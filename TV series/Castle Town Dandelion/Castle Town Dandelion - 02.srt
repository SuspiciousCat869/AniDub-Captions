00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,916
[HIKARI]
So gross!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,333
Why do we have to scrub toilets
during the Golden Week break?

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,916
[AKANE]
That was the deal.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,541
We wouldn't be here if we hadn't
finished last in the contest.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,708
[HIKARI] There are way too
many bathrooms in this castle!

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,166
[AKANE] Talk about the
worst punishment ever.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,791
I'm sure that watching
us clean toilets

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,000
in these horrible get-ups

9
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,958
makes this kinda hard
to believe, but--

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,291
Princess.

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,041
It's time for you and
your sister to get ready.

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,625
[AKANE]
Okay. Thanks.

13
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,416
[AKANE] We're members
of the royal family.

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,041
[REPORTER A] The Sakurada Castle
is having its annual concert

15
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,791
in celebration of the
last day of Golden Week.

16
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,125
The royal siblings are all
present for the festivities

17
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,208
in preparation for next year's
election for the throne.

18
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,291
Everyone wonders, which
Sakurada royal will be chosen

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,416
as our new king next spring?

20
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,083
[AKANE] You might think
being royalty is glamorous,

21
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,166
but you'd change your mind

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,041
if you spent one
morning at our house.

23
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,750
[SATSUKI]
Shiori, you're going to be late

24
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,541
if you don't get out of bed.

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,375
[SHIORI groans]

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,291

But I'm sleepy.

27
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,208
[AKANE]
Oh, good Morning, Shu.

28
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,833
Morning, Sis.

29
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,125
[AKANE] Our father, the king,
insists that our family lives

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,916
as close to a normal
life as possible.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,083
Good Morning,
Kanade. Hey, Misaki!

32
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,208
[MISAKI]
Morning!

33
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,375
Don't tell me you
just got up, Akane.

34
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,500
Hurry! There's a
council meeting today.

35
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,833
You're supposed to be there to
represent your class, remember?

36
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,125
[AKANE gasps]

37
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,291
[AKANE]
Kana, wait for me!

38
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,791
Use your inside voice, please.

39
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
[AKANE]
Why're you leaving so early?

40
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,583
We have plenty of time
before the meeting.

41
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,166
Honestly, I'm trying to
avoid walking with you.

42
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,541
[AKANE gasps]

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,291
The truth is, when you
tag along you slow me down.

44
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:34,625
Only because I have to hide from
all the surveillance cameras!

45
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,458
[KANADE]
That's your problem.

46
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,291
Oh, good morning to you,
Princess Kanade.

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,708
[KANADE]
Good morning, ma'am.

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,333
Aren't you headed to
school a bit early today?

49
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,458
I've got an important student
council meeting to get to.

50
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,958
It's early, but the vice
president has to be there.

51
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,541
[NEIGHBOR]
That sounds stressful.

52
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,041
Sometimes,

53
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,583
but I'm learning a lot about
leadership by participating.

54
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,250
[AKANE]
Don't leave without me, Kana!

55
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,708
Would you please stop pretending
that you're my shadow?

56
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,833
I can't.

57
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,666
The cameras aren't
gonna disappear.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,375
You just need to accept it.

59
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,958
Yeah, right!

60
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm gonna get rid of the stupid
things when I'm the new king.

61
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,833
Wait. So, you do want
to be the king?

62
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, maybe a little bit.
So I can ban the cameras.

63
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,166
It would be the very first
thing on my agenda.

64
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,791
Yeah, I guess you would
be able to get rid of them.

65
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,541
But becoming the king would put
you in the spotlight big time.

68
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,208
But I don't want that!

69
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Don't worry because I'm the one

70
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,791
who's going to be
wearing the crown.

71

Great!

72
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,958
You'll get rid of all those
pesky surveillance cameras

73
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,916
for me, won't you?

74

[KANADE sighs]

75
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,708
[KANADE]
I would totally ditch Akane

00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,541
if I could get away with it.

77
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,500
But there are way too
many cameras watching.

78
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,958
It would make me look
like a bad sister.

[AKANE yelps]

80

Good morning, sir.

Yeah, morning.

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,708
Tell me something.

84
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,625
How in the world did
a shy person like you

85
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,250
become a class representative?

86
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,125
I guess it's because I'm friends
with all of my classmates?

87
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,625
I see.

88
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,791
Maybe you should
try to make friends

89
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,708
with every citizen
in the country.

90
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,791
Then you'd have no reason
to be nervous anymore.

91
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,375
Sometimes you really
crack me up, Kanade!

92
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,750
What a funny idea. "Make
friends with everyone."

93
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,166
[KANADE] What made you want to
become a class representative?

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
[AKANE]
Well, I didn't want to.

95
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,875
But the other students said
that being a rep sounded boring.

96
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,291
Somebody had to do it though,
so I thought, "Why not?"

97
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,583
It's kinda my duty as
a royal to be a leader.

98
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,333
Plus, I like helping people.

99
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
And my classmates deserve
to have someone who cares

100
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,416
speaking up for them.

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,666
[KANADE] Akane's shyness
really throws off her chance

102
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,875
to be king, but she definitely
has some royal blood in her.

103
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,958
I've got it!

104
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,416
Use your power to
create something

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,833
that'll drive us to school.

106
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,666
Like a fancy limo!

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,791
[AKANE] Every member of
the Sakurada royal family

108
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,291
has a special power.

109
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,166
Kanade has the ability to
materialize any object

110
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,041
she can imagine.

111
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,083
It's a pretty awesome power,
but there's a downside.

112
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,625
The value of the object
is automatically deducted

113
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,833
from her personal bank account.

114
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,666
[KANADE]
Really? Are you serious?

115
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,416
You're asking your big sister
to buy you a limo? No.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,791
[AKANE]
Sorry, it was a dumb suggestion.

117
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,791
Then what about a flying dragon
or a magic carpet instead?

118
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,375
[KANADE] Those would cost
way more than a limo.

119
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
What're you doing on your phone?

120
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,041
Checking my stocks.

121
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,375
It must be so exhausting

122
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,625
to think about money
24-hours a day.

123
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,125
[KANADE] Well, you'd have
to think about money

all the time too
if you had my power.

do you have saved up?

Right now,

00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,750
I think about as much
as the country's budget.

00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,666
[AKANE] What the what?
Did you rob a bank?

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
[KANADE] No, but I could
get away with it.

130
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,541
Just look at those two.

You seem so confident.

135
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,458
You're totally putting off a
"noble king" vibe right now.

Which I know is what
you're aiming for,

137
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,500
but you should try to relax.

You don't wanna come across
as being uptight, do you?

Are you trying to psych
me out, little sister?

Hey. Would you
please let go of me?

I think it's about time
for you to stop hiding.

No. You're going
to run away from me.

159
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,166
[thud]

160
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,708
You have to be careful.

161
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,916
You're not invincible.
You can still get hurt, Akane.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,125
[DRIVER]
Hey, watch where you're going!

163
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,500
I'm very sorry, sir.

164
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
We shouldn't have
run into the street.

165
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,083
That must have been
quite a scare for you.

166
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,041
[DRIVER] I didn't realize
it was you, Princesses.

167
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,166
However, you were
driving too fast

168
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,625
and would've hit my sister
if I hadn't been here.

169
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,250
I hope you know just
how lucky you are

170
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,666
that Princess Akane was not
hurt due to your recklessness.

171
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,750
Please drive more
carefully from now on.

172
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,833
[AKANE]
Look! We made it on time!

173
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,416
[KANADE] Yeah, but it took
longer to get here with you.

174
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,541
[AKANE]
Me?

175
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not the one who
built a giant wall

176
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,125
that we had to move
out of the street.

177
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,750
That thing was heavy.

178
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,083
'Cause It's made
of high strength,

179
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
shock absorbent material.

180
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,708
It seemed unnecessarily
large though.

181
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,916
[KABADE] Whatever.
The meeting's starting.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,416
[AKANE]
Wait for me!

183
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,541
[KANADE] There's no stopping
an object from materializing

184
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,750
once I've willed
it into existence.

185
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,458
That's why I have
to save my money.

186
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,083
My power can get
really expensive.

187
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,291
[AKANE] The wall! You had
to pay for it, didn't you?

188
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,875
How much did it cost?

189
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,583
You don't have
to worry about it.

190
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,250
Besides, I know you don't have
any money in your bank account.

191
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,416
[AKANE] I'll pay
you back, Kana! Promise!

192
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,166
I'll work off the cost!
Just tell me how much it was!

193
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,125
[KANADE sighs]

194
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,541
It was 40 million.

195
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,250
[AKANE]
Seriously?

196
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,583
I'll spend my entire life
paying you back, I swear!

197
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,041
[KANADE]
I said don't worry about it.

198
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,291
[SATO]
My name is Hana Sato.

199
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,916
I haven't seen Shu Sakurada
since we were kids

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,375
but we're about to be reunited.

201
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,125
[SATO] I made a few friends
when I came back last year,

202
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,208
but we all got split
into different classes.

203
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,875
[HITOMI]
Hey, Hana!

204
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,541
[SATO]
Hitomi.

205
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,916
The one and only!

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,791
Are we gonna have
a sweet year or what?

207
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,875
Oh, yeah!

208
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,833
You don't know how happy
I am to see you!

209
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,083
It was kinda lonely
not knowing anyone.

210
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,041
What about Yamamoto over there?

211
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't you remember him
from fourth grade?

212
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,375
Man, you have got
to be kidding me.

213
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,291
[SATO]
Hi, Yamamoto.

214
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,208
Um. It's nice to see you again.

215
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:30,916
[YAMAMOTO]
Uh...

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,041
Oh. Right! Of course!

217
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:37,375
Wait. Don't tell me. Ah! Suzuki!

218
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,208
Actually, it's Sato.

219
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, that's right! Silly me.

220
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,208
We had classes together
in sixth grade.

221
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,291
[SATO] Fourth grade,
but I guess you were close.

222
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,125
Really? Are you sure
it was fourth?

223
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,208
This sucks.

224
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
I knew they wouldn't
remember the girl who left

225
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,875
after fourth grade

226
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,541
but I've been back for over a
year and I'm still invisible.

227
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,583
Ghost girl strikes again.

228
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,291
[SHU]
Well, look who's back.

229
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,500
What's up, Sato?

230
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,500
[SATO]
My perfect prince!

231
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,958
[SATO]
Oh, hey, Sakurada!

232
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,208
I'm surprised that you
even remember me.

233
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,625
Why wouldn't I?

234
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,041
We shared our lunch nearly
every day in fourth grade.

235
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,083
How could I forget?

236
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,458
[gasps]

237
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,166
[SATO]
Of course my prince remembers.

238
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,916
I'm sorry, is it something
I said? Don't--

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,708
How dare you
make my Hana cry!

240
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,125
[SHU] Ow, that hurt.
Why'd you tackle me?

241
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,291
[HITOMI] Maybe this way you'll
learn the lesson, you jerk!

242
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,125
[SHU] There's gotta be
a better way to pick chores

243
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,833
than drawing straws every week.

244
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,083
For sure!

245
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,250
Why don't we pick one
chore and do it forever?

246
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,333
I'll even do more than one.

247
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,833
I'll cook, clean, do laundry,

248
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,916
and all you have to
do is go shopping!

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,750
Ha. You're very sweet.

250
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,500
But don't you think
that's a little much?

251
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,916
I'll do anything to
avoid the cameras!

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,625
She volunteered,
you all heard it.

253
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,666
So why doesn't she
start with my laundry?

254
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,083
Now you know that's not fair.

255
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,208
If we don't help out,
nothing will get done.

256
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,791
So everyone needs
to do an equal share.

257
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,708
Well then, I'll clean.

258
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,125
[AOI] It looks like...
I'm doing laundry.

259
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,833
[MISAKI]
No, not cooking!

260
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,333
Lucky me!

261
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,583
Me, too. Sorry, Sis.

262
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,625
That means I'm left with...

263
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,250
Groceries!

264
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,166
[KANADE]
Wow, didn't see that one coming.

265
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,458
[AKANE]
I don't wanna go outside.

266
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,458
The fridge isn't gonna
fill itself, y'know.

267
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,500
I'll go shopping with
you if we can have curry!

268
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,750
Really?

269
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,041
Yeah, we can go get the
ingredients together!

270
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,500
That's nice of you but I'd
still have to go outside.

271
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,250
Akane! Do it for
the love of curry!

272
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,500
--Pretty please?
--But the cameras'll follow me!

273
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,166
You may hate the
surveillance cameras,

274
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,750
but they like you plenty.

275
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,083
It's no fair.

276
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,250
I'm not even trying
to be popular!

277
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,458
Haven't I already disgraced
myself enough this week?

278
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
Like things can possibly
get any worse.

279
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,958
Your panties have been
seen all across the kingdom.

280
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,791
Why'd you have to remind me?

281
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,041
I'm never going outside again.

282
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,458
Okay, fine.

283
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,625
You don't have to do the
shopping; I'll trade with you.

284
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,458
You will?

285
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,083
But I do have one condition.

286
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,750
You have to wear your pigtails
higher for the next month.

287
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,208
You've gotta be kidding me!

288
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
That won't look good at all!

289
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,958
And you want me to wear it
that way for a whole month?

290
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,958
I'm gonna look like a little
kid and everyone will...

291
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,541
...laugh... at me.

292
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,291
I'll do it for three weeks.

293
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,375
[SHU]
Works for me.

294
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,875
Wow. What a haggler.

295
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,250
[SATO] Sakurada hasn't
made it to class yet.

296
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,791
I hope he's okay.

297
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,500
I really hope I get the
chance to talk to him today.

298
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,541
[gasps]

299
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,625
[SHU]
Aw, man!

300
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,416
Sorry about that,
Sato. You okay?

301
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,458
[SATO]
Yeah, I'm fine!

302
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,125
In fact, I'm better than fine!

303
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,750
After all, everyone
loves fresh milk!

304
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,583
[SATO] It's like they said:
Ask and you shall receive!

305
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,083
Hey, jerk!

306
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,708
Quit spewing your white stuff
all over my Hana, got it?

307
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,125
You're making me sound
like a perv, Ichijo!

308
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,708
For one perfect moment,

309
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,958
my prince gazed
deeply into my eyes.

310
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,500
Now he thinks I'm the
biggest spaz in the world.

311
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,250
Well, to be fair, he's kinda
always lookin' at you.

312
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,375
From his seat, he's
got no other choice.

313
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,500
He'll be staring at your
pigtails 14-7, 365.

314
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,958
Yep, very true.

315
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,375
[SATO]
I didn't even think of that.

316
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,291
Please, Hitomi!
Switch seats with me!

317
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,083
I can if you want to.
You're sure?

318
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,541
Yes! No! I dunno,
I'm so confused!

319
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,041
Tell me somethin'.

320
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,583
What exactly do you see in him?

321
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,375
Why'd you ask me that? Huh?

322
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,708
[HITOMI]
You're not really subtle.

323
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,458
You do like him, don't you?

324
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,583
[SATO giggles nervously]

325
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,333
Well yeah, I guess
you could say that.

326
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,708
[SATO giggles nervously]

327
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,916
You're actually starting
to worry me a little bit.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,416
[SATO] I like him because
he's dashing and kind.

329
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,916
He let me borrow
his eraser once.

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,333
I let you borrow my eraser.

331
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,833
True, true.

332
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,500
Whenever I trim my bangs,
he always notices right away.

333
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,916
Yeah, and I notice them, too.

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Also true.

335
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,708
And I'm touched he
still remembers me

336
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,041
after all these years.

337
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,208
Well, I could never forget
about someone like you.

338
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,416
[SAOTOME]
Never ever.

339
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,458
Who knows. Maybe I
have a crush on you.

340
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,750
Geez, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

341
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,500
[SATO]
Sorry!

342
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,000
[HITOMI]
Me too!

343
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,500
[SATO] Even the way
he smells is perfect!

344
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,416
Uh. Sato, are you okay?

345
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,375
I didn't see you there.

346
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,208
[SATO yelps]

347
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,625
[SATO]
Oh my goodness!

348
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,875
I'm sorry, Sakurada. I must've
tripped or something.

349
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,625
Wait! I didn't hurt you, did I?

350
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,625
I'm fine.

351
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,541
I'm so glad that
you're all right.

352
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,625
Uh. I'm really sorry. Gotta go!

353
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, Ichijo?

354
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,166
Yeah?

355
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,333
What's the deal?

356
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,125
How come Sato never
looks me in the eyes

357
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,458
and why's she always running
off the second I show up?

358
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,375
Seriously, I thought
we were friends,

359
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,041
but I'm starting to think
she might really hate me.

360
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,333
Oh, yeah, she hates you.

361
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,166
[SAOTOME]
Mh-hm.

362
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,541
Sorry I'm so late.

363
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Are you ready to head home now?

364
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,500
I was but all of a sudden I feel
like I'm forgetting something.

365
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,708
Well, I'm ready whenever you are
so just take your time, okay?

366
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,000
Thanks a lot. You're so sweet.

367
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,666
I just can't get this
mystery out of my mind.

368
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,166
I feel off.

369
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,833
Like there's a part of me that's
gone missing or something.

370
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,750
Ah!

371
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,041
I totally forgot to say
goodbye to Sakurada!

372
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,000
What a tragic shame.

373
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,750
[SATO]
Found him!

374
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,541
I forgot to say--

375
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,166
Hey, there, you ready?

376
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,333
[AKANE]
Yeah. What took you so long?

377
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,750
[SATO] My prince is walking
with another girl!

378
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,833
And she stole my hairstyle!

379
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,750
[SHU] I don't mind walking
you home every day.

380
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,541
Really, it's no big deal.

381
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,208
[AKANE]
I don't wanna bug you.

382
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,625
Besides Aoi's only busy
a few days a week.

383
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,666
[SHU]
Okay, cool.

384
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,291
[SATO]
He's not dating her, is he?

385
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,375
No, stop! Don't jump
to conclusions, Hana.

386
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,500
[AKANE] Do you still need
to stop by the market?

387
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,916
[SHU]
Nah, let's head home.

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,666
I'll hit the store later.
I know you don't wanna go.

389
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,625
[SATO] My prince is
living with that girl?

390
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,166
Question for you.

391
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,666
You realize you have to get
used to the public eye, right?

392
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,750
We all have to be
symbols of hope.

393
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,666
And we can't ever
forget about that.

394
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,000
It's just a part of our
royal duty, being in public.

395
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah, I guess you're right.

396
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,916
Royalty's in my blood,
whether I like it or not.

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
[SHU] Not that you
have to start right now.

398
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,625
You're always welcome
to hide behind us

399
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,250
until you get a little braver.

400
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,416
[AKANE]
Thanks.

401
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,708
[SATO] I can't hear
what they're saying!

402
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,375
I bet they're whispering
sweet nothings!

403
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,541
Someone's there.

404
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,916
Yeah.

405
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,208
Let's turn up ahead.

406
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,208
[AKANE]
Mm.

407
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,125
[gasps]

408
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,958
[SATO]
No, no, no!

409
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:44,875
Huh?

410
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,666
Princess Akane?

411
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,666
Huh? Aren't you one
of Shu's classmates?

412
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,250
Where did you come from?

413
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,125
It's you. May I ask why
you were following us?

414
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,375
I, um. Well, I--

415
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,333
Did someone put you up to this?

416
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,583
If you cooperate, I promise
that we won't get mad

417
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,083
but you have to tell us why.

418
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,375
What is it? Something
you can't say?

419
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:10,083
[SATO] I was following you...
well... because...

420
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,208
I was jealous.

421
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:18,625
You were walking with
another girl, and I like you!

422
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,541
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

423
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,833
Sato. You like me?

424
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,625
[SATO whines] Why'd I say it?

425
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,708
[SHU]
Thank you.

426
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,916
[SATO]
Huh?

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,083
Hearing you say that
makes me really happy.

428
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,208
And I wish I could
say it back to you.

429
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,750
[SATO]
Go ahead!

430
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,208
But now, I have to make sure
the royal election comes first.

431
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,750
[SATO]
Huh?

432
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,500
There's no way I'm gonna let
stupid Kanade win this election

433
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,125
and become the next king!

434
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,416
[SATO]
Right.

435
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,791
[AKANE]
Whoa, where did that come from?

436
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,833
And why is he so determined
to see Kana lose?

437
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,708
[SHU]
I'm sorry.

438
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,500
What if I said I
would wait for you?

439
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,958
[SHU]
Huh?

440
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,166
[SATO] Until the election
is over. Would that be okay?

441
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,666
I couldn't make you wait
an entire year for me.

442
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,541
I would.

443
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,166
No, no. I want to!

444
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,208
[SHU]
Okay, then.

445
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,375
I promise you:

446
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,375
When the election is over,
I'll tell you how I feel.

447
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,958
Really? Yes!
Thank you, Sakurada.

448
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,375
Oh, hey, I have a thought.

449
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,041
Why don't you walk
the lady home?

450
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,291
[SHU, SATO]
What?

451
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,416
I can make it the rest
of the way by myself.

452
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,625
It's not that far.

453
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,875
Well, if you want.

454
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,583
No, no, it's all right!

455
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,000
I said I would wait
and I meant it,

456
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
so don't worry
about a thing, 'kay?

457
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,875
I can make an
exception for today.

458
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,958
That's really sweet,
but it's fine.

459
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,625
Um. See you soon,
Sakurada! You too, Akane!

460
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,916
[SHU]
Hey, wait! Sato!

461
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,000
Shouldn't you be
going after her?

462
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,541
Nah.

463
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:55,250
She was pretty adamant about
wanting to wait so why bug her?

464
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,250
Besides, I can tell when you're
just putting on a brave face.

465
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,708
Let's head home.

466
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,416
[SHU]
Hold up.

467
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,125
Are you mad I didn't
walk her home?

468
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,333
[AKANE]
Whatever, I'm not mad.

469
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,833
[SHU]
Sorry, Akane.

470
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,125
[AKANE]
Why're you apologizing?

471
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,500
[SHU]
I didn't know what else to say.

472
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,500
[AKANE] Don't just apologize
for no reason, weirdo.

473
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,000
[HITOMI] Congrats!
That's so amazing, Hana!

474
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,666
I mean, it's a little weird but
if you're happy, then I'm happy.

475
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah!

476
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,041
[HITOMI] Want me to smack
him around a little bit?

477
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,291
Keep him in line?

478
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
No, don't you dare, Hitomi!

479
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,666
Sakurada's sweet and wonderful

480
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,500
and you are not allowed
to hurt him, got it?

481
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,375
[HITOMI] Ooh! Look who's
acting like his girlfriend!

482
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,750
[SATO] I am not! That's it,
I'm hanging up now!

483
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,458
[phone buzzing]

484
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,875
Huh?

485
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,375
[SATO] What, Hitomi?
Gonna tease me some more?

486
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,000
[SHU]
Actually, it's me.

487
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,041
[SATO]
Huh?

488
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,125
Don't suppose you're
free right now?

489
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,666
Uh. Yeah. I guess.

490
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,250
[SHU]
Oh, good.

491
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,416
Uh. I just wanted to make sure
you got home safe. Goodnight?

492
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,875
Oh! Same to you!

493
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,041
[SATO] He called to make
sure I got home safe.

494
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,291
Or maybe he just wanted
to hear my voice.

495
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,291
Does this mean that
he like likes me?

496
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,791
Is that safe to assume?

497
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,625
I mean, he did call
to wish me goodnight.

498
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,750
I think he does.
I really think he does.

499
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:23,000
For some crazy reason,
he actually likes me.

500
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
[YAMAMOTO] I can't believe
you remembered Sato

501
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,916
from fourth grade.

502
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,416
How could I forget?

503
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,708
There aren't as many girls
as simple and honest as she is.

504
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,166
Maybe the girls in your
family are a bit much.

505
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,375
I didn't even recognize
her at first.

506
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,208
Who knew she'd grow
up to be so cute?

507
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,458
[SHU]
What?!

508
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,166
How can you say that?
She's always been cute!

509
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,291
It's just that girls start
caring more about how they look

510
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,625
at our age, that's all!

511
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,708
Whoa, no need to yell, dude!

512
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,875
[SHU] In my eyes?
She hasn't changed a bit.

513
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,791
She's still as perfect
as she was back then.

514
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,666
Who knows.

515
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,791
I wonder if Shu and
Sato will start dating

516
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,791
once the elections are over.

517
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,666
He got so weird. And why's
he want Kana to lose so badly?

518
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,125
She wants to be king
more than anybody.

519
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,000
Now I'm all worried
about the election.

520
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,125
[HIKARI] Akane, some of us
are trying to sleep here.

521
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,875
[SATO] Hi there, everyone!
My name is Hana Sato.

522
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,708
[SATSUKI] Ah, the girl
who's after my little Shu.

523
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,125
[SATO]
Sorry to barge in.

524
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,666
I know I'm not a part of
the royal family or anything.

525
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,791
[SATSUKI]
Not yet.

526
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,583
Pretty soon you may
be Hana Sakurada.

527
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,750
[SATO] Hana Sakurada?
What a beautiful name!

528
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,333
[SATSUKI]
Hm?

529
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,791
[SATO] I mean, I know nothing's
been set in stone yet, Mother!

530
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,708
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to call you that!

531
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,958
[SATSUKI] A year from now,
I might be your mother-in-law.

532
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,375
[SATO]
Until then,

533
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,958
everyone please watch over
the princes and princesses

534
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,708
and be sure to remember to vote!
