[NEWSCASTER 1A]
After months of anticipation,

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,625
the election for the nation's
next king is this weekend.

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,875
Before the ballots open,
we'll hear one last speech

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,791
from each of the
nine candidates.

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,541
[NEWSCASTER 1B] Those that
are interested in voting

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,458
will finally get
the chance to support

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,416
their favorite
prince or princess.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,541
And remember,

11
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,500
your vote has the
power to change...

12
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,958
[NEWSCASTERS]
...our future!

13
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,416
[FUKUSHINA] At last.
The elections have arrived.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,916
I can truly give support
to my dearest Akane.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,125
If all goes well,
and she becomes king...

16
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,375
Oh, hi. I'm King Akane.
Thanks for having me.

17
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,041
She'll be the cutest ruler ever!

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,125
Um. Plastic, please.

19
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,833
The sovereign of shyness!

20
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,333
[AKANE yelps]

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,791
[FUKUSHINA] Sorry, this
fantasy is for my eyes only.

22
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,500
[AKANE]
Morning, Fukushina!

23
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,125
[FUKUSHINA]
Good Morning. Sakurada.

24
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,625
You look distracted.

25
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,041
[FUKUSHINA] Oh, I was just
admiring the spring weather.

26
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,916
Are you walking to school
by yourself today?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,250
That's right.

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,916
I had to learn to get
over my shyness sometime,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,583
or I'd be pretty
useless as a king.

[gasps]

31
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,291
[FUKUSHINA]
The Sakurada that I once loved--

32
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,208
the ever-nervous idol of
our fan club has changed!

33
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,666
No, she's finally
made a breakthrough!

34
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,916
I need to support her,
like a good friend should!

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I'll see you later!

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,083
[FUKUSHINA] She may not be the
same, but she's still... great!

37
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,625
[KAREN]
Okay.

38
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,166
Everyone's gonna get
out and vote, right?

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,208
[STUDENT 12A]
Yeah! You know it!

40
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,583
[STUDENT 12B] I didn't wait
this long for nothin'.

41
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,500
Then, please vote for Akane!

42
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,416
And thanks a lot!

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,666
[STUDENT 12C]
Well, duh.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,000
[STUDENT 12D]
After all, we're her classmates.

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,500
[STUDENT 12E] Like we're
not gonna vote for her?

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,041
[STUDENT 12F]
I planned to from the start.

47
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,666
Thanks so much, guys!
I'll do my best!

48
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
Karen... An...

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,000
You'll cheer for me during
my speech, won't you?

50
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,041
Of course we will, goofball.

51
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,083
Did you decide what
you're going to say?

52
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,416
Uh. I've almost
got it figured out.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,291
You liar!

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,791
[AKANE]
What to say.

55
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,625
No pressure, it's just the
culmination of all my speeches,

56
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,208
so it has to be good.

57
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,166
I wonder if the others are
having this much trouble?

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,791
I'm sorry to hold you up.

59
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,666
Especially during
your lunch break.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,125
Please.

61
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,375
It's my honor to help you
as much as I can, President.

62
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,333
Uh, I mean, Uzuki.

63
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,333
Graduation will be here
before we know it,

64
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,208
so I wanted to get things
organized before then.

65
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,583
Makes sense.

66
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,833
[UZUKI]
I'm leaving everything to you,

67
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,000
Miss Student Council President.

68
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,708
Right.

69
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,166
I'll follow your example
and do my best.

70
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,291
Good. You better!

71
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,041
[BOTH giggle]

72
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,208
[UZUKI]
Thanks for your help.

73
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,708
I can take the rest from here.

74
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,291
You should get back to
preparing for the election.

75
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,208
[KANADE] No worries. I finished
my prep work ages ago.

76
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,750
Including the script
for my final speech.

77
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,458
'Course you did. If you
don't mind me asking,

78
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,916
what are you gonna talk about?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,083
[KANADE]
Well.

80
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,791
How I'd build my kingdom,
by my authority,

81
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,708
and exactly the way
I want it to be.

82
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,916
A dictatorship?

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
I thought about it,
but I changed my mind.

84
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,083
You still thought about it.

85
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,916
[KANADE] After watching
my siblings work hard

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,625
and grow over the past year,

87
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,833
I've realized that
everything's different.

88
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,500
Including me.

89
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
That's why I changed my mind.

90
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,416
[KANADE]
They're so strong.

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,208
I want everyone in the world
to see my brothers and sisters

92
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,916
through my eyes.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,416
Aoi, who keeps to herself
and watches over all of us.

94
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,750
Shu, who takes charge
when he needs to,

95
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,083
and always thinks of
everyone's welfare.

96
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:27,083
Akane, who, despite her shyness,
cares deeply for others.

97
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:31,750
Misaki, who can't stand idly by
when there's someone in need.

98
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,750
Haruka supports
us and never asks

99
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,791
for anything in return.

100
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,500
Hikari is doing her own thing.
But she's working hard at it.

101
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,375
Teru: Young and brave,
with boundless determination.

102
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,625
And, Shiori,

103
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,166
whose kind heart has
room for everyone.

104
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,541
[KANADE] When people vote,
I want them to do so

105
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,291
because they truly know us.

106
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,625
Kanade...

107
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,833
I know it will be a
wonderful speech, for sure.

108
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,375
[KANADE gasps]
Enough about that.

109
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,458
Let's finish cleaning
up, President.

110
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,333
You're the president
now, remember, silly?

111
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,833
Wait. Kanade really said that?

112
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,416
[UZUKI]
Yup!

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,083
[NANAO]
Aw, Man.

114
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,500
If that's some new strategy,
it's working because now

115
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,833
I wanna vote for her.

116
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, no joke.

117
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,291
It's hard to pick one candidate

118
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,000
when they'd all
make great kings.

119
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,583
[UZUKI]
Right?

120
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,250
Sorry it's so difficult.

121
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,833
If it's any consolation,
you can blame my father.

122
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,791
[laughing]

123
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,958
[AOI]
Just think it over

124
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,416
and vote for whomever
you feel is best.

125
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
If you say so.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,708
[NANAO]
What if you win?

127
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,041
[AOI gasps]

128
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,166
[UZUKI]
Nanao?

129
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,083
Do you really wanna
dance to the tempo

130
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,833
that your father set for
the rest of your life?

131
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,375
I don't know.

132
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,166
[NANAO]
Forget I said it.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,208
[SHIZURU]
Aoi? No matter what happens,

134
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,708
I'll be with you all the way.

135
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,291
Yeah! Me, too!

136
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,875
[NANAO] Tough break. I'm afraid
you're stuck with us now.

137
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,833
You better get used to having
a dose of crazy around,

138
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,375
"Your Highness."

139
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,500
[SATO]
All right!

140
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,500
[HITOMI] You're stressing
out way too much.

141
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,583
[SAOTOME]
It's true.

142
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,291
[SATO]
But it's almost election day!

143
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,041
I need to bring my A-game!

144
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,458
[sighs] Well.

145
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,708
I guess that I could get used to

146
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,208
seeing Shu sitting
on the throne.

147
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,375
[SAOTOME]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

148
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,750
Your support means
the world to both of us!

149
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,541
[SHU]
Thank you, you, you, you.

150
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,375
Then again, if he
does become king,

151
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,000
his schedule will be more
crowded than ever before.

152
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,125
[SATO]
Maybe.

153
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,416
Which means he'll probably have

154
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,250
even less time to
spend with you, right?

155
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,083
[SATO yelps]

156
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,333
Hey.

157
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,666
No need to worry,
with the two of us around,

158
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,958
you won't even miss him.

159
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,791

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,375
[SHU]
Ouch. That was harsh.

475
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,625
[AKANE] But I gotta admit,
your speech was cool.

476
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,333
[SHU]
Thanks.

477
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,333
[AKANE]
Can I ask you something?

478
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,875
[SHU]
What's up?

479
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,208
[AKANE] Why didn't you use your
power to teleport the blimp?

480
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,041
[SHU]
Oh.

481
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,875
[AKANE]
Yup. Thick headed.

482
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,083
[KUSUNOKI] The one who bears
this crown protects truth,

483
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,625
justice, and peace
throughout the land.

484
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:46,375
And embodies faith,
idealism, and nobility.

485
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,125
Do you swear to lead
this nation through

486
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,625
harmony and through
discord, and bring hope

487
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,458
to its people for as
long as you shall reign?

488
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,458
I swear.

489
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,000
[KUSUNOKI]
Shu Sakurada.

490
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,916
I appoint you the
successor to the throne.

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,166
Shu.

492
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,166
Yeah? What's up?

493
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,791
[SOICHIRO]
Do your best.

494
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,833
[SHU]
I will!

495
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,000
[AKANE] And so, after lots
of learning and growing,

496
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,541
our year of campaigning
came to an end.

497
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,541
Aoi moved out for
college and is enjoying

498
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,375
living a normal life
with her friends.

499
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,583
Shu finally introduced
his girlfriend, Hana,

500
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,791
to Mom and Dad.

501
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,208
Kana hit the books hard,

502
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,708
and is planning to go
to medical school.

503
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,250
Misaki became her
middle school's

504
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,666
student council president.

505
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,833
She elected Haruka as
secretary to keep him nearby.

506
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:44,875
After the election,

507
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,875
Hikari revealed
that she was Laito.

508
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,500
Luckily, it didn't
hurt her idol career

509
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,375
and she's still going strong.

510
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,500
Teru and Shiori decided
they wanted to help Shu

511
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,791
at the castle,

512
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,375
so they're studying under
Kusonoki's tutelage.

513
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,666
As for me--

514
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,833
Okay, I'm heading out!

515
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,000
Be careful.

516
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,041
Have a great day!

517
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,208
[AKANE] I haven't changed as
drastically as the others.

518
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,375
[AKANE]
Huh?

519
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,958
[AKANE]
When did you get here, fella?

520
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,583
[AKANE] But I still feel
like I've blossomed.

521
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,000
If even just a little.
