[AKANE] In one month, the long
awaited royal election

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,958
will finally take place.

3
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,708
Look! It's Kanade!

00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,416
Oh, good morning, Princess!

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,708
[STUDENT 11C]
Have a wonderful day, Princess!

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,416
Thanks, you, too.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,541
I bet you're excited
about next month.

8
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,291
You've got my vote, Kanade.
I know you'll win for sure!

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,583
That means a lot.

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,875
But, there's still
plenty of time left.

11

Please be sure to consider
your choice carefully.

[STUDENTS gasp]

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,208
[STUDENT 11D] Is it just
me or is there something

14
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,708
different about her?
Have you noticed anything?

15
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,166
[STUDENT 11E] Yeah, she's
nicer than she was before.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,583
More mellow.

17
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,375
I used to be so
afraid to talk to her

18
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,000
even when she was smiling.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,791
It's good to see that she's
let her guard down a little.

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,166
[AKANE, KAREN]
Uh?

21
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,750
I can't thank you enough.

22
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,500
I feel like a jerk asking
a princess to help, though.

23
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,833
[MISAKI]
Please don't.

24
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,750
With the extra hands,
it'll be done in a flash.

25
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,500
No problem at all.

00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,166
[OLD MAN 11A]
It's certainly appreciated.

Clean now, nap later, got it?

[BERU groans]

00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,083
[KAREN]
Man, she's really working hard.

32
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,000
I've seen Misaki and her
clones helping people

33
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,500
all over the place lately.

34
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,541
For real.

Akane!

36
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,333
[KAREN, AKANE]
Huh?

37
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,666
[AKANE]
Hey, Hana! Is Shu campaigning?

38
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,833
That's right.

39
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,625
We're going to the
north side park next.

40
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,541
No rest for the royal and weary.

41
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,333
You need to keep up your energy.

42
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,791
We still have three more
places to visit today.

43
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,875
[SHU] Are you kidding me?
Man, that's rough!

00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,041
[BOTH giggle]

00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,416
Well, we're off.
Catch you later!

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,541
Everyone's working
so hard lately.

47
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,166
That's true.

48

Huh?

00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,166
And you're working just as hard.

[KAREN]
Hey. Do you remember that day?

51
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,583
[AKANE]
Hm?

52
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,208
[TERU sighs] I think Jackal will
behave after that feast.

53
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,791
After six helpings,
you should be

54
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,375
the one doing the dishes,
not poor Akane.

55

[TERU]
I couldn't help it!

You should've heard him roaring
during my speech today!

That was your stomach, Teru.

[HIKARI]
One month left.

00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,458
Everyone's got a
head start on me.

I need to step up
my game, big time.

Haruka! I really
need your advice!

[AKANE]
I don't believe it.

63
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,208
Even Hikari is starting
to take things seriously!

64
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,666
Could you be more specific?

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,875

strategies I could use?

As always,

[NEWSCASTER 1A]
The immovable Aoi is still

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,250
in first, but Princess
Akane is closing in.

73

[sighs] Man, Aoi,
you're amazing.

74
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,833
You've been in first since
the start of this thing

75
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,625
and you haven't had
to do a single speech

76
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,583

Akane's 100th speech was today.

Here's a glimpse for those
of you that missed it.

[BOY FAN CLUB]
Akane forever!

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,541
[KANADE] A hundred times,
and you still can't

83
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,083
get through the first sentence.

84
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,666
[NEWSCASTER 1A]
Princess Kanade made a return

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,541
to the third spot after a
recent surge of new supporters.

86
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,583
But catching up with
Aoi will be difficult.

87
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,125
Princess Misaki is in fourth.

88
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,583
[groans] After all of that,
she still got ahead of me?

[NEWSCASTER 1A] Shiori in
seventh, Haruka in eighth,

90
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,541
and Teru in nineth.

91
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,541
Prince Shu saw a notable
increase in support last month,

92
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,666
but it's not enough to
put him in the top three.

00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,375
Our ranks may have switched,

95
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,250
but the numbers are
still pretty close.

96
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,750
[MISAKI] Somehow that doesn't
make me feel better.

97

[HARUKA]
Well, you haven't been doing

98
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
as many speeches, remember?

99
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,666
Why not?

100
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,083
She's had some trouble making
it to the speech sites.

101
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
She keeps stopping to
help out the citizens.

102
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,083
Yeah, I saw her cleaning up
the park this afternoon.

103
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,083
[HARUKA] She helped some new
neighbors move yesterday.

104
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,208
The day before that,

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,708
she unloaded cargo
at the fish market.

106
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,458
And, last week,
she even volunteered

107
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,750
to hand out tissues and flyers
at a local convenience store.

108
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,666
So, I like helping people.
It's not a big deal.

I walked Hana home first.

You've sure got it easy.

And on top of that, my numbers
have gone up, as well.

[KANADE]
It's good to be you.

[growls] I don't get it!

128

Every single one of
my brothers and sisters

129

were able to increase their
numbers over the past month.

130
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,916
But mine haven't changed!

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,041
I busted my butt and only
went up one lousy point!

132

That's still one point, Teru!

133

Yep! Nothing to scoff at.

You should be proud, bro.

[TERU] I see the pity
behind your smiles,

and I don't like it!
Go ahead! Tell me I've lost!

Darn it.

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
How am I supposed to protect
what's precious to me

139
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,000
if I can't overcome this?

140
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,208
Do I still not have the
strength to become king?

[TERU gasps]

142

Big brother, you'll always
be the best to me.

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,291
Huh?

144
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,208
At being too stubborn.

145
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,250
[TERU] Wow. And here I thought
I couldn't feel any worse.

146
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,791
Life is so cruel.

147
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,958
Hey, gathering lots of
supporters is one thing.

148
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,333
But it's important
to remember that

149
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,833
even a single vote is special.

150
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
You think so?

151
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,666
[HARUKA]
People will notice when you show

152
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,500
gratitude for their support.

153
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,041
And that will lead
to more support later.

154
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
Five or ten years down
the road, that one vote

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,125
could transform into
over 10,000 votes.

156
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,791
[SHIORI]
Wow, that many? That's amazing!

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,375
So cool!

I bet you got that number
by using your special power,

Not at all.

[AKANE]
'Kay, me next!

What can I do to
improve my chances?

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,916
Stop fumbling your speeches
before you start them.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,666
I knew you'd say that.

165
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,458
You've had a problem with
being in the spotlight

166
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,333
for a long time, Akane.

167
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,375
Try cutting yourself
some slack, okay?

168
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,916
[AKANE]
But I have to get over this now!

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If I don't become king, I'll
never get rid of the cameras,

170
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,083
and I'll never
live a quiet life!

She thinks becoming
king will get her

out of the public eye?

00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,500
Something tells me
she hasn't really

174
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,958

Hey. I've always wondered this.

176
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,583
Why is it you hate being
in the limelight so much?

[gasps]

It's because... I...

Wait just a minute.

You weren't like this
when we were little.

181
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,375
You were totally fine with
being in front of people.

182
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,875
Man, I wonder what happened.

183
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:38,875
Huh?

[HIKARI]
Come on! Tell us.

185
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,375
By the way, there's
a new park open--

186
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
I can tell you guys why.

187
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,708
Don't you dare!

Hey.

Kanade...

00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,666
[KANADE]
I've had a rough past, too.

191
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,291
But I was able to let that go.

192
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,125
[KANADE] At the time,
Akane was a little older

193
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,916
than Teru is now.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,833
The surveillance cameras
hadn't been installed,

195
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,208
back then. We didn't
think there was a need.

196
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,333
Where evil strikes,
I'll be there to stop it!

197
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,708
[SHU]
You're such a dork.

198
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,458
You do know you're not
really a superhero, right?

199
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,750
Yeah, whatever!

200
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,916
If I use my powers,
all bad guys can do

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,416
is poop their pants!

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,541
[SHU] Mom says you're being
reckless with your ability.

203
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,000
If you don't control yourself,
you'll get into trouble.

204
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,625
But I have control!

205
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,125
[sighs]

206
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,416
I'll be back.

207
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,541
Going on patrol?

208
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,083
No, to Karen's house!

209
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,041
Her mom's at work, so
I'm keeping her company

210
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,625
while she's home alone.

211
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,500
Don't follow me, okay?

212
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,000
[KUSUNOKI]
I'm afraid we have to, Princess.

213
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,416
The king has asked
that the guards

214
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,541
escort you if you wish
to leave the castle.

215
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,000
He was quite insistent.

216
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,125
I'm sorry, but those
are the rules.

217
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,333
I'll be totally fine.

218
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,458
I'm just going to play
at a friend's house.

219
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,750
But, you're still
leaving the castle.

220
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,000
Your father is only
trying to protect you.

221
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,458
He's worried about you.

222
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,833
Especially after
the way you've been

223
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,166
using your powers in public.

224
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,250
He would hate for you
to hurt yourself.

225
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,166
Okay, fine! I get it!

226
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,041
[AKANE grumbles] If I show up
at Karen's with a bunch

227
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,416
of scary guards around me,
she'll be too afraid to play!

[gasps]

230
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,916
[KANADE] In the end,
Akane found a way give

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,291
the suits the slip, and
went to Karen's by herself.

[GUARD 11A]
I can't go any farther.

When will your mom
be home from work?

234
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,541
I'm not sure.

She said it would be
pretty late. It's fine.

I won't be afraid now
that you're here, Akane.

00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,875
Princess Akane!
You dropped these.

474
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,625
Dropped wha--? Akane?

475
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,916
I didn't realize they
had fallen off my face!

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,625
Wait. How long?

477
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,833
The whole time.

478
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,916
[AKANE shieks]
No way!

479
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,833
[YOUNG GIRL 11E]
Uh-huh! Yes, way!

480
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,583
[AKANE]
I don't understand.

481
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,958
Was I really that focused
on helping everyone?

482
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,208
[AKANE gasps]

483
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,708
Thanks for everything, Princess.

484
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,750
You're welcome.

485
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,291
[giggles]

486
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,958
[gasps]

487
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,125
[AKANE]
I think... I get it.

488
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,083
[KAREN]
Hey. Do you remember that day?

489
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
When you stopped the thieves.

490
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,708
You never let go of me,
so I knew I was safe.

491
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,708
[AKANE]
Oh. I guess I did.

492
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,750
[KAREN] To this day,
I can still remember

493
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,083
what your hand
felt like in mine.

494
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,125
Your strength and warmth
made me feel like

495
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,000
I could face anything that
life had to throw at me.

496
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,708
As long as you were by my side.

497
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,625
[AKANE] That's it, I don't need
a secret identity anymore.

498
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,500
I can let it go.

499
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,708
[AKANE]
I'll never forget you.

500
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:10,166
Thanks. And goodbye,
Scarlet Bloom.

501
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,666
Hey, don't litter.

502
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,833
[AKANE]
Sorry.

503
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,750
[KUSUNOKI]
That is all.

504
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,833
[SOICHIRO]
Hm. Good.

505
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,083
[SOICHIRO] They've grown
into reliable adults.

506
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,458
[SATSUKI] Hmph. I wonder
where they get that from.

507
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,375
[NEWSCASTER 1B]
Here are the results

508
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,500
for today's opinion poll.

509
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,458
Prince Shu and Princess Akane
have increased their supporters,

510
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,791
putting Princesses Aoi,
Akane, Kanade and Prince Shu

511
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,625
in a four-way battle!
Who will take the crown?

512
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,833
You see?

513
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,958
That point turned into
12 in just one week.

514
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,166
Yeah!

515
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,333
The rest of you better
keep your guard up!

516
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,375
You must have made a
good impression, Teru.

517
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:02,333
[giggles] Ah! Hey, Haruka?

518
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,416
There's something that I've
been wanting to ask you about.

519
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,833
You already know which one
of us will be king, don't you?

520
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,083
[gasps]

521
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,125
[HARUKA]
I know the odds.

522
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,875
But there are always surprises.

523
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,166
[AKANE]
I'm the third daughter, Akane!

524
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,500
[SATSUKI] Akane may be easily
embarrassed sometimes,

525
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,791
but her shy nature makes her
very empathetic towards others.

526
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,083
She's also quite dependable.

527
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,625
[AKANE]
I don't know about that.

528
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,583
[SATSUKI] If she became
king, our country would

529
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,708
be a place of
peace and kindness.

530
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,750
So, what's your campaign
promise, sweetie?

531
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,708
[AKANE]
To destroy all cameras!

532
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,791
I want to make a nation
where people feel safe

533
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,583
without having to be watched!

534
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,541
By the way, the king that
I look up to the most

535
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,625
is Henry IV of France.

536
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,708
I hope I have your
vote next month!
