I'm Hikari Sakurada.

At first glance, you'd
think I was a normal,

be right about that!

And I'm in the
running to be king!

Aoi's still in the
number one spot.

At least, that's what
the polls are saying.

I saw that too.

a close second.

Do you really hate
curry that much?

You're totally missing
the point here.

All I need to do is add a little
bit of bounce here or there,

be eating out of my hand.

First off, what's the point?

Everyone in the country knows
you're only ten years old.

Second, you'd be changing your
appearance, not your age.

And trying to win by your looks
alone is shallow at best.

It looks like it's shaping up

162

to be another thrilling day!

163

[NEWSCASTER A] Yep! And to
make it even more exciting,

164
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,083
we'll now announce
the public opinion poll

Ready? I know I am!

167
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,250
[HIKARI]
Huh?

168
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,625
I rescued a helpless kitty cat
and I didn't rank up at all?

169
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,125
What gives?

170
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,375
It's probably because there
weren't any cameras around.

[HIKARI gasps]

You're such an airhead, Hikari.

Don't let it get you down, okay?

174
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,208
Remember, there's
always next time.

175
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,250
Just keep working at it.

You're right. Next time.

No way!

This cannot be happening!

That's three times in a row.
Why is life out to get me?

180
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,791
Maybe 'cause you
keep hiding from it?

How come I don't get to draw?

If I don't do chores,
I'll never become a man!

Worry about that when

Hello. I'm Shiori Sakurada.

Are you okay, Teru?

00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,041
[TERU]
Oh, no you don't!

189
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
Calm down, Jackal. I mean it.

190
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,833
[SHIORI] Sometimes I don't
really understand my brother.

191
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,916
I think it's because
he's a year older.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,208
[TERU]
Leave it to me, Akane!

193
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,625
I'll tackle the
shopping for you!

You're pretty gung-ho
about chores.

under your butt?

I wanna be able to protect
all of you someday,

but that is never gonna happen
unless I can get stronger.

198

I need to find every challenge
I can and beat them one by one!

Epic, bro! I'm with
you. All the way!

Big Brother! I'll
get the groceries...

201
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,750
[SHIORI]
Teru can be pretty careless.

202
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,125
I'm afraid he'll get in trouble

203
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,916
if he goes shopping
all by himself.

204

I'm going with you.

205
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,541
But, Shiori, this is
a trial of courage.

206
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,875
There's no telling what dangers
we'll face along the way.

207
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,041
[SHIORI]
I have to do this.

208
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,166
I'm going.

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,958
I get it, you must've been
feeling left out, too.

I'm such a horrible person!

all on their own!

Yeah, but they seemed
so excited about it.

That's it! Hikari,
I need you for a sec.

This is bad! I forgot to
grab the shopping bag!

already hit a brick wall.

after my stash of old socks.

thousand people there!

315
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,833
Uh, Hikari? You still with us?

316
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,375
[HIKARI]
Bingo!

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,291
[HIKARI]
This is amazing.

318
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,875
Who knew it was so easy
to become popular?

319
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,375
Hey, Borscht, you in here?

320
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,500
There's my pretty boy.
You ready for dinner?

321
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,916
Whatever it is you're planning,
don't go overboard.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,250
Consider that your only warning.

323
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't want them to copy me.

324
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,583
So, until I'm actually an idol,
this will be my little secret.

325
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,083
I have to audition first?

326
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,166
And elementary school students
need a guardian with them.

327
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
Well, that's a bummer.

328
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,500
If I was two years older,
I could go all by myself.

329
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,958
Geez.

330
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,000
The rest of the world really
needs to catch up with me.

331
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
[gasps]

332
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,500
Why wait when I can transform
into a middle school student?

333
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,541
I'm a genius!

334
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,875
But If I want to pull this off,

335
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,083
I need to find some
bigger clothes.

336
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,000
Akane's lacking in the chest.
Kanade would kill me.

337
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,375
I guess Misaki is the winner.

338
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,416
Hm. None of these
have a "wow" factor.

339
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,583
Doesn't she have any
interesting clothes?

340
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,291
[HARUKA clearing throat]

341
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,166
Would you like it if someone
started digging through

342
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,375
all your stuff
without permission?

343
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,083
No, not really.

344
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,250
But I don't have anything
to wear for my audition.

345
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,750
Say what now?

346
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,041
I really want to
become the next king,

347
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,166
so I tried to think of a way
to get popular quickly.

348
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,375
I decided being an idol
was my best shot.

349
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,333
What for?

350
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,833
It sounded like fun!

351
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,791
So, what do you think?

352
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,750
You might be onto something.

353
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,708
I can keep your secret.
And I'll help out.

354
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,375
You really mean it?

355
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,875
Just this once, okay?

356
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,416
Understood!

357
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
[HARUKA] But, if you're going
to do it, do it with gusto!

358
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,875
[HIKARI]
Maybe this was a bad idea.

359
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,958
[HARUKA]
With her brother's help,

360
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
Hikari passed the first audition

361
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,750
and kept everyone at home
completely in the dark.

362
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,958
Looking back on it, there were
easier ways to meet her goal.

363
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,916
And they may have gotten
a little carried away.

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,458
But why do it if you're
going to take the easy out?

365
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,833
That's lazy. The harder the
work, the sweeter the victory.

366
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,041
[HARUKA]
They've come far.

367
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:01,250
And now their destiny is
well within their grasp.

368
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,875
Remember the blood, sweat,
and tears that got us here.

369
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,458
Yeah.

370
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,875
If they knew the truth, they'd
probably treat you differently.

371
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,916
For now, it's best to keep
your lineage a secret.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,875
Your friend deserves
our gratitude.

373
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,625
If you weren't using
her name, we'd be screwed.

374
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,750
You can pay me back once
you're a big shot idol.

375
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,750
Thank you, Chika.

376
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,916
[HARUKA] Show them
your overwhelming charm.

377
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,625
Make yourself indispensable.

378
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,583
So when they do find
out who you are,

379
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:33,291
you'll be too popular for them
to let go. You'll be an idol.

380
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,208
Make me proud.

381
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
Yeah. You got it.

382
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm here for the second round.

383
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,458
That's great!

384
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,416
I just need to see your ID
and you'll be all set to go.

385
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,583
Oh. My ID?

386
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,791
We also accept
school identification.

387
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,708
[HIKARI]
Awesome!

388
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,833
Here you go!

389
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,166
Thank you.

390
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,458
Huh? Hold on,
this can't be right.

391
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,583
[HIKARI] Oh, crap! I gave
her my actual school card!

392
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,208
So, uh. We made a mistake.

393
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,458
[HIKARI]
Wait. Does she not recognize me?

394
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,000
According to this, you're
in elementary school.

395
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
Someone on staff must've
thought you were older

396
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,875
when they screened your photos.

397
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,750
I'm very sorry, but
we're not recruiting

398
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,958
elementary school
students at this time.

399
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,625
Be sure to check the age
limits in the future!

400
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,666
[HIKARI]
Uhh...

401
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,833
[HARUKA]
Huh?

402
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,708
[HIKARI]
Well, I feel dumb.

403
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,750
Showing my ID never
even crossed my mind.

404
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,958
[HARUKA] This wouldn't
have been a problem

405
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,583
if I had disguised myself
as her guardian.

406
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,750
All she had to do was use
her power on me as well.

407
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
I'll tell her that later.

408
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,416
[HARUKA]
Let's go home.

409
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,625
[HIKARI]
Yeah.

410
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,750
[HARUKA] And so, our
heroes left. Defeated.

411
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,958
Nature calls. Would
you mind waiting?

412
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,916
Sure. Got nothing
better to do.

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,166
[HIKARI sighs]

414
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,916
I'm not very lucky.

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,041
[MATSUOKA] Excuse me, Miss.
Do you have a moment?

416
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,541
[HIKARI]
Huh?

417
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,750
I'm a recruiter for a big
local entertainment business.

418
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,625
Would you like to be an idol--?

419
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,750
[HIKARI]
Yes, please!

420
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,208
[MATSUOKA chuckles]

421
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,708
You've got a lot
of spirit. I like that.

422
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,333
[MATSUOKA] She has a sense
of refinement about her.

423
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,750
She might be exactly
what we're looking for.

424
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
Our organization's main
office and training building

425
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,541
is right around the corner.

426
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,375
When do you have some
free time to check it out?

427
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,250
Now!

428
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,916
[HARUKA]
Where'd she go?

429
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,541
[PRESIDENT] Well done, Matsuoka.
You found us an amazing girl.

430
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,833
I'm actually kinda surprised

431
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,000
that no one had
scouted her before.

432
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,250
Morning, everyone.

433
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,291
[HIKARI]
Uh.

434
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,541
[HIKARI]
Hey, you're Sacchy!

435
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,125
You're the reason I'm here!

436
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,291
'Scuse me?

437
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,500
Your concert inspired me!

438
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,000
[SACCHY] I feel like I've seen
her somewhere before.

439
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,458
Awesome! I can't wait to tell
Chika I met you in person!

440
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,291
Well, then, what do you think?

441
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,916
You serious about
becoming an idol?

442
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,166
Yeah! More than anything!

443
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,625
That's great!

444
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,083
But first I need to talk to
your parents to make sure

445
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,333
there are no issues.

446
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,083
Would it be okay if I
tried calling them now?

447
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,750
[HIKARI]
Uh, sure! Just one sec!

448
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,375
[HARUKA] Darn it, Hikari.
You better be okay.

449
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,541
[PHONE RINGER]
Big smelly Haru's calling!

450
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,041
Big smelly Haru's calling!
Big smelly Haru's calling!

451
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,333
What's her phone
doing in my bag?

452
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,916
Oh, that's right.

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,583
I left my phone in Haru's bag
so it wouldn't be a distraction.

454
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,708
Come to think of it,
I left Haru too.

455
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,083
We could always use our landline

456
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,708
to get in touch
with them at home.

457
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,625
If you give me your phone number
I can take care of it myself.

458
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,125
Actually...

459
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,833
...I don't know the
number at home by heart.

460
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,041
[PRESIDENT chuckles]

461
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,666
In that case,

462
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,375
would it be alright with you if
we paid them a visit in person?

463
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,875
[HIKARI]
Yeah, that's fine!

464
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,541
You wanna tag along, Sacchy?

465
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,958
I'd like to, but I'm
recording in a minute.

466
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:50,000
If she isn't dead,
I'm gonna kill her!

467
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:50,958
There you are!

468
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,625
[HIKARI]
Hm?

469
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,041
I was worried sick!

470
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,666
Just what have you been doing?

471
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,416
Getting scouted! These
guys wanna make me an idol!

472
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,666
Who? These two?

473
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,208
You know better than to
run off with strangers.

474
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,875
Second Prince Haruka.

475
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,208
[PRESIDENT A]
Oh...

476
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,041
Uh, Miss Hikari, what was
your last name again?

477
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,583
[chuckles] I didn't
mention it before?

478
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,833
[MATSUOKA]
Your Majesty!

479
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,416
I didn't realize who
your daughter was.

480
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
In my ignorance, I treated
her with great disrespect!

481
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,750
For that, I beg you
for your forgiveness!

482
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,958
However, I don't think
this was a coincidence.

483
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,375
You see, Princess Hikari
has an innate talent

484
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,500
that every idol dreams about!

485
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,791
Please, sire! Let us
represent your daughter!

486
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,791
It would be our
most humble honor!

487
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,875
That sounds good to me.

488
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,166
Thanks, Daddy!

489
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,166
I knew you'd understand!
You're the best!

490
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,583
[HIKARI] Hey, hey!
How's it going everyone?

491
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,291
I'm the band new idol,
Laito Sakurapa!

492
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,375
I'm excited to be here!

493
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,458
And I'm working really hard
to make my debut amazing!

494
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,041
So you're still disguising
yourself as a middle schooler

495
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,000
and keeping your
identity secret.

496
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,791
Uh-huh. At least for now.

497
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,208
And you're okay with that?

498
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,333
I've heard of lying about
your age to be younger,

499
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,166
but never really
the other way around.

500
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,541
I'd love to wear
clothes like that.

501
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,125
[SHU] You could always
become an idol.

502
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,166
[AKANE]
No thanks.

503
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,000
I have a question, Hikari.

504
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,125
The whole point of this was
to raise your popularity

505
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,625
for the election, right?

506
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,958
[HIKARI]
You got it!

507
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,250
[HARUKA] Then why are
you hiding your identity?

508
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,291
[HIKARI]
Uh!

509
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
[HIKARI] Daughter number
five at your service!

510
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,750
[SATSUKI] Hikari can act
a little spoiled at times,

511
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,875
but she's full of life,
positive energy, and honesty.

512
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,875
She's also quite
popular at school.

513
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,083
If she became king,

514
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,916
I'm sure our country
would transform

515
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,041
into a fun and lively place.

516
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,208
Is there anything that
you'd like to say, sweetie?

517
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,666
[HIKARI] I'll make this nation
a place of fun and fashion!

518
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,000
Just so you know,

519
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,291
my favorite ruler from
history is Maria Theresa!

520
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,625
I'll be patiently waiting
for your honest vote!

521
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,291
Until next time!
