[AKANE]
The summer flew by.

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,083
Now the election's
only six months away.

00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,458
[AKANE]
Aoi, I'm going to be king.

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,333
Once I have the crown,
I'll live a quiet life.

5
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,250
[AKANE]
I made up my mind to go for it.

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,666
but I haven't really done much

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,041
in the way of campaigning
for the crown since then.

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,291
[HARUKA]
It's considered entertainment,

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,041
so it's perfectly legal.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,875
But I know how
embarrassed you get.

11
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,583
[AKANE] It's time for
me to make a change.

12
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,125
[AKANE]
Hello, everyone.

13
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,875
First, let me apologize
for the disruption.

14
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,041
My name's Akane... Sakurada.

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,333
It's nice to... meet you.

16
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,083
I'm not all that great at
speaking in front of people,

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,041
but I will be a great king.

18
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:39,583
So, I hope you'll consider...
giving me your vote.

19

[AKANE screeches]

22

[NEWSCASTER B] Despite
stammering through her speech,

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,583
Princess Akane left a good
impression on the citizens

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,708
who call her innocence
a "breath of fresh air..."

25
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,500
[HIKARI]
Look at that!

26
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,458
Whoa.

27
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,791
How did you ever
survive speaking

28
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,791
in front of all those people?

29
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,750
[AKANE]
I don't know!

30
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,291
You're campaigning?

31
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,750
Seems kinda weird

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,375
since even the pictures on
your fan page freak you out.

33
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,958
I won't give in!

34
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,041
When I become king, I'm gonna
regulate the internet so hard!

35
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,833
I'm not sure you can do that.

36
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,041
[TERU] Check it out
I'm so gonna win with these!

"Annihilating evil at its core

38
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,750
and guiding the
world to the end"?

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,333
Um, what does that
even mean, Teru?

40
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,625
That last part actually
sounds kinda terrifying.

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,083
What? I thought it
sounded pretty epic.

42
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,750
You guys really don't like it?

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,708
I think it sounds kinda awesome.

44
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,416
Speaking of awesomeness,

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I get to be police
chief for a day.

46
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,958
You mean, "Laito" does.

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,583
I've got a ton of campaign
events to attend this week.

48
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,000
Really?

[TERU] All right! Time to hang
these all over the city!

I'm coming with you.

[SHU]
Hey, Akane.

52
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,500
If you want, I can accompany
you this weekend.

53
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,000
[AKANE] Yes, please!
That'd be great, Shu!

54
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,583
Everyone else is campaigning
for the crown like crazy.

55
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,833
Meanwhile, we're just sitting
here twiddling our thumbs.

56
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,375
We've been helping
out at school.

57
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,083
But then again, that's
all we've been doing.

58
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,375
I think we need some
excitement in our lives.

59
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,416
We should be idols like Hikari.

60
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,333
I'm in! We'd totally
rock as idols, y'know?

61
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,875
Sounds like too much work.

62
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,458
Whatever, it's not like we have
a chance of winning anyway.

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,041
Hey, is there any more pudding?

64
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,625
Haruka! Why aren't
you being more helpful?

65
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,166
Like I could get a
word in. Good grief.

66
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,541
I don't get why I was even
invited to the "Misaki Summit"

67
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,583
in the first place.

68
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,000
What's the topic of
this discussion anyway?

69
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,583
Um. Election strategy.

70
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,250
[HARUKA]
Wow. You're in it to win it.

71
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, duh! I can't let the
other princesses beat me!

72
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,541
Look at Akane!

73
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,791
She only wants to win

74
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,291
so she can get rid of
the surveillance cameras

75
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,333
and save herself from
more embarrassment!

76
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,666
Then there's Hikari,

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,583
who just wants the whole
kingdom to fawn over her.

78
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,208
That's why she became an idol!

79
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,125
Aoi couldn't care less
about the election,

80
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,333
but she's still in the lead
without even trying!

81
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,916
And Kanade's totally
up to something

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,250
even though I have no
freakin' idea what it is!

with your big sister?

You're not allowed.

Mom told us we're supposed
to stay in the house.

94

You'll just have to come with
us and make sure we stay safe.

I don't think you know
what "stay at home" means.

[KANADE]
You're not the boss of me!

Only Mom and Dad can
tell me what to do!

98
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,083
Nope, I am the boss
of you 'cause I'm older.

You were only born 30
minutes before me, dummy!

I'm still older than you,
it doesn't matter by how much.

Well that doesn't make
you smarter than me!

If you're not gonna come,

then we'll go and
have fun on our own!

go back home now.

a little longer!

Wait just a sec.

I've got something
cool to show you!

114
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:50,750
What is it?

A Rose Typhoon costume for me?

If you keep making stuff
whenever you want.

You're gonna run outta
New Year's money.

All that magic stuff comes out
of your savings, y'know!

and show it to mommy!

Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

Can Rose Typhoon go inside?

Yeah, of course you can.

I dunno how to get
all the way up there.

What?

00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,291
Uh-oh, there's supposed
to be a staircase.

00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,666
See? Told you you'd
run out of savings.

[KANADE growls]

135
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,666

But I wanna go inside.

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,541
Okay, I tell you what.

137
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,500
I can teleport you up there
but just this one time.

138
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,416
[AKANE]
You can?

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,625
[SHU]
Yeah, just take my hand.

140
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,750
[KANADE] No, wait! I can finish
the stairs. I know I can!

141
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,583
[SHU] But there's nothing
left in your bank account.

It'll be fine!

Oh, wow!

00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,041
Whoa, she did it. Uh. Oh no.

148
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,791
[KANADE]
No!

149
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,791
[KANADE]
That day changed Shu's life.

150
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,916
He lost partial use of his legs.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,208
He could still walk but
running is too much for him.

152
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,000
[SHU] When I grow up,
I'll be a soccer sensation!

153
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,375
[KANADE] That was all
he ever dreamed about.

154
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,291
And I took that dream
away from him.

155
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,583
Unfortunately, I can't
heal him with my powers.

156
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,833
But maybe I can when I'm king.

157
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,041
I'll spare no expense
on medical research.

158
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,458
I wanna bring Shu's smile back.

159
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,750
I swear that I will someday.

160
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,166
[AKANE] Someone's gotta
be rigging the chore cup!

161
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,500
Please tell me why I keep
ending up with this?

162
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,750
[SHU]
Hey, whoa.

163
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,875
It's not our fault you
keep picking that one.

164
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,333
[AKANE wailing]

165
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,291
She's bawling.
I almost feel bad.

166
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,708
[AKANE]
I get it!

167
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,375
This is merely another trial
on the path to kingship,

168
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,791
and I'll overcome!

169
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,833
I shall venture forth.
Into treacherous lands.

170
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,541
Where people and cars
converge in a deadly dance!

171
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,083
From there into the shadow
fortress of the supermarket!

172
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,125
And bring back dinner.

173
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,208
Wish me well!

174
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,458
[SHU]
She's still got a ways to go,

175
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,416
but at least she's
trying, right?

176
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,791
But you're not really
trying, are you, Shu?

177
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,541
For what?

178
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,875
To be king and stuff.

179
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,166
[SHU]
Nah, I guess not.

180
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
I can't think of much
reason to be king.

181
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,500
Not over any of you.

182
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,375
[MISAKI]
Hm?

183
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,041
For real?

184
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,125
[SHU]
Yeah.

185
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,333
[HARUKA] It's nice of you to
help the team out on a Sunday.

186
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,750
They're a good group,

187
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,541
and they really needed
to snag a win this weekend.

188
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
That all it was?

189
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,833
[HIKARI] Hello, everyone!
My name is Laito Sakurapa!

190
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm your honorary
police chief for the day

191
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,708
and I'm proud to work
with all of you!

192
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,166
Let's keep the streets safe!

193
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,416
It's Hikari.

194
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,583
She's starting to take
this thing seriously.

195
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,916
[TERU]
I want to, well, uh--

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,208
[SHIORI] Make use of
the awesome power I have.

197
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,083
Uh. Make use of the
awesome power I have.

198
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,458
[SHIORI]
If I'm elected,

199
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,708
I will give my all to protecting
this great kingdom.

200
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,083
If I'm elected,

201
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,333
I will give my all to protecting
this great kingdom.

202
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,708
I can't pick out which
one's making the speech.

203
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,958
[ANNOUNCER C]
Here she is,

204
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,666
please welcome to the
stage our special guest.

205
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,541
This spring, Princess
Kanade will serve

206
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,166
as special advisor to
our Sports Foundation.

207
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,750
She'll help us teach
the kingdom's youth

208
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,416
to make healthy
lifestyle choices.

209
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,333
Wow. Kanade isn't messing
around with her campaigning.

210
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,541
She really wants this.

211
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,000
[YUNIKO]
Ugh!

212
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,291
Everyone else is campaigning
for the crown like crazy.

213
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,333
Meanwhile, we're just sitting
here twiddling our thumbs.

214
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm pretty sure we've had
this conversation before.

215
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,208
Yeah, most definitely.

216
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,333
But seriously, we should
become idols, too.

217
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,458
Why's everyone getting
bent up over it now,

218
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,541
it's not like our chances
have gotten better.

219
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,916
This isn't about
who's gonna win.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,208
It's that everybody
seems to be so focused

221
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,125
on campaigning for themselves.

222
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,375
They're ignoring the
people's needs, y'know?

223
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,000
And that just seems wrong to me.

224
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,833
That's easy to say when
you're doing nothing.

225
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,833
[MISAKI wails]

226
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,291
Yeah, like you can talk, Bro.

227
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,708
[HARUKA]
I didn't mean like that!

228
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, I see, you've turned
traitor and sided against me.

229
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,333
But that's not what I said.

230
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,375
I mean, sure, you have
to put the people first.

231
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,833
But it takes a whole lot more
than that to be a good leader,

232
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
Misaki.

233
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,333
It's not as though our
sisters aren't thinking

234
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,125
about the people,
of course they are.

235
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,375
They're just doing the best they
can with the skills they have.

236
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,750
In the end, it's up to
the citizens to decide.

237
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,416
All you can do is tell
them where you stand

238
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,166
and hope for the best.

239
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,500
Listen here!

240
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,875
The monarch's actual job
is to govern this kingdom!

241
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,875
Obviously, the best
person for the throne

242
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,083
is the one who's willing to put
this nation above anything!

243
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,583
[HARUKA] And do you think
you're the one to do that?

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,958
I can!

245
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,333
[REVI]
I'm not so sure about that.

246
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,666
[MISAKI gasps]

247
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,291
[HARUKA] Wow, you can't
even agree with yourself.

248
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,083
[REVI] Be honest, why're
you getting all worked up?

249
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,291
It's not about your sisters
gunning for the crown, is it?

250
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,083
No, you're upset because
Haruka stood up for them.

251
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,666
You're not "fighting
for justice."

252
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,958
You're jealous of them.

253
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,666
[RAIO] You can't hide
your feelings from us.

254
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,000
The only reason you want the
crown is to impress Haruka.

255
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,916
[gasps]

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,125
[HARUKA]
What's that look for?

257
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,708
Are you all right?

258
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,250
She's realized she wants to be
king for selfish reasons, too.

259
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,000
I doubt she'll go around bad
mouthing all her sisters anymore

260
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,000
after a major
revelation like this.

261
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,666
[MISAKI]
I'm just as bad as they are.

262
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,416
No. I'm even worse for
being a gigantic hypocrite.

263
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,458
Hey, Misaki.

264
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,000
You know, I really think
you'd make a good king.

265
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,416
No matter what
the reason may be.

266
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,583
[MISAKI gasps]

267
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,375
You honestly care about people.

268
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,333
You always put others
before yourself.

269
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,541
I wish I was more like you.

270
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,041
If you want to be king,
I think you should go for it.

271
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,250
Because you'd make
an awesome one.

272
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,791
Then I will.

273
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,125
I didn't think I had
it in me before now,

274
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,291
but I'll campaign
and try my best.

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,666
Would you mind helping me?

276
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,375
[gasps]

277
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,708
Well, sure, I don't see why not?

278
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,833
I'm in. But if we're gonna
do this, we do it right.

279
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,208
[MISAKI, CLONES]
Yeah!

280
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,541
[YUNIKO]
Whoa!

281
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,375
I've never seen Bubu this
fired up about anything.

282
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,125
[HARUKA]
We were changing.

283
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,666
At first, it was
just tiny steps,

284
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,875
but slowly they grew to
strides, leaps, and bounds.

285
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,083
Things we once thought
impossible became the everyday.

286
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,625
I think maybe that's
why Father decided

287
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,208
to hold this election now,
while we're young.

288
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,291
He's giving us the chance
to find our weaknesses

289
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,833
and overcome them before we have
to make our own in the world.

290
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,750
[BUBU] I hear the sound
of pudding approaching.

291
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,791
[HARUKA gasps]

292
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,250
[HARUKA]
You hear pudding?!

293
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,875
[SHU]
Huh? What was that?

294
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,708
[PRINCIPAL]
We have a special visitor today.

295
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,083
This is Princess Kanade
of the royal family.

296
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,666
It's nice to meet you all.

297
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,500
I've been working hard
to become king,

298
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,666
but today, I'm here just
to have fun with you.

299
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,708
She's even prettier
in real life!

300
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:59,791
[KIDS laughing]

301
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
[KANADE]
You're very good.

302
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
Is that a drawing of your mommy?

303
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,708
[KAE]
Nuh-uh! It's Princess Aoi!

304
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,541
She's cool! I'm gonna give
her my vote for sure!

305
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,541
[TEACHER] That's enough
drawing for now, Kae.

306
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,833
Why don't we go sing a song?

307
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,375
[KAE] But, Teacher,
I'm not done drawing yet!

308
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,416
But doesn't singing
sound like a lot of fun?

309
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,416
[KAE]
I guess so.

310
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,000
[TEACHER]
Come along over here.

311
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,041
Bye, bye!

312
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,500
[KANADE] Even little
kids are taken with her.

313
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,541
My biggest rival for the
crown is definitely Aoi.

314
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,583
[groans]

315
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,958
I am so done.

316
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,958
Hey. Are you alive?

317
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,041
[KANADE]
What happened to her?

318
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,166
[AOI]
She's just a little tuckered out

319
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,666
from all the campaigning.

320
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,333
I don't blame her. She's been
going full speed for days.

321
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,000
[KANADE] Wait, have you
guys been helping her out

322
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,875
this entire time?

323
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,208
Yep.

324
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,208
I've been hauling materials
for her all weekend.

325
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,583
I hope she does well when it's
time for the votes to come in.

326
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,791
She's been campaigning hard.

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,958
Who's there?

328
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,750
[KANADE]
It's me. Can I come in?

329
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,416
Kanade? Yeah, sure.

330
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,500
Okay, now be honest with me, do
you want to become king or not?

331
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,083
Whoa, where did
this come from?

332
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,500
[KANADE]
If you're not in it to win,

333
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,083
then you should dedicate
yourself to Akane's campaign.

334
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
You can help her
overcome her shyness.

335
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,291
Plus, you won't have to be king,
it's a win-win, y'know?

336
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,000
[AOI]
Let's make one thing clear,

337
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,666
I'm not helping her just
so I can avoid the crown.

338
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,875
You make it sound as though I'm
using her. It's not like that.

339
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,125
I know. Why don't
you talk to daddy?

340
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,750
Tell him you want
out of the election.

341
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,250
Father, please,

342
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,125
you must understand that I don't
want to rule the kingdom.

343
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,125
'Kay! Love ya, sweetie.

344
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,708
Better yet, if you
don't want to,

345
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,375
I'd be happy to go talk to him.

346
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,166
Daddy, I don't think Aoi
wants to be the king.

347
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,666
But you know that
she's not a quitter.

348
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,208
You should just
let her drop out.

349
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,583
Okay, then. Love ya, sweetie!

350
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,416
Sure, he talks
about "royal duty,"

351
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,375
but he just wants
us to be happy.

352
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,416
[AOI] I know he does but
dropping out of the election

353
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,916
isn't as easy as
you make it sound.

354
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
Wow.

355
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,916
You're willing to wear the crown
even if it makes you miserable?

356
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,958
Kanade. Why're you being
so mean about this?

357
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,458
You used to be such
a sweet little girl.

358
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,375
Aoi! Wanna go outside and play?

359
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,041
Yeah, whatever!

360
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
Ahem.

361
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,833
Okay, talk to me, I want to
know what your power is.

362
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,416
The real one.

363
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,041
You're being silly.
You know my power.

364
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,541
You have perfect memory,
thanks to Invisible Work.

365
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,916
And it's an impressive
ability, that's for sure.

366
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,708
Everything comes easy to you.

367
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,583
You've aced every
test you've taken.

368
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,583
You remember every
person you meet.

369
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,333
And you've memorized every
national statute word-for-word.

370
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,041
But that's your intelligence,
it's not magic.

371
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:41,500
What happened to my cute sister?
You were always so sweet.

372
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,916
I made this just for you, Aoi!

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,750
I'm still sweet, okay?

374
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,166
So why are you asking me now?

375
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,000
I've been waiting.

376
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,375
But I'm not very patient
and I wanna know what it is.

377
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,416
'Cause I know it's not long
before you turn the tide on me.

378
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,000
[AOI]
Wha...?

379
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,208
I wouldn't worry
about it, Kanade.

380
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,458
You'll surpass me soon enough.

381
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,416
[KANADE]
I hope you're right about that.

382
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,333
[AOI] She's right, I could turn
the tides and win the election

383
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,583
if I used my real power.

384
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,416
But I can't do that.

385
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,208
I won't abuse this
gift I've been given.

386
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,166
[NANAO]
Hello? Earth to Aoi!

387
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,208
[gasps]

388
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,458
You want us to post
these in front

389
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,333
of the freshman classrooms, too?

390
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,041
Uh. Yeah, I guess so.

391
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,333
Sorry to make you help. I can
put the rest up by myself.

392
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,500
We don't mind and you'll
get it done a lot faster.

393
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,833
For sure!

394
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,666
And besides, I don't
understand why you're stuck

395
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,500
doing this in
the first place.

396
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,125
Well, nobody else
wanted to do it.

397
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,625
I'm always happy to help out.

398
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,333
[UZUKI]
That's so like you!

399
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,541
Hey, look! Princess Aoi's
putting up posters today!

400
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,041
[STUDENT A] Would you
expect any less of her?

401
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,833
[STUDENT B] She's got three
other girls to help her out!

402
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,833
[STUDENT C]
Don't get in their way!

403
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,208
Geez, everyone's staring at us

404
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,750
like we're in some
kind of parade.

405
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,916
I'm sorry!

406
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They've been at it since
elementary school.

407
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,583
Don't you remember, Shizuru?

408
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,666
Even back then everyone would
watch us walk down the hallway.

409
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,083
Yeah, I guess so.

410
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,000
Not that it was ever
limited to school.

411
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,250
Remember the lady who used
to call Aoi "Momotaro"?

412
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,666
If Aoi's Momotaro, then
Uzuki's the pheasant,

413
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,458
'cause she's so tiny.

414
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,958
That makes sense to me.

415
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,250
[NANAO]
So Shizuru's the monkey.

416
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,375
[SHIZURU] No, I'm the dog!
You're the monkey!

417
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,583
Uh, why don't you let
me be the monkey?

418
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,791
'Kay, then I get to
be Momotaro! Sweet!

419
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,458
Quit yappin', puppy!

420
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,458
I'm more Momotaro than you!

421
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,291
Isn't that right, Aoi?

422
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,208
[NANAO]
Told you so!

423
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,458
[SHIZURU]
Whatever.

424
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,875
You're just mad you got
stuck with the monkey.

425
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,250
[NANAO]
Better that than the dog!

426
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,625
[UZUKI] I think I would
make the best Momotaro.

427
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,375
[SHIZURU, NANAO]
You're the pheasant, Uzuki!

428
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,791
[UZUKI]
Okay, okay!

429
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,375
[NANAO]
You guys, guess what?

430
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,375
My friend's dog had
puppies a few days ago

431
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,416
and I went over to her
house to see them.

432
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,958
When I reached down to pet one,

433
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,583
it licked my finger and it was,
like, the cutest thing ever!

434
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,875
That's adorable.
Show us how it licked you.

435
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,916
[NANAO]
Huh? No way! That's super weird.

436
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,541
C'mon, Nana, show us.

437
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,916
[NANAO]
Huh?

438
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,291
[NANAO]
Yes. Of course I will.

439
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,541
[gasps]

440
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,583
The student council asked
me to put up posters.

441
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,333
You guys wanna help?

442
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,625
[ALL]
Yes, of course we will.

443
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,333
Welcome home, Princess Aoi.

444
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,208
[AOI] Pardon me, sir.
May I ask you something?

445
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,416
Uh, sure.

446
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm happy to help in
any way that I can.

447
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,250
[AOI]
Uh.

448
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,625
Well, I...

449
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,500
Would you please do a handstand
and bark like a dog for me?

450
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,333
[BODYGUARD]
Yes, of course I will.

451
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,708
[BODYGUARD barks]

452
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,208
[DOCTOR]
The examination concludes

453
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,458
that Princess Aoi's true power
is not the quick learning

454
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,208
and faultless memory
that she possesses.

455
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,000
Her actual power's called
"Absolute Obedience."

456
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,041
She can command immediate
loyalty of anyone.

457
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,208
Since she's been unaware
of this ability until now,

458
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,791
it's possible she's been using
it involuntarily for some time.

459
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,583
I suspect the commands
have gained power

460
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,708
throughout her adolescence,

461
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,000
which is why they
went unnoticed.

462
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,500
Her abilities have grown.

463
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,541
She did not always have absolute
control, but she does now.

464
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,666
Ah. Well, whatever
powers she has,

465
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,125
she'll always be my perfect
and beautiful princess.

466
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,458
Dad, stop you're
embarrassing me.

467
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,458
[AOI]
"Absolute Obedience."

468
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,125
That's the real power
that I possess.

469
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,458
Whenever I give a command,
people are forced to obey me.

470
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,750
No one should have
that kind of power.

471
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,625
Especially not someone
who could become king.

472
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,958
We're done, Aoi!

473
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
Thanks for all of your help.

474
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,708
[SHIZURU]
No big deal.

475
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,416
Uh. I'd really like to take
you to tea after school.

476
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,791
To thank you for helping me.

477
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,916
No way.

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,291
Not a chance.

479
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,625
Sorry. I guess you
have other plans.

480
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
It wasn't fair for me
to ask out of the blue--

481
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,916
We'll go if you agree
to split the bill.

482
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
We told you we would help you
out and we're happy to do it.

483
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,833
There's no need for you to
take us out. It's all good.

484
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,791
Yeah, you can always
bank on us to be there

485
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,625
when you need someone
to lend a hand.

486
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,375
We're your friends.
That's what we're here for.

487
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,625
[SHIZURU]
Sweet! Let's go.

488
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,666
[NANAO] Oh, we should go
for pancakes instead!

489
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,083
[UZUKI] Yeah! That's like
the best idea ever!

490
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
[AOI]
Wait for me!

491
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,250
[AOI] Ever since I found
out about my power,

492
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,583
I've worried that my friends
were just following my commands.

493
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,125
But now I know better.

494
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,083
[NANAO]
Hey, isn't that Akane?

495
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,791
[UZUKI]
It is her!

496
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:51,333
[AKANE]
Big Sister!

497
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,416
[NANAO]
Wow, look at you, Akane.

498
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
Walking home by yourself.

499
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,208
[AKANE] I'm trying to be more
independent but it's not easy.

500
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,500
I heard you're doing
some campaigning, too.

501
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,125
Aw, I'm so proud of you!

502
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,375
I can't believe you're the shy,
little princess we grew up with.

503
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,250
Yeah, you've gotten
brave. Good job.

504
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,875
That does it! You're
getting my vote for king!

505
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,291
Well, this is where
we split up. Later!

506
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,750
See you tomorrow!

507
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,208
[AOI]
'Kay, see you then.

508
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,125
[AKANE] You've got
great friends, y'know?

509
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,708
Yeah, I certainly do,

510
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,958
but sometimes I'm afraid
it's only because of my power.

511
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,083
[AKANE]
Uh?

512
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,041
Never mind me.

513
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
Come on. Sis, tell me
what's on your mind.

514
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,875
It's okay. I promise
I won't tell anybody.

515
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,500
Are you worried that
your friends only like you

516
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,125
because you're a princess?

517
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,375
[AOI]
Huh?

518
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,541
I mean, that might be
what drew them to you.

519
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,583
But anyone can see that the four
of you are best friends now.

520
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,833
It's true.

521
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,416
They love you for who you are,

522
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,083
not because of your
royal heritage.

523
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,708
[AOI]
Yeah. You're right.

524
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,291
That's funny!

525
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,291
I know, right?

526
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,875
Um. Hi. Sorry to bother you.

527
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,500
But, uh. My name's
Aoi Sakurada, and...

528
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,666
...I was wondering if I could
be friends with you guys.

529
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,041
[NANAO]
Sure. Sounds good.

530
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,166
Nice to meet you!

531
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,583
I think that we'll
make great friends.

532
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,083
[AOI]
Me too!

533
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,416
[AOI] I'm the Sakurada
family's first daughter, Aoi.

534
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,833
[SATSUKI]
My Aoi is compassionate,

535
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,916
with a big smile and
an even bigger heart.

536
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,125
She's always helping
keep the house in order.

537
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,583
[AOI]
Thanks, Mom,

538
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,625
but, honestly, I'm just glad
to help out however I can.

539
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,458
[SATSUKI] She's is a great
candidate for the throne

540
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,541
but what I want most
is for her to be happy.

541
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,541
I want you to choose
your own path, my dear.

542
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,208
[AOI] But sometimes the path we
walk is already chosen for us.

543
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,083
Anyway, if I had to
pick a favorite king,

544
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,750
I'd say Edward VIII,

545
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,125
I hope you'll give me your
vote. Thank you so much.
