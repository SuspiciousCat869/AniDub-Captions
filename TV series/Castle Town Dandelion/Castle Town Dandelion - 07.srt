00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,208
[AKANE] To say that
our father, the king,

7
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,583
is overprotective
is an understatement.

8
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,750
He's always worried
about us kids.

00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,666
Dad, who the heck are these men

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,458
and what are they
doing in our house?

14
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,416
What kind of father
do you think I am?

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,166
I'm going away for a
business trip overnight.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,708
I can't leave three
of my daughters alone.

17
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,708
Soichiro, my love, you've always
been overly concerned.

18
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,708
We already went over this,
Dad, we'll be fine!

19
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,291
I'm just concerned.

20
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,000
Akane's down with a cold and
Shiori, well, she's so young.

21
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,666
You have to trust me.
We don't need guards.

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,375
I can take care
of them by myself.

23
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,166
Dear. I trust you.

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,583
I'd simply feel more comfortable
with the added security

25
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,250
of a few guards. That's all.

26
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,708
Like anyone would be dumb enough

27
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,500
to break into a house full
of people with superpowers.

28
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,500
[SOICHIRO]
Oh, I almost forgot!

29
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,833
We're going to need guards
at the end of the street, too.

30
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,333
Did you even listen to
a word that I just said?

31
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,916
[sighs] Honey...

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,083
[SOICHIRO] You think I'm
going overboard, too?

33
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,875
Well, at least let
this unit stay--

34
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,541
Nope, now hurry up
and get out of here

35
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,791
before I kick you out.

36
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,916
Ah! All right, fine.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,416
But you have to promise me
one thing before I go, Kana!

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,708
What's that?

39
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,375
[SOICHIRO] Your power lets
you create anything

40
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,458
you can imagine while
the cost of that object

41
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,208
is withdrawn from
your bank account.

42
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,083
Promise me that, no matter
what, you will not create

43
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,166
anything that has yet
to be invented by man.

44
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,208
If you were to drain your
savings account again--

45
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,416
Daddy.

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,125
--Get out of here now.
--[SOICHIRO] Right!

47
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,125
[SATSUKI]
We're leaving, sweetie.

48
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,541
Come on, Soichiro, let's go.

49
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,458
[SOICHIRO]
Bye, Kana.

50
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,000
[sighs]

51
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,750
[SOICHIRO]
That's fine.

52
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,916
Just make sure your men
stick to the plan.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,291
Yes, I'm aware of
the consequences

54
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,958
and I'll take
full responsibility.

55
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,041
Also, don't blow your cover.

56
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,083
[GUARD 7F]
Got it, Your Majesty!

57
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,541
[SATSUKI]
Seriously?

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,750
I can't believe you actually
called that ground unit.

59
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,250
Uh...

60
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,916
Well, you see, dear, it's
better to be safe than sorry.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
Relax, you shouldn't worry
about Kanade so much.

62
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,333
She's grown into a very
responsible young lady.

63
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,625
[chuckles] As usual,
you're right.

64
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,166
Yeah.

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
What's Dad's deal?

66
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,625
He's the biggest
worrywart I know!

67
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,666
We can handle one night
alone. Can't we, Shiori?

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,000
I think so.

69
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,833
All right. It's time to
go and check on Akane.

70
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,083
[SHIORI]
Mm-hm.

71
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,291
[KANADE] Sorry, kiddo,
you have to stay here.

72
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,708
She could be
contagious and I don't

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,583
want you getting
sick on me, too.

74
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,833
Fine.

75
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,458
[KANADE] I hope she's
feeling a little better.

76
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,666
[AKANE screams]

77
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
Akane!

78
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,875
What's going on?

79
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,875
[AKANE sobbing]

80
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,500
[KANADE]
Are you in pain?

81
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
Please-- Tell me what's wrong!

82
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,416
He's dead!

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,166
But he was way too young
and handsome to die!

84
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
If you don't go back
to sleep right now,

85
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,125
you're gonna join him!

87
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,125
[KANADE]
How'd this happen?

88
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,916
Your temperature's
even higher now.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,375
I'd better put one of those
fever patches on you.

90
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,666
Thanks for being
so nice to me today.

91
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,291
Whaddya mean? I'm
always nice to you.

92
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,375
[AKANE]
Yeah, you're awesome.

93
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,125
Well, thank you.

94
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,333
Hey. You know what?

95
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,458
[KANADE]
What?

96
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,416
I don't think you
need to act perfect

97
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,791
in front of everybody.

98
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,750
There's no need to pretend;
people will vote for you

99
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,708
'cause they like you
for who you are, y'know?

100
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,583
[KANADE] I dunno-- I mean,
look at who I'm up against.

101
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,416
There's no way I can beat Aoi
unless I'm a perfect angel.

102
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,666
What? You're silly.

103
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,708
Now, stop talking
and get some sleep.

104
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,333
[inahles] 'Kay.

105
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,958
[gasps] Shiori, what're
you doing out here?

106
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,833
I wanted to know if
Akane's feeling any better.

107
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,125
She'll be fine.

108
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,708
I gave her some medicine
and she's resting now.

109
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,166
Thank goodness.

110
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,500
Think she'll want something
to eat when she wakes up?

111
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,833
Probably.

112
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,250
Whaddya say we go cook up
something yummy for her?

113
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,833
'Kay!

114
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,916
I hope you stay sweet
like this forever, Shiori.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,375
[SHIORI]
Huh?

116
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,500
[KANADE]
Mmm. Looking good.

117
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,625
You can turn the stove off now.

118
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,791
Okie doke.

119
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,208
[KANADE]
Ready to give it a try?

120
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,541
[SHIORI]
Yeah!

121
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,708
[KANADE]
It's tasty, right?

122
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,291
[SHIORI]
Mm-hm!

123
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,541
It's so yummy.

124
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,041
I'm sure Akane will feel
better once she eats it.

125
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,083
Think so?

126
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:54,875
[KANADE]
Definitely.

127
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,458
We're the best cooks ever.

128
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,250
[KANADE] What? How is it your
fever's gotten even higher?

129
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,333
Akane looks like she's in pain.
What am I supposed to do?

130
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,833
I know!

131
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,833
I'll create a medication that
can cure all her symptoms.

132
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
[SOICHIRO]
Promise me that no matter what,

133
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
you will not create
anything that has

134
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
yet to be invented by man.

135
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,416
If you were to drain your
savings account again--

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,791
[KANADE]
I know I shouldn't, Dad.

137
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875
But still. What if
I could prevent

138
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,333
something horrible
from happening?

139
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,375
Kanade...

140
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,625
You okay?

141
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,500
[AKANE giggles]
I'm fine, I just have a cold.

142
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,291
You're making a big
fuss over nothing.

143
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,625
No. I'm not.

144
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,958
I don't need you to create
a cure-all pill for me.

145
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,458
Don't risk it,
I'll be okay as long

146
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,333
as I take my medicine
and get some rest.

147
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,000
No need to worry.

148
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,750
[KANADE]
I understand.

149
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,500
Instead, I'll bring to life the
smartest doctor to ever live.

150
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:47,000
[AKANE]
You don't understand anything!

151
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,291
If you create
anything to help me--

152
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,625
[KANADE]
What?

153
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,416
Then I'll run away.
And it'll be your fault.

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,166
[KANADE] Okay, okay, I get it!
Please don't do that!

155
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,958
[AKANE] All I'd have to
do is alter my gravity

156
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,000
and I could fly away and
you'd never see me again!

157
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,750
[KANADE] All right, fine!
I won't create anything.

158
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,083
Just lay back down.

159
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,125
[AKANE]
You pinky swear?

160
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,458
[KANADE]
I promise I won't!

161
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,166
--[AKANE] Sounds iffy.
--[KANADE] You need rest!

162
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,416
Put your head on your pillow!

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,041
Hey, I told you
not to come in here

164
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,708
unless you wanna
get sick. Shiori!

165
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,875
It's a magical kiss
to make you feel better.

166
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,041
[groans, giggles]

167
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,125
Shiori.

168
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,875
Who taught you how
to use that magic?

169
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,500
The kiss?

170
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,833
That's what Mommy and Daddy do
whenever I'm not feeling good.

171
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,208
[gasps] That's pretty
sweet. I never knew.

172
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:46,250
[KANADE] And they lived happily
ever after. The end.

173
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,708
All right, Miss Shiori.

174
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,500
It's way past your bed time
now. Aren't you tired yet?

175
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,750
[SHIORI] Can I stay up
just a little longer?

176
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,041
We can stay up late
but it's our secret, okay?

177
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Yay!

178
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,916
[clatter]

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Weird. Was that Akane?

180
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,875
I'll go and check it out.

181
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,375
[SHIORI]
Okay.

182
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,500
[KANADE]
Akane, how ya doing?

183
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,875
[gasps] She's not here.

184
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,041
I wonder if she
went to the bathroom.

185
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:16,958

Be careful, Kanade.
That noise was spooky.

[door creaks]

189
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,416
[SHIORI]
Akane, you scared me!

190
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,333
Sorry. Where'd Kana go?

191
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,125

[BOTH gasp]

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,666
Hey, Akane. Is that
you making noise?

194
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,375
Please answer me!

195

[KANADE]
Shu, what are you doing here?

199
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,625
I had to come back to pick up
some stuff that I forgot.

[GUARD 7B] Princess Akane and
Princess Shiori are safe.

I've secured Sir Borscht!

206
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,625
[GUARD 7F] Princess Kanade,
have you been harmed?

[gasps]

208
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,333
[GUARD 7F] There was no
threat inside the house.

209
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,291
It may have been a false
alarm, but stay alert.

210
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,458
[KANADE]
You jerks are the threat!

211
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,708
[SOICHIRO] You idiots
rushed in?! How could you!

212
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,250
Did I not stress the
importance of being discreet?!

213
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,291
[GUARD 7F]
I apologize, Your Majesty.

214
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,208
I'd like to talk
to my dad please.

215
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,416
[SOICHIRO] No, don't do it!
Don't give it to her!

216
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
[GUARD 7F]
Uh, here you go.

217
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:36,166
[SOICHIRO groans] Oh, Kanade, my
darling. How are things going?

218
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,041
You couldn't trust me
for one night, Daddy?

219
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,791
[SOICHIRO] That's not it at all!
You see, there was a-- a-- 

220
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,166
Yeah, whatever you say.

221
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,083
We'll talk about this when
you get home tomorrow.

222
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,541
[KANADE]
You can have your toy back now.

223
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,541
[GUARD 7F] I apologize for
the scare earlier, Princess.

00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,916
[AKANE giggles]

225
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,750
[KANADE sighs] Am I the only one
who got tired all of a sudden?

226
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,875
[AKANE giggles]

227
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,208
We should get some sleep.

228
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,041
[AKANE]
Yeah.

229
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,166
Wait. I forgot about Shiori.

230
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,750
She can't sleep in here or
she might catch your cold.

231
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,791
[AKANE]
I understand.

232
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,375
You sure?

233
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,750
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
Shiori needs you more than I do.

234
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,958
[KANADE]
But you're sick.

235
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,125
It's okay.

236
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,500
[KANADE groans]

237
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,541
You better go, or I'll
run away for real this time.

238
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,250
[laughs] Fine, you win.

239
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,750
All right, Shiori.

240
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,166
It looks like I'll be joining
you in here tonight.

241
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:22,708
[SHIORI]
No!

242
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,583
Huh?

243
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,458
Akane's the sick one, not me.

244
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,041
She needs her big sister there
to help her feel better.

245
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,875
I can sleep fine
all by myself, Kana!

246
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,541
She kicked me out of her room.

247
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,208
[AKANE]
Uh...

248
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,125
[KANADE]
She finally got to sleep.

249
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,458
'Kay. I should go
check on Shiori.

250
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,333
I hope that you
feel better soon, sis.

I'm coming in, invited or not.

252
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,958
Better not let her catch me.

253
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,083
I don't wanna get scolded
by my little sister again.

254
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,125
Love you, Momma.

255
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
[KANADE]
She is pretty adorable though.

256
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
I think I'll keep her.

[AUDIENCE cheering]

258
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,916
Hello, fans!

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,041
[AKANE] Hikari has transformed
herself into an idol

260
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,041
by the name of Laito
Sakurapa in the hopes

261
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,125
of boosting her campaign.

262
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,708
[MATSUOKA]
What do ya think?

263
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,666
You gotta admit, she's turning
into a bona fide idol, right?

264
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,916
[SACCHY]
Sure.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
I know she's a little
rough around the edges,

266
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,333
but, the girl's got talent.

267
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,750
[SACCHY]
She certainly has something.

268
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,916
And the rivalry between
you has been great.

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,125
The label couldn't have
asked for better publicity.

270
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,708
Don't you think? Sachiko?

271
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,166
Yes.

272
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,083
You really failed
the test! That sucks.

273
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,708
You prob'ly should've
studied a bit harder.

274
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,125
Hey, why don't you shut it?

275
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,500
She's got more important
responsibilities than school.

276
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,791
Yeah, being royalty
is hard work. Right?

277
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,250
It is.

278
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,916
[HIKARI] If only they knew
I didn't study 'cause

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,416
I'm too busy being an idol.

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
Don't you worry about
this stupid test.

281
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,375
Me, worried? Yeah, right. See--

282
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,458
I only put in 90% total
effort on this one!

283
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,708
[STUDENTS] Whoa, seriously?
You should've studied!

284
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,541
[HIKARI]
Hi, Matsuoka!

285
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,500
Ah-- I-- Hello there,
Princess Hikari.

286
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,500
I hope you're feeling well
after your recent performance.

287
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,208
To be honest, I'm kinda sick...

288
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,708
[MATSUOKA] Oh no, Princess!
We can't have that.

289
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,000
...of being called Princess.

290
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,750
[MATSUOKA]
Ahem. Sorry about that.

291
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,875
Whaddya say we go over
the video of your concert?

292
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,166
[HIKARI]
I'd love to!

293
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,750
There's no doubt
you're talented.

294
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,166
But you know, there's more to
being an idol than just talent.

295
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,958
Let's start with basic
training. To help you focus.

296
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,875
[HIKARI] But I've got
so much homework to do.

297
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,208
They really overload
us at school.

298
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,250
[MATSUOKA] First lesson: Don't
talk with your mouth full.

299
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,458
[HIKARI muffled mumbling]

300
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,916
[MATSUOKA] Sorry, I didn't
understand a word.

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,333
Listen.

302
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,875
I'm not saying you have to
be the perfect role model.

303
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,541
It's actually better for
your career if people

304
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,041
see that you have
flaws like them.

305
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,541
Do the fans want perfection?

306
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,625
No, they want an
idol who's relatable.

307
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,708
Now, about the show--

308
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,875
Hey, Matsuoka!

309
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,916
Hello, Sacchy!

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,750
Wait, I wasn't done
talking to you!

311
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,583
Havin' a good day?

312
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,500
It's been going great.
That is, until now.

313
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Uh-- Ah.

314
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,416
Well, if she's not
into high fives...

315
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,666
[MATSUOKA]
Listen up!

316
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,083
I have some plans I
need to run by you two.

317
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,875
Sachiko's our biggest
star right now.

318
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,041
She's got a fan base.

319
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,250
And that's exactly what
Laito needs to build.

320
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,750
She needs to be exposed
to a wider audience.

321
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,208
You understand?

322
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,500
Which is the reason
why we've planned

323
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,416
a double concert for you.

324
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,666
[BOTH]
Double concert?

325
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,708
You heard me.

326
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Together, you'll
be "Search Light"!

327
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,208
I'm gonna shoot
straight with you--

328
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,166
This is all about
boosting sales.

329
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,083
We're hoping that a double
ticket will do that.

330
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
So we'll both be on stage
performing songs together?

331
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,833
What? No way!

332
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,583
[MATSUOKA]
Sorry Sachiko, but Laito will be

333
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,375
headlining this
concert with you.

334
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,166
I need your support
to make this a success.

335
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,125
All I'm asking for is
a one-day collaboration.

336
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,791
But there will be a matinee
and an evening performance.

337
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,500
We need both shows to sell out.

338
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,750
After all, we're promoting it
as the concert of the year.

339
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,083
Are you in?

340
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,041
Well yeah, I guess so.

341
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,583
I'm excited!

342
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,666
[MATSUOKA] With good reason!
This is a big deal!

343
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,416
Hey, Sacchy! Are you pumped?

344
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,208
This is, like,
the coolest thing ever!

345
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,583
I can't wait to get
on that stage with you!

346
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,083
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,291
Huh?

348
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
Thing is, I sat down
and watched the video

349
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,666
of your last concert.

350
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,708
[HIKARI]
You did? That's so sweet of you!

351
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,500
What did you think?

352
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,708
[SACCHY] Honestly, it was
one of the worst I've seen.

353
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,083
It was a very sloppy performance
full of rookie mistakes.

354
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,500
Ah...

355
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,916
It's clear to me
that you don't take

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,666
being an idol seriously.

357
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,416
You come across overly
confident up on stage.

358
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,375
Almost smug-- It was bad.

359
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,375
[gasps]

360
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,375
That said.

361
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,208
I'll perform in
the double concert

362
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,041
because I take my job seriously.

363
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh. Okay, then.

364
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,000
Sacchy...

365
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,541
I've got lessons now.
I'll see ya.

366
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,916
Wait, don't go!

367
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,250
[SACCHY]
Sorry, Laito.

368
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,583
But you need to learn that
raw talent isn't enough.

369
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,666
You have to work
hard to succeed.

370
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,583
Something tells me you've never
had to work hard for anything.

371
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,958
What'd I do to make
Sacchy mad at me?

372
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,583
[MATSUOKA] I know how you can
win her over as a friend.

373
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,625
[HIKARI whines unintelligibly]

374
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,166
[MATSUOKA] I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

375
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,708
[whines louder]

376
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,083
[MATSUOKA]
Lemme explain, Laito.

377
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,125
Sachiko started out
with nothing.

378
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,750
She didn't have any powerful
connections to get ahead.

379
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,083
Nor did she have
amazing raw talent.

380
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,958
She pushed herself and
she never missed a lesson.

381
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,125
She started at the bottom
and she struggled to the top.

382
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,166
Sacchy had a dream,
and she worked hard

383
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,333
to make it a reality.

384
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,000
You can be just
as good as she is

385
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,458
if you train hard. Got it?

386
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,833
[HIKARI]
Yeah.

387
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,916
[COACH 7A]
One, two, three, four.

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,375
'Kay, I'm here to learn!

389
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,333
[COACH 7A]
That's enough for today.

390
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,458
I'll see you tomorrow.

391
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,875
[HIKARI yelps]

392
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,750
Do you mind if I stay and
practice a little longer?

393
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,791
Yeah! I'll stay, too!

394
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,041
[HIKARI] Unfortunately, Sachhy
hasn't said a word to me

395
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,833
since that day.

396
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,041
But, eventually, she'll notice

397
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,333
how hard I've been
working. She has to!

398
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,041
[AKANE]
Hey, um, Hikari?

399
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,041
If it's not a pain, could
you pretty, please get me

400
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,375
tickets to one of your
double concert shows?

401
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:24,916
Sure.

402
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,333
Oh, thank you!

403
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,041
And do you think, maybe,
you could take me backstage

404
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,041
and introduce me to... Sacchy?

405
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:31,833
[HIKARI]
Nope.

406
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,083
[AKANE whines]

407
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,541
[HIKARI] I can get you
tickets into the concert

408
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,958
but we can't hang
out or anything.

409
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,000
People can't find out
my true identity.

410
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,500
[HIKARI] I want to become
a great performer

411
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,958
based on my talent,
not because of who I am.

412
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,125
That'll earn me
Sacchy's respect.

413
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,333
Guess ya tried this time, huh?
'Cause that's an awesome score!

414
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,375
Whoa!

415
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,250
You're so smart, Hikari!

416
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,625
Ha!

417
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,458
We've only just begun to
tap into my true potential!

418
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,583
Hey, Sacchy? You should stop.

419
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,833
Don't wear yourself out
before the big concert.

420
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,166
True.

421
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,958
But I haven't nailed down
the choreography yet.

422
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,833
[SACCHY] I've gotta be
perfect and show Laito

423
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,458
that raw talent is no
match for hard work.

424
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,250
Whoa!

425
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,583
[SACCHY]
Hey, Sakurapa.

426
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,791
Yeah?

427
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,875
[SACCHY] I wanted you
to know that I'm not

428
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,375
going to sabotage
today's concerts.

429
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm not here to
hurt your career.

430
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,208
But I also won't be performing
to help increase your sales.

431
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,083
So I'll sing,
but I'll be doing it

432
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,416
for the fans out there.

433
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,791
I plan on giving them a
show they'll never forget.

434
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,500
Like a true idol would.

435
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,625
You're reading my
mind right now!

436
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,750
Let's go out on that stage
tonight and make this

437
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,750
the best concert that
they've ever seen!

438
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,250
Huh?

439
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,375
[SACCHY] I didn't expect that
kind of reaction from her.

440
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,375
Now I look like
the conceited jerk.

441
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,708
[AUDIENCE cheers]

442
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,791
[SACCHY, HIKARI]
Welcome to the show!

443
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,083
That was seriously awesome!

444
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,541
You two put on the best
concert I've ever seen!

445
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,750
[SACCHY]
Thank you.

446
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,000
We really gave it
our best out there.

447
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,041
[MATSUOKA]
And it showed!

448
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,083
Shoot for that
kind of performance

449
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,000
for the evening show!

450
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,333
Will do, sir.

451
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,666
That goes for you, too!

452
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,166
What? Oh. Yeah.

453
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Laito, were you listening?

454
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,625
No, I really wasn't.

455
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,166
--[MS. YAMAMOTO] Ah...
--[MATSUOKA] Uh-huh.

456
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,916
[AUDIENCE cheering]

457
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,833
[SACCHY] Two concerts in one day
is a lot harder than I thought.

458
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,208
I'm impressed with how well
Sakurapa is holding up.

459
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,125
She's really good.

460
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,541
You can tell that she's taking
these concerts seriously.

461
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,833
But what happens
to me when someone

462
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,791
with her talent
puts in the effort?

463
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,083
I have to try harder.

464
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,125
I have to be better
than her! I have to!

465
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,875
[SACCHY yelps]

466
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,291
No! Sacchy!

467
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,500
[SACCHY whimpers]

468
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,166
[HIKARI] Do you think
you'll ever walk again?

469
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,333
What're you talking about?

470
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,333
I just sprained it!
I'm gonna be fine.

471
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,500
I understand. Thank you, Doc.

472
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,750
Hey, Sachiko, bad news.

473
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,000
[BOTH gasp]

474
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,166
You can't go back on stage.

475
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,250
You could risk permanent
damage to your ankle.

476
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,625
[SACCHY]
What? That's crazy!

477
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,041
You can't stop me
from performing!

478
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,291
I can!

479
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,083
I won't have you risking
the rest of your career!

480
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,708
Sacchy, please listen to me.
Don't try to fight me on this.

481
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,125
As for you, Laito.

482
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,875
The show must go on.

483
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,250
I need you to go and finish
the concert by yourself.

484
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,333
Huh?

485
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,583
[MATSUOKA]
I know it's a lot to ask,

486
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,541
but you've proven
yourself today.

487
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,166
Please, Laito.

488
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,041
[HIKARI]
Okay.

489
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,125
[gasps]

490
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,583
Let's do this!

491
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:45,083
Hey, guys! Sorry about
the short delay!

492
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,458
Let's get this concert
back on track!

493
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,125
Who wants to hear some music?

494
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,750
All right! Then I'm
gonna kick it off with--

495
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,916
[grunts]

496
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,750
[HIKARI giggles]
I'm so clumsy!

497
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,625
[AUDIENCE laughs]

498
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,375
[HIKARI] I'm excited to sing our
new song for you. It's called:

499
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,416
"Follow The Search Light!"

500
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:19,000
[singing in Japanese]

501
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,875
I hope you're watching, Sacchy!

502
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,250
[gasps]

503
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,125
[HIKARI] The fans and I sure
do miss you out here!

504
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,958
I need to apologize
for the mean things

505
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,291
I've said to you.

506
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,708
I was so focused on trying
to show you up, that--

507
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,166
I forgot the fans.

508
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,208
What? You have no
reason to apologize.

509
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,166
You were right, I wasn't
giving it my all.

510
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,166
[SACCHY] I gotta admit,
you put on a wonderful show.

511
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,666
You think so? I mean,
I took that tumble.

512
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,125
No big, you made it look good.

513
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,416
Oh, really? Thank you, Sacchy!

514
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,916
I can tell you had fun and
that's what's important.

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,416
Yup.

516
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,791
Idols don't have to be perfect
to put on a good concert.

517
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,375
You've just gotta
have fun out there.

518
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,125
'Cause that's what
the fans wanna see.

519
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,500
At least I think so.

520
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,500
That's what Mr. Matsuoka
always tells me.

521
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,083
Right?

522
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,250
I misjudged you. I'm sorry.

523
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,416
You're gonna be an awesome idol.

524
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,208
[gasps]

525
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,708
And...

526
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,625
Well, um-- I feel silly asking
after the way I've acted--

527
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,083
But would you be willing
to be my rival and friend?

528
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,000
Because that would
make me really happy.

529
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:47,416
[gasps, shrieks]
It's all I've ever wanted!

530
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
We'll be best friends
forever and together,

531
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,541
we'll rise to the top of
the entertainment industry!

532
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,416
Are you ladies okay?

533
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,625
What's up?

534
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,791
[MATSUOKA]
Oh, um.

535
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,208
There seems to be
an intruder backstage

536
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,666
peeping into the dressing rooms.

537
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,000
How'd they get back here?

538
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,250
I dunno!

539
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,875
The intruder moved so
fast it was almost like

540
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,250
they could defy gravity.

541
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,458
Our security guards
couldn't even

542
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,458
get close enough to catch 'em.

543
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,041
Did you say gravity?!

544
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,833
[TERU] I'm Teru, third son of
the Sakurada royal family.

545
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,333
That's T-E-R-U.

546
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,250
[SATSUKI]
Teru's a bit of a daredevil.

547
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,291
Needless to say, I spend
a lot of time worrying

548
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,291
about the little guy.

549
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,875
[TERU]
What?!

550
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,500
[SATSUKI] If Teru were to become
king, he wouldn't think twice

551
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,666
about risking his life
to save his people.

552
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,458
What's your campaign
slogan again, dear?

553
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,375
[TERU] I will protect this
country and its citizens

554
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,916
with my own two fists!

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,458
How could you ever forget
that awesome slogan?

556
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,416
And, just to remind
everyone, Napoleon was

557
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,916
the coolest king ever.

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,541
Don't forget to get out on
election day and vote for me!
