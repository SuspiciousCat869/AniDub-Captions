You've been walking

I'm living a dream.

I know it's silly, but
sometimes I get so scared.

And what about his fangirls?
Will they still root for him?

160
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,541
because I had to be honest.

161
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,250
But if doing that is
somehow holding him back...

162
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,750
It's not worth it.

163
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,375
[AKANE] I've never really
thought about it, but--

164
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,166
It's gotta be tough
for normal people

165
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,750
to hang around with a
member of the royal family.

166
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,708
[gasps]

167
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,750
Ah! Nothing. Just.

168
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,916
Well, are we almost there?

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,083
Ah! Yeah! We're super close.

170
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,791
It's around this
next corner, I swear!

171
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,583
[WAITRESS 8A]
I'm so sorry, ladies.

172
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,791
But I'm afraid we're
suddenly very busy.

173
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,625
All we have available
are seats on the patio.

174
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,166
If you wouldn't mind
waiting for a bit,

175
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,041
we'll gladly put something
together for you.

176
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,291
Oh, no! Please!

177
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,625
Don't go out of your
way for us. We're good.

178
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,083
[AKANE]
It's another challenge.

179
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,166
If I wanna be king, I'm gonna
have to talk in front of

180
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,166
way bigger crowds than this.

181
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,791
People will see me
eat as they walk by.

182
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,083
I can do this!

183
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,916
What are you talking about?

184
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,791
[SATO] Sounds like it's
tough for you guys, too.

185
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,875
Still, the way you're
trying to show everyone

186
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,625
who you really are is admirable.

187
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,666
[AKANE]
Huh?

188
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,125
I could never do
anything like that.

189
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,625
I don't have the
courage to stand up

190
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,375
and make people take notice.

191
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,708
That's why I was so
surprised when your brother

192
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,583
remembered me, even though
he hadn't seen me

193
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,708
since the fourth grade.

194
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,708
I mean, there are people
who were in my class

195
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,708
just last year who still
have no idea who I am.

196
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,333
But he remembered.

197
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,166
And I fell head
over heels for him!

198
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,708
Wow. That's all it took?

199
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,166
It's Princess Akane!
What's she having?

200
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,541
Lemme see!

201
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,875
[WOMAN 8A] I'm gonna order
one of those right now!

202
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,083
[MAN 8A]
Make it two!

203
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,916
I thought this patio
suddenly felt crowded.

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,333
I'm sorry about this.

205
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,875
You were so sweet to
invite me out with you.

206
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,041
It isn't fun, but this is
what it's like to be a royal.

207
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,875
Wait, what are
you talking about?

208
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,666
It a hassle to go out anywhere.

209
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,958
And when you do go out,
it's virtually impossible

210
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,708
to get any privacy.

211
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,083
If you don't like
being in the spotlight,

212
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,291
then you'll have
to deal with that

213
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,833
before you can marry my brother

214
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,125
Marry? Whoa!

215
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,791
Who said anything
about marriage?

216
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,166
We haven't even been on
our first date yet, silly!

217
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,125
Uh...

218
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,666
Ah-- What do you say we dig in?

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,791
Sounds like a plan to me!

00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,041

inside the café.

Hey, everyone!

My name is Hana Sato and I've
got an important announcement!

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,583
You don't know me
but I'm a classmate

237
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,250
and friend of the eldest prince!

238
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,166
I decided to step it up
a notch. That's right!

239
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,750
I confessed my feelings
to Prince Shu Sakurada!

[CROWD gasping]

He's not the type
to rush into things,

242
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,541
so we're going slow.
Well, for now.

243
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,250
But when the election's
over, he will be mine!

244
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,750
You bet I'm gonna
date that prince

245
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,833
and after that,
I'm gonna marry him!

[CROWD cheers]

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,916
[AKANE] You saved me today.
Two times, in fact.

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,916
I promise I'll pay you
back for the clothes.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,541
Please. I was happy
to help you out.

250
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,291
Ah. I can't believe it.

251
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,625
Once I started talking,
I couldn't stop myself.

252
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,791
I hope he doesn't turn around
and dump me over this.

253
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,708
[AKANE]
I don't think that'll happen.

254

If I were him, I'd be flattered.

255
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,875
Earlier today, you told me that

256
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,083
you weren't very
brave or confident.

257
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,708
But you're confident about
your feelings for Shu.

258
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,166
What you did was brave!

259
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,958
Do you think so?

260
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Yeah, I do.

00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,333

good care of him?

Seriously, he likes you.

My idiot brother's always
going on at home about

267

[SATO] But when the election's
over, he will be mine!

268
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,208
You bet I'm gonna date
that prince, and after that,

269
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,583
I'm gonna marry him!

271
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,333
Are you okay with this?

272
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,916
Uh.

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,041
I guess it's fine, as long as
she's cool with announcing it.

274
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,541
I was asking what you
thought about it, you idiot.

275
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,875
What?

276
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,125
[HIKARI] I'm glad the
Break Out's finally over.

00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,833
It's good to be back
at my real age.

What did I say to
deserve this, Kanade?

You're hurting me! Cut it out!

I just wanna know
why you're upset! Ow!

283
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,375
[SOICHIRO] So here's a story
for you, a little tale

284
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,166
set right around the time
I entered high school.

285
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,500
Yours truly, Soichiro
Sakurada, king of the realm,

286
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,375
was allowed to attend a normal
school with normal kids,

287
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,750
despite some rather
strenuous objections.

288
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,958
There was one big problem

289
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,583
with this arrangement,
though. I was alone.

290
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,625
I hadn't made a real
connection with anyone,

291
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,166
much less any kind of friend.

292
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,250
Freaks me out.

293
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,958
[SOICHIRO] Is that contempt?
Fear? No, more like dread.

294
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,916
I might as well get used to it.

295
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,625
As long as I'm king,
I'll always be an outsider.

296
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,541
That's just the way it goes.

297
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,250
Of course, the personal maid
doesn't help matters.

298
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
Who's gonna come up and
talk to me with her looming

299
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,750
over my shoulder all the time?

300
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,708
Hey, Sowa?

301
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,750
My liege?

302
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,083
I don't think you're
allowed in here.

303
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,750
I didn't realize you were
going to the restroom!

304
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,458
I'm so sorry, I'll wait
outside, Your Majesty!

305
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,833
[SOICHIRO] As both my royal
caretaker and bodyguard,

306
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,791
Sowa is truly something special.

307
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,916
She's always been devoted
to her duties and gladly

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
placed her trust in me.

309
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
But it was hard to
make friends with her

310
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,875
at my heels 24 hours a day.

311
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,083
As if my classmates
weren't terrified enough.

312
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,250
I felt kinda bad about
it, but I ditched her

313
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,041
whenever I got the chance.

314
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,958
In fact, that was the
17th time I'd done it.

315
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,958
You'd think she'd have
caught on by then.

316
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,000
[SOICHIRO] That day, I decided
to check out the roof.

317
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,666
Ah.

318
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,583
[gasps]

319
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,958
[SOICHIRO]
I've never seen her before.

320
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,916
Why's she all the way up here?

321
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,166
[SOICHIRO]
There's a petal on her nose.

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,166
Whoa! Who in the heck are you?

323
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,958
[SOICHIRO] Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

324
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,208
I'm just a guy who tried to pick
a flower petal off your face.

325
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,125
[SATSUKI]
Yeah right, like I believe that.

326
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,416
Just admit it, you were trying
to sneak a peek, weren't ya?

327
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,208
No.

328
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,208
I promise I would never do

329
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,666
anything like that
to you, I swear.

330
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,291
Okay. Good!

331
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
What, am I not cute enough
for you or something?

332
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,166
[SOICHIRO]
I didn't mean it like that!

333
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,208
[SOICHIRO]
Man, girls are confusing.

334
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,708
Well, you're in luck.

335
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,291
'Cause I know just how
you can make it up to me.

336
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,291
[SOICHIRO]
What do you have in mind?

337
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,708
[SATSUKI]
Shopping.

338
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,916
[SOICHIRO] Um. Sure. Wait,
you mean like, right now?

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,291
[SATSUKI]
When did you think?

340
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
Don't you have classes?

341
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,250
I'm skipping.

342
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,833
It's a good thing I caught you.

343
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,666
I actually have a lot
to pick up today.

344
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,458
[SOICHIRO] My royal superpower
allows me to see emotions.

345
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,000
They usually appear
to me as a colored aura.

346
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:56,000
But this girl was a mystery--
completely colorless.

347
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,125
Why doesn't she light up

348
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,791
with the same fear
that the others do?

349
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,125
What're you staring at me for?

350
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,916
Or do you gawk at
every girl that way?

351
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,750
No, of course not.
I'm sorry about that.

352
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,041
Why the heck is she
buying so much food?

353
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
Is she cooking for
an army, or what?

354
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,666
Sounds good. Nice to
see you with a boy.

355
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
He's nothing more
than my packhorse.

356
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,208
Hey, Packhorse,
ain't I seen you before?

357
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,666
I don't think so.
Just one of those faces.

358
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,916
I'll say.

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
You look just like
every other bozo in town.

360
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,333
[laughs in monotone]

361
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,583
[SATSUKI] The sun's setting.
When did it get so late?

362
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
Guess you might as well
come in and join us.

363
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,583
[gasps]

364
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,916
Something wrong?

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,875
So this is just the entryway
to your home, right?

366
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,416
No, this is the whole house.

367
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,708
[ALL gasping]

368
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,833
[SATSUKI'S KID BROTHER]
Who is this girl

369
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,708
and what has she
done with my sister?

370
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,375
She would never
bring home a boy!

371
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,875
[SATSUKI]
Shut up, you little twerp.

372
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,375
It's nice to meet you.

373
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,375
You're more than welcome

374
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,958
to join us for dinner,
if you'd like.

375
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,625
They're cooking it up right now.

376
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,458
Thank you very much.

377
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,041
[SATSUKI'S TEEN SISTER]
C'mon, you can tell me!

378
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,291
Is he your boyfriend or what?

379
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,458
[SATSUKI]
Not even a little.

380
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,375
Wow, Mister, you're really tall!

381
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,541
[SOICHIRO]
Hm?

382
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,375
You gotta tell me how
you got like that!

383
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,875
[SOICHIRO]
Curiosity, anticipation.

384
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,583
I've never seen these colors.

385
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,125
Well, you know--

386
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,041
All I did was eat right and get
plenty of sleep growing up.

387
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,083
For real? I could
totally do that!

388
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,708
[ALL]
Thank you for the food!

389
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,875
Do you cook your family
dinner every night?

390
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
[SATSUKI] Both our parents
work, so I pick up the slack

391
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,625
whenever they come home late.

392
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,000
That's very impressive.

393
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,666
[SATSUKI] My little sisters
help out with the prep,

394
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,708
so I can't take all the credit.

395
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,958
[SATSUKI'S TEEN SISTER]
She's being modest.

396
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,875
Her specialty is the
simmered taro dish,

397
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,916
so you gotta make
sure you try it.

398
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
You've got some talent!

399
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,916
Thanks.

400
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Whoa, I've never seen
your cheeks so red before!

401
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,166
[SATSUKI]
Pipe down and eat your rice!

402
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,250
The omelette you made
is really good, too!

403
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,791
[SATSUKI]
Glad you like it.

404
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,708
Uh-oh, you've got food on your
cheek, I'll get it for you.

405
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,916
Some more rice, please!

406
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,250
There are lots of other

407
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
yummy foods in the world,
y'know! Here try this!

408
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,416
[SATSUKI'S KID BROTHER]
You know I hate carrots!

409
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,666
[SATSUKI'S TEEN BROTHER]
Open wide and say "ah."

410
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,666
[SOICHIRO chuckles]

411
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,458
[SATSUKI] Wait a sec.
Did you call your home

412
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,875
to let them know where you are?

413
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,625
Yeah. At least,
I tried to call Sowa.

414
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,541
Who?

415
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,500
[SOICHIRO] She's my guardian.
I know, weird, right?

416
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,375
My mom passed away
when I was a little kid

417
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,250
and my dad died
a few years back.

418
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,583
So now she sort of
takes care of me.

419
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,416
I miss them a lot, but
I've got plenty of people

420
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,291
looking out for me,
so I never feel alone.

421
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,583
Still. I don't have any
siblings of my own.

422
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,125
Let's play a card game!

423
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,250
[SOICHIRO] They might get on
your nerves, but I kinda feel

424
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,000
like I've missed out, you know?

425
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,083
I can't do it alone!

426
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,291
[SATSUKI'S TEEN BROTHER]
I've got my own!

427
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,666
[SATSUKI'S KID SISTER]
I can help you out!

428
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,375
[SOICHIRO] It must be
wonderful to have a family.

429
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,208
[SATSUKI'S KID SISTER]
Yay!

430
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
[SATSUKI]
Yeah, it is.

431
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,375
Thank you for having me.

432
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,541
Whatever.

433
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,083
[SOICHIRO]
By the way. Do you always nap

434
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,708
on the roof during lunch?

435
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,958
Well, I wouldn't say always.
It's better when it's sunny.

436
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,125
Hey!

437
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,291
You better not steal
my secret nap spot!

438
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,708
I wouldn't dream of it.

439
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,333
Oh, that reminds me,
I never introduced myself.

440
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,708
I'm Satsuki Shinonome,
second year.

441
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,375
[gasps] Oh, I'm
just a first year.

442
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,625
You can call me Soichiro--

443
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,875
[SATSUKI]
You're Sakurada, right?

444
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,083
[gasps]

445
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,875
Well, it was nice having
you over for dinner,

446
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,166
"Your Majesty."

447
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,791
[gasps] You knew
this whole time?

448
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,666
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

449
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,208
[SOWA whimpering]

450
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,416
Where have you been,
Your Majesty?

451
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,541
Don't worry, I'm fine.

452
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,208
You're too kind.
Some guardian I am.

453
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,000
Who keeps watch outside
a bathroom for hours

454
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,875
before realizing you
aren't in there anymore?

455
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,125
My lord.

456
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,375
I wasn't even able to
ensure you had a healthy

457
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,083
and nutritious dinner tonight!

458
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,583
[SOICHIRO]
Tell me something, Sowa.

459
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,375
Do you think tomorrow
will be sunny?

460
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,458
[gasps] I'll find out
the forecast for you

461
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,541
right this moment!

462
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,750
[HIKARI]
Whoa! Have you seen this one?

463
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,750
Daddy and Shu could be twins!

464
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,500
Your old man was
a handsome king!

465
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,916
Despite what certain
shopkeepers said!

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,416
That's right.

467
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,000
You'd already been sitting
on the throne for a few years

468
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,000
by the time you were Shu's age.

469
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,708
He's a lazy king!

470
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,291
Didn't I ask you to
tidy up before dinner?

471
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,166
My mistake. I'm sorry, honey.

472
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,375
Guess your title doesn't
count for much with Mom.

473
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,375
[laughs] My crown
doesn't make me

474
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,166
any less of a normal person.

475
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,208
Matter of fact, normal happiness
beats a crown any day.

476
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,916
Your mom's the one
who taught me that.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,833
Hey, Dad.

478
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,708
[SOICHIRO]
Hm?

479
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,041
You're right.

480
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,041
You warned us being a
member of the royal family

481
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,750
would never be easy, 'cause
we're always in the public eye.

482
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,541
Leaving the house
becomes a production.

483
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,583
And we're expected to smile
and wave at the crowds

484
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,583
who follow us around.
It can be tough.

485
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,958
So, were you scared?

486
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,833
Knowing you would ask
Mom to live that way?

487
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
To put up with so much.

488
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,041
[SOICHIRO]
Not for a moment.

489
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,916
She was the driving
force when it came to

490
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,500
living in the public eye.
Her courage made me brave.

491
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,500
She'd warn me

492
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,041
whenever people
were watching us.

493
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,375
Then she'd force me
to smile and wave.

494
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,916
A lesson I'm glad I learned.

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,458
I wouldn't be the
king I am today

496
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,958
if it weren't for your mother.

497
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,875
The only reason I smile
and laugh the way I do

498
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,500
is because she taught me how.

499
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,875
And I'll spend the
rest of my life

500
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,458
trying to repay her for that.

501
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,916
That's why there's nothing
more important to me

502
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,708
as a man and a king, than
keeping my family happy.

503
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,416
Thank you, Dad.

504
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,916
[SATO] Why would Shu
ask me to the roof?

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,916
Is it about my overdramatic
speech at the café?

506
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,458
Did I ruin everything?

507
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
[SHU]
Hey!

508
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,083
Would you mind coming up here?

509
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,458
[SHU]
Sato.

510
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,666
[SATO]
Yeah?!

511
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,333
Let's talk.

512
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,416
I never thought for one second
that I would actually

513
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,416
want to be king.

514
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,333
Huh?

515
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,791
It just didn't matter to me.

516
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,041
Probably because I've
watched Kanade work so hard

517
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,625
in her campaigning to wear
the crown for my sake.

518
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,875
Uh. What are we talking about?

519
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,333
I've been thinking about it,

520
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,958
and I've decided to follow
in my father's footsteps.

521
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,833
[SATO] He does wanna
end things with me!

522
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,666
He's going for the crown and
he thinks I'll hold him back!

523
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,041
But how can he break up with me

524
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,083
when we aren't even
officially going out?

525
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,291
I mean, we talked about it--

526
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,708
[SHU] There's something
I need to tell you!

527
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,583
[SATO gasps]

528
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,625
What the--?

529
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,208
Whoa, where did you take us?

530
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,291
I thought for sure the
Break Out was over by now.

531
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,500
[SATO]
He's gonna break up with me

532
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,958
and then leave me in
this frigid wasteland!

533
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,125
Sato!

534
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,500
Would you please
just listen to me?

535
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,166
It's done, okay? We're
over. Now let me go!

536
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,041
[gasps]

537
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,083
[SATO] I'll do my best
to try and forget about

538
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,666
my feelings for you.

539
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,083
When we were little,
I liked you so much.

540
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,750
And I'm happy we had
a chance to try.

541
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,166
We talked and you
walked me home.

542
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,666
It was like a dream come true.
But it wasn't meant to be.

543
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,833
I'm not worthy of
a prince's love.

544
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,291
I'd keep you from doing
incredible things.

545
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,083
I couldn't live with
myself if I held you back!

546
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
I'm sorry.

547
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,208
Guess I was wrong.

548
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,333
I was worried that
you couldn't handle

549
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,750
the glare of the spotlight.

550
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,250
[SATO]
Huh?

551
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,791
[SHU] But you stood up in
front of a crowd of strangers

552
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,750
and told them all
how you feel about me,

553
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,791
so now I have to know--

554
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,708
Know what? Please.

555
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,416
If I do win this election,
will you stay with me?

556
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,958
[SATO gasps]

557
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,291
[SHU]
Please?

558
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,958
I told you I'd share my
feelings with you someday.

559
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,000
I like you, too, Hana.

560
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,458
[SATO]
I'm so happy.

561
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,333
Oh, Shu.

562
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,416
I'm freezing.

563
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,833
[yelps]

564
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,541
Hana! Snap out of it!

565
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,875
[SHU] I'm Shu, the
eldest Sakurada son.

566
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,041
[SATSUKI] My Shu is the
spitting image of his dad

567
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,208
at his age and shares
his sense of wonder,

568
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,500
and the way he sees the world!

569
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,750
[SHU]
Well, he is my father.

570
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,625
[SATSUKI] Plus, he's got
an adorable girlfriend,

571
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,625
who cares for him very much!
You two are so cute!

572
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,583
[SATSUKI] If Shu is elected
your king, he'll rule

573
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,833
with wisdom and pride,
delegating what he can

574
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,916
so he can focus
on the big issues!

575
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Go ahead and tell them your
campaign slogan, sweetie.

576
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,000
[SHU] It's simple:
"I'm going to make our country

577
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,583
a bright and peaceful place."

578
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,958
The election's coming up soon.

579
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,708
I'll do all I can
earn your votes!
