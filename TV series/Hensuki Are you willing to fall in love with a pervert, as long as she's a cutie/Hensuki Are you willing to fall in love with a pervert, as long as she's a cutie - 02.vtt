[SAYUKI]
Previously, on Hensuki!

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Undierella left me her
panties and a love letter.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.056 position:50% align:center
Now I have to
find out who she is.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
Possible suspects
include Sayuki Tokihara,

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
Yuika Koga, and Mao Nanjo.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
My investigation
lead me to Sayuki,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
but when I confronted her...

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] I'm sorry.
Did you say "Undierella"?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
Please make me your pet, Keiki!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Slow down, sister!

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
What exactly do
you mean by "pet"?!

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Just what it sounds like.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
I want you to own me,
and treat me like an animal.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Wow, perfect.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
You rephrased it and
I'm still completely lost.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?
I want you to be my master!

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I just don't
know what that means!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
You said you were
surprised, but not put off.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
That there was nothing bad
about it and you didn't hate me.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
Right? Though I never
would have expected you

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
to figure out my secret.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
You realized I'm a hardcore,
masochistic pervert.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI yelps]

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] And... You were
more aggressive than I ever

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
could have hoped for.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
No! Sayuki, control yourself!

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
There's no way Keiki would ever
approve of how depraved you are!

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
But maybe then,
he'll discipline you for it!

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, how I've dreamed of
becoming your possession

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
so you could punish
me all night long!

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center
When we saw that dog...

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.289 position:50% align:center
That's right. I was
envious of the dog,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.166 position:50% align:center
being scolded by his master.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
"Must be nice.
I want to be leashed up

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
and treated like a dog, too."

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Is this real life?!

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.713 position:50% align:center
So once more...

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, please
make me your pet, master!

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Or we could, like, not?

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
Hey, Kiryu.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
Hi, Ms. Okita. Good morning.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.106 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
Nice job with the club room.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you were
able to get it so clean.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
One thing, though.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hm?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.157 position:50% align:center
I went to check your work
after you'd already left,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.201 position:50% align:center
and you had forgotten
to lock the door.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
Remember to next time, okay?

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] That's weird.
I swear I locked it.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] So you think that
Undierella was hiding somewhere

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
in the room with you when
you found the love letter?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It adds up.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
She pretended to go
home like the other girls.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
Then, during the ten
or so minutes I was gone,

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
snuck back in.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.390 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] When she heard
my footsteps approaching

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
down the hall, she hid in
the room so she wouldn't

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
be seen leaving it.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Score!

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
I follow you.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
You locked the door and left,
then she opened it

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
from the inside, and left
before Ms Okita stopped by.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
Okay. So, that means
we can't assume that

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
the last person to leave
the club room did it anymore.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Now Undierella could
be any of the girls.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Tokihara's no longer
the prime suspect.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
You're right...

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, how was
your investigation into her?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
Kinda wild. I talked to her,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
but didn't learn enough
to say one way or the other.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
So it goes.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
Shoma.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
Have you ever fantasized
about turning a girl

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
into your pet before?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
you're into that now?

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
I promise that's
not why I'm asking.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
I won't kink shame.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
As you may know, I'm
a pursuer of the petite.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
If I started saying
I wanna make a girl

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
half my size my pet,

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
I'd probably start getting
some unsavory looks.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
You're right. Forget it.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I can't
read those girls.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
Whoever's Undierella is
making it hard to figure out.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] I say investigate
the other two,

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
like you did Tokihara.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No arguments there.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What's up?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
So, uh... Thanks
a lot for yesterday.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
Me and Sayuki are back
on speaking terms,

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
thanks to your advice.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
Awesome. Glad to hear it.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It's still totally possible

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
--that Nanjo is Undierella.
--[gasps]

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
Agh! Come on, not again!
Why is pinching your go-to move?

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to
bring it back on time.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA gasps]

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I totally zoned out!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's fine.
You're probably just tired.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA gasps]
I should go put these away, too.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good idea, go for it!

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back, one sec!

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
Man, she's great.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
Always so endearing
and considerate.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
--[SAYUKI] That's true.
--[KEIKI grunts]

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
Between that cute
little chest and her gold locks,

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
she's a catch.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
--Phoo...
--[screams]

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Oh, my!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
I should prank you more often
if you react like that.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
And what do you want, anyway?

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
--To blow in your ear, duh.
--Yeah, why?!

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
Because I'm bored?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're evil! Don't try
to scare me when I'm working.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Are you mad?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I don't like being
messed with out of boredom.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
That's unfortunate.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
It looks like this disobedient
mutt has angered her master.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
You should probably punish her.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
Torment me as you see fit.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
I only ask that you be
as cruel as possible!

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
Is this why you came here?

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
I was waiting around
for you to come see me.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
So when you didn't,
I came to you!

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
You realize you're pressing
your boobs against me?!

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't sweat the small stuff.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
Find me one person
who would consider

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
your boobs "small stuff"!

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
--[SAYUKI giggles]
--Don't you get closer!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Do I have to remind you?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] You're in a library,
so be quiet, please.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
Oh, look. Koga's back already.
How are you doing?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Cut the crap. Aren't you
a being a little handsy?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
What's the problem?
Keiki's my underclassmen and--

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
Well, he's my upperclassmen,
and we're close, too!

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
--Can we not do this?
--Hah! Koga, you have no idea.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
He and I have just
recently become far closer

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
than you could even imagine.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
--No, we haven't!
--And what does that mean?

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
--The two of us went on a date.
--[YUIKA] Wha--?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
He bought me a parfait
at the café by the station!

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI groans]
--Huh. Fine, then. I get it.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yuika. You're not mad, are you?

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Let's assume for
a second that I was.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
Why do you think that would be?

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Um... Because
you wanted a parfait, too?

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Huh?

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center

Or...

[YUIKA]
You're so stupid!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What'd I do?!

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Okay, that was
all on you, buddy.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
You're so dumb sometimes.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
But what did I do?!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Could you, like, leave now?

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
You're disturbing
the students here.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
You don't have to be so rude.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
And after all we did together?

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
We didn't do anything!

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
There!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
But you held my
unwilling body down

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
--and violently had
--Whoa! Stop!

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
--your way with me!
--Whoa! Stop!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
That was my first time,
too, so I was frightened!

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
What the hell did I just hear?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
Nothing! I just
slammed a dumb wall!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center
--[YUIKA] Mm-hmm...
--Besides...

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
I have every
right to use the library.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
I should go study up!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
You're never too experienced
to learn new things!

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Was that a dog training book?

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I've got a question for you.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh... Fire away.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Did you really go on
a date with that witch?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh! I wouldn't say that!

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
More like she forced me
to buy her dessert.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
That's a date.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
Right. I know it was.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Next question:

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
Did you corner her assertively,
perhaps using a wall?

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, that? Yeah. I guess.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
--How filthy.
--"Filthy"?!

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
One last question:

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
Are you two officially
seeing each other?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
What? Why do you care?

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
Don't think I haven't
noticed how nice you are

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
to her all the time.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
You clean her mess,
tell her to go home early

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
because she looks tired,

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
and now you're going
on dates with her.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
Lately, I feel like all you
talk about is that witch.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Is there anything I can
do to make you feel better?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Take me out, too!

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
How's this Sunday?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It's still up in the air.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
Yuika could be Undierella.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
I mean, she wants
to go on a date.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Is everything okay?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI yelps]

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
A date, huh? And with Yuika?

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I can't
figure out why she asked.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
I don't have
much experience, but...

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
I doubt a girl would
ask a boy out

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
if she didn't have
thing for him.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Do you have
any dating experience?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
Well then. It's lucky
you have me here

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
to teach you how
to treat a girl right!

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Step one!

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
Wherever you decide to
meet, get there early.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI mumbling]

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Hey, Keiki! Sorry I'm late!

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're not late!
I'm just... early.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Step two.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Make sure to compliment
her outfit and her hair

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
if she did it.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
You okay?

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
Uh... Totally!

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
I've just never seen
you in anything

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
but your school uniform before.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Does it look good?

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts] It's really cute!
And your hair looks great, too!

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
[gasps, giggles]

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
Glad I put in the effort, then.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Mizuha. I owe you one.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
She's glowing
thanks to your help!

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
You ready?
I expect you to pamper me!

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! I've got
our day all planned out.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling
you're gonna like it.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Whoa!

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
It feels like I haven't been to
a movie theater in forever.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
What are we seeing?

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Hmm... You'll find
out when it starts. Okay?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
Ho-ho. A surprise?
Wonder what it could be.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Just be patient.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
May I take your hand and
guide you to the theater?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
And if you'd close
your eyes until we get there,

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
that'd be wonderful.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
Okay. And I
promise I won't peek.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Step three. Take the lead!

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
And maybe even
try holding her hand!

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well... Here we are.

My lord.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
[KING] But... How do
our enemies compare?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
And... Are we better?

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center

[SUBJECT 02B] We all know
the majesty's tendencies.

--[CROWD yelling]
--[SUBJECT 02 A] Here we go!

[YUIKA]
I can't believe you remembered.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well, were you surprised?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
Yeah. As much as
I hate to admit it, you won.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
I don't know what part of this
was a competition, but...

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Step four.
Get lunch at a fast food place.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
It's a relaxing,
easy environment.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
It was a pretty good movie.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah. It seemed like
it was gonna be pure comedy

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
the whole time, but by
the end, I was in tears.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
Weird how they pulled that off.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
And actually...

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
The plot was a little
different from the book.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
So I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wait, really? Cool.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
Now I want to read
the book, too.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] You can borrow
my copy if you want to.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Sure, thanks.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
That reminds me,
you're not really much of

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
a reader yourself,
are you, Keiki?

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Yeah, not really.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
I read manga though.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
So why'd you
become a student librarian?

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's actually
a pretty funny story.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
During my first year,
they tried to make the girl

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
sitting next to me do it.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
Of course, she had some
other important obligation.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
So I took her place
to help her out.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
That sounds
pretty damn wholesome.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Oh, shut up!

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
That's so you. And it's
a great quality to have.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Step five.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
Go shopping with her until
she's completely satisfied.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] We went to
so many different stores.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, and we bought nothing.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
The date's what's important,
not buying things. Right?

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
You know, you're
really thoughtful.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
You've got longer legs
and you're matching my pace.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
Well. Why wouldn't I?

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Step six.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
Actually, never mind.
I don't have to tell you that.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I guess if you're gonna
hang with an underclassmen,

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
you gotta be put together.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
This is my first
real date, so y'know.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
I dunno what I'm doing.
But I tried to prepare.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
It's your first?

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
In my book.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
What Sayuki says was
a date, really wasn't.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That's crazy!

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
That means I'm the first
girl you've been with!

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Hmm...

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I suppose that gets
you a passing grade, then.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Did you say something?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Oh. Never mind.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna run
to the bathroom quick!

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I'm on
a date with such a cute girl.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
I better not drop dead
tomorrow or something.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[MEN chuckle]

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She's taking a while.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02A]
You're super cute.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02B]
You hungry?

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02C]
Come on, let's hang out.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02A] Give us a shot,
you might have fun!

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02B] I'll buy you
somethin'. You want chocolate?

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02C] Are you seriously
ignoring us right now? Hello?

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02A] Yeah, why you
gotta be so standoffish?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
--We're just being nice.
--[KEIKI] Yuika!

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02B]
I'm starvin', aren't you?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
Let's go grab a parfait.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey!

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
--Keiki.
--[KEIKI] She's with me!

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.544 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02A]
We'll find another.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
[MAN 02B]
Let's just eat.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I'm really sorry.
I ruined our date.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
And we were having
such a good time.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.938 position:50% align:center
You're so pretty, I should
have been on the lookout

00:14:57.022 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
for jerks like those guys.
So, I'm sorry!

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA sighs]
Hey, you know what?

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
I think I see something
stuck in your hair.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
It's like some
massive piece of dust!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
What? Where? Are you for real?

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll get it.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
Just bend down.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
Did you...

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles]
That's thanks for saving me.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
You were great back there.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
My very own knight
in shining armor.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
Well, now you're
just exaggerating.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:34.142 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles] All right. Why
don't we start heading home now?

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
If you want.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I've had
my fill of fun today.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
Oh! There's one more thing I was
hoping we could do though.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm? Sure, anything.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
Anything? Great!

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]
Yuika.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Let's walk to
the station like this.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're pushing your
chest up against my arm.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I know. I don't mind. Do you?

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yes, very much!

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Really? Why?

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
Mine are a lot smaller
than the witch's.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
And you can't sweat
the small stuff!

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You heard that whole exchange?

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA snores]

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I later learned that
Yuika is only part Japanese.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
Her hair and eyes always
looked beautiful to me.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
But it caused other
people to push her away.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] She didn't seem to
care one way or the other.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.447 position:50% align:center
Maybe they found her
beauty intimidating.

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
Thought they couldn't
approach her.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
Hey, Koga, good to see you.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I didn't take the hint.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Yo, Koga. Whatcha reading today?

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] "The World's
Most Indecisive King"?

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
Weird title.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
Will you stop?
You're staring at me.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
that's kinda rude?

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh, sorry.
You're just very pretty.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
You're a strange guy, Kiryu.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
--You must really like that one.
--[KEIKI] Again.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
It reads like a comedy.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
But the funny dialogue
isn't the whole story.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
If you read between the
lines you can find a lot

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
of deeper meaning.

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
The humor actually foreshadows
a much more dramatic--

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
You really are a strange guy.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
And again.

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, I've read that book before.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
It's good, right?

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I kept talking to her.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Well, have you
ever heard of this one?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
You should check
out this book,

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling you'd like it.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
And slowly, over time,

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
the ice in her eyes
seemed to melt away.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kiryu!

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
I swear, you're
so strange, Keiki.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
If Yuika is Undierella,

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
would every day
be as nice as this?

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
Seriously, look at this girl.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
She's the cutest thing ever.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] So what you're saying
is that you have no idea

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
if Koga is Undierella, either.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
To be fair, I was
more focused on my date

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
than investigating.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
Can't blame you there.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
She's got a youthful
glow to her.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
I can understand why
you'd be so distracted.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah, well
the difference is I'm not

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
only interested
in girls like that.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
I feel that unfledged,

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
unrealized potential is
the apex of human existence.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
In that regard, Koga's perfect.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
[cell phone jingles]

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
It's her.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Ooh, speak of the devil.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh...

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] We have something
important to discuss.

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
Meet me in the storage room
in the library after school.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI (girly)] Hmm? This is
totally suspicious. Like, right?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA (girly)]
Oh, you know it, girl.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
She's, like, so gonna
confess to you.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI (girly)]
Like, OMG.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA (girly) giggles]
I'm so proud and so jealous.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI (girly)] But you get
so much more tail than me!

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA clears throat]

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
[normal] But seriously,
there's no reason

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
she couldn't be Undierella.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
What if she set this up
so she could tell you

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
the letter was hers?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI (girly)] Like...
What do I do if it's for real?

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
First, you stop doing that.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
Then... think about
how brave she's being.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
Sending this message at
all must have been tough.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] He's right. Even
the Indecisive King

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
mustered up some
courage in the end.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
I have to talk to Yuika.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI gasps]
Bad omen.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yuika?

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Keiki. I'm glad
you actually came.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
There's something
that I need to ask you.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
If you're willing to listen.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth...

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
...I've had this feeling,
that maybe you could be the one.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
You were so kind when
you taught me to be a librarian,

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
and even nicer on our date.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
Especially when you
saved me from those guys.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] You're just
a reliable, great person.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that maybe
you'd think I was the "one,"

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
for you, too.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
And so, here we are.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:08.208 position:50% align:center
Now what do you say?
Would you become my slave?

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Huh? I think
that came out weird.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
Did you just ask me to
become your "slave"?

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
Yup, that's exactly
what I asked!

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That was your one out!

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
Is that... a no, then?

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Not technically, no.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
Do you not like
the idea of being a slave to

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
a cute girl like me?

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't most guys go crazy
over something like that?

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI whimpers]

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Yeah, all that stuff
I've read can't be wrong.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
So what's the problem?

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
Am I not giving my little slave
enough treats to satisfy him?

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, that'll work!

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
If you agree
to become my plaything,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
I'll reward you with
something invaluable.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Like what?

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Whoa! What are you--

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles]
You're blushing. How adorable.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI whimpers]

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Here you go.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. What is this?

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Obviously freshly worn panties.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
They should make a guy happy.
I read about it online.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
Very specific types
of perverted guys!

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA growls]
Talking back to your master?

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Someone's being
a very naughty boy.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Hold on... Yuika?

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
I'm going
to have to punish you

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
until you learn your lesson.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunting]

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles]
Wow, look at that reaction!

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
You must really love my panties.

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
Ahh, this is wonderful.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
Look at you, being
dominated by a little girl,

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
with her panties in your mouth!

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
This is the greatest
view I could ask for!

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Just seeing you like
this is gonna make me explode!

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
But don't worry, Keiki.

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
I'll be very gentle
with your training.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.978 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll love it.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
Ah. Wait, Keiki? Hey, Keiki?

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.735 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Aw, balls.

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
This is where I die, isn't it?

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
Couldn't I have suffocated
on something else?

00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
[overlapping talking]

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:45.842 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Next time on Hensuki:

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.302 position:50% align:center
"Cinderella is Shy?"

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.763 position:50% align:center
Are you willing to love
her as long as she's cute?
