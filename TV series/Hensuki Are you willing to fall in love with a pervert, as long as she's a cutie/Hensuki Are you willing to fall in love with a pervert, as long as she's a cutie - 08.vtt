00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Frankly, I was
expecting something way worse

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
when she brought up
the animal foreplay,

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
but whatever this is,
it's not half bad.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Hey, Keiki?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
Ah, what do you want now?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
It's just that you'd make
this pupper extra thankful

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
if you rubbed her belly.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well, this is certainly a thing.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Go on, what are you waiting for?

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
Uh, 'kay!

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI giggling]

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
That tickles!

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Does it? Heh, heh.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] It's a little strange
letting someone caress my tummy.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
I'm a bit self-conscious.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
Um, do you want me to stop it?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Nope!

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
It's also very comforting.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
Please keep petting!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Roger that.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
I think I'm slowly beginning

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
to understand more
about canine psychology.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Care to explain?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
Because having you
pamper me like this

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
fills my heart and makes my
insides all warm and fuzzy.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
This must be why
doggies like it.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
A gentle touch reminds them how
much their masters love them.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
Not sure those dots connect,
but if you're saying

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
you feel satisfied,
I won't argue with that.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this?

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
Allow me to explain in terms
that you'll be able to grasp,

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
--or grope!

You're a boob guy, so I bet

you're feeling great
right now, huh?

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
What can I say?

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
It's... amazing.

I knew you'd understand!

[SAYUKI sighs]
You're such a cutie pie!

We don't have much,
but I made tea. Uh.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
Eh...

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
Emergency family
meeting right now!

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] I didn't know my
brother was such a pervert.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're wrong!
It's not what it looks like!

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
I wasn't doing anything bad,

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
I was only rubbing
her belly like a dog!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
That's cute, but doesn't sound
like a hobby you should defend.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Crap!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
The more I explain, the more
I keep digging my own grave!

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I had lots of fun today!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
And I feel like it took
a few years off my life.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
Having Mizuha see us made it
all the more exciting for me.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
Well, excuse me if I haven't

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
learned how to get off
from embarrassment like you.

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI giggles]

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
I'll see myself out.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
One last question.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.193 position:50% align:center
Why does it have to be me?

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
What?

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I know that
you're looking for someone

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
to treat you like
an animal and all,

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
but maybe there's someone
else better suited?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.621 position:50% align:center

own sense of pride.

You're the only one fit

Thanks for filling me
up with your love,

dirty magazine in sight.

to leave 'em out in the open.

admitting you own some?

No.

So, uh, why are you here again?

I'm here to discipline you!

Oh, right.

why you were trying
to get her panties off?

herself, out of the blue.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
and you're drowning in ecstasy!

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
[MAO cackles]

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
No way in hell!

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Fine! New topic!

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Earlier today,
did Tokihara and Yuika visit?

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]
You knew about that?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
They were making plans

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
and blabbing obnoxiously
in the clubroom.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Now I see.

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
These crimes were premeditated.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
I considered interfering,

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
but I'm cutting it dangerously
close with this deadline.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] That sounds like
business as usual for you.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
So, tell me,

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
did anything happen?

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh, lots of things
happened, all right,

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
and I'd rather not
reopen those wounds.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad I have nothing
serious to worry about.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI] Come again?
--[MIZUHA humming]

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Oh, nevermind.
I'm just relieved.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Okay...

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
By the way, Kiryu,

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
have you ever been in
a relationship before?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh? Where did that come from?

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
[MAO] I know you're super
single at the moment,

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
but did you have
a girlfriend in middle school?

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
I was alone. Chastity intact.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Gotcha.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
Hypothetically,
what if you dated...

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
...me?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Ha, JK.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI coughs]
You almost gave me a stroke!

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
Not cool, man, you shouldn't
joke around like that!

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Ooh. I made
your heart race, huh?

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Why are you so giddy about that?

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
I dunno what you mean!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
It's getting late! Good night!

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
[dial tone]

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
[MAO sighs]

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] That was
a pretty long phone call.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Nanjo was
feelin' talky I guess.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
Hey, Keiki?

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
Can you dry my hair?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. I don't mind.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
Really? You're sitting there?

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.202 position:50% align:center
I sit where I want!

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
Someone's demanding
a boatload of attention.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
It's my sisterly privilege
to be spoiled as I please.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
I'd better be careful and
respect your authority then.

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Yes! My wish is your command!

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whatever you say, Princess.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA sighs] There's been
so many surprises today.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
One a beauty, one a cutie,

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
both lookin' to get
some of your booty.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
Believe me, when I
first learned the truth,

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
I was shocked, too.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet you were.
Sounds like some funny rom-com.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
There's nothing funny about it.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
You could be
a master or a slave,

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
but honestly either
way you can't lose.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
Must be nice to have
all of these people

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
fighting over your
undivided attention.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nope, not really.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Deviant life suits you.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
After all, it's a bit twisted
how much you dote on me.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
I'm just being
a good big brother!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
Okay. Finished.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Thanks a bunch.

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, are you upset?

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Upset? Not at all.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
Don't forget you
were mine first, okay?

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
I just wanna sleep.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What the...?

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
[gasps] How?

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Undierella's undies...

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
They're gone!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
[dog howls]

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Both Tokihara and Koga

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
paid a visit to your
house this weekend.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
And at some point when you
stepped out of the room,

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
the evidence disappeared
into thin air.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
What's that tell us?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
It's settled.

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
Clearly my Undierella has to
be one of those two horndogs.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Well, this is shocking.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
Can't believe our candidates
have such kinky hobbies.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Bros who live in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Don't forget
you're a pervert, too.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Putting my preferences aside,

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
let's focus on the two suspects.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Any observations?

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
One wants me to dominate her,

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
the other wants me
to serve as her slave.

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
At first I thought there
was no love involved,

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
but that might not
actually be the case.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Interesting.

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
They both followed
that dumb rumor

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
and wore pink underwear
when cornering me.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's the color of their
panties gotta do with this?

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
It's an urban legend

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
among female students in this
school. Wearing pink undies

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
while confessing your
feelings to someone

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
is supposed to be good luck.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
The chances are better that
they'll feel the same way!

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Weird.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Sayuki was definitely
wearing a pink bra

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
when she came out
to me as a masochist,

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
and I could never forget
Yuika's pink panties.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
Finally, the love letter came
in a pink-colored envelope.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Actually...

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's
possible that both of them

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
might have fallen for you?

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't rule that out.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
Two culprits at the
same time is a stretch,

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
but our investigation implies
one of them must be Undierella.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
Right, and there's also
the glass slipper issue

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
to think about.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
How do you think those panties
disappeared from your room?

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
I never saw that coming.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
She must've snuck
back for her underwear

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
while I was distracted.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
If you zoom out a bit,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
this could be a huge win
for the investigation!

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
How's losing evidence a win?

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] If the culprit
took her panties back,

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
then it means she
left them by accident.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
She may have never
intended to leave them

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
with the love letter
in the first place.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wait a sec.

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
If that's true,
it means the underwear

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
wasn't supposed to be part
of the original message.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
Maybe there was some emergency

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
that forced her
to leave them behind.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Heh, yeah, okay.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Wait, maybe it's not all bad

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
that the panties are
back in her possession.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
If you track down the underwear,

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
then you'll discover
who sent the letter

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
and get to the bottom of it.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
If I catch her red-handed,

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
there's no way she can
argue against the evidence.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
It's a shame you
lost the good stuff,

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
but at least now
you have suspects.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
So, how are we gonna
find those silky drawers?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Do you wanna go
and flip some skirts up?

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's assault.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
I could always do some research.
Sneaky photos are my forte!

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure walking around

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
taking panty shots
isn't our best move.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
I guess you're right.

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's either
Sayuki or Yuika.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
One of them is our panty thief.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
But who?

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
What's your gut say
based on what you know?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
Nothing good.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
Oh, someone's running late.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
For a second there, I thought
you wouldn't show up.

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
It's just us here, right?

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Yes, the other
two club members left,

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
since they were tired
of waiting around.

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I decided
to stay though

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
since now I have you
to all to myself.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, is something wrong?

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Hm?

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I... I need to talk to
you about something important.

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
Cup size?

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that's a secret
I'll never tell anyone.

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It's not that.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
Okay, then spit it out already.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're finally
ready to be my master.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
That it?

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
You bet I am.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
Are you prepared to be my pet?

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Huh?

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.017 position:50% align:center
You came early. Huh.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd get here first.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I couldn't risk making you wait.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
After all, I am not a bad dog,

00:21:56.649 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
Now, that's the right
type of attitude. I'm glad.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
Because today, I'm gonna
own you, body and soul.

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:36.583 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
All my plans are ruined!

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Well, what have we here?

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.377 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Ready or not,
it's time to investigate...

00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.879 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Now that you've
found me out, what can I say?

00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Finally, I've got
you cornered, Undierella!

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:45.675 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Next Hensuki!

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.886 position:50% align:center
"Operation: Keiki
is a Master Now!"

00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
Are you willing to love
her as long as she's cute?
