[YUIKA] This story's called
"The Shy Princess."

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time, there was
a princess who was very shy.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
One day, a party
was held in the castle,

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
and a handsome
prince was invited.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
The princess fell in love
with the prince right away,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
and everyone said it
was love at first sight.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
But the princess
is a very shy person.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
The girl couldn't
express how she felt.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
So she locked him up!

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
When the prince
awoke in the dark room,

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
he was very confused
and asked her,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
"Why are you doing this?

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
Please return me to
my country this instant!"

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
But the prince would
never return home again.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
For he was destined
to live with the princess

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
forever and ever.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
And from that day on,
the princess began

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
disciplining the
disobedient prince.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center

Previously, on <i>Hensuki</i> !

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] One of the
Undierella candidates,

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
Yuika Koga, confessed
her love to me,

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
AKA asked me to be her slave,
but I was like, "hard pass."

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
Then, she stuffed her
used panties in my mouth.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.206 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I died a little.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Oh? A message from beyond?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] What was that
blood-curdling scream

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
I just heard?

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
Did you have a bad dream?

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I dreamed I died the
death of a thousand panties

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
thanks to my underclassman...

--Oh! Toast is ready!

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center

...is what I'm not gonna say.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey, Mizuha?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA giggles]
Yeah?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You think it's cool
if I skip school today?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
Are you actually sick?
Or are you just pretending?

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Pretending.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Request denied.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] According to Yuika,
I passed out yesterday

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
due to "extreme happiness."
From getting a love confession.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
You got a little
overexcited, huh?

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] She's turned the
school into a house of lies!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Keiki?

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Who knew Yuika would
have such a dark side to her?

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
But if neither she nor
Sayuki are Undierella,

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
then that means
it's gotta be...

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Morning, Kiryu.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nanjo.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Nothing, just grappling
with the heavy weight

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
of my poor life choices.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
Wow, sucks to suck.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI screams]

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What is it,
why are you yelling?!

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh, nothing!

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're so weird.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI whimpers]

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
They're bigger than you think!

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Seriously?!

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] So... What's up with
the cryptic bra message?

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Duh, Isn't it obvious?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
--You didn't like panties,
--Panties?!

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
--so I tried a new treat!
--Panties?!

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
Scary panties, scary panties,
scary panties, scary panties,

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
scary panties...

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Keiki? What's up?
Why the muttering?

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I think I have PTSD.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Hmm. Well, at least now
I understand why you've been

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
avoiding me so much lately.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't come to
the library or answer my texts.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
A special bra-livery
was my best shot!

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For real?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
PS, it's a present, so enjoy!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, no.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
Listen. I really hate
to ask this, but...

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're not bra-less
under there, are you?

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No, of course
I'm wearing a bra,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
you disgusting,
boob-obsessed, pervert!

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
How is that any worse
than airing out your cooter?

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
What if the other
boys in school found out?!

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
You just know they'd
have a field day!

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
You force-fed me
your used panties,

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
but I'm glad there's a line.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] You don't get it,
you're very special to me.

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, you mean it?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
You're the only guy who's fit

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
to be my personal slave!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
Not what I wanted to hear.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
By the way, would you like to
see the picture book I created?

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, yeah. I forgot you said

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
you wanted to make
picture books.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Yep, if it's okay,
I'd like to read it to you.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
Go for it. Knock yourself out.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] This story's called
"The Shy Princess."

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time, there was
a princess who was very shy.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
One day, a party
was held in the castle.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
The princess fell in love
with the prince right away,

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
and everyone said it
was love at first sight.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
But the princess was
a very shy person.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
The girl couldn't
express how she felt,

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
so she locked him up.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
--Heh...
--[YUIKA] And so...

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
She ordered her soldiers
to knock the prince unconscious,

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
tie him up, and throw him
in the cold, wet, dungeon.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
When the prince awoke
in the dark room,

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
he was very confused.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
He asked her,
"Why are you doing this?

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
Please return me to
my country this instant!"

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
But the princess
absolutely refused to let go

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
of her one true love.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
Until one day, the prince
learned the joys of servitude.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
After that, the prince
and the princess

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
lived happily ever after.
The end.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gulps]

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
--What'd you think about it?
--[KEIKI] Uh...

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Doesn't their love
story make your heart pound

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
with excitement?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, it's pounding, all right.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
But I wouldn't
call it excitement.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Don't you get
what I'm trying to tell you?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh, not really.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
This story is basically

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
my ideal relationship
between us!

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Wait, you wanna
slap my ass with a whip?

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] No. This is a
work of fiction, silly.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
But if that's the
kinda fantasy your into,

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
I'd be more than happy
to accommodate!

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
That is most
definitely not my thing.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
I promise to find
a way to change you.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
Yes. I shall be
extremely thorough.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
Until one day, serving me
as my personal slave will be

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
the only thing that brings
you any kind of joy.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
Slowly...

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
...but surely.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
'Kay?

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center

throw up! See ya, bye!

[KEIKI]
Home!

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
I've gotta go home
and hang out with Mizuha.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
I'll eat her awesome cooking,
we'll watch some TV,

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
laugh about something
stupid together,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
then everything will
go back to normal

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
and I can pretend
like this nightmare

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
never happened
in the first place.

[school bell chimes]

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
This is bad...

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
It's on a whole different
plane than the bra.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
What was that about a plane?

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Um, math planes!

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
Well, if you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

[SAYUKI] Come to the
club room immediately.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.089 position:50% align:center
Or else I'll post this photo
all over the Internet,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
along with your full legal name
so everyone knows it's you.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Seriously? Not the Internet.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
When did she even
take that photo?

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Welcome back,
Master, I've missed you!

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Right, maybe...
I'll just change my name.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
would just walk out on me--

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
that's so cold!

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] If you're cold,
it's 'cause of your outfit.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
You're so mean.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
But I'm not opposed
to being disciplined!

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What is her problem?!

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
And how did she
even open the door?!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Are you ditching Calligraphy
club to start a maid café?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
Remember the book
I took from the library?

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
I thought that perhaps a maid
was the modern-day equivalent

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
to a loyal dog.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a giant stretch,
and yet, here we are.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
I've decided I'm going
to become your maid!

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
Gotta be honest. I'm speechless.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Could you return
this book for me?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
Now then, tell me
your first order!

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
Cool, I only have one request:
Change into normal clothing.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to oblige.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
But it's kind of hard to change
while wearing these handcuffs.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
Then I'll unlock them.
Just give me the key, okay?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
It's quite the story, actually.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What is?

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I might have
accidentally dropped it

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
when I was trying
to put it on the desk.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So where is it?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
In my cleavage.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What?! But how?!

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Keiki...

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.222 position:50% align:center
Please stick your hand in there
and pull it out for me...

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI, sarcastically]
Aw, yeah, lemme rummage around!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Don't worry,
I won't press charges,

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
and I'm definitely
not secretly filming this

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
or anything like that.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
That makes me wanna
do it even less!

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Wait here! I'll go get a girl!

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Keiki!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
I hate to be rude, but could
you possibly hurry up?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
I can barely hold it.
You see... Nature is calling.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Are you kidding me?

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
--[heart thudding]
--[KEIKI gulps]

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I can get the key
from her storage knockers.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
Or watch the
poor girl wet herself.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Hey, Keiki...?

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
What is it?!

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
Be gentle... This is
my first time, after all.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Can we please
not talk right now?!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI moans]

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
Ahh!! Ohh!

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
Hey! The sound effects
are not necessary!

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] My, that was
a close call, wasn't it?

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For both of us.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
What if I didn't show up?

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
You'd be, like,
a literal mess right now.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
I know, but lucky
for me you did show up.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center
Yeah, "lucky."

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] There, deleted.
Now just you and I know.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
Cherished memories
only for us two.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say "cherished."

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. This is
gettin' kinda weird.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
Oh, how so?

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Like, you just seem
to be really handsy lately.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
Yes, true.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
I'm marking you with my scent,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
that's how one
indicates ownership.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
Oh, like a dog.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Exactly. I'm your
loyal little puppy.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
I don't have any pets,
much less a puppy.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
Aw, your cold demeanor
is so soothing, Master!

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
Why'd you
blackmail me like this?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
Was it all just to get me here?

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
Why do you need a reason
to come and see me?

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
You never needed
a reason to come

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
and see me before.
I'm old news, aren't I?

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
Well, you know...
Good pets can become anxious

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
when they don't
see their masters.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Listen, if you do
decide to become my master.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
Then I'd let you have all of me,
mentally and physically.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wait... Physically?

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'd do anything for you.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
Even things normal
girls might shy away from.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
Whatever your heart desires!

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
Well then? Will you
keep me as your pet?

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
Come on, you know
you wanna make

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
Miss Bouncy Balls your new pet!

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be ridiculous!

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
She's a girl, not a dog
you saw in a window!

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Bruh, the lady just said
she'd do anything

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
your heart desires!

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
Those things should be reserved
for couples who are in love!

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I think so, too.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
[DEMON] Buddy,
You're seeing the huge pillows

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
that girl's packing, right?

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
I do have to admit
they're rather impressive.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
--They look so soft.
--Like memory foam...

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
And if you agree,
they're your pillows to fluff!

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is say,
"Yes," and you're good to go!

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
You get the whole
package, my friend!

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Sounds great, doesn't it?

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI, ANGEL]
That does sound great!

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
I'll pass.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's not there.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
What's not there?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] There's no romance.
Where's the looooove...?!

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
[MAO sighs]

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI screaming]

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Hm?

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
Kiryu?

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] So, did you ever
solve the Undierella mystery?

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
Oh. That mess.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Did you seriously forget?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It's more like
I'm trying to block it out.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] You looked into
both Tokihara and Koga

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
as suspects, right?

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.458 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
I beg you. Please make
me your pet, Keiki!

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
Now what do you say?

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
Would you become
my slave, Keiki?

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] One wants a master
and the other wants a slave.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I dunno, man.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's
either one of them.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
In that case, there's only
one person it could be.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You mean Nanjo?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
It's a possibility.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
And I've even caught her
looking your way a few times.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
What? You haven't noticed?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center
It's kinda hard to say.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm pretty sure
she's staring at you, not me.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Nah, definitely you.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
How do you know?

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
It's obvious.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
The girl won't even spare
me a glance if I'm alone.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
When she looks at you, though.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
She blushes a little bit.
Like, in a cute way.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
It's the kinda look a girl
has when she's in love.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
She's in love? With me?

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
[MAO growls]

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Ah. Pretty sure she just
tried to stab me with her eyes.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
That's hate. Hate in
its purest form.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Dude, what'd
you do to piss her off?

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center

It's all part of
my plan to seduce you.

Keiki was late,
so I started looking around.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
That's when I overheard
a familiar voice.

Don't touch him
without my permission!

got the wrong idea

I came to save you from her, and
you treat me like a nuisance.

This witch told me
the moment I met her.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
She told me to give up and move
on because you were destined

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
to become her master,
isn't that right?

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had to, it was obvious
you were lusting after him.

He may have been tricked,
but you couldn't hide

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
your true intentions from me.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
Ah. That's why
you couldn't get along.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
This is unacceptable.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center

like some submissive mongrel.

I won't allow you to
disgrace him any more.
