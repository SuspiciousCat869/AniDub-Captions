[KEIKI] My bud, Shoma Akiyama,
is a dude who'd do anything

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
for a cute young thang.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.422 position:50% align:center
Koharu Otori looks young,
but she's actually a year older.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
Phase one of the plan to hook
them up was moving along nicely,

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.384 position:50% align:center
but then everything
came crashing down

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
thanks to a new
Undierella candidate.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.180 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] All this competition
sure is exciting!

Miss Okita,

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
remember that day we
cleaned the clubroom?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
Was there anyone else around?

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
Um... Let me think about it.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
I do remember walking by
a student in the hallway.

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
Did you see who it was?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
Miss Fujimoto, a second-year.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Fujimoto?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
What was she doing
in the club building?

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
You rang?

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It--It's you!

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
Student council vice president,
reporting for duty.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.213 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
Fancy running into you here.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
Could this be fate?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
You just snuck up from behind
me when I wasn't looking.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
That's too intentional
for fate, if you ask me!

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
Aww, I guess you're not
the type to play along.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
Either way,
I'm glad I found you.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
I wanted to repay
you for saving me.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal.
I don't need any payback.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
But when I fell down the stairs,

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
you were the only reason
I walked away without a scratch.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
You make it sound more
epic than it really was.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
I brought a present
to show my thanks.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
Please, take these cookies.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, thanks a lot.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Try one now if you'd like.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
Sure, don't mind if I do.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
I'm actually
getting pretty hungry.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
Man, these are delicious.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
They're homemade.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
I baked them myself.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
You know how to bake?
Cool. That's a neat skill.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] I'm very good at making
all sorts of sweet things.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
Okay. This is getting weird.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.392 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you're
a couple inches too close?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
What do you know, it's time
for us to get back to class.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] I suppose it
wouldn't be very good

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50% align:center
if we both walked in late.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center

the heck you're doing?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center

rest of the afternoon.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
And why was I kinda into it?

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Proceed, Agent Otori.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Show us the findings
of your report.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Yes, Commander.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
Allow me to direct your
attention to Exhibit A.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hm. Such detailed photography.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
You never fail to deliver.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
I appreciate your praise, sir.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] So, what's our opinion
of the subject in question?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
I ran a background check

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
and came up with the following:

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
She's an exceptionally
good student.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
So far, I've found nothing
to warrant any concern.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I see...

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
A typical member of
the student council.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
However, the number of times
she's made contact with you

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
is enough that we
shouldn't ignore it.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Is that so?

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
Humor me, Agent,
do you think she could be

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
the elusive Undierella
who dropped her panties?

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
It's within the
realm of possibility.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
She does visit the club building
quite often for student council.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] One last thing
you should be aware of.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
She's usually expressionless
and rarely smiles,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
but when she makes the
occasional slip-up,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
her perfect image shatters.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
In such moments,
she becomes super cute.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ah, an accident-prone beauty.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think?

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
Was that helpful, or do you want
me to keep on investigating?

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
Nah, you did plenty.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch for
all the research.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
I'll take it from here.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
I've got enough clues to
do my own snooping around.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
I hope you find something.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
I'll keep all my
fingers crossed.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
sorry I'm lagging behind
with the cupid stuff.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
Meh!

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
No worries, there's no
point in rushing anything.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
Slow and steady wins the race!

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
I've had these feelings
for an entire year already.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
I can hold on a bit longer.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So much info in just a few days.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
Those are some
amazing stalking skills.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do it.

Tracking Fujimoto in between

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
all her appointments is
practically impossible.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center
Yet somehow, she ambushes
me anytime she wants.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh? Where's Sayuki?

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
She left. Something about
having business to attend to.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
Well, Nanjo took off
to buy art supplies.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center

You're gonna pay.

So?

I wanted to get
back at that busty witch

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
for what she said the other day,
so I asked you what I should do

in order to increase
my cup size!

telling me how
massaging my boobs

give in and submit to me!

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
Keiki, you dummy.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Oops. Uhh.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
Guess we're even. Hooray?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I should've known
you were a typical perv.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
You generic male protagonist!

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA crying]

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Aw, balls.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
That was messed up.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Come in.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
I'm here for a clubroom checkup.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Being in the student council

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
sure seems like
it's a lot of work.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
Auditing is important.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure the budget

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
for each club is
spent responsibly.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
If anything looks out of place,
then it's my job to correct it.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What's the matter?

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
Find something?

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
Nothing to note.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
Are all our papers in order?

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thank you.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
Nice work for
a generic protagonist.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You heard that?!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
By the way, I'm looking
for a couple of volunteers

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.749 position:50% align:center
interested in helping me
pick up litter around town.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50% align:center
I'd greatly appreciate
it if you could join me.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
Volunteer work, huh?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It could be a good
opportunity to do some recon.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Who is this
intruder in our love nest?

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] That's a lot of ground
to cover for three people.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
It's gonna be ruff.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but why are you here?

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
As a pet, I'm obligated
to go out of my way

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
to help my master however I can.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center
Do you mind interpreting
whatever she just said?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It's just a weird
inside joke she likes to make.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
Don't pay attention to her.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
In any case, I'll take
whatever help we can get.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
There's something
you should know.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
I'm wearing a pair of
scandalous black underwear.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah, really
needed to know that!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI sighs]

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Of course, the ones I'm
wearing today are pure white.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Would you mind doing me a favor?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
I'd like if you'd stop
walking so close to Keiki.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
And why would I do that?

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
Because my body and
soul belong to him.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I follow. Are you
two going out with each other?

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
We don't need labels

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
--We're friends!
--to describe our bond.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Then I simply can't
see the problem.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
What if I were to do this?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI gasps]

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Hmph! That move
wasn't very effective.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
He prefers his melons
big and juicy.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
You may outrank me when
it comes to size, however,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
I'm very confident
when it comes to shape.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunting]

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
Uhh, what do you want from me?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, white undies.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]
Man, this is pointless.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
I came for an investigation,
not sanitation.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Over here!

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
I found a huge piece of garbage

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
and I can't pick
it up on my own.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
Can you help me out?

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Mm-hm.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So, where's that trash?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, right here. It's me.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Be careful. A dog gets
jealous if their master

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
spends too much
time with others.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What are you talking about?

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whoa!

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
You attract way too many girls!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
Wait, why are you licking
my face all of a sudden?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I'm marking you, silly.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
I'm replacing the smell of other
females with my sweet scent.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI gasps]

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
This is bad.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
She's about to swipe my V-card.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
I gotta stop her, but boppin'
her baps isn't gonna work

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
on her like it did on Yuika!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
It might just end up totally
unleashing the beast within her!

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
How do I get this
thirsty hound to calm down?

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.924 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO barking]

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, get off!

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.386 position:50% align:center
Stop it, Hanako.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
I said that's enough!

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA giggling]

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI'S GRANDFATHER]
What's with the commotion?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Are you letting that hound
get all over you again?

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
Come help! Don't just sit there!

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
Ugh. So heavy, lay off already!

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI'S GRANDFATHER]
Sure is embarrassing

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
to let a dog get
the best of ya. Heh.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I can't help it!
She's bigger than me!

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Hanako, what's your
problem? Leave me alone!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
It's time to teach you my
Ancient Super Secret Technique!

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
What technique, Grandpa?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI'S GRANDFATHER]
The butt!

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Just remember
to pet her caboose,

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
and she'll calm down right away!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
Gotta conk that badonk!

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI'S GRANDFATHER] I believe
in ya, kiddo. Make me proud!

[SAYUKI gasping]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
Wh-Whoa, wait just a minute,
what are you doing?

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
What's happening?

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI yelps]

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
You must be delicate yet bold,

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
like you're kneading
a ball of dough.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
Now, start massaging and show
that tushie who's the boss!

[dog howling]

That's too much!

[KEIKI]
Delicate, yet bold!

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Please, stop it!
I've had enough!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
Almost...

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
And now, the finale!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI gasping]

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Safe at last.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I asked you to stop it,

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
but you wouldn't listen.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
You were so aggressive and mean.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
I couldn't believe it.
I was so humiliated.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry, Sayuki, I didn't
mean to make you feel that way!

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
So scary...

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
...frightening...

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
...yet terrifically
exhilarating!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI] Huh?
--You took my breath away!

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
What a bold attack on my rear!

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
Relentless! It was
absolutely incredible!

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
You're truly the only person
fit to be my master!

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well, I disagree!

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
It's best if I go home for now.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
Uh... Why's that?

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Because I'm so embarrassed,

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I can look you
in the eye for a while.

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I guess a dog
really does get jealous

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
if their master spends
too much time with anyone else.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
[HANAKO barks]

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
Gross.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50% align:center
It's pretty late.

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
We should probably wrap
up and head back home.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
Okey-dokey!

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
Sayuki already left for the day.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
Lemme just finish up.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
I guess it's true,
boys will be boys,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
but it's okay.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
I won't judge you
for your hobbies.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
Wait, this doesn't belong
to me, I just found it!

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
It's cool, really.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
I'll go on ahead, so take
all the time you need!

being so considerate?

Whoa, watch it!

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
Mm. Yeah. I think so.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You sure seem
to fall down a whole lot.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
[AYANO sighs]
I owe you one.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center

They are white.

[AYANO]
Huh? Don't look!

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry about that.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
Here, take my sweater.

Thank you so much.

I'm home.

[MIZUHA]
Welcome back!

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
Ah. You're a total mess!

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
Let's get you
washed up right away.

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
Hold on, where's your jacket?

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I let someone borrow it.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You know, I was thinking.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Huh?

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] We should go pay
Grandpa a visit sometime.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] It has been
a while since we've seen him.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
And Hanako, miss that mutt.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center

[SHOMA] Man, that
badminton match was tight!

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we were pretty into it.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
Nanjo was staring at us again,

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure we gave her
a ton of new material.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by "material"?

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry your
pretty little head about it.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
There are some things in life
you're better off not knowing.

So, catch me up to speed.

Fujimoto's your new
Undierella candidate?

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
Yeah, after all there's a chance

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
it might be someone
who isn't in the club.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
Have you discovered
any solid evidence?

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
Nothing important yet.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
She did pay extra attention
to the lockers in the clubroom.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
How very interesting.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
That's the same place we thought

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
the culprit
might've been hiding.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
Feels a bit suspicious
if you ask me.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center

Hi there, Kiryu.

[KEIKI]
Hey, how are you feeling?

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Hope you didn't get sick
yesterday, you were soaked.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm fine.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
It was all thanks
to your jacket.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad to hear that.

[SHOMA gasps]

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
What was that about?

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
She just completely
blew me off. Huh.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Maybe it's 'cause
you're sweaty and smelly AF!

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] Thanks again for
lending me your jacket.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
Don't mention it.

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
What's the occasion?

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
I wanted to show
my appreciation.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
You didn't happen to
make this, too, did you?

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] Mm-hm. I'm proud
of how it turned out.

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
Please, dig in.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You've baked
another masterpiece.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch for the dessert.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Mm! What'd you
put in this? It's so good!

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Yay! Great.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
The secret ingredient
is lots of love!

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, not to
ruin the moment,

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
but it's kinda hard
to eat like this.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
You're right-handed, I don't
think there should be an issue.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
What if someone
walks in the room

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
and sees us sitting
here all snuggled up?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
That's not gonna happen.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
I let the others know I
was bringing a boy here,

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
and they all winked
and told me "good luck."

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
Sounds like they may have
gotten the wrong message.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
It's actually a testament to the
amount of respect I've earned.

[KEIKI sighs]

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
This all feels very relaxing.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Sitting next to you on
the sofa relaxes me, too.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
I was wondering...

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
You see...

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She actually fell asleep.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
Guess she wasn't kidding
about how she felt.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]
Wait, a minute.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
This is totally romantic!

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
There's been no mention of pets,

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
no sadism, no smutty books,
or any other kinky BS.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
This is exactly the kind
of thing I was looking for.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI yawns]
I'm starting to get sleepy, too.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
Can barely keep my eyes open.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center

to wind down after exercising...

Uh... What was that noise?

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
Sure feels breezy
between my legs.

[KEIKI gasps]

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center

Guess I woke you.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
Here's the truth.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
I'm an olfactophiliac,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
which means I have
a fetish for smells.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
Specifically, I love the
scent of boys' body odor.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
And now, I can't get enough of
your natural musk, Kiryu.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
Okay. Is this a weird joke
with some next-level twist?

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
No. I'm completely serious.

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
So, I'd appreciate it if you'd
hand over your underwear.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls, enough!

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
When you caught me
at the staircase,

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
I recognized that
aroma instantly.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I knew it was
the scent of destiny.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
That destiny needs
to be canceled.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
How anticlimactic.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
I even crafted this
textbook sleepy scenario--

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
Chamomile tea, calming music,

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
a warm temperature,
soft lighting... Perfect!

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
No wonder I fell asleep! [sighs]

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
If this was an elaborate
plan to get me to nap,

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
then why'd you pass out first?

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was
a minor miscalculation.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
Your pheromones
were so intoxicating,

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
my eyes got heavy
and I dozed off.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
I was in more danger
than I realized.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
Aww. I was so close to having
my way with your undies.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
They were salty and soaked
and heady with the fragrance

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
of a fresh workout.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
Wow...

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
If you're obsessed
with how I smell,

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
then why'd you run away earlier
when I was in my gym clothes?

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
I couldn't stand it.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
If I'd taken even
one step closer,

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
I would've completely lost
myself in front of everyone.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, so, that's why you
planted your face in my jacket.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
Yes.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
When I got home from
trash pickup yesterday,

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
I took absurd pleasure
in savoring it.

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
It had the optimal amount
of sweat, and was wonderful.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
Yuck.

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:49.267 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh, why were you
staring at the club lockers

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:50.810 position:50% align:center
the other day?

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] That's where you can
find sports uniforms, towels,

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
protective gear, gloves...
Lockers hold my wildest dreams!

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
More like the nastiest!

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
Speaking of nasty,
hand over the goods, please.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.075 position:50% align:center
How 'bout no!

[KOHARU] There's a star
named Shoma Akiyama.

It shines brighter
than any other star,

else in my universe.
