[YUIKA]
Previously, on Hensuki!

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] My epic search for
the lost panties revealed

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
that neither Sayuki nor
Yuika were the culprits.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
I was about to say screw it,
until a photo gave me

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
a new clue to help
solve the mystery.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.896 position:50% align:center
At long last, it's time
to unveil Undierella!

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Wow, Keiki, you sound
just like a real detective!

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
Thanks for meeting me.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Why exactly are we here?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
We're headed to the pool.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.540 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
This free pass is
good for five people.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
I thought you might wanna go.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the invite,

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.630 position:50% align:center
but I don't have
a swimsuit on me.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
No worries. I took the liberty

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.051 position:50% align:center
of buying you one so you
wouldn't have to go back home.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.013 position:50% align:center
That's kind of a weird thing
to be prepared for.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
How'd you even know
what size to get?

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.474 position:50% align:center
Well, they don't call me the

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
"over-the-shoulder-
boulder-holder connoisseur"

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
for nothing.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Gross...

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
How impressive!

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.607 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You're always
so supportive of me,

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
I wanted to return the favor.
Consider this day out a present.

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Hmm...

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
Freakin' womanizer...

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Thanks to that picture,

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.959 position:50% align:center
I pretty much know
Undierella's true identity.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Today's the day.
I'll put this mystery to rest.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal,
you're the first one out.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.179 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
No way!

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
I never thought your
swimsuit would be so normal.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI giggles] A little
birdie told me you prefer

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
things sweet and simple.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it
doesn't get a whole

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
lot simpler than that.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
But your anatomy makes it
far from sweet looking.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Yo, I'm all changed.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
So... How is it?

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Lookin' good!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
Ew.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You know we're swimming, right?

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
Why the sketch book?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
I'm totally gonna draw all
the half-naked swol dudes

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
I see today.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Of course.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long!

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whoa.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
You look mega-cute
in your swimsuit, Yuika.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
Oh? Does that mean
you'll become my slave?

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nope.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
All done.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Ready to go, Mizuha?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
What do you think?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nothing much, I guess.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
That swimsuit looks good on you.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Who knew Mizuha was
hiding such a curvy little body?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yep, and it's
all natural, my friends.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
Ew, why would you brag
about your sister like that?

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Yeah, stop saying weird stuff.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I'm sorry!
I thought it was a compliment!

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Anyway... What do
you wanna do first?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
Swim or whatever?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
Hey! Go on
the water slide with me!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Excuse you?

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
If anything, he's going to
the wave pool with me.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
Can you please let go?

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
This floatie's becoming
a euphemism.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
Should I call you Casanova?

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
I suppose we'll have
to duke it out to see

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
who wins Keiki's attention!

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
You're on!

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
--Uh, don't I get a say?
--How's this goin' down?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Like this!

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI shrieks]

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
Winner: Yuika Koga!

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whoa...

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
Looks like Humpty Dumplings
had a great fall.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
C'mon, Keiki, it's slide time!

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I never agreed to this.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
Really? Too bad.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
I'll let you two have
some alone time.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wha--? Don't leave me!

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
[PATRONS chatting]

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles]

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
Does my junk have
to be in your trunk?

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Hey, so...

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Heh?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I'm scared!
I actually hate water slides!

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
I slid down one as a kid
and it traumatized me!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Then why you'd get on?!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA, KEIKI yelling]

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI chuckles]
Looks like I'm the winner now.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
Are you, though?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

[gasps]

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
That wave was enormous!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
Weird for a public pool.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hey, uh, Sayuki?
Your buoys!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Huh...?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] So, how's the
shoujo manga going?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Uh... I guess I'm
making decent progress.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. If you help
me with my research,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
it might move
things along a bit.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.
Just tell me what you need.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
Really? Thanks, Kiryu!

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
Careful--are you all right?

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Here. I don't
want you to slip again.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
[MAO gasps] You know...
That was pretty smooth.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]
Free at last.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Where'd Mizuha go?

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA hums]

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I thought I'd find you here.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
I was looking
for you, but as usual,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
the girls from the calligraphy
club were being all-- Gah!

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center
[blubbers]

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What the heck, Mizuha?!

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
My sneaky water gun attack
was a total success!

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What'd I ever do to you?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, you only have
yourself to blame, meanie.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
That'll teach you to abandon
your adorable sister.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
Would a hug from
your brother make it better?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Nope! But, if you play
with me for a little bit,

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
then I might forgive you.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It's a deal.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA giggles]

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
[gasps, groans]

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What's wrong? [gasps]

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?!

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Yeah. My leg just
cramped up a bit, is all.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
It'll pass in
a couple of minutes.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'll carry you.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Uh? Ah!
Whoa, you're so strong.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It's easy--
you're as light as a feather.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA sighs] Good!
If you said I was heavy,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
I'd have to start making nothing
but healthy salads for dinner.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
This reminds me of
when we were kids.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groaning]

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[groaning continues]

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I'd forgotten about that.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] We were so
little back in those days.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
We used to be pretty close
to the same size.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
But now that we've gotten older,
you're much taller than me.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You've grown in your own way.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
Like how you've got a rack now.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
Yeah, could you not?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
Oh, that reminds me.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
--Keiki...?
--[KEIKI] Huh...?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
I'll still support you even
if you're into boys, okay?

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI] What?
--Earlier...

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
I read the manga that Mao
wrote about you and Shoma.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
Whoa, how'd you find that smut?!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
Tokihara was kind enough
to give me a copy

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
in exchange for some
advice on her swimwear.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That traitor!

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
I had never read
any boys' love before.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
To be honest...

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
It was like I'd discovered
a whole new steamy world.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well then, undiscover it!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna
go down that road!

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
It's cool if you like boys,

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
I just want you to be
comfortable with who you are!

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
That manga is a work of fiction!

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Attention! Hello!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
--Attention park guests.
--[KEIKI] That voice...

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
We're having a special event!

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
Come one, come all!

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
You can win a prize!

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Man, this stinks...

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Koharu?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Oh!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50% align:center
Kiryu!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
Please help me!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So, yeah.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
This is Koharu Otori,
she goes to our school.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
Hi there!
This is my part-time job,

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
running some of
the special events.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm totally
down to help out!

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but no.
You're lacking the right parts.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
This is the
"Cute Girls Assemble!

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
Super Adorbs Love
Confession Competition!"

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Participants have to compete
over who can make

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
the most heart-throbbing
love confession

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
in front of a crowd of people.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Challenge accepted.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
Every girl here
will gladly participate.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
And then, the winner
gets the right

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
to give Keiki one command!

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
No matter how
weird the request is.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
He'll have no choice
but to obey the victor!

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Ooh...

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
Once again,
I never agreed to this.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Without further ado.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
I give you the
"Cute Girls Assemble!

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
Super Adorbs Love
Confession Competition!"

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
I'm your host!
My name is Koharu Otori!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
The audience will
act as our judges!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
That's right,
you have the power!

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Our high-tech machinery
will measure all your applause

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
--and choose the winner!
--[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
And the highest
score wins this prize!

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE whooping]

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Now, let's get started!

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
Tell us your name,
contestant one!

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Sayuki Tokihara.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I'm a third-year
student and I'm also

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
the president of our
Calligraphy Club.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Who is your love
confession for, Miss President?

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
An underclassman.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE gasping, oohing]

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
He's a year younger
than me, and very cute.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
Also, he's a member of the club.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
He's a little naïve whenever
I'm trying to play with him.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
But I love that he's
such a kind person.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Don't say "love." It
really gives me the wrong idea.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Oh, boy! Here comes the passion!

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
All I want is for you
to accept my feelings,

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
and in return you can
have every piece of me!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Roughly translated as:

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
"Be my master and
I'll be your loyal dog."

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
[drumroll]

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Ninety-two points!
Quite impressive!

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
Such a high score
right out of the gate!

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
I gotta give you props
for being able to make all

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
the boys spring to attention!

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if she's
giving me a compliment

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
or insulting me.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Moving on to
the next contestant,

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
give it up for
beauty number two!

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
Ugh. She's talking about us
like we're show dogs.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] You're a student
librarian, correct?

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh, yeah, who told you?

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Oh, you know,
Miss Otori has her ways.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
Hmm, I've never noticed
how small and cute you are.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Note to self,
keep Princess Petite

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
away from Sho-Sho.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Uh?

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Ahem.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
Anyway, why don't you tell us
who you've got the hots for?

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Well.
He's an upperclassman

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
who goes to my high school.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
He's super nice to me,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
and takes the time to teach me
things that I don't know.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
But... he's always
surrounded by tons

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
of cute girls, and it kinda
ticks me off when I catch him

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
staring at them instead of me.
Like, come on, what the heck?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
That's why I have a very
important message for him today.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
Listen up! I won't forgive you

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
if you wag your tail for
other girls, you stupid dog!

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Could've been worse.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
[drumroll]

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
No way, it's a 95!

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
She may be a small package,
but she's packing dynamite!

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
And the dudes totally dig it!

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] That's two
things I've won today.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
Suck it, witch.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
Get off your high horse.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
It's not over yet,
there's always a chance

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
I could make an
unexpected comeback.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Yeah, reality called,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
they wanted me to tell
you to keep dreaming.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
Right, let's get ready
for hottie number three!

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
Put your hands
together for Nanjo!

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
--[AUDIENCE cheers]
--Uh, hello there.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
I'm Mao Nanjo.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
My, my...

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
I've heard you're quite
the artist, correct?

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
How'd you know that?

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] How 'bout you
spill the tea on the guy

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
who's on your mind?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Um, okay, then.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
He's a classmate, but also
one of my best friends.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
I don't know, I guess he's
pretty fun to hang out with.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
It's whatever.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
It's kinda like
he's more than a friend.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
Like over time,
he's become someone

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
that's super important to me.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
that makes any sense.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
Dammit, this sucks.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
Look, what I mean is...

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
All I see is you, okay?
So just deal with it, stupid!

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers, whoops]

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah, all she
sees in me is a reference

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
for her boring manga character.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] The feisty
firecracker takes the lead

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
with a whopping 98!

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
This is the highest
score we've ever had!

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
They've done this
dumb contest more than once?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center
It's time for
our final contestant!

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Put your hands together
for number four!

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hi, everyone.
I'm Mizuha Kiryu.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] She excels in the
domestic skills department.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
Cooking, cleaning,
and all sorts of housework.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
Who's got you all excited?

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Well, um... I have a
brother who's older than me.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
Whether we're
at home or at school,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
he always goes out of his way
to help me out whenever he can.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, he even
goes a bit overboard.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
But he seems to really
enjoy my cooking,

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
and he always does nice
stuff like comfort me

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
after a scary movie
or help me dry my hair.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
All those little things add up,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
and that's how I know
he has a good heart.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
So I want to tell him
how much he means to me.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] A-And that I
love him a whole lot!

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
--[microphone screeches]
--So, yeah...

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers loudly]

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
One hundred and twenty points?!

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
This record is so high,
it actually broke our machine!

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
Oh. I suppose
that's a compliment, huh?

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
We have a winner!

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I really hope Mizuha was
talking about the kind of love

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
that's between family members.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Good thing she
likes housework, am I right?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
Keiki?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, hey.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
So, uh, we've got a bit
before the bus comes.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Cool.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
Coming to the pool
was a lot of fun.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I gotta admit,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
I was surprised you actually
won that weird contest.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] What'd you think
of my confession? Huh?

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hm? It was really something.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
Did not expect that.

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
I can't wait for the prize
Tokihara mentioned.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the whole command thing?

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Please be gentle with me.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
Don't you wanna go meet up
with the rest of your friends?

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
No.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to talk
to you for a minute.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Huh? About what?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
I wanna apologize
for what I'm about to do.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I knew it.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
You were the one who left the
love letter in the club room.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
[cicada chirping]

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
Yep, you found me.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Honestly... I didn't
figure it out on my own.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
I had help.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Let's look at this
from Undierella's perspective.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Whoever it was snuck
into your room and removed

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
the evidence without
you knowing.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Naturally, the next
step would be to move them

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
to a new location.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] True, but she has
to find a good hiding place.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Why wouldn't she
just hide the coot suit

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
under her bed
like a normal perv?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
Think about it,
Undierella already smuggled

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
the treasure out of your room.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
Meaning she's already well aware
that her room isn't a safe place

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
to hide the loot, either.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
She'd never be dumb enough
to repeat your mistake.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
Okay, so where, then?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] The answer's simple:
They're with her.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
All she has to do
is carry the goods

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
on her person at all times.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
Girl's undies tend to be
pretty small and light.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
It would be easy to just
stash them in her bag.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
And that's when
I devised a plan.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
I decided we'd all go to
the pool on a school day.

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
But not tell you about it
until right before we left.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Mm...

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
The surprise swimsuit
was also part of my strategy.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
To force you to wear
the Undierella panties

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
you'd stolen from me.

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA gasps]

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
After we were done swimming,

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
you'd change back into
your uniform. However...

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
Since you didn't know
about the trip in advance,

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
there's no way you'd have an
extra pair of underwear on you.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Except, of course...

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
...the Undierella ones
in your bag.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You then faced
a difficult choice.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
Wear your dirty taco
wrapper from earlier,

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
or the clean Undierella
panties you've been

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
carrying around with you.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
Game over.
You're such a clean freak.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
There's no way you'd ever pick
dirty undies over fresh ones.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] So how did you
figure out it was me?

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
This photo.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
See? It was taken on the day

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
I found the love letter
in the club room.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
Timestamped at 5:50 PM.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
We finished cleaning right
after five that day.

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
You supposedly left early.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
So there was no reason for
you to still be at school.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] There was only
one logical answer.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA whimpers]

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Damn normies and
their happy relationships!

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
After we finished cleaning,

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
it wasn't Sayuki who
left the room last.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You put the letter on the desk

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
and then hid inside the locker.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
[door rattles]

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]
I really want a girlfriend.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I locked the door
as I was leaving.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
Which you had to unlock
in order to get out.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
It was you.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] The reason
I couldn't figure out

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Undierella's identity...

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
...was because I had
removed you as a suspect

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
from the very start.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
It's basically just
a math problem.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
If you can't find the answer,

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
then revisit all
the information.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Everything you've
said is actually correct.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
I wanted to find a way
to tell you my feelings.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
I thought the best way
to do that would be

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
through a love letter.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
But... I ended up
getting scared.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
I was afraid of what
you'd think of me.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Because my feelings
had the potential to ruin

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
the great relationship
we have as siblings.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Is that why you didn't
sign your name to the letter?

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
I don't know...

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
In the end...

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
...maybe I just wanted
to be chased a little.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] By making the sender
of the letter a mystery,

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
it made you focus,
and I consumed your thoughts.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
So... What do you think?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
Now you know.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
I'm in love with you.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
You're always so kind.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
You go out of your way
to spoil me.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
You're such a hard worker
at everything you do.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
I love all that stuff.

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
Everything.
To me, you're perfect.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Say something.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Don't get me wrong,
I'm flattered.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
But...

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
...we're family.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] So you think
it's wrong to feel this way

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
because you and I
are related, right?

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah. That's what I think.

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
What if I said it's not wrong?

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Mm? But it is.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
Okay, listen.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
Bear with me here,
but have you ever thought about

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
how we're the same age?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah. Sure.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
Tell me when your birthday is.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
It's October 11th, so what?

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Uh-huh. And I
was born on March the 3rd.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Isn't that strange?

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
If you do the math,
that means you and I

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
are only five months apart.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that just mean
that mom and dad tried, like,

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
super hard or whatever?

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
You dummy.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
Babies take longer
than that to make.

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Mm. Wait, they do?

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls. That means...

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
The two of us are...

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Keiki. Forgive
me for this, okay?

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh...?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
wrong here. All right?

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
