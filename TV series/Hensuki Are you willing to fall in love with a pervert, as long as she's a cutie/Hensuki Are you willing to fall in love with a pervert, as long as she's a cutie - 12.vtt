[SAYUKI]
Hey. C'mon, wake up!

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Sayuki?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
What are you doing in my house?

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Wow. You sleepyhead!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
It's our house!

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center
Right, I forgot. My bad.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I still felt guilty
for embarrassing her.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
After what went down
at the amusement park,

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.251 position:50% align:center
I had to make it right.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
When I graduated,
we made it official.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Her last name isn't
Tokihara anymore.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
It's Kiryu.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,
we were classmates.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
Now, we're married.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
It's been a while. Can we?

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
Come, giddy up.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Oh, I love it!

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's how our pervy story ends.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
The kinky couple
creeping into the night.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI screams]

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.705 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, good. Just a dream.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
I thought I was
getting a bad ending

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
in some erotic visual novel.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.670 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Oopsie-daisy!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
Eegh.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
Ah. Huh?

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Emergency family meeting!

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Previously on Hensuki.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Well, I finally
caught the panty thief.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
The culprit?
My very own sister!

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center
I thought Undierella was bae,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50% align:center
but it turns out
she was just fam.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.865 position:50% align:center
Before I could turn her down,

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.203 position:50% align:center
she dropped a major truth bomb.
And it threw me for a loop!

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:05.625 position:50% align:center
MIZUHA] The one who wrote
you that letter was me.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.252 position:50% align:center
No more smooching me, okay?!

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.253 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Wha--?

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.421 position:50% align:center
You heard me.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
Also, what are you
doing in my bed?

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:13.550 position:50% align:center
I'm lonely, I can't help it.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
You've been acting totally
distant with me lately.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me for not cuddling

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
when there's a predator
in the family.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Stop it!

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.726 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to kiss somebody

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
you're in love with!

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.731 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Still need consent.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
Be honest, okay?
Do you hate me now?

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:36.156 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
'Cause I really like you!

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
Be-tee-dubs. You're a
boobie man, aren't you?

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I wouldn't date a girl
based on her cup size.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:46.499 position:50% align:center
But what about mine? Try 'em!

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA growls]
Whee!

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I'm not gonna lie.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
The sensation of her tender
mammaroonies against my chest?

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Splendiferous. I have no choice!

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Uh... Keiki...?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Fine. If that's the
way you wanna play this game,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
I got moves, too.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
Just watch this...

--[DOG barks]
--No, bad dog!

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Run away!

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, Dad?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are Mizuha and I not
actually related to each other?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
[FATHER]
Wha--? Uh, 'course not.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
[FATHER]
Uh... I mean... Did you forget?

--[sighs]
--[cell phone rings]

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
Took you long enough!

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Undierella was
the Prince's sister?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
Man, who'da thunk?

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
I figured the two of you
were twins or something

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
since you're both in
the same year at school.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
I've thought of her
as family this whole time.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to pretend
that none of this is a big deal?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
Bruh. Let's be real--

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
even I can tell that she's
a total catch of a girl.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
No way, man.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
She may be cute and gentle
and considerate and a great cook

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
and basically perfect, but...

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
But?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
I'm not diddling my sister!

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
Why? If she ain't
blood, be a stud!

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
I can't just flip a switch
and start seeing her

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
as a girlfriend now.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Oof. That's
a tough nut to crack.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
If you asked me,
I think fantasies

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
of forbidden love and
longing are super-duper hot!

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks for your input.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
By the way, how far have
you gotten with Shoma?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm...?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Well... Something
happened the other day.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Wait. For real?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] He gave me a kiss
on the cheek with his lips!

What are you, five?

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Real talk--
what's your plan, broski?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
'Cause life on the
streets ain't easy.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
True. I guess I need
a place to crash, huh?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Wish I could help out.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
Too bad I have a cousin
staying over at my place.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
Ah. I wouldn't wanna be a jerk

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
and interrupt whatever's
going on with your family.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
Then you're welcome
to spend the night at my place!

friendship with benefi--

Whoa!

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
A sleepover with Koharu. Huh...?

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your offer,
but the risk is too high.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
How could I be so dumb?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
She was right under
my nose this whole time.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Oh. 'Sup, dude.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh... Hey.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
I pulled an all-nighter.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
The shoujo comic
wasn't coming out right.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
So, I thought I'd switch
it up a little and work on

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
some boy's love instead.
And then it was dawn.

Wow, you're like
my guardian angel.

Relax, bro, it's just a snack.

What's the sitch?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, nothing. A tiff with Mizuha.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
Well, it's you
we're talking about,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure it was
something pervy

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
that involves peeping
or underwear.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
I know you are, but what am I?

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
A guy with sister issues.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
You got that right.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
Eh. Fights can happen no matter
how close you are to someone.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Me and my mom
butt heads all the time.

[KEIKI]
Really?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
I think that's
how it is with family.

--[gasps]
--[KEIKI] Huh. Weird.

But I feel like we don't
usually fight too often.

[MAO] Maybe she's
just putting up with you.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
That girl always
goes with the flow.

[KEIKI]
Heh. You've got a point there.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50% align:center
[MAO] She's popular,
y'know. Boys love her.

[KEIKI]
Huh.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
[MAO] She's cute,
but she's also down to earth.

to help everyone she meets.

[MAO] Right. Time to
get back to drawing.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
Cool. Thanks for the munchies!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Keep your chin up, okay?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Why am I helping him?
So much for getting in his way.

Ouch, my back...

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Where are you?

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Dear Mister Keiki Kiryu.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
I am in love with you.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
Sure. I get it.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you've only ever
thought of me as a sibling.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
But for me, it's different.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
I've always seen you
as so much more.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hold on. So she was adopted?

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[FATHER]
Yes, that's right.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] How come you
never told me until now?

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
[FATHER] Why does it matter?
Who cares about DNA?

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
Either way, she's our family.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
That's deep.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
[FATHER]
Come to think of it.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
I think she's my favorite,
hands down.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wow, thanks a lot, Pops.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Since childhood...

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
...people often said
we didn't look alike.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
But secretly,
I enjoyed hearing that.

My dearest Mizuha Kiryu.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
I never imagined
it could've been you.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
Even in my wildest dreams,

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
you definitely
weren't Undierella.

It's raining...

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Honestly. I still can't
wrap my head around this.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
[GUY 12A]
Watch it.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
You're always so kind.

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
I love spending time with you,
even mundane things

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
like walking to class.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
I was so excited we got
in to the same school.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
When Mom and Dad were busy,

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
I remember how
you were there for me.

[bell chiming]

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] After we started
living on our own,

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but feel
butterflies in my chest.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
It's late. I gotta start dinner.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Day by day,
I would accept you

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
as a part of my life.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
But...

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
...I yearned for something
more than what we had.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
So...

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
In the end...

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
No matter what
happens after this.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
...we won't be able to go
back to how we once were.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
--Because you're my...

[MIZUHA]
Because you're my brother.

What the-- Oh, no...

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.304 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

[MIZUHA] You're definitely
running a fever.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
I'll go make you
some porridge, all right?

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center

on an empty tummy!

Urgh. I'm sorry.

Finally! You're awake!

How are you feeling now?

[KEIKI]
What are you doing here...?

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
I ran into
your sister at the store.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
She mentioned that
you were bedridden.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Didn't mean to trouble you...

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, we have
to look out for each other.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
Let me take care of you!

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Hold on.
What are you trying to pull?

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I'm keeping my master
warm like a good little doggie.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
Silly!

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Huh... I'd say it's
getting more hot than warm.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI chuckles] Look at you,
you're red as a tomato!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ah! That's the fever!

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
Sayuki?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
You always come to my rescue
whenever I'm in trouble.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
So, when I saw a chance
to return the favor,

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
I had to pounce on it!

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
I can't do much,
but I can stay by your side.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet of you.

[SAYUKI] That being said...
If it makes you feel better,

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
you may bury your face in
the comfort of my cleavage.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
Ugh, way to ruin the moment.

Wait! No, not again!

How do you keep ending up

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
in these situations?

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
I guess all that
"rescuing" really wore her out.

[door clicks]

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center

doing well, for a sicko.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] What'id you do
to Sleeping Booby?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you
tell me why you came--

[coughs]

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
Aw. You sound
so helpless and pitiful!

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
What a beautiful
symphony of suffering!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I really don't have
the energy for this crap.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Here you go!
It's a "get well soon" present!

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh. Thanks.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
I was worried you
might feel bored while

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
you were resting up.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
So, I thought I'd pick out
some books for you to read.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
Welp... Looks like it's time
for me to take out the trash!

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait a sec!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.002 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Ow!

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what on earth?

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
Rise and shine, you busty witch!

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Oh, great. It's you.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
I wasn't expecting
this to happen.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
I came over 'cause
you texted me, remember?

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
You said Keiki was defenseless,
so we should try to mount him

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
while he was down for the count.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
Oh, really now?

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Don't look
at me with those eyes!

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
It was only a joke!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. Anyway, I'm taking care
of the caretaking now.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
So begone with your
blanket-burgling ways,

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
Chesty McBreastyson.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
Watch your tongue!

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
Is it possible
for you girls to stop

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
bickering all the time?

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Good idea.
I propose a little truce.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] You'll name your
terms and conditions, first.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
Fine. This time,
I get to spoon him softly!

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
Then I can keep him toasty.
Just like the obedient pet I am.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
Too bad you'll
never be able to satisfy him

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
with that ironing board
you've got there!

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
You should be ashamed
for seducing him with

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
those droopy jigglejoggers,
you witchy cow!

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
Y'know...

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
The two of you are starting
to make me feel worse.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] A double serving
of shame? Really?

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.941 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Come on, that's enough.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
The boy is sick,
so let him rest already!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Sayuki, Yuika,
Nanjo, and Fujimoto.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
None of them were Undierella,

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
but they were all
totally sweet babes.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
And absolute perverts.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ah. Guess it's naptime again.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
[FATHER] She's a new
member of our family.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
A girl?

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
[FATHER]
Yes. You're older than her.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
That makes her
your little sister.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Sister?

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
Hi. What's your name?

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
[whispering]
It's Mizu...

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Mizuha.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Mizuha? Cute name!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
I'm Keiki! I'm your big brother!

Keiki? Brother?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
Yup! We're family!

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Right. How could I forget?

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
When we met... I made a promise.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA whimpers]

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sorry! I apologize!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
I really thought this
room would be empty!

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Hey. A-Are you sure
you should be out of bed?

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The fever finally broke.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
I'm so glad to hear that.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
Just please be careful, okay?

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
I gotcha. I'll take it easy.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA chuckles]
Someone's acting grown-up.

[blow dryer whirrs]

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] So how was that
threesome you had today?

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh, my. Is it me,
or do you sound upset?

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Do I? You must
be hearing things.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
That's strange.
Why am I having déjà vu?

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Don't forget
you were mine, first!

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmph.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
To be honest,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
I thought they were gonna
take you away from me.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Anyway. I'm sorry.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For what?

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
It's my fault
that you got so sick.

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't've
scared you like that.

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nah. I was being way immature.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Don't worry, though.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
I'll quit making advances
since you don't like it.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
But once I get you
to fall in love with me,

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely make
sure to make up for it.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Great.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
can I ask you something?

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Hmm? What is it?

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
I wanna know--

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
How long have you
felt this way about me?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Well. I began feeling this
when way I first met you.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
I can never
forget what you said.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
I remember every single word.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
I lost the people
who I loved the most.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
I was all alone,
but then you spoke to me.

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Brother?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
Yep! We're family!

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
That's what we are forever!
We'll always be together.

Always together.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Always... together...

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] That simple phrase.
I really liked how it sounded.

[KEIKI sighs]

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center

Both of us living together.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
Eating our meals together.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Watching TV together.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it meant getting
into fights over nothing.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
But in the end,
we always made up.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
After everything we've done,

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
how could I not fall for you?

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
always being there for me.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
I love you!

the point of no return.

No take-backs.

A long time ago, I made her
a promise--"always together."

[KEIKI]
I won't abandon her.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
I've made up my mind.
I will always...

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
...be her brother.

enough to be up and about.

Well. It's all thanks to you.

Some of us grew up...

Okay, I know it's
a mid-summer school day,

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
but don't slack off!

Peace!

if girls ever got the urge
to go clammando sometimes?

we were cleaning the clubroom.

It was getting
sweaty downstairs,

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.408 position:50% align:center
so I took out my spare panties.

before I could wear 'em.

to how this whole mess began.
