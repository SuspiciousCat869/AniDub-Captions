Whoa... Hmm... Heh.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
Keiki...

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI] Yeah...
--Oh, Keiki...

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
--[KEIKI] Uh-huh...
--Kiryu.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.022 position:50% align:center
--Keiki!
--[KEIKI screams]

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
Good morning... You okay?

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] What are you
doing in my bed, Mizuha?!

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA chuckles]
Man. For a second,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
I thought you were gonna attack
me in your sleepy stupor. Ha-ha!

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Just because
you sleep-walk into

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
your brother's bed
doesn't mean I'd do that.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
Check it out! My luck with
romance is great today!

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
[TV VOICE 01A]
Libras, watch out!

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
You might have a terrible day!

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.675 position:50% align:center
A sudden request for a favor...

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yup. I really want a girlfriend.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
[OKITA] By applying the
rules we discussed earlier,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
the passage becomes much
easier to understand.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What does Sayuki need from me?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Hey, Keiki?

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:17.994 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] We don't put
much stock in our days

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
spent here in high
school, do we?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.166 position:50% align:center
But years from now,
we may look back and think

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
it was easily the
best time of our lives.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Why, then, do we
waste this precious time

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
on pointless chores like
cleaning the club room?

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.887 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Might have something to
do with you trashing the place.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Appropriate.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] If I have to be clean
for the rest of my life.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.644 position:50% align:center
Kill me!

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] If you didn't
wait to clean until now,

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
this wouldn't be so hard.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.190 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Like it's any
of your business, Koga.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
You're not even
part of the club.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
Chill, she's helping!

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But it's just
'cause I can't stand by

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.906 position:50% align:center
while you suffer the
tyranny of this evil witch!

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.157 position:50% align:center
--I'm fine!
--[MAO] Can we just shut up,

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
--do this, and go home?
--Rude much?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.871 position:50% align:center
[MAO] No one wants to
be here. So let's hurry.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
This mess is ridiculous.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
I called a clean freak.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:06.960 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Excuse me.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
This is worse than I thought.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
But it's okay!

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
I'll have this place
spotless in no time!

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd be eager
to help when you saw it.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
All right.
Let's get this done!

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Wow.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Well, that was awful.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, and your fault.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.095 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] I think we did
a pretty good job.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
Thanks for helping out, Mizuha.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Yikers.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
What, a brother can't pamper
his helpful little sister?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA giggles]

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I can't be the only one
who wants to go take a bath.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
You're not.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
That's funny?

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center
No. It's just, this is... fun.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
All of us working together,

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
getting ink on us
in the process.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
I don't think we'll
look back on this

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
and call it a waste of time.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
[ALL laugh]

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Lemme put these
last things away.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Oh. No, I can
do that, at least.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]
You sure?

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
It looks like you have
bags under your eyes.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
Wh-What? No, I don't!

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Why would you tell
such an obvious lie?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess, I'd say you
were up late finishing

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
your submission for that
contest and lost sleep.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
All right, all right.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
Just make sure you lock
the door, 'kay? [yawns]

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
Welp. You're all free
to get out of here, now.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Should I wait then? Or...

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
No need.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you want to get
home and shower, too.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA sighs]
Yeah. I probably should.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I'm headin' out as well.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Later.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
I'll see you at home, Keiki!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
See ya.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA grunts]

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
[OKITA] Nice work with
the student council today.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
--[GUY 01A] Seriously?
--[GIRL 01A] I know, right?

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Damn normies and
their happy relationships.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I really want a girlfriend.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For me?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wait. No way.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Here we go!

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It is! A love letter.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:32.374 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Oh, hell yeah!

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
This is unbelievable!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting my entire
adolescent existence for this!

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
It's time for me to move
beyond my joyless, single life!

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
But... Who's it from?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
And what's this?

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
P-P-P-P-P...

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
Panties...?!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, Shoma.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
What do you think the whole
panties part's about?

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Hmm... Maybe she was in
a hurry, and they just fell.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
Y'know?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
I dunno what world you live in,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like you
gotta buy tighter briefs.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
I think we should
be focusing on the fact

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
that your admirer
didn't sign their name.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
Do you think it could
just be a prank, then?

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
Hard to say.
That'd be kinda immature.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
I have to wonder if someone
our age would go for that.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, good point.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
Maybe she just straight up
forgot to sign the damn thing.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
We're dealing with quite
the clumsy Undierella, then.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
What does "Undierella" mean?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
You know, like Cinderella?

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
She just happened
to drop her underwear

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
instead of a glass slipper.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
That's a terrible name!

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
If you don't want
my help, that's fine, too,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
Prince Charming.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
You're better
than no help, I guess.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
Since you found
the letter in your club room,

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
that narrows down
the list of suspects.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Likely, your Undierella
was part of the cleaning crew.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
Think so?!

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
Aww... I hate you.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Just kidding. I'm positive, man.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
You better not
just be saying that.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] We've got the beautiful
and busty upperclassmen,

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Sayuki Tokihara.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
The cute and honest
underclassmen, Yuika Koga.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
The friendly
and approachable classmate,

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
Mao Nanjo.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
And the caring
younger sister, Mizuha Kiryu.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] That's gonna be
a yikes from me, dog.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] One of these three
girls is your Undierella.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Wait, did you seriously
just get a royal flush?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Nobody could have
gotten inside the club room

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
after you locked
the doors yesterday.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
So maybe you should take
a look around there.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
You might find some clues
that could help us.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Morning!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Oh. Thanks for
bringing the key back!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center

So not that.

There's gotta be
some other, natural way

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
to get it out of her.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center

her on a date I guess?
