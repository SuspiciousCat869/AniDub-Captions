When I first noticed her,

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
she was just standing
there all by herself.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but
wonder if it was true.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She had this cold look,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
that insinuated nothing
could possibly faze her.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why she didn't
get along with everybody.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
Except...

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
That time was different
than the others.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] And I felt I had to do
something I'd never done before.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Those words were
the first I'd ever exchanged

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
with my classmate, Mao Nanjo.

Previously, on Hensuki!

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I was kidnapped by Yuika
and tied up while she and Sayuki

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.936 position:50% align:center
fought over me in the weirdest
perv-off I've ever seen!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.479 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, Nanjo
swooped in and saved me,

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
but then demanded that
I stay away from other girls.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.817 position:50% align:center
Does that mean what
I think it means?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.278 position:50% align:center

What's up, Mao?
Beautiful morning, huh?

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
Sure is. I should get going.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]
Later.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
Man, felt like
I could cut the tension

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
between you two with a knife.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Ya think?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's how
it looked to me.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I think I took
things too far yesterday.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for apologizing.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
Oh, but don't worry. I have no
intention of giving up on you!

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
I'd actually
really prefer you did.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I can't help but notice

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
that you and Mao
seem pretty close.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
We do?

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Obviously!

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
I mean, she's got a frown
perma-glued to her face.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
And the only time I ever
see her smile is around you.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
Maybe.
She's a tough nut to crack.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I guess. The situation
just has me uneasy.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
So you should try to make
things right with her, 'kay?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?
You seem surprised.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just weird
for you to act so nice

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
after all the slave talk
you've been dishing out.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
Ah. You're so silly!

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center

that a good master

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] About yesterday...
Was Nanjo mad at you?

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Yeah, maybe a little.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I thought so.
I saw her in the hall earlier.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
She seemed more
stoic than usual.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry. It's my fault.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Koga and I behaved
terribly yesterday,

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
and we shouldn't do
that stuff in public.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
I'll try to be better.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center

have some common sense.

Huh, wow.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
Instead, I'll just
do it in private!

I'll behave myself.

wanna talk about it.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] No problem. It was nice
spending time with you guys.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Both of us?

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
[MAO] I suppose our relationship
is fun, for what it is.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
But I'm not sure that's how
I really want it to stay.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
It's like, I don't know, it
feels insufficient somehow.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
I was wondering...

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
What do you think
if we moved forward?

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
And ditched the trio thing
for a couple thing?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
You mean...

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Man, stupid rain!

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
[MAO, KEIKI panting]

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
[MAO sighs]
That was unexpected.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's definitely crazy.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
[MAO gasps]
Were you checking me out?!

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, can you blame me?

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Also, have they
always been that huge?

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Ew, can you not?

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Tell me something.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
What the heck is going on
between you, Sayuki, and Yuika?

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh, what now?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
[MAO] It looked like
they were fighting over you

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
pretty hard yesterday.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] What happened to not
wanting to talk about things?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Spill it.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
Well, the truth is,
it isn't what you think.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
They're just
comfortable around me.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Okay then.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, is dating girls
something you think about?

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah. I'd be
lying if I said I didn't.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
Of course. You perv.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
How so?

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
They were draped over you like
a wet towel and you loved it!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
That's not true!
It wasn't even like that!

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
Your face was all pervy, too!

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense!

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Says the perv!

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
You snuck a peek. So there.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well. That doesn't count.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
'Cause it was involuntary.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Okay, that's it! Everyone!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
Watch out for Sergeant
Perv and his X-ray vision!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
Stop making such a scene!

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
--It's embarrassing!
--Help! He's a sex animal!

--[KEIKI giggles]
--What now?

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
Just that sneeze was so weird.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
So's your face.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
I'll get us something
warm to drink.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
I guess... hot cocoa.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Sure thing.

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
My hands, my hands, my hands.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ah, I get it now.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nanjo, do you like Shoma?

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[MAO gasps]

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
No! You've got it all wrong!

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
If ya do, it's cool.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
I don't! I'm telling the truth!

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
I'm not interested
in Akiyama like that.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well... I...

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Sorry. I gotta go!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What just happened?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
With an expression like that...

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
I can't help but
get the wrong idea.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Oh, you're home.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're soaked.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm? Yeah...

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
Now I feel bad that
I took the first bath.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Don't.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For you.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Ah! [giggles]

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Thank you.
It's tasty when it's so cold.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center

It's colder than I thought.

who falls asleep
wherever they like.

Y'know, did anything happen
when you walked Mao home?

Yeah, uh, sort of.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
I went from being her friend
to being Sergeant Perv.

Huh?

What's wrong?

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Um, nothing.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] You're spacing
out and working sloppy.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
If you ever need to talk to
anyone, I'm happy to listen.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Sayuki.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
But... I'll be okay.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Well, in the meantime
I suppose I'll just have to

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
bask in the neglect you've
been inflicting upon me.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I hate to state the obvious,

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
but your book
seems to be upside down.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
Stop me if I'm wrong,

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
but patching things up with
Mao didn't go too well, huh?

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
Ugh, For real? It's pretty
inconsiderate to make your

If you don't make up with Mao,
then I'll have to punish you.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center

I know.

them bigger, right?

Yeah...

of a younger sister to pamper

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
Kinda hard to pin down.
I think she's hiding something.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what it was.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
So I asked her about it
and she got mad.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
All I know is...

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
...I really hurt her feelings.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't force it
if she doesn't want to talk.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
Understand?

[KEIKI grunts]

You can be close to someone
and not know what to say.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
I think it's also tough
to open up to a friend

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
when you care about them a lot.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, you may be right.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
But... this sucks.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
I wanna help her.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
I wanna know her better.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
Doesn't sound like you're
ready to give up just yet, huh?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
No.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
Then obviously, you need to
make things right with Nanjo.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
How do I do that?

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
I think you should
do whatever it takes

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
to get back on her good side!

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
No, duh!

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
Listen, I really doubt you
need to do anything special.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
if you just be yourself,

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
the right thing to do
will come naturally.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah.
