00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] I've always loved
gazing at the stars.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
Whenever I feel down, I just
look up at the night sky.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
Any problems I have
feel way insignificant

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
compared to the constellations.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
One day, while observing,

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
I discovered a light shining
up at me right here on Earth.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
His name was Shoma Akiyama.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
I was so captivated.
So thankful for him.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
A star of the
brightest magnitude.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
And I was the only one
who could see it.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
Previously, on Hensuki!

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
When I met Ayano Fujimoto,

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd finally
found my Undie-rella.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50% align:center
But she's a pervert, too.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
Yet again, I'm back on a
Panty Quest to find true love.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
Come on, I don't have time
to keep sniffing around.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
I need to take care of
another important mission!

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Sure sounds like you have

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
a lot on going on right now.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, what's that?

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
Looks like you got a little
sauce on your cheek.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.108 position:50% align:center
Oops, didn't realize.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.110 position:50% align:center
Hold still for a sec,
okie dokes?

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
There, nice and clean.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Aww, thanks a bunch.
You're such a sweetheart...

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.992 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I might as well
be invisible to them.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
Just as planned!

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
All part of Operation:
Koharu Is a First-Year.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm here
eating chicken nuggets.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.834 position:50% align:center
Sure looks like
they're getting chummy.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
So far, so good.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
Although, Otori's
still hiding her age.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
Actually, that's the only reason
we've even made it this far.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
When Shoma finds out the truth,

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
his [coughs] passion for
the petite might take over

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50% align:center
and make him lose interest.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
My job is to play
undercover cupid

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
and make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
I needa make one last push
to help them seal the deal.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
Here goes nothing.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU, SHOMA laugh]

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Wait. You wanna
go on a double date?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
I thought it over, and it's your
best bet for the next move.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That's a genius idea!
I knew you'd pull through.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
You're a wiz when it comes
to this romance stuff.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I sure get around. Even
if it's only in my dreams...

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] If I'd known you
went out for chicken nuggets,

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
I would've made something else

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
instead of fried
chicken, you dummy.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I wonder who I should
take on this group shindig.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
Maybe Yuika?

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.389 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Lala, lala, laa!

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] My, you're
looking cute as always!

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
What? Oh, thank you.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
That's so kind of you to say!

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's way too risky.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
How 'bout Fujimoto?

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] Kiryu smells all right,
but I'd be silly to resist

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
your intoxicating
post-workout scent.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI
Like that would go well.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Maybe Nanjo, then?

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Shouto doesn't like
chicks, it isn't canon!

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Nope. That means
there's only one other option.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Good grief.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
If you're going to steal food,

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
could you at least pretend
to be sneaky about it?

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
This is nice. Thank you
for taking me out.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's not like
I had a choice.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
Everything okay?
You look nervous.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] G-Gee. I-Is it
really th-that obvious?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
Well, the walk is a giveaway.
And your voice is shaking.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
You need to chillax, girl.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
Can't say I expected to see
her here. What a surprise.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
Wow, I didn't realize you and
Otori already knew each other.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] We were in the
same first-year class.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
I'm doing well, thanks!

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
Always a pleasure,
Mister Akiyama!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Why is she talking like that?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
Y'know, kinda weird
for a third-year--

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whoa!

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
What's goin' on?

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Nothing much!

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Sayuki's always
crackin' lame jokes

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
and someone has
to stop her, right?

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Ah, so business as usual.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] So she's pretending to
be younger to get with Akiyama,

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
the "pursuer of the petite"?

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yep.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] And he hasn't
realized that she's actually

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
an upperclassman?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's the gist of it.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Mh-hm, mh-hm.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
I'll accept this taiyaki
as hush money.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
Whatever keeps you quiet.
Thank you very much.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.786 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way,

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
I probably should've
said it earlier,

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
but this is the first time
I've gone bowling.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
Can't say I expected
this development.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
I'm not a big fan of
physical activities.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
Huh? I had no idea sports
weren't your thing.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
Wait, then why'd you show
up in the first place?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, it's because...

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
...you invited me,
so I wanted to come.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
Loyal dogs always
follow commands.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
Even difficult ones, like
fighting bears or sharks!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, you can't
compare that to bowling.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
Also, I'm still not
your master, okay?

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Ooh, I know!

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
How 'bout we try
and spice things up?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
Whoever ends up scoring
lowest will pay a penalty!

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
That does raise the stakes.
But are you sure?

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
After all, you've
never gone bowling.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
Irrelevant. All I
need is to win.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
This is hopeless.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
She's basically digging her
own grave at this point.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
We all know how this
is gonna turn out.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Hmph. We'll
have to see about that.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
When it comes to sports, I may
be a lost cause, or whatever,

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
but lucky for me, there's Otori!

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
Huh? How am I gonna help you?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's no possible way
she's good at this either.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
Seriously, can you can
even hold a bowling ball

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
with such a tiny body?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
Size isn't a problem.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
There are light ones
I can play with.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
There's no turning back now.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
So, what's the
loser's punishment?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
I say whoever wins first place

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
gets to draw on
the loser's face.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
Obviously, no washing off
till they get home.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks, I hate it.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Also, whoever's
in third place has to obey

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
a single order from the winner.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
Isn't that worse than the
penalty for coming in last?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
I'm up for the challenge.
Are you ready to go all in?

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
Sure! I'm down if you are!

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
Game on.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU giggles]

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Yay, I did it!

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
That was incredible!

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
My father loves bowling.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
I'm at the lanes with
my family all the time.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Ha! No wonder!
You're a beast.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
Spare me.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Somehow, I didn't expect you

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.487 position:50% align:center
to be worse than me at this.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] I've never been
able to throw much more

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
than gutter balls.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Um, if you'd like,
I'd be more than happy

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
to show you a few pointers.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
I'd love to get coached
by a pro like you!

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Um, is this right?

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Hmm...

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
Your center of balance
needs a little adjusting.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
Try doing... that!

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
Ah. Mission success.
Take a look at that.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh, she's been
filming this whole time.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Am I an enabler? Should I be
supporting this romance?

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Can I ask you something?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Go ahead!

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
I know you said that hoodie
was for sun protection,

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
so why are you
wearing it inside?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
Uh! Uh, well, I...

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause, uh...

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
I'm ashamed of how
flat my chest is.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA yelps]

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
Hey, did you hear that?!

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
She's so modest,
my heart's thumping!

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
That's awesome.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
We've all got our quirks, now
let's forget about the hoodie.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU sighs]

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.928 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Man, I still
couldn't beat you, Keiki.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You should get your tutor

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
to coach you again sometime.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
Dude, sign me up.
Would you wanna take me on?

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan!

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Since you've won the game,

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
it's time for you to figure out
what to do with Shoma.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
You did great.
Go easy on me, huh?

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Whatever you do,
don't hold anything back.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
You should be as unreasonably
merciless as you can.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
Not another peep from the
loser's corner, please.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Here goes.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
This is my official request.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
Starting now...

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
...I order you to let me call
you "Sho-Sho" from now on!

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA screams]

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Keiki.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
I think that I'm so happy
I could literally die.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Don't hold back on my account.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry. I didn't ask
for too much, did I?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
No! I'd love it if
you'd called me that!

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
Yay! Then that
settles the matter.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
I'mma call you by your
nickname from this point on.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
All right, "Sho"?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA screams]

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What's got you smiling?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
Did something good happen today?

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
You could say that!

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
I'm excited 'cuz
Sho-Sho invited me

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
to spend some time with him
during the next school holiday!

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
Nice. When'd that happen?

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
We talk and text each other

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
more and more every day!

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Seems like you're pretty close.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Guess they're
somewhere between friends

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
and something more.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya know?

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
I suppose my services
are no longer required.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Hey, Kiryu? Thanks a bunch.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
I thought that I
didn't have a chance

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
until you came up with the
plan to hide my ribbon.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
I never would've made it this
far if it weren't for you.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
You made my dream come true.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
I'm so much closer to him now.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
Nothing seems
impossible anymore.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
I didn't really do
anything though.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
My helping you was selfish.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
I just wanted that
photo deleted.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Oh. I see.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
Well, I erased that old thing

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
as soon as you promised
to help me out with this.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
What? Why'd you do that?

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you just didn't
seem like the type of guy

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
who would break his promises.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
After all, you're friends
with my darling,

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
so obviously you're a good dude.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
That's a bold assumption.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Anyway, I've been
relying on you too much,

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
so it's time for me to step up.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, yeah?

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Today's the day.
I'm not backing down!

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Afterall, I'm even wearing
my lucky pink panties!

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
Your lucky pink what-now?

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
It's a thing that all the female
students do for insurance.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
When you're confessing your
love to that special person,

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
wearing pink underwear
might increase your chances

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
they'll return your feelings.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
Huh. You learn something
new every day.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
Wait, if you're sportin' those
undies right now, then...

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
I wanna be brave.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
There's so much I need to
say that's hiding inside.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
The person Shoma's been getting
to know isn't the real me.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
I'm done with all
the pretending.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
What are you planning on doing?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
I'm going to tell him
the truth about how I feel.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
This time, I'll show him
the girl I really am.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
What's up, Koharu?

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
Good afternoon!

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
I was wondering, would you
like to walk home with me?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
Now it feels like I'm
the one doing the stalking.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. Was there a particular
movie you wanted to see, or...?

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? You okay?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what
happened here?

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
It was almost a year ago.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
The first time we ever met was
by the trees on this sidewalk.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
On that day,

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
there was a strong wind
that took my hat away,

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
but it somehow
brought me to you.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Wait, a blue ribbon?

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
I hope you can
forgive me for lying.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to get as close
to you as I possibly could.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
From the first time I ever laid
my eyes on you, I've always...

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
I've always been in
love with you, Shoma!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
I'm so sorry. I really am.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
I'm just not into older girls.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
So I don't think this
would ever work.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Hey. How's it hangin'?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
You must be well-endowed
because that was a dick move.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
You saw all that, huh?

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
Sure did.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth, she asked me

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
to play matchmaker for the
two of you, and I agreed.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
So that's how it went.
Makes a lotta sense.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] She looked rough.
Was she crying?

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center
My dude, did you have any clue
how serious her feelings were

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
when she was spilling
them to you?

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She was nervous.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
Had butterflies every
time she saw you.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You don't know the half of it.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
It took her an entire year

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
to even muster up the
courage to say hello.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI, SHOMA laugh]

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, man. Okay, okay.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
...flunk the chemistry test.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah, same here.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Hey, ball is life, brah.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] She spent all that time
figuring out the right way

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
to tell you how she felt.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
And all you could say was
she's "too old for you"?

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
Do you think that stupid reason
is gonna fly in this scenario?

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
Everyone has their preferences.
You can go out with whoever.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
It's not my place to
tell you what to do.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
Still, you found a great
person who might be the one,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
but she's one year
older, so no dice?

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Heh. You're being
way too easy on me, Cakes.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
The girl I ran into on
the sidewalk one year ago?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
I never forgot who she was.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
She was so adorable.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
I hoped someday I
would run into her

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
and be her Prince
Charming again.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It sounds creepy
when you put it that way.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Unfortunately, that
was the only time I saw her.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That checks out.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't bump into someone

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
if they were secretly
following you around.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] I had no clue the girl
from back then was Koharu.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
And when I broke her heart,
I ended up breaking my own, too.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
I've had to turn down a
few girls in the past,

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
and it never felt great,

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
but this time feels
completely different.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
Like my heart is in my stomach.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
No one's ever torn me up
so badly like this girl.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] A star of the
brightest magnitude.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
And I was the only
one who could see it.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It was fun, wasn't it?
Hanging out with her?

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Yeah.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You know why that is?

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do
with her looks or age.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause of who she is.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
I know that.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
It's not like I can
always stay this way.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
I gotta get over myself.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU crying]

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be here.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Even after all your
planning and encouragement,

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
I still ended up getting burned.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
You did everything
you possibly could.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
Shoma's the only one
to blame for this.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
I... Maybe I had it coming.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Why is that? Because
you've got a lousy year on him?

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
That's balls.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Well, I guess...
you have a point.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
He might look like a pretty boy,

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
but he's totally rotten
on the inside.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
I mean, he says stuff like,
"Ooh, a delicious flat chest!"

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
with a straight face!

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
That's cringy.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
I suppose some of
the things he says

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
can come off rather insensitive.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
And when a poor girl steps up
to confess her feelings to him,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
he goes, "no, muh fetish!"

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
What kinda stupid
response is that?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
Way too pathetic of him,
don't you think?

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Yes. I agree with you!

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
Pathetic! That was
beyond hurtful to say!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That idiot is missing out!

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
Dating older people has
all sorts of benefits!

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
That's so true!

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Marrying an older woman is a
classic formula for success!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
And what's with the fascination
with itty bitty tiddies, anyway?

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Bigger is better, you dummy!

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] No way! Small
boobs are lowkey poppin'

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
'cause itty bitty
tiddies are the tits!

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
Society's too
obsessed with youth!

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
We need to stop
fetishizing younger girls!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
True dat! It's a problematic
issue that has conseque--!

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA clears throat]

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Sho... Sho?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
You have a point,
but you mind slowin' down?

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
I thought I felt bad before,
but now it's even worse.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
It's all a big misunderstanding!

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
I wasn't trying to bully you
behind your back or anything!

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
I was only airing out all the
shitty aspects about you!

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
That's all, I swear!

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Now you're just being
brutally honest, Koharu.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
Listen, to tell you the truth,
I enjoy being around you.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
I do like younger girls,

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
but I was thinking,
maybe with you,

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
that could start to change.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
You see, I sort of need someone
to help me work on myself.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm trying to say
you could be that person.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
I'd like to help. But how?

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
If you wanted, maybe we could...

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could start off by
being friends or something!

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
Said like a generic protagonist.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
I'm disappointed, but I
can't say I'm surprised.

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
You wanna be friends?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
Or do you just wanna
avoid commitment,

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
while lacking the balls
to turn me down properly,

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
keeping me in limbo?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that would make you

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
the worst person ever.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA yelps]

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
You truly are the
lowest of the low.

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
The lowest of the low.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
Yeah. True. I'm the
absolute worst. Totally.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
How bout'chu don't kick me
while I'm down, 'kay, broski?

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
Couldn't help it. Sorry.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.240 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU giggles]

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
Relax, I'm just teasing.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
After what you put me through,

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
dumping me with that lame,
weak-ass excuse,

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
I feel more than entitled
to a little payback.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess you're right.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. Forgive me!

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Of course I will.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
Do you know how happy hanging
out with you makes me?

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
And yeah. I think it's best
if we start out as friends.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it. Thanks, Koharu.

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Well, congratulations.
You did it!

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Is it just me, or is it
super dark in here?

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it is.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
No, Shoma, wait!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
[wheezes]

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center

Huh...?

[groans]

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
Did you... take these?

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
Yep! I took every one
of these badboys myself!

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
Y'know... maybe...

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.527 position:50% align:center
...older women just
aren't for me after all.

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls. But I get'cha, fam.

It's time to discipline you...

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.546 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Sayuki or Yuika,

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:43.465 position:50% align:center
one of them has
