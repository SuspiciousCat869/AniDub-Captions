[OKITA]
Previously on Hensuki!

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.471 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Someone swiped
Undierella's panties

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.889 position:50% align:center
right out from under me.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
The masochist dog Sayuki
and the she-devil sadist Yuika

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
both came over, so they're
my prime suspects.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be one of them!

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50% align:center
I've almost got you
in my sights, Undierella!

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] You better
not be peeping! So rude!

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Today's the day.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
I've decided to bite the bullet
and give Sayuki what she wants

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
for the next several hours.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Depending on what happens,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
I might end up having
to make a huge decision.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
Ready or not.
Here we go.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
I'm the master now!

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
[GIRL laughs]

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.841 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Even if it's only for today,

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.343 position:50% align:center
having you as my owner
is a dream come true!

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50% align:center
You're not supposed to
go off on your own.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
A well-behaved dog
walks faithfully

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.100 position:50% align:center
alongside their human.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Right, I forgot! I'm so sorry.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
Also, you should
start addressing me by

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
my proper title,
which is "Master."

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
I understand, Master!

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Let's see...

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
What's the best way to
investigate this pound puppy?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI whimpers]

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
Wanna kick things off
with a roller coaster?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI gasps]

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50% align:center
What, is there a problem?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
No. It's just...

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
I'm wearing a skirt.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] There're plenty of other
girls wearing 'em, too,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
so what's your point?

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Well... You never
know what might happen.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Paranoid much?

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What'd I say?

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's hard to tell what
makes her feel embarrassed.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
Showing the goods should
be nothing to this weirdo.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wait a second. Maybe...

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
She's rocking the Undierella
panties right here, right now!

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
If I went through
that trouble to steal 'em,

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
I'd want to stash 'em
in a safe place.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
But her? She's a masochist!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be out of the
question for her keep 'em close.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
She'd chase any thrill
to get her rocks off.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It's a hunch
that's worth pursuing.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Eegh... I got you.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
You're not digging the whole
"goin' on a crazy ride" thing.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
--[SAYUKI sighs]
--[KEIKI] Too bad.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
--We're still doing it.
--[SAYUKI gasps]

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
Or was all that sub-dom
talk just for show?

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
Of course it wasn't. Let's go.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
As your pet, I'll follow you
to Hell and back.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] The air pressure
from the ride hydraulics

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
will blast her
skirt up and over.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Allowing me to discover
the secret that lies beneath.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
At least, I hope!

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI pants]

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
So skewwy...

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I've learned a hard lesson.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
Clothes don't fly off
on a roller coaster.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
So I take it you aren't
into thrill rides, huh?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI groans]

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That operation was a bust.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
But at least I got to experience
another side of her personality.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Next up, goin' down.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Y-Ye-Yes, Master!

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
A gust from below should work!

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Ugh, I can't sneak
a peek if I'm next to her.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
Maybe some centrifugal force?

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI yelling]

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]
Damn you, gravity!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
there's no guarantee
she's even got 'em on.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
Okay, we've had a moment
to relax, what's next?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
How about you decide
what ride we go on this time?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't wanna be
too mean to my pet

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
and make her
miserable, after all.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
You called me your pet. Heh.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
And I get to pick? In that case,
can we go on that one?

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] We're so high,
it's giving me butterflies!

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
We only just started moving up.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Maybe now's
a good time to take a break.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]
Wait. The farther up we ride...

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
the less visible
we are to the outside!

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
Now's my chance!

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
Oh! We're all alone,
so it's time to leash up!

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles] No one can see
us in the privacy of the clouds.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
And I've successfully
asserted my dominance.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect opportunity to
make her do whatever I please.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
Sayuki! I order you, lift up--

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Thank you for today, Master!

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI squeals, screams]

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Having you treat me this way

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
is all I've ever
wanted and more!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I still haven't
been able to secure a visual.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
And it's sunset.
Might as well quit.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
I've got a question.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
What made you hit me up for
some roleplay all of a sudden?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth,

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
I thought hanging out like this
would be a good way

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
to get to know you better.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Hmm?

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
You seemed so serious about it.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
Most of the time, you don't
take anything seriously.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
But when you asked me
to make you my pet,

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
I could tell you were
speaking from the heart.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
And it clicked. I had to be
serious about it, too.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
That why you studied so hard?

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What are you talking about?!

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Oh, don't play dumb.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
You totally researched
stuff about pet play!

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
So she knew all along.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
You're so sweet. Thank you.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Guess the mission
wasn't a total failure.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
It was nice to level up
my friendship with Sayuki.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
And see a whole new side of her.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, crap. We gotta book it!

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Huh? Where are we going now?

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
The contest...?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Special Selection.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
That means it's the best
one in the show, right?

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I suppose
that's one way to put it.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
Dude, that's amazing!

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
You are allowed to be proud
of yourself, you know.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
Come on, you put in
a buttload of effort.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
Did you forget already?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Congrats, you deserve it.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
I might enjoy
when you treat me meanly.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
But I also like it
when you're kind.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
You're welcome. I think.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I've been wondering,

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
what made you think
I was "master" material?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
I first sensed you
could be the one

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
the day you joined
the Calligraphy Club.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but grow fond of
that sweet underclassman.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
He'd always come by to visit me.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
Anyway. That's when
I began to hope

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
there was a chance you'd
accept me for who I really am.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
And then I got turned down.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
I know it was surprising,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
but I'll never regret
asking to be your pet,

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
misunderstanding or not.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Keiki, in my heart,
it was always you.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Paw!

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
Would you hold my hand?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center

beneath that white fabric?

What is it?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
Your skirt.

came to my troubled mind

was "Run away." But it was late,

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center

the bottomless bottom.

Yeah? 'Bout what?

All out there.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] When I got home and
had a moment to calm down,

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
I realized how embarrassing
it was to do that.

realized that before

I can't deny it was exciting.

But I'll avoid leaving the house
without them for a while.

doing that for eternity.

And you know...

Anyway. That's all.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center

Sure put my foot
in it this time.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
She's giving me the cold
shoulder treatment again,

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
and I thought it was because I
made her expose herself,

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
but maybe not?

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
You must care
about her a whole lot

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
--if this is still on your mind.
--[KEIKI] Huh?

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
Look at yourself.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
At this rate, you'll go
crazy trying to figure out

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
what's the matter.

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Come on, the answer's
right in front of you, broski

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
It's pretty obvious.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
I believe the only thing
left to consider is

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
what you want to do next, Kiryu.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Let's see...

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
The answer's as clear as day.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
It always has been!

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
I wanna bring that smile back to
her face and make sure it stays.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
Okay! I'm going
to go talk to Sayuki!

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
[thunder rumbles]

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh, hey, Sayuki.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I'm done. I've reached my limit.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
I tried so hard to hold
myself back for you.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
But I can't.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] You've been
all over Koga lately.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
You give her so much of
your time and affection.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I'm just
left alone in the dust.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
You... heartless beast!

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I never meant to hurt you.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I admit, she's sweet and petite.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
Her boobless-ness caters to your
newfound taste for unripe fruit.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
Not true! Bigger is better.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I know that.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you're only
playing hard to get.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
Ah-- Hold the phone!
Hard to get? Since when?

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Well... Think back.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
When you walked me
home the other night,

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
you were such a tease!

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
I was totally ready for a
healthy spanking after

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
you caught me running
around commando all day!

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
I was counting on it.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI growls]

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] So I figured this
was part of your plan.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
A plan to stretch out the game.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
That's the stretch!

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I realized you
raise the expectations,

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
but you stop every time
you're about to deliver.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Then you focus every bit
of attention on Koga.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
It's because you want
me to be jealous.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
In fact, I bet you're
getting off watching me squirm

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
this very instant!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Gross!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
Wait. Do you mean
to tell me this is the reason

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
you've been acting
cuckoo lately?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
You think this is all some
elaborate kinky plot

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
to blue-ball you?

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.578 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's correct.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Guess the joke's on
me for showing concern.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Wait. Now I can
follow through

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
with the original mission.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
Whoever sent the love
letter still refuses to come out

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
and show themselves.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
And Sayuki is definitely
the prime suspect.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
However... I doubt she's gonna

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
give herself up willingly.
Investigating is pointless.

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
Right. Only one option left!

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
What's the question?

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
Listen. I'm gonna be blunt.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Are you the thief who took the
underwear from my bedroom?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Answer, yes or no.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
If she's the real Undierella,

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
she's probably not going
down without a fight.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Yes. It appears
you've finally found me out.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[thunder cracks]

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So...

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
Uh, you saying what
I think you're saying?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
Bingo.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
You're looking at the girl
who stole a treasure from

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
the sanctity of your chambers.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] At long last, I've
caught her red-handed!

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
In fact, I happen to be
wearing them at this moment!

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
[thunder cracks]

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ah! Not again!

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm...?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh. Boxers.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, those are mine!

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
How?! Why?! Explain!

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
What in the world are
you doing with those?!

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
It was a crime of passion.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
I found them when I was
sniffing around for dirty books

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
in your room while
you weren't looking.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
So you just helped yourself?!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I like walking
around in boy undies.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
It's a twisted pleasure
that's so arousing!

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Disgusting! Immoral!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! Your judgmental words
are music to my ears!

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
I just can't win with you.

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
And what made you wanna put
my shorts on in the first place?

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
I was lonely from being
neglected so much.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
But at least this way I could
feel your warmth on my body!

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's a new trauma to unpack.

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
Here's a yummy idea!

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
Now that I've worn your undies,
why don't you try mine?

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.283 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
No, thank you!

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] And that's how I learned
Sayuki wasn't Undierella,

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
but she was totes a pervert.

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Regardless, I'm glad she's
back to her regular self again.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hey, Yuika.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
You're a lifesaver.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot for the umbrella.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
Especially since you had
to go out of your way.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] No biggie.
Well, guess I'll take off--

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
Ah-choo!

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
How about I fix you something

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
nice and warm to drink?

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Smells like Yuika in here.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
Why'd I have to go
and make it weird?

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute! This is perfect.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
It's my chance to do more recon!

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
Now that the boxer thief
is out of the picture,

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
the only suspect left is Yuika.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
She may be unripe, but her
bedroom is mine for the picking!

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
If she's the real culprit,

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
the evidence has got
to be in here somewhere.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA hums]

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Better hurry up
and get a move-on.

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Don't mind if I do.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
Sure are a lot.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
And no surprise,
they're all crazy cute.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
They're not here.

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
Could it be because she's
wearing them right now?

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
Guess I could try
flipping up her skirt.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Hello, Keiki!
Whatcha doing there?

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Duh, what's it look like?

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
I'm rummaging
through your drawer

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
full of panties, obviously.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Oh. Ah.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
Cool. You're back already...

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
That sure was quick...

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
Our electric kettle
boils water pretty fast.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center

Check this out.

Ah. I'm dead.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
So this is what it feels like.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
Not sure if I've ever
mentioned it before,

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center

an obedient slave.

Say, here's a great idea!

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
Why don't you volunteer
for the position?

00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center

Aw, balls.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
Please let me serve you,
for your wish is my command.

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.167 position:50% align:center
