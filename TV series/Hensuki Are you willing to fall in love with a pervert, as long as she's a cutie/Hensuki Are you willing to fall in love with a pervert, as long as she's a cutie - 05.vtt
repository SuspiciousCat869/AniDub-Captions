Previously, on Hensuki!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.596 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] One wants a master,
one wants a slave,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
and another just wants
to watch dudes get it on.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.558 position:50% align:center
Hooray, I'm surrounded
by perverts!

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
Also, I think I'm getting
blackmailed now,

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
so that's great.
Where's the love?

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
All I want is a good
old-fashioned romance.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
It's all strangely perverted.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
I mean, uh, complex.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Aw, balls.
Who took this picture?

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] Mr. Keiki Kiryu,
come to the following location

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
after reading this:

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
Club Building, Fourth
Floor, Astronomy Club.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
If you do not comply,
your dignity as a human being

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
may be placed at risk.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
When you put it that way,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hello, I'm here.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
Hey, anybody home?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What is all this?

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.645 position:50% align:center
[door closing]

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Don't even think about moving.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] After three leads,
and three dead-ends,

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.167 position:50% align:center
this unlucky prince still
hasn't found his Undie-rella.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
Instead I've found
what's commonly known as

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
a "bunny girl."

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
As the name
suggests, this is a girl

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
who's incorporated bunny
elements into her outfit.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
Fishnet stockings,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
a revealing, strapless corset,

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
bunny ears, bushy tail,

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
and a few additional touches
to complete the package.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
When I was still just a
bushy-tailed boy myself,

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
I prayed that I'd get
to see one first-hand,

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.570 position:50% align:center
but even then, I knew the
chances were slim to none.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
I was ready to
give up on my dreams

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
and let them fade
away, but suddenly!

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
There she was,
right in front of me.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
A wild bunny girl,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
and of the cutest variety.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
I'm naming this folder

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
"Underclassman blooms
into a bunnygirl."

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Could you not?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
Also, you're interrupting
my hare-obics!

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] How'd she end up
falling down this rabbit hole?

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] She told me
that she wanted to join

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
the Calligraphy Club.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Why would she?

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I had to because it's not fair!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
That evil witch gets way
too much quality Keiki time.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
Don't you realize that maybe
I want some of you, too?

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? You mean it?

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] How else am
I supposed to discipline you

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
if I can't whip
your butt into shape?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
Yup, saw that one coming.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
Anyway, as a student
of this school,

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
I have every right to be here.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
Well, she makes a good point.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
Guess this means there's going

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
to be some competition
over you, Keiki.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
I have to say,
I don't like this one bit,

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
but it's true, I can't
turn a new recruit away.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
Still, I don't
like this one bit.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You said that twice,
so that's two bits.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
This isn't exactly
my cup of tea, either.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
I could've just let
her join the club,

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
but that wouldn't be any fun,

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
so I thought I might as well put
her in a costume for the day.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
'Kay. I don't follow the logic,

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
but I'm not gonna
argue with your style.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
Despite her personality,

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
she's quite adorable.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
That's pretty rich coming
from you, thirsty hound!

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
I wanted to dress up too,

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't find
anything in my size.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Catch me
outside, you witchy cow!

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to ask you,

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
why do you keep
calling me a witch?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
Because you're a hideous witch

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
with gargantuan
monster boobies, duh!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
Better to have monster boobs
than be a boobless monster.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy. Girls, let's not fight.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]

[YUIKA, SAYUKI growling]

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
I'm suddenly thirsty,
mind brewing me some tea?

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
Tch! Fine! I'll hop to it!

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA mumbling]

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
What the heck is she doing here?

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
Wow, rude much?

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
I've joined the
club too, obviously.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Uh, you what?

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm a club member,

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
you'd better start treating
me with a little more respect.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure,
welcome, or whatever.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, shouldn't
Nanjo put on a costume too?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
She's already more than
earned her membership.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
Whoa, why do you
have that thing?

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Because I'm a fan
of Ms. Mao Minami's work.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Dang it. What're the odds?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
You let her bribe you
with that filthy smut?

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
Of course not, I bought it at
a convention using my own money.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
So, what did she give you?

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] She promised
to reserve me copies

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
of any future releases.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
A shady back-alley deal,
why am I not surprised?

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
I actually own every volume

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
of the "Shortcake" series.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] This last issue
was so very yummy.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
Especially the
facial expressions

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
in the lovemaking scenes!

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
Why must you torture me?

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's the story about?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It's about nothing!
Adults only! Not for kids!

Read mine!

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Think of it as a welcome gift.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?
I feel bad taking it.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
It's all right, I have two more
copies tucked away at home.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
Wow. Thanks a lot.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
This is so filthy! It's unclean!

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you
were this prudish, Koga.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Can't resist!

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and feast your eyes.

are a woman of culture.

I feel weird.

I feel awakened!

[KEIKI]
Uh-huh.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] I went ahead and told
Nanjo about our whole situation,

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
since she's part
of the club now.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
She basically knows everything.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
She understands both
our true natures,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
including why we're
fighting over you.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I figured as much based on
the way the conversation went.

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
So, they're grooming you

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
as a top and a bottom
at the same time?

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a real pickle.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Can it.
Besides, you of all people

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
have no right to
talk about my pickle.

--[phone chimes]

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Don't tell them
about why I joined.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
If you tell them, I'm showing
my books to Mizuha.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center

Enough chitchat, it's time
for club activities.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
the Pornography Club.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
How did we even get to this?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] There is way too
much on my plate right now.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Don't even think about moving.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Who is this girl?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
You had better not do
anything suspicious, either.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
One wrong move and I'll end
your life as you know it

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
with a single tap.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Why do I keep falling
into these sorts of situations?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
If you do exactly as I tell you,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
then I'll delete this photo

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
and we can pretend that
none of this ever happened.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
What do you want from me?

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
Well, you see...

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
I really had no other options,

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
so when I saw this
opportunity I took it,

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
even though it meant
blackmailing you.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh. She's pretty cute.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought
I could be happy

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
with just watching
from a distance,

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
but my emotions got
the better of me,

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't help myself.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec...

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Could she be Undie-rella?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
The truth is... I'm in love.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasping]

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
Marry me!

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI grunts]

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
Why are you saying that
I should marry you?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasping]

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
A Shoma stan?

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Yeah, sorry.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
I'm flattered, I truly am,

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
but the only one I have
eyes for is Akiyama.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
So, I'll have to turn
down your proposal.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Okay. Let's get this straight.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
Your name is Otori, right?

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Yep, yep!
That's right, Koharu Otori.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She's sweet and petite,

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
like a bunny rabbit in pleats,

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
and who'da thunk, she's also
stalking my best friend.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
You see, I'm in love
with Akiyama,

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
but it's a one-sided affair.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
Yep, you've made that
painfully obvious.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
And I'm asking you to be
my undercover cupid, Kiryu.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
Why do you need me
to play matchmaker

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
between you and Shoma?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
The two of you are
pretty close friends,

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
so I thought you'd be the
perfect person for the job,

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
and thankfully,
I have a scandalously

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
convincing incentive
for you to consider.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
You really just
went for it, huh?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
I object!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
How did you manage to get
that picture anyway?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
In the Astronomy Club we're

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
all about observing
objects from a distance.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
Photographing the
Calligraphy Club's interior

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
was an easy task.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
And snap!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
Got him...

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Voyeuristic creep.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
B.T. dubs, maybe
try keeping your hands

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
to yourself during school hours.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
Listen, there's a deep
explanation for that

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
which goes beyond
space and time itself!

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] I'd say you
were about elbow deep,

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
but whatever the reason,

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't be a good look for
you if I leaked this little pic.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree?

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
I'm selling out
my friend to a stalker.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Great, glad to see that
you're such a quick study.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
So, how long have you been
crushing on Shoma like this?

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
It started around a year ago.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
A strong wind blew my hat away,

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
and it ended up
landing in a tree.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
I couldn't reach it,
but Akiyama got it for me.

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Fascinating.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
I've been trying to find
a chance to talk to him, but,

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
well, I keep chickening
out at the last second.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
He's like an elusive star

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
twinkling in some distant,
far-flung galaxy.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I can do
but gaze at him from afar

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
and snap a few pics.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's more than
a few pics, girlfriend.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
Listen, you don't need me
to be your undercover cupid.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
You'll do just fine on your own.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
'Cause you're his type.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
He's likes to feel like
'big man on campus.'

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
Only dates petite girls.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
I am well aware of Akiyama's
personal preferences.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's the biggest
hurdle I need to overcome.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
Why? What do ya mean?

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
You're a super cute
first-year and you're a girl,

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
so I'm pretty sure
that if you hit on him,

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
he'd be all about it.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Yeah...
I'm a third-year upperclassman.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
What? I'm sorry. Say that again?

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
Okey-dokes.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
I am a full grade ahead
of both you and my love.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
I look young,
but I'm older than you.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
That is a blue skirt,

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
like the one Sayuki wears.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it,
you are older than me.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Of course I am, silly!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
Look!

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Uh, okay,
I think I get the picture!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Huh?

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
Oopsie! I got a little
carried away.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
She's actually a third-year--

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
it's starting to make sense now.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
Shoma won't be so quick
to play Prince Charming

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
when he finds out his
princess is older than him.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a lost cause!
Buh-bye! Nice meetin' ya!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
Come again?

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
I mean, call me Cupid
and get ready for love,

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm gonna give it my all!

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm done for.
What am I gonna do?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] Is that mine own
brother I see sitting yonder?

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Your eyes do not deceive.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
Coming back from the store?

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
Yep! We were running
low on some stuff.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That looks heavy.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Only the soy sauce.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You should call me next time.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Isn't it my job
to do the heavy lifting?

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
So cold, but tasty!

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch, Keiki.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
What are big brothers for?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA crying]

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Mm!

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch, Keiki!

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
What are big brothers for?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Huh?

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.000 position:50% align:center
By the way, I heard
that the Calligraphy Club

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
got a few additional
members today.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
Word travels fast. Yeah, we did.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
Yuika and Nanjo.

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
May be time to leave.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
With those two around, it's
not like they need me anymore.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
Wow, you always
think so negatively.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Well, it's true. I only
joined to boost the headcount.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
Don't be that way.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Tokihara's
very grateful for you.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
If you told her you
were quitting the club,

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
it would make her really sad.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
It's like how if you said that
you were quitting this family,

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.905 position:50% align:center
it would make me really sad.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
I would never say
something like that.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
But if you did, then I would
have no one to buy me ice cream.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
That's your concern?

Hm?

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center

is really pretty.

different colored ribbons
according to their year?

[MIZUHA] Uh-huh, but we all
wear pink skirts for summer.

about to start matching, huh?

This might be my chance.

you keep him distracted and
conceal the blue ribbon.

[KOHARU] Mm... My skin
is super sensitive,

so I'm just hiding
it from the sun.

This is true,

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
but the jacket also
conceals her real age.

So cute!

this girl? She's adorable!

Uh, in the library.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
She told me she
likes to watch tennis.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
I told her that you did, too,
and now I'm introducing you.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Then did you catch
the last showdown

run to the clubroom.

Can I ask you something first?

I'd like it if we could
talk about tennis again

Would it be okay if we
trade our contacts?

Of course! My B.

Sure, I'm sure!

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
You've been nothing but
helpful to me, so it's my turn.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
An Undie-rella who left
her undies behind,

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
a love letter, sender unknown,

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
a gift, pure white panties,

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
and a locked door somehow
opening entirely on its own.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
This is starting to
become quite the mystery.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
I found the letter
in the clubroom,

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
so at first I thought
it might've been one

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
of three possible admirers.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
But sadly, all three of them

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
turned out to be
perverted nasties.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah... Every single one.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
And nobody else knows anything
about this situation?

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
No one except Shoma.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.251 position:50% align:center
I didn't tell him any of
the kinky stuff, though.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
You can trust me to be discreet,

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
so nothing you've said
will leave this room.

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Have you considered
the possibility that Undie-rella

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
could be someone outside
your cleaning crew?

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she waited for
the perfect moment to sneak

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
into the clubroom after
everyone else left for the day,

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
but when you came back
earlier than expected,

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
she stopped what she was doing

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
and quickly found
somewhere to hide.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
But why would an outsider
risk getting caught

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
in a place where they
never hang out?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Fair point.

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
The original girls
who helped you clean up

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
are still the prime suspects,
but there is another likelihood.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't rule
out the possibility

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
of a fifth
Undie-rella candidate.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
Wait, a fifth
Undie-rella candidate?

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Which makes
every single female student

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
here a potential suitor.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
No way.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have
a glass slipper.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
I can't make all those girls
try on the same pair of undies!

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU]
Let's narrow it down a bit.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
It happened in a clubroom,
so they'd have to be

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.684 position:50% align:center
someone who was in the
club building that day.

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center

That makes sense.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center

if there were any witnesses.

left early. I can ask them!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
I'd make her wear
a maid outfit this time.

I went to check your work
after you had already left,

to lock the door.
