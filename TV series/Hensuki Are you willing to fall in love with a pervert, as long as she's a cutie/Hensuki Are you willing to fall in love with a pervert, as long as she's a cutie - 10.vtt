00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I'm thirsty! Fetch me
something to drink, Keiki!

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Right away, miss!

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I need a massage!

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
Come rub my shoulders, Keiki!

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
I'm honored to comfort you!

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Unacceptable!
My horoscope sucks!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.484 position:50% align:center
Fix it, Keiki!

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I shall rearrange
the stars for you, ma'am!

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Previously, on Hensuki!

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] There were only two
Undierella suspects left!

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.833 position:50% align:center
My first guess was Sayuki,
but the aftermath

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
of our pet-play date
proved I was wrong.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
That left Yuika! But she
caught me sniffing around

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
for evidence and blackmailed
me into being her slave!

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.967 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA] For your sake, I hope
she's not a terrible mistress.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.552 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I'm hungry!

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.470 position:50% align:center
Get me an extra firm pork ramen
with double broth, double veg,

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
double meat, and one egg!

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yes, milady!

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA slurps]

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Hey, Master?
Can I ask a question?

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Not your master
anymore, but sure, go on.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] What's up with you
going out of your way

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
to do things for Koga
all of a sudden?

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
Oh. This?

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
Let's just say I made
some poor life choices

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.240 position:50% align:center
and now I'm paying the price.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
What? That's awful.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.371 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles]
Funny how things work out.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
It's pretty obvious that
you're blackmailing him

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
into obedience.
Hell would freeze over

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
before you could seduce my owner
with that pitifully flat chest.

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA growls]

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.547 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Ouch, burn.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
There's no value
in a relationship built on

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
such a weak foundation.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
Do you hear that?!
Get up and defend me, already!

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
Say you love cutie patooties
more than monster melons!

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] What? Wait, how
did we even get here?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
After all, you loved my
boobies so much you faked

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
an accident just to grab 'em.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
That isn't true!

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?
Well, he shoved his hand

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
down my cleavage like he was
diving for gold the other day.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Not you, too!

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] You'd better
explain yourself, Keiki!

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI]
Yeah, start talking!

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
Were our moments
alone nothing but a lie?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Make up your mind!
Adorable A-cups!

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
Sweater stretchers!

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA, SAYUKI]
Which ones are the best?!

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gulps]

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
Ladies, please! This doesn't
have to be a competition!

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
There's a time and a place
for boobs of all sizes.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
But... If I could
only pick one to enjoy.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
I'd take the
tig ol'biddies, er'yday!

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
You can enslave me,
but you'll never change me.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
--So, yeah.
--You're such a stupid jerk!

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI laughs]
It looks like I win this round.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
My decision is final,
but I'm not done.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
Don't think I'm saying
I hate itty-bitty tiddies.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
I believe all breasts
are equally precious!

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
That makes it sound worse, perv!

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI] Oh, my!
Is someone feeling upset?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA growls] Hey, you're not
the only girl here who can

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
bring out the big guns!

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
--[SAYUKI] Hmm...?
--Hey, Keiki. Paw!

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Bark! Oh. Crap. Reflex.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI whimpers]

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
I knew there was
something immoral here!

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
Something wrong!

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
But I had no idea you'd
be so well-trained!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
my master would submit

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
to another girl like this!

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
What the... Wait a sec!

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
[SAYUKI sobs]

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles] I'm glad she
finally understands.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Now it's clear who
the real master is.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
Done with the bath--
it's all yours.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yes, milady!

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Um... Are you feeling all right?

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
That's right. I'm just dandy.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Gotta stay strong
and keep my chin up.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
This fight ain't over yet!

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
If I have evidence it
was Yuika who sent the letter,

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
I'll finally be able to prove
that she's Undierella!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
Then I can end this
miserable life of servitude!

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You wait and see, baby!

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
At long last,
sweet freedom will be mine!

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[MIZUHA]
Keiki...?

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.608 position:50% align:center
Uh... What? I said I'm fine.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
[DOG whines]

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Slave duty starts early. Always.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Sundays, holidays,
doesn't matter.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
The mistress's orders
are absolute.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
For now, I'll endure it.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
Even if I have to grovel
through the mud with a smile.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] But I never thought I'd
end up becoming a butler.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I made the entire suit by hand.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
This is so exciting,
it makes me wanna tie you up

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
and have you squeal
like a li'l piggy!

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Pigs only wear blankets, ma'am.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Must stay strong!

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
So, ready to head out?

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Huh? Whoa, hold up!
I can't do this in public!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
Of course you can, silly!

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
You're my footman all day,
in and out of the house.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
I'd love it if you could
attract lots of attention

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
for my personal enjoyment.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
I didn't sign up
for more roleplay.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
We're home! Nice work today!

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It was my pleasure
to be of service, milady...

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
Aw. Now that's a good servant.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
Well, I've gotten sweaty
from all that shopping.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Into the shower I go!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
Allow me to help you
change out of your clothes!

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles] It's cute that
you're beginning to understand

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
your role better.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
But it's too soon for
you to see me naked.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yes, ma'am...

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I know boys your age
are obsessed with "anatomy."

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
But no peeking allowed, okay?

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Of course.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
What a perfect distraction.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
Time to get the skivvy
on her skivvies!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Oh, one more thing.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Welcome back! How may
I be of assistance to you?!

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
If you try to get away
with going through

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
my undie drawer again,
you can expect me

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
to blackmail you for life!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Whoa! For life?

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
That's all I had to say.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
Make sure you restrain if
you don't want the chain!

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Right. Yes, ma'am...

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] At this rate,
I'll never find any evidence

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
to close this investigation.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA shrieks]

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Was that Yuika?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I just saw a huge
spider, it came out of nowhere!

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh? Spider?

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
Um... It crawled over there.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center

Oops. Sorry.

--[KEIKI yelps]

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
So, do you have any last
words before I banish you

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
to the fiery depths of Hell?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Please have mercy!

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
Walking in on a
helpless girl is unforgivable!

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
Hope you're prepared
to accept your punishment!

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
Now! Bow your head down!

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
With your face to the floor
like the sorry dog you are!

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.157 position:50% align:center
Fine. How's this?

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
There's more.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Ask me for discipline
like you really mean it.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
I want you to tell me you're
a foolish mutt and beg for me

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
to step on your head!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
Please, Mistress,
I need you to step on my head

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
with your feet because
I'm a foolish mutt

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
who can't do anything right.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA sighs]

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
You've seriously been
a naughty puppy today,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
haven't you? Although...

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
I do appreciate that you
rushed to my side so quickly.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI gasps]

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Uh-huh...

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
Uh... Are we done here?

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
You're not off the hook yet.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
So I'm still being punished?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
Yes, you are.
Now shut up and caress my head.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI sighs]

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
You know... This brings me back.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
Your touch reminds me
of my grandmother.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Is that you two in that picture?

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Yeah, she was such a kind soul.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
When I was a kid,
I got bullied a lot.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
Just because I looked different.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
So after school, I'd run
as fast as I could to her house.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
I. N. D. E. C. I. S. I. V?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
[GRANDMOTHER]
"Indecisive."

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
That's what it means when you
can't make up your mind!

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
Make up?

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
[GRANDMOTHER]
You'll find out someday.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, poppet.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA laughs]
Make up your mind!

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
Make up your mind!

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[GRANDMOTHER] Oh, my adorable
granddaughter is so smart!

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Grandma,
you're the bestest!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I cherished her more
than anything in the world.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
And as long as I had her,

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
I didn't need other
people in my life.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Of course, when she passed away,

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but feel as
though she betrayed me.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50% align:center
I loved her so much.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
I couldn't understand
why she left me behind.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
After that,
I avoided people as much

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
as I possibly could.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
'Cause if I didn't
get close to anyone,

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
then I couldn't get hurt
when I inevitably lost them.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
Well, that explains a lot.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA giggles] Tells you why
I'm childish sometimes, huh?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
I realized something.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
I wasn't lonely because
of the way I looked.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
I was lonely because
it's what I chose for myself.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
And yet... You didn't
seem to notice any of that.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
You never stopped
coming by to say hi.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Again and again.
Until I gave in.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] At first, I
thought you were nothing

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
but some filthy pig who was
cruising for a dose of abuse.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
You were wrong.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I also considered you
might've been volunteering

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
to be my slave.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Oh, so very wrong.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
But...

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
Despite my shortcomings, you've
always been so kind to me.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
If I really wanted to be alone,

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
then why did I keep going
to the library every day?

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'd tell
you to leave me be.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
Pretend to give you
the cold shoulder.

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
Ignore you until you left.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
Truthfully,
I was waiting for you.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
Secretly excited for the
next time you'd try again.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
I was so happy.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
You kept talking to me
and being friendly even when

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
I was acting mean to you.

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
Since my grandmother...

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
...you're the first person
that's cared about me.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
And that's a pretty big deal,
you know? I guess...

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is
that you're special to me!

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
I'm speechless.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that was
super embarrassing.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
Aw, jeez. I'm sure
I'm red as a beet.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
Let me go grab a drink,
I'll be right back--

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
--[yelps]
--[KEIKI] Be careful!

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] Heh! Whoops,
good thing I landed on my bed!

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's wrong?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
You've got this intense
look on your face

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
like something's
about to go down.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Um... Keiki?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Don't move.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
No wait, stop!
I'm not ready for this yet!

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Gotcha.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Hmm?

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What the hell's this?

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Uh...

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
My boxers?
Why are they under your pillow?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
Are you waiting
for the undie fairy?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA]
Oh, uh... The thing is...

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
You're not smiling your
way outta this one, missy!

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving until I get
answers, so start singin'!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
Aw, balls.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's kind of
a complicated story--

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
Try to keep it brief.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
But that might be
a bit of a challenge,

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
--if you consider all--
--I said brief.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
When I came by to visit
you the other day,

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
I started snooping around.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
You weren't there to
catch me, so I just did it.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
I found your undies,
and before I knew it,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
they were already in my bag.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
Another boxer thief,
that's great.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
D'you do anything weird?
Like sniff 'em or something?

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
Um... Just a few times.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Officer, this is her!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stop myself!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
Besides, boys aren't the
only ones who're curious

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
about that stuff!

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
And thus...

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
I was saved from the
humiliation of slave duty.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
But neither of
these boxer burglars

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
stole Undierella's panties.
The plot continues to thicken.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
[YUIKA] I'm hungry. Could you
go get me something to eat?

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yes, milady!

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
[OKITA]
Bye! And don't get too crazy--

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
you'll all be back
soon enough!

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
Summer vacation
starts tomorrow, doesn't it?

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Tell me about it.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Another summer without
a girlfriend. What a bummer.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
You said it, brother.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] You hang out
with Koharu so much,

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
you may as well
have a girlfriend.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
You dirty traitor.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Hey, it's not like we're
officially dating or anything.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
In my opinion,
if you're not quite a couple

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
but you're more than friends,
you're basically there.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
You guys are gonna make lotsa
happy fun memories together,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
am I right?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
I'm so jealous, I could cry!

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
No lie, she's pretty cute.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
She's sweet, cute.
She's the best.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
Oh, and, uh, also cute.

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
You said "cute" three times.

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder
if she's really the one.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
'Cause I notice things.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Things like what?

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
Like the other day, man.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
She invited me up to her
bedroom and it was so awkward.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Yeah? Don't tell
me she had stalker photos

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
hanging all over the walls?

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
No. The visit appeared to be
perfectly normal at first.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
But then I found out
she had over a hundred DVDs

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
that were all labeled
"Records of Shoma."

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI chuckles]

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Also... I discovered
a strange journal

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
full of extremely detailed
reports of my daily activities.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
One entry, every ten minutes,
in tiny letters.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Creepy. Well, I caught
Sayuki wearing my boxers

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center

for some weird reason.

[KEIKI, SHOMA sigh]

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Shit's rough, bro.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Yep.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
When I found that love
letter, I could've sworn

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.407 position:50% align:center
I was gonna land
a nice girlfriend

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
and have a hella
romantic summer.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Too bad
you never figured out

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
who Undierella really was.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up?

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
Do you have a second or two?

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
Sure, not much going
on here. Whatcha need?

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
Listen. I need you
to be my boyfriend, okay?

[baseball clangs]

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Your what?

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Well, that was easy.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I let you set me up.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Less yappy and more look happy!

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
I think that'll
be enough for now.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
Are we done?

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
With the front view.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
Go on. Take it off already.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Heh? You mean, like, my shirt?

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
I'm doing a full nude,
so I mean everything.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
We did not agree on that!

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
Man, you didn't take the bait.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
Yeah, obviously.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
What kind of sleaze ball would
strip down in a classroom?

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Now,
turn your head to the side.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
And hold still.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
By the way, this isn't
some sort of strange plot

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
to seduce you.
So don't get the wrong idea.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Trust me,
I wasn't hoping to get any.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
[MAO growls]

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
What, so now you're mad at me?

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
I'll never understand girls.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't you need to
draw sketches of Shoma, too?

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Nah. Those pretty boys...

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
They're easy to draw
without a reference.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Generic faces like yours
are actually the hardest.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
Oh, so I'm boring, cool.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
[MAO] It's a bit basic to ship
two hot guys in the same story.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
Cake's relatable.

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
That's what amplifies
the hotness in Shouto.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
So in a way, I guess they
complement each other.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
You ever wish you were born hot?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I mean, sure,
doesn't everybody? Come on.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
I guess.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
Not that it should
matter to you that much.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
And why's that?

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Because you're attractive.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
[MAO gasps]

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're such a moron.

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
Moron? Why?!

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll try to make you look
a little nicer in my next manga.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nah. Just leave my Cakes alone.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Guess what?

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
I got an awesome offer from
this manga publishing house.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
There's this editor,
they want me to do a one-shot.

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Wow, congrats!

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
The genre's different.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
One I've never drawn.
I mean, it's a shojo comic.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
But it's a good chance
to challenge myself.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
[MAO] I'm not sure what
I wanna do with my life yet.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
But I know that taking this
opportunity will help me grow.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
--Watcha think?
--Go for it!

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's obvious you've
really thought this through.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
In the end...

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
--...I still love boy's love!
--No one said you didn't!

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Just curious. Are you
dating anyone right now?

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
Ah! Why do you ask?!

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
I've never written
any girls' comics before.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
I need to start collecting
plot ideas right away.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Hmm?

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you had
a girlfriend so I could

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
interview you and maybe
get some inspiration.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
Ah, that makes sense.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
[MAO] How're things
with Tokihara and Yuika?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
You also seem chummy with the
student council vice president.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI groans]

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
You aren't, like,
going out with her or anything?

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No. I would never.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
I see. Well, then...

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you
try me on for size?

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Nanjo...?

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
This is research.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
What kind...?

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
I just wanna see
the look on a boy's face

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
as he's being wrapped
around a girl's finger!

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
I get where this is going.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center
Really? Then don't blink. Okay?

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI squeals]

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
[MAO] Hey! You were supposed
to keep your eyes open!

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
Sucker. You actually thought
I was gonna kiss you, huh?

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
[sighs] No, you said
it was for research!

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
Well. I appreciate
you showing me

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
your honest reaction back
there! This'll help my story.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
Can I have my innocence back?

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
[MAO]
Kiryu. Thanks for today.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center

Ah, look who it is.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Whatchu up to?
Student council stuff?

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] Mm. There's some
paperwork from first semester

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
that still needs to be finished.

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] It seems like
your work never ends.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
It's reward time

scent of fresh sweat.

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] I'm pretty sure
this is harassment.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
I should report you
to the authorities.

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
[AYANO]
What if I never let you go?

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
Is that a threat?

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
C'mon. We'd get in trouble
if anybody saw this.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] If they did, we could
just say we're dating.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
That wouldn't be too bad.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Huh?

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
[AYANO] Then I'd have an endless
supply of used undies to sniff!

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
Thanks, but no, thanks.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
[AYANO sighs]
Okie, recharging complete.

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
Take this as a token
of my gratitude. Enjoy.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
What is it?

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
It's a pass you can
use at the nearby pool.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
Wait, why don't
you wanna go swimming?

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
Uh, you see...

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
I lose control around that
many masculine musks.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
All those men running
around is too much!

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI]
TMI.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks
a lot. I appreciate it!

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
See ya!

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
Valid for up to five people.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
Anyone home?

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
I got a group pass to
the neighborhood pool.

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center

[SHOMA]
Ugh. Dude, could you not?

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm the one
who should be asking you that.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] I tripped and
fell down the steps

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
and he was trying to catch me.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Was there something
you wanted to tell us?

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
[KEIKI] Oh! I scored some
free tickets to go swimming.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
You two wanna get wet?

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
As much as I'd love to.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
I have plans for summer break.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
Ah, you do?

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
Sorry, broski, but I'd
feel guilty saying yes.

figured out who Undierella is.
