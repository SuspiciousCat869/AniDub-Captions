1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,916
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,458
- Man: IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT, ANYTHING AT ALL,

3
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,958
COME TO ME.

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,791
I'LL BE YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

5
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,666
- ( footsteps )

6
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,583
- ( banging )

7
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,416
- OPEN IT.

8
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,958
- ( lock turning )

9
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,041
- ( heavy breathing )

10
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,708
- LEAVE US, PLEASE.

11
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,208
- ( door opens and closes )

12
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,000
- ( trembling )

13
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,708
- AT LAST, IT SEEMS THAT YOU'VE
FINALLY BECOME MY TYPE.

14
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:02,958
- ( grunting )

15
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,625
- ( bang )

16
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,791
- Ichise:
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,416
- Doc:
 NOTHING.

18
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,750
- ( door opens )

19
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
- NOW, DOC--

20
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,375
- ARE YOU GOING
TO KILL HIM NOW?

21
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,000
RIGHT HERE, EVEN THOUGH
THIS BOY BELONGS TO ME?

22
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,083
- ( chuckles )

23
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,375
- Onishi: SO YOU GOT
THE ORGANO TO GO ALONG

24
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,875
WITH YOUR CAPRICIOUSNESS,
SATISFIED?

25
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,916
- AS A COMPANION FOR HIM,

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,375
THIS CITY IS MUCH MORE
SUITABLE THAN I AM.

27
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,083
- Onishi: THIS CITY DOESN'T
HAVE ANY TIME TO SPARE

28
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,875
FOR A DOG LIKE HIM.

29
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,833
- ( chuckles )

30
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,833
- NOW WHAT DO YOU FIND SO FUNNY?

31
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,958
- I'M JUST WONDERING
BY WHOSE WILL

32
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,375
HE'S STILL BEING KEPT ALIVE.

33
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,875
BY YOURS,

34
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,250
OR MINE?

35
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,875
OR PERHAPS THE CITY
OF LUX ITSELF.

36
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,333
- HM.

37
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,666
- ( squeaking )

38
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,083
- LOOKS LIKE I FOUND SOMEONE
ELSE TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

39
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,583
- HM.

40
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,208
- ( train bell )

41
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,666
- YOU LOOK WORN OUT.

42
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,916
- DO I?

43
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,416
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED RAILROADS.

44
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,666
I GUESS THAT MY DREAM FINALLY
CAME TRUE WHEN I ARRIVED HERE.

45
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,875
- LOOKING AT YOUR HANDS,

46
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,875
PEOPLE WOULD THINK
YOU'RE A DIFFERENT MAN.

47
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,333
- ACTUALLY, I AM
A DIFFERENT MAN.

48
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,375
- IN THE WORLD ABOVE, THE FACT
THAT YOU EVEN ONCE EXISTED

49
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,375
IS NOW BECOMING OBSCURE.

50
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,375
- SO IT'S THE SAME AS ALWAYS
UP THERE.

51
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,625
- NO CHANGES WHATSOEVER,
ANNOYINGLY SO.

52
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,833
- HUH.

53
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,375
- AS SOMEONE WHO ONCE ASPIRED
TO BECOME LIKE YOU,

54
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,291
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

55
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,333
TATSUYA SAKIMURA
IS ALREADY DEAD.

56
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,541
THE MAN YOU'RE TALKING
TO RIGHT NOW IS SOMEONE ELSE.

57
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,541
- THEN HOW SHOULD I REPORT
THIS TO THE PEOPLE ABOVE?

58
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,916
- IS THERE ANYTHING 
THAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

59
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,125
- NO.

60
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,166
- Man:
MAN, HE'S SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

61
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,583
( laughing )

62
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,500
- Shinji: YO.

63
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,833
THERE'S A MODEL
YOU DON'T SEE OFTEN.

64
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,750
WHERE DID YOU COME BY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

65
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,333
HEY MAN, I HEARD YOU WERE

66
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,750
PISSING IN THEIR
POT PRETTY GOOD.

67
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,458
HE'S SURE GOT SOME BALLS

68
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,791
BEATING UP THE ORGANO'S HOODS
TO DEATH BY HIMSELF.

69
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,791
- Shinji:
GOT A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

70
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,750
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

71
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,708
I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T
REGRET IT.

72
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,500
YOU DO KNOW NOW THAT YOU'RE
THE SAME AS US,

73
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,500
RIGHT?

74
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,708
- HUH?

75
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
- WHAT IS IT?

76
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,750
- Sakimura: SKIRMISHES BETWEEN
THE ORGANO AND THE UNION

77
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,875
HAVE BECOME A CONTINUAL PROBLEM.

78
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,083
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE
ON A TEMPORARY TRUCE

79
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,375
SINCE ONISHI HAD
A FACE-TO-FACE NEGOTIATION

80
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,083
WITH THE UNION'S KIMATA.

81
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,583
BUT THE LOW-LEVEL MEMBERS 
ARE AS HIGHLY VOLATILE AS EVER.

82
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,625
THINGS COULD ERUPT
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

83
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,333
SHIN-SHIN-SE-KU-SA!

84
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,541
- ( whimpering )

85
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,666
- ( gun cocks )

86
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,958
- ( gun shot )

87
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,458
- Tsujinaka: HOW DID HE
COME OUT OF IT IN ONE PIECE?

88
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,458
- Organo member one:
NOT EXACTLY IN ONE PIECE.

89
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,041
HE'S NO LONGER A MAN.

90
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,125
- Tsujinaka:
HMM, I GUESS IT'D BE POINTLESS

91
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,291
TO TEXHNOLYZE THAT
PART OF THE BODY.

92
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,958
- Izaki:
 WELL ON THE OTHER HAND,

93
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,041
THE WOMEN MIGHT LIKE
THAT BETTER.

94
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,791
- Organo member two:
WITH ALL THAT JERKY MOVEMENT.

95
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,125
- ( all laughing )

96
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,041
- Onishi:
 IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER.

97
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,958
IS IT THAT THEY'RE TRYING
TO SPIT IN THE ORGANO'S FACE?

98
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,791
OR IS IT THAT
THEY'RE UNABLE TO CONTROL

99
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,833
THEIR MORONIC HENCHMEN?

100
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,583
OR PERHAPS IT'S THE WORK
OF SOME OTHER PARTY.

101
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,583
- WHATEVER, IT'S A
GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

102
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,875
- NOW WE HAVE
THE PERFECT EXCUSE

103
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,750
TO COMPLETELY
DISSOLVE THE UNION.

104
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,833
- HM.

105
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,750
- Sonoda: THE YOUNG ONES ARE
ALL FIRED UP AS IT IS NOW.

106
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,291
- Tsujinaka: THE DISCONTENT
OF THE MEN BELOW US

107
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,000
HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED,
THAT'S MORE OF A PROBLEM.

108
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,166
WHY DON'T WE DO IT AND LET
THEM BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

109
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,666
- YES, MY FATHER IS
OF THE SAME OPINION.

110
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,958
THAT MUST BE
THE HAND OF FATE GUIDING US.

111
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,041
- CALL THE UNION, NOW.

112
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,000
- ( all groan )

113
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,583
- JUST FORGET IT.

114
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,791
YOU GO TO THE UNION AND DEMAND
AN ANSWER DIRECTLY FROM THEM

115
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,541
WHETHER OR NOT THIS INCIDENT
WAS TRULY THEIR DOING.

116
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,041
YOU WILL GO THERE
AS MY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE.

117
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,208
TELL THEM THAT THEIR
ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOU

118
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,125
IS THE SAME AS THEIR
ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME.

119
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,666
- YES SIR.

120
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,375
- I'VE MET WITH THEIR LEADER,
KIMATA.

121
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,208
HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS BEING SO STUPID.

122
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,291
- ( jazz music playing )

123
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
- ( trembling )

124
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,166
- WELL, IT JUST TAKES
A LITTLE GETTING USED TO.

125
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,416
I REALLY DON'T CARE
HOW MANY GLASSES YOU BREAK.

126
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,333
GO AHEAD AND PRACTICE
ALL YOU WANT.

127
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,500
ONCE YOU LEARN THE
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES

128
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,833
BETWEEN CONSISTENCIES,

129
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,708
THEN SOME OF THE ANNOYING
THINGS FLOATING AROUND

130
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,875
SHOULD DISAPPEAR
FROM YOUR VISION.

131
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,166
- HUH?

132
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,166
- ( breathing heavily )

133
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,875
- YOU GUYS MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

134
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,041
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

135
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,166
HOW COME YOU'RE BEING
SUCH A NICE GUY TODAY?

136
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,291
- HE KILLED SEVERAL
OF THE ORGANO'S HOODS

137
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,166
AND THEN CAME BACK FROM IT ALIVE
AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

138
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,166
HE'S GOT SOMETHING ON HIM,

139
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,916
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS YET.

140
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,166
BUT IT'S SOMETHING EVEN
THE ORGANO CAN'T TOUCH.

141
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,125
THE MORE CARDS WE'VE
GOT UP OUR SLEEVE,

142
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,208
THE BETTER OUR HAND.

143
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,875
- Sakimura: THERE WAS
AN INCIDENT RECENTLY.

144
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,041
A UNION SNIPER TRIED
TO SHOOT ONISHI.

145
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,291
THE UNION OFTEN EMPLOYS
TACTICS OF THAT SORT.

146
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,833
RUMOR HAS IT THAT IT WAS
THEM AS WELL WHO ATTEMPTED

147
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,916
THE ASSASSINATION OF
THE CHIEF OF GABE.

148
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,500
- ( gunshot )

149
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,750
- Izaki:
HAS IT BEEN CONFIRMED?

150
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,833
- Man:
 YES, IT HAS.

151
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,208
- THAT'S THEIR REPLY.
WE'RE AT WAR.

152
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,208
- NOW ONISHI,
THE ONLY THING LEFT

153
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
IS FOR YOU TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

154
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,791
- NAKAHARA WAS KILLED ACTING ON
YOUR BEHALF, SO IT'S ON YOU.

155
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,041
- THE CITY DOES NOT WISH
FOR A SPECTACLE NOW.

156
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,541
- HUH?

157
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
- Onishi: AND THERE'S NO NEED
FOR US TO MAKE A MOVE YET.

158
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,875
- ( scowling )

159
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,333
