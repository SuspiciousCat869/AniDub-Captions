1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,583
- Man: INSIDE EVERY PERSON
LIVES A MONSTER

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:13,083
THAT WOULD MAKE EVEN
THE HOST HIMSELF

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,541
SHUDDER WITH FEAR.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,916
THE RACE THAT FAILED
TO HIDE THEIR INTERNAL MONSTERS

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,916
WERE DRIVEN TO
AN UNDERGROUND PURGATORY.

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,291
HE WAS BORN IN THAT
UNDERGROUND PURGATORY,

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,625
CREATED BY MANKIND.

8
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,958
MORE THAN ANYBODY,
HE HATED AND LOVED

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,958
THE MONSTER INSIDE HIMSELF.

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,458
WITH HIS SECOND MOTHER,

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,291
HE ROSE TO THE WORLD
OF THE RACE

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,416
WHO HAD DRIVEN AWAY
HIS PEOPLE.

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,958
WHEN HE REACHED THERE,

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,625
THE ABOVE GROUND WORLD
AND ITS PEOPLE

15
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,291
WERE SIMPLY WAITING
FOR THEIR SLOW DEATHS.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,958
ABOVE GROUND WAS
THE WORLD OF THE DEAD.

17
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,958
THE HUMAN SPECIES
AND THE WORLD CREATED BY THEM

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,291
WERE IN THE TWILIGHT OF LIFE.

19
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,958
IT WAS THIS PLACE
WHERE HE MET A GHOST

20
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,416
THAT HE CALLED HIS FATHER.

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,833
LEAVING HIS SECOND MOTHER
WHO CHOSE TO REMAIN

22
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,833
IN THE WORLD OF THE DEAD,

23
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,875
HE CAME BACK TO 
HIS BIRTH PLACE,

24
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,208
THE UNDERGROUND PURGATORY,

25
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,541
FOR THAT IS THE WORLD
WHERE HE BELONGS.

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,375
PURGATORY IS THE PLACE

27
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,000
WHERE MANKIND MUST BE

28
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,000
IN ITS FINAL MOMENTS.

29
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,375
- Kano: THE INFORMATION
AN ANIMAL REQUIRES

30
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,375
DOES NOT EXIST WITHIN
ITS ECOLOGY.

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,041
IT EXISTS IN THE AFFORDANCES
OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

32
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,875
OUTSIDE ITS ECOLOGY.

33
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,208
- ( panting )

34
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,708
( gasps )

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,750
RAN?

36
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,458
( grunts )

37
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,083
DAMN.

38
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,500
THE LEG ISN'T
WORKING EITHER.

39
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,083
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,041
WHY DOESN'T IT MOVE NOW?

41
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,750
- Ran: ICHISE.

42
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,791
- Kano: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT,
MY DEAR THEORIA?

43
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,791
- Ran: I WON'T--

44
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,791
I WON'T BE YOUR ORACLE.

45
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,791
- Kano: THAT'S FINE.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,791
YOU'RE THE THEORIA
CREATED BY THIS WORLD, LUX.

47
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,125
SEEING IS THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

48
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,541
- ( breathing heavily )

49
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,833
- OH.

51
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,333
IT'S YOU.

52
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,041
I CUT OFF MY PERFECTLY
FINE LEGS

53
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,208
AND GOT TEXHNOLYZED

54
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,541
WHEN I WAS STILL YOUNG.

55
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,708
I NEVER THOUGHT THEY
WOULD STOP FUNCTIONING

56
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,333
IN MY LIFETIME.

57
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,000
- I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

58
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,875
- THE DAYTIME WILL
SOON BE OVER IN LUX.

59
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,875
WE WON'T SEE THE DAYLIGHT
EVER AGAIN AFTER THAT.

60
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,708
- Man:
IF THE NIGHT GOES ON AND ON,

61
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,541
THE CITY FOLKS EYES
CHANGE COLORS,

62
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,041
JUST LIKE OUR
GREAT GRANDFATHERS

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,208
WHO CAME HERE FIRST.

64
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,916
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO
KEEP THIS PLACE DAYTIME.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,583
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
RIGHT?

66
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,000
- YOUNG MAN,

67
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,625
WHY DID YOU COME BACK
FROM THE SURFACE WORLD?

68
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,750
TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS
DON'T WORK ANYMORE.

69
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,750
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
BACK TO THE CITY FOR?

70
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,333
LUX HAS GONE CRAZY.

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,791
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS
CRAZY TO BEGIN WITH,

72
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,958
AND ALL THIS TIME IT WAS
JUST PRETENDING TO BE SANE.

73
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,583
- Chief of Gabe:
DRIVEN FROM ABOVE GROUND,

74
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,333
OUR FOREFATHERS DESCENDED
INTO THIS DEEP HOLE.

75
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,166
WE THE PEOPLE OF GABE
ASSUMED LEADERSHIP

76
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,833
FOR THE EXILES
UNDERGROUND.

77
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:36,958
HOPING TO CREATE A DECENT
LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR US ALL.

78
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,583
OH, HOW MANY LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST

79
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,833
BEFORE THAT WAS ACHIEVED.

80
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,000
YET, THIS PLACE 
HAS BECOME HELL.

81
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,666
THE QUESTION NOW REMAINS:

82
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,541
BEING ALREADY IN HELL,

83
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,666
WHERE ARE WE TO GO NOW
WHEN WE DIE?

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,541
- Man #1:
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

85
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,416
WE WHO AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT TEXHNOLYZE STUFF

86
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,458
ARE GONNA WIN.

87
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,458
- Man #2: YEAH.
( laughs )

88
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
- ( sighs )

89
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,333
WE'RE OUT OF BOOZE.

90
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,333
- WANT TO GO GET SOME MORE?

91
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,500
- LIKE WHERE?
- UP THERE ON THE HILL.

92
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,166
- GOOD IDEA, MAN.
( chuckles )

93
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
- ( all laughing )
- Michiko: KILL ME.

94
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,750
KILL ME.
- SHUT UP.

95
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,041
YOU JUST BE PATIENT.

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,750
WE'LL SCREW YOU AGAIN LATER.

97
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,750
- ( men chuckle )

98
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,458
- ( door opens )

99
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,625
- HUH?

100
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,375
- ( gasps )

101
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,458
- YOU SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN DEAD, ORGANO!

102
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,291
( grunts )
- ( whimpers )

103
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,250
- I SEARCHED FOR YOU.

104
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,875
- PLEASE...

105
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,833
JUST KILL ME.

106
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,125
- Ran: LET HER DIE.

107
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,083
LET HER DIE.

108
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
- Onishi:
ARE YOU TELLING ME TO DO IT?

109
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,666
- Kano: YOU'RE THEORIA,

110
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,791
THE ONE WHO SEES.

111
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,125
THEN WHY ARE YOU
LETTING HIM HEAR YOUR VOICE?

112
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,125
- Ran:
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

113
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,833
WHY DO YOU WANT TO
KILL THE CITY?

114
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,916
- Kano: KILL THE CITY?

115
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,708
KILLING IT WOULD BE
THE SAME AS KILLING MYSELF.

116
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,875
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'D DO
SUCH A THING, DEAR SISTER?

117
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,208
- I AM NOT YOUR SISTER.

118
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,000
- Hirohisa: I CAN'T TELL HOW 
THINGS STAND IN THE CITY NOW.

119
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,708
BUT IT'S NOT HARD TO GUESS

120
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,333
FROM HOW IT IS
HERE ON THE MOUNTAIN.

121
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,791
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE GOING THERE,

122
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,916
BUT I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE OF
THE SENSE OF DUTY

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,416
YOU CARRY WITH YOU.

124
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,083
BUT YOU KNOW,

125
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,375
YOU COULD CHOOSE TO STOP
CARRYING IT AROUND.

126
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,875
- Chief of Gabe:
IT HAS LONG BEEN SAID THAT WE,

127
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,208
THE UNDERGROUND EXILES
WHO RESIDE HERE,

128
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,208
HAVE DEMONS
IN OUR HEARTS.

129
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,875
THOSE WHO HAD KILLED,

130
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,416
AND THOSE WHO
HADN'T YET

131
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,541
WERE ALL DRIVEN 
INTO THIS ABYSS.

132
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,208
ARE WE NOT HUMAN BEINGS?

133
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,583
ARE WE NOT EVEN WORTHY
OF LIVING AS HUMAN BEINGS?

134
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,541
THOSE WHO LOSE
THEIR LIVES HERE

135
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,708
ARE ALL THROWN INTO
THIS RAVINE

136
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,541
TO BE REINCARNATED
AS RAFFIA FLOWERS.

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,750
IS IT THE ONLY MEANING
OUR LIVES AND EXISTENCE HAVE?

138
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,333
OHH.

139
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,916
ARE YOU WELCOMING ME
INTO THE NEXT LIFE? 

140
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,583
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME FOR FAILING
TO PROTECT THE SEER?

141
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,583
- Shinji: DID I EVER
TELL YOU HOW WE GOT STARTED?

142
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,750
ME, HAL,
AND THIS ONE OTHER GUY

143
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
FIRST STARTED
THE RACAN.

144
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,083
THIS GUY, TOMO.

145
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,791
HE WAS A YEAR OLDER THAN ME.

146
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,625
HE WAS THE ORIGINAL LEADER.

147
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,250
BACK THEN, THERE WAS
ANOTHER GANG OF KIDS

148
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
BESIDES THE RACAN.

149
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,666
AND JUST WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TO
HAVE A SPECTACLE AGAINST THEM,

150
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,000
THIS TOMO,
HE CHICKENED OUT.

151
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,666
SPECTACLE AFTER SPECTACLE
AFTER SPECTACLE.

152
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,125
WE BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM
EVERY TIME,

153
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,750
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

154
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,375
AND THEN,
AS MUCH AS WE WERE WINNING,

155
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,875
WE GOT TIRED OF HAVING
SPECTACLES AGAINST KIDS

156
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:58,958
ALL THE TIME.

157
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,208
SO WE DECIDED TO GO KILL
THE ORGANO GUYS

158
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,708
IN THEIR FANCY SUITS.

159
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
BUT DON'T HOLD A GRUDGE
AGAINST ME.

160
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,250
I'M TIRED OF YOU GUYS.
SO NOW I'M GONNA START

161
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,916
A SPECTACLE WITH
THE LIGHT ON THE HILL.

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,625
AND THERE'S NOBODY
WHO CAN STOP ME

163
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,416
SINCE ALL THOSE SHAPES
HAVE TURNED TO CRAP.

164
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
- WHAT POSSIBLE GOOD
WILL IT DO NOW

165
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,541
TO WIPE OUT EVERYBODY
IN THE CLASS?

166
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,333
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I'M SURE I WILL KNOW

167
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,375
WHEN IT'S ALL DONE.
DON'T YOU AGREE?

168
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,666
YOU'RE GONNA GO
SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

169
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,000
AND I'M GONNA
GO KILL PEOPLE.

170
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,666
I THOUGHT THAT DOING
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE FROM YOU

171
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,875
WOULD BE RATHER POETIC.

172
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,666
HEY, THOSE SHITHEADS WHO
ARE STILL ALIVE IN THE CITY?

173
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,125
SO HOW COME THEY'VE
ALL GONE CRAZY LIKE THAT?

174
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,458
- YOU AND ME,

175
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,833
WE'RE BOTH
THE SAME AS THEM.

176
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,666
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

177
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,250
- ( motorcycle revs )

178
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,583
- Onishi: THE CITY...

179
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,375
THE VOICE OF THE CITY...

180
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,708
IS THIS CITY
DRIVING ITSELF TO INSANITY?

181
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,750
- Ran: DO YOU WANT TO DRIVE
EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE

182
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,041
TO INSANITY?

183
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,083
JUST AS YOU'VE DONE
TO YOUR OWN MIND?

184
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,083
- Kano: THEORIA.

185
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,750
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING?

186
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,750
THE PEOPLE OF LUX,

187
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,083
THEY'RE NOTHING BUT 
A GROUP OF HOMUNCULI

188
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,083
THAT ARE ERODING
INSIDE MY HEAD. 

189
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,791
- ( gunshot )

190
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,250
- EVER SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE KID,

191
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,083
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SOME DAY
I WOULD COME AND LIVE HERE.

192
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,083
I WAS SO NAIVE TO THINK
THAT I'D BE ACCEPTED.

193
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,041
ACCEPTED INTO THE LIGHT
THAT WAS ON THE HILL.

194
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,583
WHAT A JOKE.

195
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,083
FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

196
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,291
LAUGHABLE.

197
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,541
LAUGH!

198
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,000
I SAID "LAUGH"!

199
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,125
I HAD SERIOUSLY BELIEVED
THAT THE PEOPLE ON THE HILL

200
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
WERE ALMOST LIKE GODS!

201
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,875
THAT IS...

202
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,458
UNTIL I SAW YOU, KANO!

203
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,583
THIS IS...

204
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,708
THE LIGHT?

205
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,291
SO YOU'RE THEM?

206
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,333
( gasps )

207
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,583
IT'S ALL RAFFIA?

208
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,958
SO MANY?

209
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,166
WHAT?

210
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,833
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME
BE ONE OF YOU?

211
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,125
( chuckles )

212
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,375
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

213
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
- Ran: SATISFIED?

214
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,875
- Kano:
THE BLOODLINE OF MY FAMILY

215
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,208
HAS BEEN CONTINUED
BY ITS MEN MATING 

216
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,875
WITH THEIR MOTHERS
AND SISTERS.

217
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,125
IT WAS ALL TO BRING
ME INTO THE WORLD. 

218
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,250
I, THE ONE WHO WILL BECOME
THE BRAIN OF THIS WORLD.

219
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,583
THEREFORE,
IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED.

220
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,583
- Ran: I TOO AM BEING
DRIVEN INSANE.

221
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,916
I TOLD WHAT I SAW
TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY,

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,916
AND SHOWED THEM MY POWER.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,583
BUT...

224
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,833
- RAN.

225
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,291
RAN?
( grunts )

226
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,291
RAN.

227
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,291
( panting )

228
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,666
I'VE COME BACK.

229
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,333
WAIT.

230
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,208
RAN!

231
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,833
- I FELT AFFECTION
FOR THESE LEGS

232
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,791
THE FIRST TIME THEY 
STOPPED FUNCTIONING.

233
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,666
- Ran: ARE YOU STILL
HOLDING ONTO YOUR SANITY?

234
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,291
- THERE'S NO WAY
FOR ME TO KNOW

235
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,333
IF I'M REALLY
SANE ANYMORE.

236
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,875
IF I AM,
THEN FOR THE VERY FIRST

237
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,541
TIME IN MY LIFE

238
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,041
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

239
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,291
VOICE OF THE CITY
THAT HAS SPOKEN TO ME

240
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,666
ALL THESE YEARS,

241
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,958
PLEASE TELL ME.

242
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,541
- I'VE BEEN UP TO 
THE SURFACE WORLD.

243
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,875
I MET MY FATHER THERE.

244
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,708
IT WASN'T THE KIND OF 
PLACE I COULD LIVE IN.

245
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,041
BUT RAN,

246
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,791
I WANT TO TAKE YOU UP THERE.

247
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,791
ABOVE GROUND

248
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,750
WHERE NOBODY WANTS TO KILL.

249
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,041
WHY DID YOU LOOK AFTER ME
ALL OF THIS TIME?

250
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,708
WHENEVER I WAS IN TROUBLE,

251
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,958
I FOUND THE FLOWERS
THAT I'D NEVER

252
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,416
BEEN ABLE TO HAVE BEFORE.

253
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,750
SO WHAT CHOICE
HAVE I GOT?

254
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,625
I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU.

255
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,625
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY I CAME BACK. 

256
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,166
RAN!

257
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,750
- PLEASE TELL ME.

258
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,791
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

259
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
- Ran: KILL ME.

260
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,083
I'M THE ONE WHO DROVE
THIS CITY INSANE.

261
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,458
YOU MUST KILL ME.

262
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,750
- IF THAT'S YOUR WISH.

263
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,833
- ( men chuckle )

264
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,333
- ( sighs )

265
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,208
( gasps )

266
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,583
- IF THE ONLY WAY TO BE
GRANTED LIFE IN THIS WORLD

267
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,833
IS TO SURRENDER MY BODY
AND SOUL TO INSANITY,

268
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,291
THEN I SHALL CHOOSE
TO MEET MY DOOM!

269
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,583
( shouts )

270
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,916
( screams )

271
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,250
- ONISHI!

272
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,916
- ( theme music playing )

273
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,583
- ( singing in Japanese )
