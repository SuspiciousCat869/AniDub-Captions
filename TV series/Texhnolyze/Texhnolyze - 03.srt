1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,791
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,875
- ( laughs )

6
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,416
- ( panting )

7
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,416
- ( wails )

8
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:50,791
- Woman: PLEASE, DON'T LOOK.

9
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,791
- ICHISE.

10
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,666
- ( music over sound )

11
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,875
- Yoshii: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH
THE MONEY FROM SELLING FLOWERS?

12
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,666
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE CITY, ARE YOU?

13
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,458
IS IT A SAFE ENOUGH
PLACE FOR A GIRL

14
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,666
TO HANG OUT BY HERSELF?

15
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,125
I'M INDEBTED TO YOU
AND YOUR GRANDFATHER.

16
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,583
SO I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO HELP YOU.

17
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,666
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WORLD
OF LUX IS A PLACE

18
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,833
COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR TO ME,

19
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,583
BUT THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON
WE SHOULD--

20
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,583
RAN, CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?

21
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,791
- WHAT?
- I HEARD THAT YOU

22
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,958
CAN SOMETIMES SEE
THE NEAR FUTURE.

23
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,583
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

24
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,583
- ONLY ONE POSSIBLE FUTURE.

25
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,083
- YOU SAW MY FUTURE,
DIDN'T YOU?

26
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,250
I DON'T WANT YOU

27
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,375
TO TELL ANYONE
ABOUT MY FUTURE,

28
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,416
ESPECIALLY ME.

29
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,583
- ( ringing )

30
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,458
- ( alarm beeping )

31
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,416
- ( beeping stops )

32
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,666
- ( sighs )

33
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,625
- WATER.

34
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,625
WATER.

35
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,083
 WATER.

36
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,500
- YOU SHOULD SAY PLEASE.

37
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,625
- PLEASE.

38
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,041
- ( beeping )

39
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,083
- ( gasping )

40
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
- ( loud thud )
- ( grunts )

41
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,458
( panting )

42
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,166
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

43
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,250
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO THAT DUMP.

44
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,166
- ( wheels clacking )

45
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,833
- ( telephone ringing )

46
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,541
- OH, WOULD YOU?
MY HANDS ARE FULL.

47
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,041
- ONISHI.

48
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,791
- ( beeping )

49
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,541
- WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH IT

50
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,083
PRESERVED IN SUCH A WAY?

51
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,083
A MEMENTO?

52
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,833
DON'T TELL ME YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD STILL REATTACH IT

53
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,791
TO YOUR BODY.

54
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,750
THE CELLS IN YOUR ARM
ARE LONG DEAD.

55
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,333
EVEN RAFFIA DOESN'T HAVE

56
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,541
THE POWER TO REATTACH
A MUMMIFIED BODY PART.

57
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,083
- ( grunts )
- ( gasping )

58
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
( gagging )

59
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,583
- RAFFIA.

60
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,666
- RAFFIA.

61
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,791
- I'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO

62
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,500
WITH ANYTHING
INVOLVING RAFFIA.

63
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,250
- THE PLACE YOU LIVED IN
IS GONE.

64
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,625
IT WAS BURNT TO THE GROUND.

65
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,416
- WHERE IS IT?

66
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,208
TELL ME WHERE IT IS.

67
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,666
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST LOOK
RIGHT OVER THERE?

68
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,541
- ( gasps )

69
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,583
- HUH?

70
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,083
HMM.

71
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,333
- ( gasps )

72
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,333
- YOU WANNA WAGE A WAR
THAT BADLY?

73
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,125
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HOPE
TO ACCOMPLISH?

74
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,833
DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN REPLACE THE ORGANO?

75
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,250
THE MAN THAT YOU WORSHIP

76
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,916
SO BLINDLY-- KIMATA.

77
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,875
DO YOU KNOW WHY
HE'S TEXHNOLYZED?

78
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,791
OR MAYBE YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THE LEADER

79
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,333
OF YOU FLESH FUNDAMENTALISTS

80
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,833
IS A TEXHNOLYZE HIMSELF.

81
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,708
THE ONLY THING THAT KIMATA WANTS
IS THE RAFFIA.

82
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,875
HE'S NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION

83
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,750
OF DELIVERING
YOUR LIBERATION.

84
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,875
- ( whimpering )

85
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,375
( shouting )

86
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,375
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

87
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,875
- WAKE UP AND SMELL THE WORLD.

88
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,875
IF YOU'RE GOING BY THE TEXTBOOK,
THEN...

89
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,625
OH, WELL, AND I JUST WENT
THROUGH THE TROUBLE

90
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,750
OF HAVING IT SERVICED.

91
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,708
- I BELIEVE IT WASN'T
BY ACCIDENT

92
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,916
THAT I PICKED YOU UP.
I FOR ONE THINK THAT IT'S BORING

93
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,375
TO KEEP REPRODUCING
THE SAME TECHNOLOGY

94
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,750
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

95
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,083
WITH RAFFIA
AND TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS,

96
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,250
A HUMAN ONLY RECOVERS
THE PREVIOUS SHAPE

97
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,750
AND NOTHING MORE.

98
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,500
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO CREATE
A MORE UNIQUE CHEMISTRY

99
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,541
FROM THE COMBINATION.

100
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,500
- TELL ME.
WHERE IS IT?

101
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,250
- YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT IT.

102
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,416
IF I WERE TO BILL YOU FOR THE
OPERATION AT THE NORMAL RATE,

103
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,958
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY PAY
EVEN WITH AN ENTIRE LIFETIME

104
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,541
OF HARD LABOR.

105
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,041
- TELL ME.  WHERE IS IT?

106
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,041
- WELL, I DIDN'T THROW IT AWAY.

107
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,666
I'M ASKING YOU WHAT YOU DID
WITH IT.

108
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,333
WILL YOU TELL ME
WHO IT IS?

109
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,000
THOUGH I CAN GUESS.

110
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,458
I SEE THOSE EVERY NOW AND THEN.

111
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,416
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
TO BURY THEIR DEAD

112
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,166
IN A LOW INCOME CEMETERY.

113
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,041
USUALLY THEIR WIFE
OR HUSBAND.

114
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,541
GIRLFRIEND?  PROBABLY NOT.

115
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,541
YOUR MOTHER.

116
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,541
- ( gasps )

117
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,416
- SHE'S IN THERE.

118
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,333
I MERELY HAD HER PLACED

119
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,583
INSIDE THAT TEXHNOLYZE UNIT.

120
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,458
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
THAT KEEPING

121
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,791
ONLY CELLS ALIVE

122
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,541
IS ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS.

123
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,041
YOU KNEW IT,

124
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,291
BUT YOU COULDN'T HELP IT.

125
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,625
YOU COULDN'T GET RID OF IT.

126
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,208
AFTER ALL, IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

127
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,625
THAT UNIT HAS BECOME A LIVING
BEING AS IT WERE.

128
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,125
IT'S MORE THAN A MECHANISM
OPERATING IN COMBINATION

129
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,458
WITH THE NEUROTRANSMISSION
SYSTEM.

130
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,833
WHAT I HAVE DONE

131
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,666
IS UTILIZE YOUR MOTHER'S CELLS

132
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,083
AS THE BIOCIRCUIT.

133
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
- ( panting )

134
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,083
- THAT'S GOING TO
BE YOUR NEW ARM

135
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,500
AND YOUR NEW LEG.

136
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,500
I TOOK YOUR PRECISE MEASUREMENTS
WHEN I CREATED THOSE.

137
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,958
TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS ARE ALWAYS
ORDER MADE.

138
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,000
- NOW I SEE.

139
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,291
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

140
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,041
BLOW THE OPPORTUNITIES
THAT ARE GIVEN TO YOU?

141
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,041
LIVE WITHOUT MEANING
AND DIE WITHOUT MEANING?

142
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,291
- BY HAVING A MECHANICAL ARM
AND LEG?

143
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,958
I DON'T NEED ANY
OF THOSE THINGS.

144
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,291
- FINE WITH ME, BUT YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE THAT UNIT

145
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,291
DOWN WITH YOU.  YOU'RE GOING TO
KILL YOUR OWN MOTHER

146
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:02,083
WITH YOUR OWN HAND.  LOVELY.

147
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,833
- DAMN YOU!

148
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,375
( screaming )

149
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,166
( grunts )

150
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,291
- DOC, I TRIED TO ADVISE YOU
AGAINST DOING THIS,

151
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,875
DID I NOT?

152
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,416
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

153
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,291
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE HAD
I BEEN MORE MERCIFUL

154
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,583
AND PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY
BACK WHEN WE FIRST MET,

155
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,958
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
PICKED UP BY YOU.

156
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,500
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

157
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,416
YOU SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED AND KILL
HIM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

158
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
- I DID NOT CUT HIM.

159
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,666
I WOULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER
DULLING MY BLADE

160
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,416
ON A MERE STRAY DOG.

161
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,416
- ( gasping )

162
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,333
- HE'S NOT DEAD.

163
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,458
- ALTHOUGH AN ORDINARY HUMAN
WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN DEAD.

164
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,250
