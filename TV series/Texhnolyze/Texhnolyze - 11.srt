1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,750
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,500
- TAKING AN ASSESSMENT
OF THE DAMAGE IS NOW SECONDARY.

6
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,583
POINT IS SOMEONE MUST
TAKE THE BLAME.

7
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,375
SADLY, THERE SEEMS TO BE
NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT.

8
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,958
- IF WE FAIL TO SHOW OUR
SINCERITY TO THE CLASS,

9
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,916
IT'LL ALMOST CERTAINLY
AFFECT OUR FUTURE.

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,916
- WE THINK THE ONLY SOLUTION
IS A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,916
- WE MUST DO SOMETHING NOW.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,125
- IN MY HUMBLE OPINION,
IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF MAKING

13
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,125
A CLEAR DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THOSE

14
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,416
WHO DIDN'T DO WHAT THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO DO

15
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
AND THOSE WHO DID.

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,083
- BUT AFTER THAT I PUT OFF
A FINAL DECISION.

17
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,041
SO YOU'RE UNDER MY PROTECTION
FOR THE TIME BEING.

18
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,625
- I'M SORRY FOR CAUSING YOU
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

19
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,166
- DON'T APOLOGIZE.

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,916
DID YOU DO ANYTHING

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,875
YOU MUST APOLOGIZE FOR?

22
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,916
IT'S FOR THE BEST
THAT YOU LAY LOW

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,416
FOR THE TIME BEING.
WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS

24
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,291
FOR BOTH THE CITY
AND THE ORGANIZATION.

25
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,625
- YES.

26
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,291
- YOU SEEM TO BE CONCERNED
ABOUT THAT BOY.

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,291
- SIR.
- ( laughs )

28
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,083
WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

29
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,041
HAPPENS FOR HIM AS WELL.

30
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,208
- WE'RE GOING TO BE BUSY.
- SIR.

31
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,666
- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
WAIT UNTIL I BECOME LEADER.

32
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,958
WE NEED TO START DOING
THE THINGS WE CAN RIGHT NOW.

33
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,916
- AH.
- DON'T "AH" ME.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,250
HERE'S A PIECE OF ADVICE.
A COMPETENT MAN IS ONE

35
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,166
WHO ALWAYS THINKS AHEAD.
UNDERSTAND?

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,291
- UH, YEAH.

37
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,291
- HE TELLS ME THAT YOU SEEM
TO BE BORED.

38
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,666
SO I THOUGHT YOU COULD KILL
SOME TIME BY GOING WITH US.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,458
THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU
TO FIND.

40
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,916
HE'S USUALLY HANGING AROUND
IN THIS AREA,

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,875
BUT HASN'T BEEN SEEN
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

42
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,333
I CAN SEE YOU HAVE
NO PARTICULAR OBJECTION.

43
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,750
YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE HIM
A LITTLE HAND WITH IT.

44
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,125
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,208
- HUH.

46
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,333
INTERESTING.
YOU'VE HEARD THE SAYING,

47
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,958
"BIRDS OF A FEATHER
FLOCK TOGETHER."

48
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,958
( laughs )

49
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,375
- Toyama: THE ORGANO IS MADE UP
OF A FEW ORGANIZATIONS

50
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,333
UNITED AS ONE.

51
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,916
THIS UNITY WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN POSSIBLE

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,833
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

53
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,083
IT EXISTS ONLY BECAUSE A MAN

54
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,458
LIKE MR. ONISHI IS IN CHARGE.

55
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,416
I SEE YOU'RE NOT
VERY INTERESTED.

56
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,416
DID YOU WAIT LONG?
- THANKS TO YOU

57
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,250
I'M DRUNK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

58
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,416
- SO--
- NO DOUBT IT WAS SAKAZAKI.

59
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,250
A WITNESS SAW HIM CARRYING
A PAPER BAG

60
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,666
AND WALKING HURRIEDLY PAST
THE OBELISK

61
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,125
ON THE DAY IT GOT BLASTED.

62
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,708
- AND?
- MMM.

63
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,083
THEN HE STARTS SPENDING
ALL OF HIS MONEY

64
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,166
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW
AND THEN JUST DISAPPEARS.

65
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,625
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE WENT?

66
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,833
OVER TO MASAMUNE'S FACTORY.

67
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,583
MOST LIKELY HE GOT ATTRACTED
TO THE BOOZE THERE.

68
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,125
CHANCES ARE HE SHOULD STILL
BE SLUMMING AROUND IN THAT AREA.

69
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,458
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

70
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,666
IF YOU DON'T WANNA GO, I CAN
ARRANGE SOMEONE TO GO FOR YOU.

71
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,375
BUT THEN I'M GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE OF THIS.

72
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,125
- I'LL GO.
- WHATEVER.

73
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,083
I THINK THE CHANCES ARE PRETTY
GOOD THAT HE WON'T KILL YOU

74
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,375
IN COLD BLOOD.
- UH-HUH.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,125
- LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT
THE ARSONISTS WERE A FEW IDIOTS

76
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:46,000
IN OUR ORGANIZATION,
BUT I HAVE ONISHI'S WORD

77
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,458
THAT YOU'LL BE COMPENSATED.

78
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,000
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
IN OUR END OF THINGS,

79
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,166
YOU'LL HAVE MY COMPLETE SUPPORT.

80
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,750
- ( all gasp )

81
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,083
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN.

82
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,416
I'M SURE YOU DO.

83
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,666
WELL, I'LL COME AND SEE
YOU AGAIN SOME TIME,

84
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,500
AND I'M SURE WE CAN CONTINUE
THIS LITTLE CHAT THEN.

85
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,250
IN THE MEANTIME,
PLEASE WAIT UNTIL

86
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,541
YOU RECEIVE FURTHER DIRECTION
FROM US.  UNTIL THEN.

87
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,458
- SO DID IT LOOK LIKE
I'M IN CHARGE?

88
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,041
- I THINK SO.

89
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,166
- WHO WAS THAT?

90
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,250
- WELL, MUST BE SOME PISS ANT.

91
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,833
- WHATEVER HAPPENS, PLEASE TRY
TO CONTAIN YOURSELF.

92
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,458
THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE
THAT EVEN RESIDENTS

93
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,208
DO THEIR BEST TO STAY AWAY FROM.

94
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,250
- ( gasps )

95
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,041
- IS MY OLD MAN HERE?
- YES.

96
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,291
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

97
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,958
- I DON'T KNOW.

98
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,333
- THERE IS NO WAY
YOU DON'T KNOW.

99
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,208
- THEN I FORGOT.

100
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,291
( sighs ) BUT WHO KNOWS?

101
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,708
MAYBE I'LL REMEMBER IT
SOONER OR LATER.

102
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,375
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

103
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,333
THIS MAN IS UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF ONISHI.

104
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,791
- AND HERE I WAS THINKING
YOU MIGHT HAVE MATURED A BIT.

105
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
- MEANING?

106
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,333
- YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE

107
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,041
IF YOU THINK I'LL GIVE YOU
THE INFORMATION

108
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,541
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FATHER.

109
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,333
THE WORLD DOESN'T
REVOLVE AROUND YOU.

110
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,375
YOU'VE LOST YOUR SENSE
OF RIGHT AND WRONG.

111
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,083
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
JOIN A GROUP LIKE THE ORGANO.

112
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:57,083
DON'T COME HERE EMPTY-HANDED
LIKE A LITTLE BRAT.

113
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,833
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FROM ME,
THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.

114
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,833
IF YOU CAN'T,
THEN GET OUT OF MY SIGHT.

115
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,875
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

116
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,916
- YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

117
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,708
- IF YOU WEREN'T MY FATHER,
I'D HAVE ALREADY KILLED YOU.

118
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,208
- HMM.

119
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,125
- COULD YOU PLEASE WAIT OUTSIDE
FOR ME?

120
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,291
- Man: RAN, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO THE CITY?

121
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,125
THE FLOWERS YOU PICKED
ARE GOING TO WITHER AWAY.

122
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,875
- NOTHING.

123
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,291
NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

124
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,000
- RAN.

125
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,750
- Toyama:
IS THE INFORMATION SOLID? 

126
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,541
- YEAH,

127
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,416
BUT THE BOSS THERE
CAN BE SUCH A PIGHEAD.

128
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,041
WHETHER YOU CAN SEE SAKAZAKI
OR NOT WILL DEPEND

129
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,250
ON HOW WELL YOU DO.

130
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PRETTY GOOD.

131
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,958
- NEXT TIME I REALLY
WILL KILL YOU.

132
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,625
- AND?

133
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,375
- AND THAT'S ALL THERE
IS TO IT.

134
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,791
- BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T
EXPLAINED WHAT IT IS.

135
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,083
I DON'T GET WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

136
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,125
- YOU DON'T GET IT?  WHY NOT?

137
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,416
- DID YOU GET WHAT HE SAID?
- UNH-UNH.

138
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,416
NOT ONE SINGLE WORD.
- WELL.

139
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,708
- I'M TELLING YOU
THAT I'LL MAKE SURE

140
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,666
YOU WON'T LOSE ANYTHING
FROM IT.

141
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,166
- SO THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

142
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,666
- BECAUSE I'LL BE THE NEW HEAD
OF THE ORGANO.

143
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,833
- Both: HUH?

144
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,958
- GET LOST, MAN.
YOU'RE NOT WORTH TALKING TO.

145
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,333
- ( stammers )

146
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,291
- YOU BASTARD!

147
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,416
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

148
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,750
- NOPE.

149
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,625
- I'LL MAKE YOU VERY SORRY
FOR THIS.

150
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,458
LOUSY PUNKS.

151
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,166
- OOH, I'M SCARED.

152
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,083
- ( laughs )

153
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,416
- Man: YOU.
YOUR IKUSEI'S BOY, AREN'T YOU?

154
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,541
DOING QUITE WELL
FOR YOURSELF, EH?

155
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,958
- I THOUGHT YOU DIED
IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE.

156
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,958
- DID YOU JOIN THE ORGANO
OR SOMETHING?

157
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,666
YOU GAVE IN TO THE POWERFUL.
IS THAT IT?

158
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,875
- THINK YOU COULD FOLLOW
IN YOUR OLD MAN'S FOOTSTEPS.

159
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,166
- I WILL NEVER ALLOW IT,
SOME YOUNG PUNK LIKE YOU,

160
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,375
I WON'T ALLOW TO EXIST.
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

161
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,250
THAT IKUSEI'S SON GETS
TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE THAN ME.

162
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,458
- I WON'T ALLOW PEOPLE
LIKE YOU TO EXIST, EITHER.

163
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,916
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO NOW.

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,750
NOTHING YOU CAN DO AT ALL.

165
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,083
- ( grunting )

166
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,958
- EXCEPT DRAG DOWN THOSE
WHO TRY TO RISE ABOVE.

167
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,625
SCUM.

168
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,416
LET GO.  LET ME GO.

169
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,541
BASTARD!

170
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,791
I'M SORRY.

171
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,833
I WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

172
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,916
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE HAD
AN INFURIATING MOMENT.

173
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,125
LET'S GO.

174
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
I KNOW NOW WHERE THE MAN IS.

175
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,250
I WANTED TO GET OUT
OF THIS PLACE.

176
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,375
I SIMPLY COULDN'T STAND IT.

177
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,458
I HATE PEOPLE WHO ENVY OTHERS

178
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,166
AND DON'T DO ANYTHING
THEMSELVES.

179
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,375
AND I RESENTED THE FACT THAT
I WAS MY FATHER'S SON.

180
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,833
THAT'S WHY I CHANGED MY NAME.

181
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:01,208
AND THAT'S WHY I DID THIS.

182
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,000
THEY SAY THAT ACTS

183
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,416
SUCH AS SELF-INJURY
AND MUTILATION

184
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,333
LIKE GETTING TATTOOS
SIGNIFY AN ATTEMPT

185
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,333
TO DENY ONE'S BLOOD TIES.

186
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,708
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPIER
TO GET TEXHNOLYZED.

187
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,250
I WANTED PROOF THAT I WAS
NOTHING LIKE THAT MAN.

188
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,750
- IF YOU HATE YOUR FATHER
SO MUCH, THEN WHY?

189
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,625
- I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THE BOSS HERE

190
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,500
IS QUITE AN UNREASONABLE MAN.

191
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,875
YOU CAN RUN A BIT WILD
IF YOU'D LIKE.

192
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,083
WELL, SHALL WE GO?

193
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,583
- NICE WORK.
GET SOME REST.

194
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,291
- Toyama: IT'S BECAUSE
I'M GRATEFUL TO KOHAKURA.

195
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,541
THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED,

196
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,833
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE
WHO FOUND ME AND RESCUED ME

197
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,208
FROM THAT PLACE.
WHAT I DID TODAY IS NOTHING.

198
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,541
IF I CAN REPAY HIM
BY DOING SO,

199
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,375
BUT SOMETIMES I CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER IF THE DECISIONS

200
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
I'VE MADE ARE RIGHT.

201
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,500
I FEEL THAT WAY
ESPECIALLY AFTER WATCHING YOU.

202
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,666
I WONDER WHAT WILL
EVENTUALLY BECOME OF YOU.

203
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,166
I WONDER IF YOU CAN STILL REMAIN
EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE NOW.

204
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,416
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF?

205
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,125
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO DO?

206
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,583
- I JUST--

207
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,500
- GOOD NIGHT THEN.

208
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,458
- IN SHORT, WE SIMPLY HAVE TO
GET RID OF ONISHI.

209
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,750
ISN'T THAT SO, GREAT FATHER?

210
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,875
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE CLASS
IS GOING TO REACT,

211
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,375
NOR THE UNION, NOR RACAN.

212
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,791
BESIDES, THE GENERAL PUBLIC
IS FEELING APPREHENSIVE.

213
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,500
WE MUST REPLACE
THE LEADER IMMEDIATELY.

214
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,833
AND BY DOING SO,
SHOW TO THE WORLD

215
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,625
THAT THE ORGANO HAS CHANGED.
- I AGREE AS WELL.

216
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,583
- BECAUSE I'M RIGHT.
- I SUGGEST WE CUT OUT

217
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,500
THE CANCER
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION.

218
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,625
- THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
SO, GREAT FATHER--

219
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,458
- AND TO HELP GET THAT STARTED,
I HAD A COUPLE OF MY MEN

220
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,708
CAPTURE THE OBELISK BOMBER.
- ( gasps )

221
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,208
- HOWEVER, THIS BOMBER CLAIMS
THAT SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM

222
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,125
PUT HIM UP TO DOING IT.

223
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,000
- DO YOU HAVE THE MAN HERE?
- YES.

224
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,791
- BRING HIM IN.

225
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,500
- OH.

226
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,250
- ARE YOU THE ONE
WHO BOMBED THE OBELISK?

227
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,833
- ( gasping )

228
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,833
- WHO PUT YOU UP TO IT?

229
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,833
POINT TO HIM.

230
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,416
- TO KEIGO ONISHI
AND HIS RETURN TO POWER.

231
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,083
CHEERS.

232
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,666
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY.

233
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,458
- I CAN'T SMILE FOR A DOCTOR
WHO'S SO INCONSIDERATE

234
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,041
THAT SHE GULPS DOWN ALCOHOL
IN FRONT OF HER PATIENT.

235
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,625
- OOPS.  SORRY.
- ( door opens )

236
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,333
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
- A MESSAGE FROM KOHAKURA.

237
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,833
HE SAYS HE'S GIVING ME
TO YOU AS A GIFT.

238
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,333
- AND THAT'S COMPLETELY FINE
WITH YOU?

239
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,333
- IF NOT, I WOULDN'T HAVE COME.

240
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,333
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I REALLY DON'T KNOW

241
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,500
WHAT IS IT THAT I WANT TO DO

242
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
OR WHAT IT IS
THAT I SHOULD DO.

243
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,916
BUT I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO WHERE I WAS BEFORE.

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,416
AND I HAVE NO PLACE
TO GO NOW.

245
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,291
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

246
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,625
- Onishi:
THEN DO AS YOU WISH.

247
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,250
- QUITE STRANGE THAT BOY.

248
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,208
- ( panting )

249
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,916
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

250
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,875
YOU SAW IT, DIDN'T YOU?

251
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,625
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA
KNOW THAT FOR?

252
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,541
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

253
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,541
- I CAN SEE EVERYTHING NOW.

254
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,041
BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

255
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,041
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANYTHING ANYMORE.

256
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,416
- ( theme music playing )

257
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,916
- ( singing in Japanese )
