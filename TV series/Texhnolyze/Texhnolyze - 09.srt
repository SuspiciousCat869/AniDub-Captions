1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,000
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,666
- ( growls )

6
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,166
HUH?
- ( screams )

7
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,208
- SHINJI!

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,666
- ONISHI.

9
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,416
- SHINJI!
- ONISHI!

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
- STOP IT.

11
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,708
- ( sighs )

12
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,041
- ( whistles )

13
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,708
- HUH?
- ( gasping )

14
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,583
- ( shouts )

15
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,666
- WHOM TO KEEP ALIVE?

16
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,583
- TURN RIGHT QUICKLY.
- ( tires screeching )

17
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,708
- ( gunshot )
- RATS!

18
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,666
DON'T SLOW DOWN.

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,708
- HMM.

20
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,375
- Onishi: AS IF HE HASN'T GOT
A CARE IN THE WORLD.

21
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,583
- Mana:
WHERE SHOULD WE GO?

22
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,250
- LET HIM SLEEP
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

23
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,500
- YES.

24
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,250
- ( beeping )

25
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,375
- Man: REALLY?  ONISHI?

26
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,000
THEY DID, HUH?  I SEE.

27
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,750
- WELL, YEAH.

28
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,208
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO PLAN.

29
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,791
- ( coin rattles )

30
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,041
- ( grunts )

31
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,791
- HMM?

32
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,791
DID YOU JUST HEAR
SOMETHING?

33
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,750
- ( gasps ) NO, I DIDN'T.

34
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,583
- ( telephone rings )

35
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,041
- THE OBELISK?  HOW ABOUT
THE SUBTERRANEAN DIG SITE?

36
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,833
- SO THEN IT'S TRUE.

37
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,875
- YES, I SEE.

38
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,625
YOU MEAN IT CAN BE RESTORED
IN NO TIME?

39
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,041
GIVE IT TOP PRIORITY.

40
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,541
- Man:
SO WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

41
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,083
- NOW IT'S GETTING INTERESTING.

42
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,000
- Man:
WE LEAVE ONISHI IN CHARGE

43
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,125
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS.

44
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,750
- THE PROBLEM IS

45
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,666
HOW ARE WE GOING TO WEATHER
THE COMING STORM?

46
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,583
- IF THEY'RE COMING TO SEE US,
THE ONLY WAY TO HANDLE THIS

47
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,125
DELICATE SITUATION IS TO HAVE
MR. GOTO MEET WITH HIM.

48
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,708
- MR. SONODA,
MR. TSUJINAKA,

49
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,958
YOU DON'T MEAN TO HAVE
GOTO THE GREAT FATHER,

50
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,125
GO TO THEM EMPTY-HANDED,
DO YOU?

51
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,458
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT HIS AGE.

52
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,333
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRAGGING
OUT A HOSPITALIZED MAN.

53
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,666
WE CAN'T JUST ALLOW HIM
TO BE HUMILIATED LIKE THAT.

54
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,166
- AND YOUR POINT?

55
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,083
- WITHOUT PUNISHING
THE MAN RESPONSIBLE,

56
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,166
HOW CAN WE
MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE?

57
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,916
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ONISHI.

58
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,416
HE SAT ON THE FENCE AND STRUCK
A DEAL WITH THE ENEMY.

59
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,375
- SO, GENTLEMEN,
DOES ANYONE HERE DISAGREE?

60
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,208
- NOW I BROUGHT THIS UP,

61
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,791
SO OF COURSE,
I'LL CARRY IT OUT.

62
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,958
JUST TRUST ME.

63
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,500
- HOW DID IT GO, SIR?

64
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,958
- THINGS JUST GOT A LOT
MORE COMPLICATED.

65
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,916
I HAVE A LITTLE JOB FOR YOU.

66
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,166
- SO NOW?

67
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,750
- I'M RETURNING TO THE OFFICE.
CALL ME WHEN HE WAKES UP.

68
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
- YES, SIR, I WILL.

69
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,625
- ( explosion )
- OH!

70
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,875
- THIS WAY!
- ( glass shatters )

71
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,083
- ( shouting )

72
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,500
- ( gunshots )

73
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,458
- ( laughing )

74
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,500
- LOOKS LIKE ONISHI WASN'T
IN HIS OFFICE AFTER ALL.

75
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,458
- ( laughs )

76
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,000
HEY, GO GET ME SOME KOI.

77
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,500
GO ON.

78
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,958
- ( panting )

79
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,000
- ( engine revving )

80
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,416
- TOYAMA.
- MR. ONISHI.

81
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,541
YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK
TO YOUR OFFICE RIGHT NOW.

82
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,875
THAT IS NO LONGER
A SAFE PLACE FOR YOU TO BE.

83
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,750
I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU'D
BETTER KEEP MOVING.

84
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

85
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,916
- THE DIG SITE
HAS BEEN VANDALIZED.

86
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

87
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,541
- THE PEOPLE UP ON THE HILL
ARE COMING DOWN.

88
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,916
THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
HAS DECIDED THAT YOU

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
SHALL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

90
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,458
- ( gasps )

91
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,458
- THE MEN FROM MIZUNO'S OFFICE
ARE NOW OUT LOOKING FOR YOU.

92
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,833
- MIZUNO?

93
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,833
- WE SUGGEST THAT YOU MAKE HASTE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

94
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,291
- WHY?

95
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,291
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

96
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,791
IS THIS KOHAKURA'S IDEA?

97
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,208
- MR. ONISHI, IF YOU THINK
SOMEONE'S PULLING THE STRINGS

98
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,291
BEHIND ALL THESE DISTURBANCES,

99
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,791
THEN PERHAPS

100
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,333
I COULD INVESTIGATE FOR YOU.

101
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,916
- ( man humming )

102
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,708
- ( door opens )
- HMM?

103
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,208
- I NEED TO USE THIS.

104
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,166
- MR. ONISHI!

105
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,750
- ( telephone rings )

106
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,708
- ( clicks )

107
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,708
- MANA, I NEED YOU TO GET OUT
OF THERE IMMEDIATELY.

108
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,166
MANA.

109
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,416
HEY!  WHAT'S WRONG?

110
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,166
MANA!

111
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,250
WHO'S THERE?

112
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,916
- MR. ONISHI, I WENT THROUGH
SO MUCH TROUBLE

113
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,541
TO ARRANGE THINGS, BUT YOU
JUST HAD TO PUT THINGS BACK.

114
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,291
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST
WAY TOO PETTY-MINDED.

115
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
OH, MR. ONISHI.

116
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,250
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE YOU
JOIN THE SPECTACLE

117
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,625
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

118
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,541
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE
YOUR WIFE JOIN AS WELL.

119
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,666
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

120
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,750
- WHO ME?  LET ME SEE.

121
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,958
A SPECTACLE.

122
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,333
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
A SPECTACLE

123
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,250
WITH THE ENTIRE CITY
INVOLVED.

124
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,541
- HELLO!  MANA!

125
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,375
- ( growls )
- ( gasps )

126
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,333
( grunts )

127
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
- FOUR OF THEM.

128
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,375
- HUH?
- ( coughing )

129
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,166
- WHAT IS THIS?

130
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,583
- ( gasps ) OW!

131
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,916
- LOOK, MY FRIEND.  I JUST
WANT YOU TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

132
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,208
PLEASE TELL ME
THE CURRENT STATUS

133
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,916
OF YOUR PEOPLE'S SPECTACLE.

134
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,583
I SAID PLEASE.

135
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
- ( telephone rings )

136
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,416
- Toyama: MR. ONISHI.

137
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,333
- TOYAMA.

138
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,708
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING.
HE WAS VISITING THE RACAN.

139
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,458
- THE RACAN?
- ARE YOU GOING?

140
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,375
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

141
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,583
- TELL ME.

142
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,750
DAMN YOU!  WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME SOMETHING?

143
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,250
- HMM?

144
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,875
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
SAKIMURA?

145
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,375
- YOSHII, LET'S STOP THIS.

146
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,666
YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP ANYMORE.

147
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,791
- OH.  NOW YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A COWARD.

148
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,125
NO QUITTING HALF WAY.

149
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,500
HI.  VERY SOON THE PEOPLE
UP ON THE HILL

150
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,250
WILL BE COMING DOWN.

151
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,250
- PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING NOW?

152
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,708
- I THINK THIS WILL BE
A VERY NICE ATTRACTION

153
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,208
FOR THE SPECTACLE.
- BUT WHY?

154
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,791
THIS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
AN ORDER.

155
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,416
- ORDER?  I DON'T CARE
ABOUT SUCH THINGS ANYMORE.

156
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,041
I WANT TO ENLIGHTEN
THE PEOPLE OF LUX

157
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,791
SO THEY CAN BELIEVE
IN THEIR OWN POWER.

158
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,791
NOW I'M BEGINNING TO SEE

159
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,791
THAT IS MY MISSION.

160
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,291
- YOSHII.

161
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,458
- SAKIMURA.

162
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,625
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'VE DONE
SINCE YOU CAME TO THIS CITY?

163
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,041
YOU'VE USED IT AS A SHIELD
