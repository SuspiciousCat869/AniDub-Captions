1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,208
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT, 

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,750
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,458
- ( theme music playing)

5
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,666
- Man: HOW LUX BECAME
THE CITY OF DOOM.

6
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,708
THE GIRL WAS FORCED
TO EXIST THERE

7
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,708
AS THE ONLY THING
THEY HAD TO PROTECT.

8
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,833
AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF
BLOOD WAS SHED IN LUX.

9
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,208
THE KING OF
THIS WORLD STOOD BY

10
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,583
WATCHING THE BATTLE.

11
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,250
THE KING OF THIS WORLD

12
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,916
TOOK AWAY THE SANITY
FROM THE WORLD'S PEOPLE.

13
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,333
- Ran: KILL ME.

14
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,750
I'M THE ONE WHO DROVE
THIS CITY INSANE.

15
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,750
- VOICE OF THE CITY...

16
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,708
IT WAS YOU.

17
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,708
- YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

18
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,666
I WANT YOU TO DO IT.

19
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,666
YOU, WHO HAS BEEN
LISTENING TO MY VOICE

20
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,333
ALL THESE YEARS.

21
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,333
YOU MUST KILL ME.

22
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,791
- IF THAT'S YOUR WISH.

23
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,750
- ( men chuckle )

24
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,791
- IF THE ONLY WAY TO BE
GRANTED LIFE IN THIS WORLD

25
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,083
IS TO SURRENDER MY BODY
AND SOUL TO INSANITY,

26
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,041
THEN I SHALL CHOOSE
TO MEET MY DOOM!

27
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,833
( shouts )

28
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,125
- ONISHI!

29
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,333
- Onishi: DIE!

30
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,083
- ( gasping )

31
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,833
( shouts )

32
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,750
- IT'S HIM.

33
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,125
- WHO?

34
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,291
- THE ONE WHO GOT
INTO THE ORGANO. 

35
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,291
LET'S TEAR HIM APART TOO.

36
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,500
- ( breathing heavily )

37
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,500
- Ichise: RAN.

38
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,458
SAY SOMETHING.

39
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,708
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DO IT AGAIN.

40
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,375
- ( gasps )

41
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,708
- ( grunts )

42
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,791
( shouts )

43
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,916
- ( grunting )

44
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,083
- ( stammers )

45
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,083
YOU RABID DOG!

46
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,916
- ( grunts )

47
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,208
Ichise: YOU ARE...

48
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,875
SUPPOSED TO BE MY ARM.

49
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
YOU ARE...

50
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,958
SUPPOSED TO BE MY LEG.

51
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,750
MOVE.

52
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,375
MOVE.

53
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,416
( gasps )

54
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,000
( gasps )

55
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,583
MY ARM.

56
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,250
MY LEG.

57
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,125
- ( men gasp )

58
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,083
- ( chuckles )
WHAT IS IT?

59
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,250
- ( gasps )

60
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,000
- ( grunts )

61
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,583
DOC.

62
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
( panting )

63
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,166
- Kohakura: OH, YOU.

64
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,166
YOU'RE ONE OF ONISHI'S.

65
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,541
HEY.

66
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,208
YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO MOVE.

67
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,750
- Ichise: IF YOU WANT
TO DIE, JUST TELL ME.

68
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,166
- DIE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

69
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,666
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,

70
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,000
THE REASON WE WERE REBORN
WAS TO HAVE THESE BODIES,

71
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,666
AND TO LIVE NEAR
ETERNAL LIVES.

72
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,875
I CAME TO UNDERSTAND
THAT TEXHNOLYZATION 

73
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,666
IS A MEANS OF REFORMING
THE HUMAN SPECIES,

74
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,541
WHICH HAS COME
TO A DEAD END.

75
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,666
IT WAS MEANT TO ENHANCE US.

76
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,541
WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE
TO LIVE A LIFE

77
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,000
THAT TAKES ROOT ON EARTH.

78
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,541
AND THUS MAINTAINS
OUR ABILITY TO THINK

79
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,708
FOR A LONG TIME.

80
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,708
IS ONISHI STILL ALIVE?

81
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,750
THERE'S ONE THING
I REGRET.

82
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,041
I REGRET NOT ADVISING HIM

83
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
MORE STRONGLY THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE OBEYED

84
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,250
THE WORDS OF MASTER KANO.

85
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,708
- ( beeps )

86
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,708
- THAT'S FINE.
TAKE IT.

87
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:41,083
SOMEONE TOLD ME LONG AGO
WHAT THIS PLACE IS.

88
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,416
WHAT HE SAID
MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

89
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,583
HE CALLED IT
THE NINTH ANNEX

90
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,875
OF THE REVIVING HELL.

91
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,750
- THE ONLY THING LEFT
IS FOR US TO WATCH, THEORIA.

92
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,083
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
REMAIN BEING MY DEAR SISTER?

93
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,083
- HEY.

94
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,291
I'VE CHANGED,
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

95
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,333
NOT BECAUSE
I GOT THIS ARM,

96
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,291
BECAUSE I MET YOU.

97
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,833
I'M STILL DOING...

98
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,458
THE SAME OLD THING.

99
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,375
BUT WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO DO NOW

100
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,958
IS WHAT I'VE BEEN
DOING ALL MY LIFE

101
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,333
JUST TO SURVIVE.

102
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,458
DOES THAT MEAN
WHATEVER I DO 

103
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,333
DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS
NO MATTER WHAT?

104
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,333
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
IS IT?

105
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,791
HAVE YOU CHANGED AT ALL

106
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,291
BECAUSE YOU MET ME?

107
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,208
- Kano: SO IT WAS YOU

108
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,666
WHOM THEORIA WAS WATCHING.

109
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,166
- TELL ME WHERE IS RAN?

110
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,541
- THEORIA WILL NEVER AGAIN

111
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,666
VOICE WHAT SHE SEES.

112
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,333
- Ichise:
WHY DID YOU DO ALL THIS?

113
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,875
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO THE SURFACE

114
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,708
WITH YOUR SOLDIERS IN TOW.

115
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,083
- IT WAS MEANINGLESS
FROM THE BEGINNING. 

116
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,208
I WAS WELL AWARE
THAT THE WORLD ABOVE

117
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,083
WAS ABOUT TO DIE OUT.

118
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,250
I WANTED TO SEE FOR CERTAIN

119
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,750
HOW MUCH TEXHNOLYZATION
COULD CHANGE

120
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,916
A HUMAN BEING'S
CONSCIOUSNESS. 

121
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,583
AND SO REVENGE

122
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,208
WAS THE IDEAL WAY TO MOTIVATE
THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLACE.

123
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,916
BESIDES,

124
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,166
WE WEREN'T FORCED
TO COME HERE.

125
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,583
THE HUMAN SPECIES

126
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,875
THAT'S ABOUT TO COME
TO THE END OF ITS LIFE

127
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,250
WAS BORN HERE.

128
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,583
AND IT HAS COME
FULL CIRCLE.

129
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,250
- TELL ME WHERE IS RAN.

130
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,541
- HAVING EXPANDED MY MIND
BY TEXHNOLYZATION,

131
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,250
I CAME TO UNDERSTAND

132
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:11,125
THAT LUX IS INSIDE MY MIND.

133
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,625
IT'S A DELUSION
THAT WE HAVE GENES

134
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,958
THAT NO HUMAN BEING
SHOULD HAVE.

135
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,166
I BECAME FREE
OF ALL GENES 

136
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,291
BY HAVING INTERCOURSE
WITH LUX.

137
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,958
WE MUST NOW ENDURE
A LONG PASSAGE OF TIME

138
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,958
IN ORDER TO BECOME
A DIFFERENT LIFE FORM.

139
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,291
THEY RECEIVED THEIR BODIES
IN PREPARATION FOR THAT.

140
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,000
I'M SANER THAN
ANYONE ELSE.

141
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,583
MY DEAR SISTER,
THEORIA,

142
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,166
KNOWS IT BETTER
THAN ANYONE.

143
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,666
BUT SADLY,
THEORIA WON'T SPEAK AGAIN.

144
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,000
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE KILLED HER OWN MIND.

145
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,666
- ( gasps )

146
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,666
- Kano: SHE CAN'T BE
MY EYES ANYMORE.

147
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,666
- ( breathing deep )

148
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,708
- WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU'RE AFRAID OF?

149
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,750
TO KILL ME,

150
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,666
WHO IS SANER THAN ANYONE,

151
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,666
IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
YOUR OWN INSANITY,

152
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,333
AND TO EMBRACE IT
UNTIL YOU DIE.
