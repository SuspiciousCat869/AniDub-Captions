1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,666
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,291
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,166
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,125
- TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS
DEPEND ON THE OBELISK

6
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,000
FOR THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE
OF POWER

7
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,750
AND FOR ALL INFORMATION
RELATED TO THEIR MOVEMENTS.

8
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,375
- ( beeping )

9
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,708
- THEREFORE, THEY BECOME
USELESS ABOVE GROUND,

10
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,708
WHERE THERE IS NO OBELISK.

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,250
WHERE IS THE ONE FOR THE LEG?

12
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,500
HOWEVER, WITH THESE ATTACHED,

13
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,166
THEY ONLY CAN FUNCTION
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

14
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,875
EVEN WHILE ABOVE GROUND.

15
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,875
SO?

16
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:46,125
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ABOUT
60% OF YOUR NORMAL POWER.

17
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,666
AND THANK YOU.

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,625
YOU'VE BEEN MOST HELPFUL.

19
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,750
THE TRUTH IS THAT
I'M THE ONE INSIDE HERE.

20
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,750
THE BIOCIRCUIT I DESIGNED

21
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
ACTUALLY CONTAINS MY CELLS.

22
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,666
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.

23
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,125
I'M VERY SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

24
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
BUT IF I HADN'T,

25
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:50,083
I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE
TREATED THIS ARM CARELESSLY.

26
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:54,000
AFTER ALL, I HAD TO MAKE SURE
YOU WOULD TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT.

27
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,458
AT LEAST THIS ARM.

- Man on radio:
SILENCE RECEDES.

33
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,708
I REPEAT,
SILENCE RECEDES.

34
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,666
I REPEAT, SILENCE RECEDES.

35
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,166
I REPEAT,
SILENCE RECEDES.

36
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,166
I REPEAT, SILENCE RECEDES.

37
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,500
I REPEAT,
SILENCE RECEDES.

38
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,291
I REPEAT, SILENCE RECEDES.

( continues )

40
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,166
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

41
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,041
- THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE.

42
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,208
- WILL WE BE ABLE TO WORK
SOMETHING OUT IF WE GO THERE?

43
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,500
- WELL...

44
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,541
( gasps )
- THEN YOU DON'T KNOW?

45
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,333
- I'M NOT TAKING THIS
 WHOLE THING LIGHTLY.

46
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,333
IT'S JUST THAT'S
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO.

47
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
HONESTLY.

48
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,375
- THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

49
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,625
- ( birds calling
from a distance )

- ( breathing heavily )

51
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,791
- DON'T EXERT YOURSELF TOO MUCH.

52
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,750
IF ANYTHING MALFUNCTIONS,

53
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,750
I'M NOT SURE I COULD
FIX IT HERE.

54
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,833
THAT GIRL WHO WAS STANDING
IN FRONT OF THE OBELISK...

55
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,833
THE SEER OF GABE--

56
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,333
SO WHAT IS SHE TO YOU?

57
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,791
SO WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

58
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,333
- TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

59
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,791
WHO KNOWS?

60
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,125
MAYBE THERE AREN'T
ANY HUMAN BEINGS

61
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,791
LEFT IN THIS PLACE ANYMORE.

62
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

63
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,541
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOON ENOUGH.

64
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,208
- ( breathing heavily )

65
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,541
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

66
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,541
AT LEAST I THINK.

67
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,541
- ( thunder rumbling )

68
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
- WHO'S THAT?

69
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,416
- HMM?

70
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,166
- Man's voice:
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, MR. SAKIMURA.

71
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,666
- UH, MR. SAGINUMA.

72
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,666
- Saginuma's voice:
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

73
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
- UH...

74
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:33,083
- YOU ONLY NEED TO ANSWER
TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY.

75
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,583
- WELL, WE'RE GOING TO
THE GOVERNMENT OFFICE BUILDING.

76
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,125
- IS THAT YOUR
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE?

77
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,541
- UH, YEAH.

78
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,541
- THEN I'LL COME WITH YOU.

79
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,625
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

80
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:57,041
IF THAT IS YOUR OBJECTIVE,
MR. SAKIMURA.

81
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,041
WELL, SHALL WE GET GOING?

82
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,833
- HUH?

83
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,666
- NOW DO YOU SEE?

84
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,416
THERE AREN'T
ANY PEOPLE HERE ANYMORE

85
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,000
WHO ARE FULLY HUMAN.

86
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,791
- Man on radio: ONLY ONE GLASS
OF WATER BRIGHTENS THE WORLD.

87
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,625
- ( feedback )

88
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,416
- Man on radio: ONLY ONE GLASS
OF WATER BRIGHTENS THE WORLD.

89
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,125
ONLY ONE GLASS OF WATER
BRIGHTENS THE WORLD.

90
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,333
ONLY ONE GLASS OF WATER
BRIGHTENS THE WORLD.

91
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,208
( continues )

92
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,083
- Saginuma's voice: HOW MUCH
DEMAND FOR TEXHNOLYZATION

93
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,541
IS THERE IN LUX?

94
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,500
- SORRY.

95
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,333
I'LL ANSWER ALL
YOUR ROUTINE QUESTIONS LATER.

96
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,333
WE RISKED OUR LIVES
TO GET UP HERE.

97
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,666
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO TELL YOU. 

98
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,000
IF YOU WOULD PLEASE
LET ME SPEAK.

99
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,000
- ROUTINE REMAINS ROUTINE

100
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,833
ONLY BECAUSE IT IS
CARRIED OUT AS ROUTINE.

101
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,583
THERE IS NO EXCEPTION
TO THE RULE.

102
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,166
- THIS IS OF THE UTMOST URGENCY!

103
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,916
- HOW MUCH DEMAND FOR
TEXHNOLYZATION IS THERE IN LUX?

104
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,583
ALSO, OF THE ENTIRE NUMBER
OF OPERATIONS PERFORMED IN LUX,

105
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,916
WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF
OPERATIONS DONE BY YOU? 

106
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,583
- ( deeply sighs )

107
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,125
- MR. SAKIMURA.

108
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,791
I'VE BEEN KEPT ON STANDBY
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. 

109
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,625
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO.

110
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,375
AS YOU CAN SEE,

111
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,041
WE'VE KEPT YOUR DESK
EXACTLY AS YOU LEFT IT.

112
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,125
- BUT I JUST CAME BACK
FROM LUX TODAY.

113
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,583
- OH, I SEE.

114
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,583
- DO YOU REMEMBER YOSHII?

115
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,416
- OH, YES, YOSHII.
HOW IS HE DOING THESE DAYS?

116
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,083
- HE'S...

117
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,041
ACTUALLY, I KILLED HIM.

118
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,791
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

119
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,833
I WAS THE ONE
WHO ACTUALLY MURDERED HIM.

120
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,416
( voice breaking )
I MURDERED HIM.

121
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,375
( sobbing )

122
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,333
- I'M SURE YOU DID
 A FINE JOB OF IT.

123
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,041
- ( sobbing )

124
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,000
- Saginuma's voice:
COULD YOU TELL ME IF YOU HAVE

125
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,625
EVER KILLED ANYONE?

126
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,500
IF YOU HAVE KILLED ANYONE,

127
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,541
THEN HOW MANY?

128
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,708
- THEY'RE PLANNING TO ATTACK
THE SURFACE WORLD.

129
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:01,208
IF THEY DO, YOU WON'T REMAIN
UNAFFECTED ANYMORE.

130
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,708
- Saginuma's voice:
NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO,

131
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,625
IT WILL BE MEANINGLESS.

132
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,291
ALONG THE SAME LINE,
IT IS EQUALLY MEANINGLESS

133
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,458
FOR US TO DO ANYTHING TO THEM.

134
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,250
FOR ONE THING,

135
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,875
TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS
SHOULD BECOME

136
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,458
EITHER COMPLETELY
OR PARTIALLY INCAPACITATED.

137
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,625
BECAUSE THERE IS NO OBELISK
ABOVE GROUND,

138
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,125
WHICH ACTS AS
THEIR CONTROL SYSTEM.

139
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,541
JUST AS HE SHOULD BE.

140
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,583
- AREN'T YOU CONCERNED ABOUT
THE SUPPLY OF RAFFIA?

141
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,958
IT STOPPED.

142
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,125
- RAFFIA.

143
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,125
YES, I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD THINK THAT.

144
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,458
BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY
THE REALITY IS

145
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,291
THAT WE NO LONGER
HAVE NEED OF IT. 

146
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,208
OUR IMPORTING IT FROM LUX

147
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,666
HAS SIMPLY BECOME NOTHING MORE
THAN A FORMALITY NOW.

148
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,416
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

149
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,250
- WE, THE SELECT FEW,

150
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,250
WHO ONLY CARRY 
DOMINANT GENES,

151
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,750
WILL NEVER SUFFER
FROM BODILY DAMAGE.

152
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,166
EVEN IF WE DID, WE WOULDN'T TRY
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

153
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,083
THE REALITY IS THAT RAFFIA
IS QUITE USELESS TO US.

154
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,541
WHAT GOOD IS IT TO
COMPENSATE FOR LOST LIMBS

155
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,041
BY REPLACING THEM
WITH ARTIFICIAL ONES?

156
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,041
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GRAB
WITH SUCH AN ARM?

157
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,375
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
STAND FIRMLY ON WITH SUCH A LEG?

158
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

159
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,166
RAFFIA AND THE IDEA
OF TEXHNOLYZATION

160
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,958
ARE COMPLETELY ALIEN TO US.

161
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,958
MANKIND HAS GROWN OLD.

162
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,250
THE ONLY THING LEFT NOW IS
SLOW DEATH.

163
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,541
- Doc: MAYBE IT'S HARD
FOR ALL OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

164
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,625
SINCE YOU'RE JUST SITTING
AND WAITING FOR YOUR DEATHS,

165
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,291
BUT TEXHNOLYZATION
INFINITELY EXPANDS--

166
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,875
( sighs )

167
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,250
- Man on radio: A MIRROR
IMPROVES THE ABILITY TO THINK.

168
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,916
I REPEAT AGAIN,

169
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,750
A MIRROR IMPROVES
THE ABILITY TO THINK.

170
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,750
A MIRROR IMPROVES
THE ABILITY TO THINK.

171
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,166
I REPEAT AGAIN,

172
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,166
A MIRROR IMPROVES
THE ABILITY TO THINK.

173
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,750
( continues )

174
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,708
- ( exhales )

175
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,708
- DO YOU WANNA REST?

176
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,541
THAT MAN OVER THERE...
- HUH?

177
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,666
WHAT IS IT?

178
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,833
- I DON'T KNOW,

179
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,458
BUT HE SOMEHOW
LOOKS FAMILIAR TO ME.

180
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,666
- ( slow melody playing )

181
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,541
- ( projector clatters, whirrs )

182
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,291
- ( theme music playing )

183
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,583
- ( singing in Japanese )
