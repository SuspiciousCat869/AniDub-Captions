1
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,583
- Man: IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT, ANYTHING AT ALL...

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,250
COME TO ME.
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,250
- ( theme music playing )

4
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,583
- ( people clamoring )

5
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,625
- ( rock music
playing distantly )

6
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,083
- ( people laughing,
chattering )

7
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,916
- SHINJI!

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
HEY, LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK
AT THE CRYING FACES

9
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,375
OF ALL THOSE FANATICS.

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,333
SHINJI!  COME ON!

11
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,083
- HEY, KID,
KEEP YOUR SORRY ASS

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,750
OUT OF THE GROWN-UPS' FIGHT.

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,125
HERE.
- ( coughs, laughs )

14
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,875
YEAH, THIS IS GREAT!

15
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,333
- HMM.

16
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,916
- ( glass shatters )

17
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,166
- YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

18
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,125
- YES, I'M AFRAID SO.

19
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,583
- WANNA HAVE A DRINK?

20
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,083
- SORRY, I'VE HAD MY FILL.

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,250
BUT I MUST SAY,
THAT WAS QUITE A SHOW

22
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,000
YOU PUT ON FOR THEM.

23
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,041
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT IT WAS US?

24
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,041
- I HEARD A LITTLE RUMOR
THAT IT WAS.

25
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,916
AM I WRONG?

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,541
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS JUST
MY MISUNDERSTANDING.

27
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,875
- IT WAS THE ORGANOS
WHO DID THAT.

28
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,708
- OH?
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED.

29
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,916
- BY THE WAY...

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,166
- ( lighter clicks )

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,833
- ...WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR MISUNDERSTANDING.

32
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,750
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO NOW?

33
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,166
- WELL, I GUESS WHEREVER
I WANT TO.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,916
- ( glass shatters )

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,291
- ( squeaking )

36
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,833
- SO WHERE ARE YOU TWO GOING?

37
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,500
YOU WANNA GO CHECK OUT
THE FIRE?

38
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,583
- I SAW IT.

39
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,875
- WHA--?

40
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,708
- Organo Member: WHAT DO YOU
MEAN WE SHOULDN'T RETALIATE

41
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,000
EVEN AT THIS POINT?

42
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,833
YOUR METHOD OF DEALING
WITH SITUATIONS

43
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,541
IS TOO OBTUSE FOR MY TASTE.

44
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
- HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ANY ONE OF US

45
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,500
TO ACCEPT THIS UNREASONABLE
ASSERTION YOU'RE PUSHING ON US?

46
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,541
- PARDON THE INTERRUPTION.

47
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,875
IZAKI AND THE OTHERS
HAVE RETURNED.

48
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,875
- I'LL BE THERE SHORTLY.
- YES, SIR.

49
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,166
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

50
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,833
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GIVE THEM ALL MEDALS.

51
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,875
- ( men laugh )

52
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,000
- Kimata: THE SALVATION OF
MIND, BODY AND TRUTH!

53
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,833
IS THERE ANYTHING PREPOSTEROUS

54
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,833
ABOUT WHAT, WE,
THE SALVATION UNION STAND FOR?!

55
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,125
- All: NO, SIR!

56
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,000
- OUR FORTRESS HAS BEEN
BURNT TO THE GROUND

57
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,833
AS A RESULT
OF AN IMMORAL PLOT,

58
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,500
CARRIED OUT BY MEN
WHO THRIVE ON ATROCITIES.

59
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,458
THEREFORE, WHAT MUST
WE DO NOW, MY BROTHERS?

60
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
- All: RETALIATE!

61
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,125
- CORRECT!
WE MUST RETALIATE AGAINST THEM.

62
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,000
THOSE WHO DO NOT FEEL SHAME
TO STAND OVER OTHERS,

63
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,500
THOSE WHO DO NOT FEEL SHAME

64
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,375
TO LIVE ONLY FOR THEIR
OWN HAPPINESS--

65
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,375
THESE ARE THE MEMBERS
OF THE ORGANO.

66
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,208
THE TRUE CAUSE OF
DETERIORATION WITHIN LUX.

67
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,833
THE DEALERS OF CORRUPTION,
THE BRINGERS OF CHAOS--

68
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,458
THEY ARE THE TRUE CAUSE
OF EVERY CALAMITY.

69
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,000
- All: YES, SIR!

70
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,500
- YOU, THE BROTHERHOOD
OF THE SALVATION UNION

71
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,166
WHO GATHER HERE IN THE NAME
OF OUR IDEALS,

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,166
I DARE ASK YOU NOW:

73
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,500
ARE WE BEINGS WHO REFUSE
TO FIGHT

74
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,500
FOR THE THINGS WE WANT
AND SEEK?!

75
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,791
- All: NO, SIR!

76
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,791
- THEN YOU SHALL SAY IT WITH ME.

77
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,500
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

78
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,500
- All: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

79
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,000
- SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

80
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,333
- All: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

81
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,833
- SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

82
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,333
- All: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

83
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,666
- SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

84
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166
- All: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

85
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,875
- HI.  IS THAT YOUR FRIEND?

86
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,416
LEARNING TO WALK?

87
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,416
VERY NICE.

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,416
HMM.

89
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,375
- ( gasps )

90
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,250
- PLEASE TELL ME WHAT
I POSSIBLY DID TO OFFEND YOU.

91
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,708
WHAT A WASTE.

92
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,208
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR ANGER.
- ( grunts )

93
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,958
- YOU COULD THINK ABOUT
HOW YOU WANNA USE IT.

94
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,375
- ( grunts )

95
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,208
- THERE ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
WAYS OF USING IT THAN THAT.

96
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,875
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

97
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,708
WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE
NO WORRIES FROM ME.

98
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,958
- ICHISE.

99
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
- ICHISE.

100
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,791
I'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

101
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,916
- ( men chuckling )

102
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,791
- All: HUH?

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,916
- ( beeping, trilling )

104
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,833
- ( ticking )

105
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,500
( ringing )

106
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,750
- GOOD MORNING.

107
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,166
- WHAT THE HELL?

108
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,833
- WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

109
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,750
- ( gasping, whimpering )

110
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,708
( grunts )

111
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,333
- SHINJI.

112
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
- YOKO.

113
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,375
- HAL.

114
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,500
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
HAL?

115
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,375
HAL.

116
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,041
- DAMMIT.

117
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,291
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

118
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,708
TELL ME.

119
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,666
WHY DID THIS ALL HAPPEN?

120
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,458
AH, DAMMIT!

121
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,958
( panting )
DAMMIT.

122
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,208
- I GUESS IT MEANS
WE'RE INVITED TO TAKE PART

123
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,041
IN THE GROWN-UPS' FIGHT.

124
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,458
- ( chuckles )

125
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,416
- SHINJI.

126
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,166
- Union Members:
ONE, TWO, THREE!

127
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,625
( grunts )

128
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,833
- WE'RE OKAY
ANYTIME YOU WANNA GO.

129
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,000
- AND THE BIKES?

130
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,166
- GO WHEN THE OTHERS ARE ON IT.

131
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,458
- ( motorcycle running )

132
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,416
- RIGHT ON TIME.

133
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,750
- ( grunts )

134
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,708
- ( tires screeching )

135
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,333
- I SEE YOU STILL HAVEN'T
DEVELOPED A TASTE

136
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,791
FOR HAVING YOUR HENCHMEN
LOOK AFTER YOU.

137
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
- Organo Member:
ONISHI HASN'T RETURNED YET?

138
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,708
- I SENT ENDO TO GET HIM.

139
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,041
HE SHOULD BE BACK SOON ENOUGH.

140
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,666
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S DOING NOW?

141
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,208
- HE'S PROBABLY MAKING THEM
STAND IN THE HALLWAY

142
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,875
AND LECTURING THEM,
I GUESS.

143
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,708
- THE PROBLEM IS THAT
HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH GUTS

144
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,625
TO START A SPECTACLE.

145
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,125
- HE'S USING THE WILL
OF THE CITY AS AN EXCUSE,

146
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,541
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS
HE'S JUST A COWARD.

147
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,041
- ( men chuckling )

148
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,500
- Kohakura:
I SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM.

149
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,500
- HUH?

150
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,416
- HE'S GONNA CLEAN UP
THE MESS THOSE IDIOTS MADE

151
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,000
ALL BY HIMSELF.

152
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,833
AND HE'LL DO IT WITHOUT
EVEN A WORD OF COMPLAINT.

153
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,458
- KOHAKURA.

154
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,541
- Michiko: PARDON ME.

155
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,083
- THIS MEETING IS POINTLESS.

156
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,375
- WHY'S THAT?
- THIS IS NO LONGER A MATTER

157
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,083
THAT CAN BE SETTLED
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

158
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,083
IT IS A MATTER BETWEEN
THE UNION AND THE ORGANO NOW.

159
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,625
- ( motorcycles approaching )
- HUH?

160
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,750
- WELL, YOU'RE ALL HERE.

161
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,875
THAT MAKES THINGS
VERY CONVENIENT FOR US.

162
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,708
- WHAT DO YOU BRATS
WANT WITH US?
