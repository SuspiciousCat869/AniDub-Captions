1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,708
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,375
- Man: I CAN'T FORGET
ABOUT THAT TIME.

6
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,041
THE CITY FOLKS' EYES
CHANGED COLORS.

7
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,250
NO, IT'S NOT A FIGURE
OF SPEECH, NOT AT ALL.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,916
THEIR EYES DID CHANGE COLORS.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,250
AND THAT'S A FACT.

10
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,250
THIS PLACE WAS SHUT DOWN

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,541
FOR A FULL FIVE DAYS.

12
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,250
EH?  SIX DAYS?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID?

13
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,250
DID I NOW?  OH, WELL.

14
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,041
THE FOLKS UP IN THE MOUNTAIN
WERE RELATIVELY CALM,

15
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,375
BUT THE CITY WENT
INTO THIS MAD TURMOIL.

16
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,291
IT WAS BEYOND BELIEF.

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,333
SO THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW

18
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,666
THAT NO MATTER HOW UNNATURAL

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,666
AND UNREASONABLE
IT MAY SEEM TO YOU,

20
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,416
THE WORK WE DO HERE

21
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,041
IS IMPORTANT TO THOSE
WHO LIVE IN LUX.

22
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,083
YOU UNDERSTAND.

23
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,583
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

24
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,875
THE COLORS OF THEIR EYES

25
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,583
WERE DIFFERENT,
BUT YOU KNOW,

26
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,583
THE COLOR OF THE CITY
FOLKS' EYES,

27
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,958
WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME

28
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,333
THEY HAD CHANGED.

29
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,833
- ( laughs )

30
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,500
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

31
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,333
- ( door opens and closes )

32
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,375
- ( continues laughing )

33
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,875
YES.  I UNDERSTAND.

34
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,458
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

35
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,791
MY HUSBAND IS UP NOW,
SO... YES.

36
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,291
YES, GOOD DAY.

37
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,083
- SO WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING TO?

38
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,500
- THE CITY.
- HMM?

39
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,333
- I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH THE CITY.

40
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,541
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR
THAT ONLY YOU CAN.

41
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,375
- THAT ONLY I CAN?

42
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,750
- THE CITY TALKS TO YOU,
DOESN'T IT?

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,375
YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL,
AREN'T YOU?

44
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
THAT'S WHY IT ISN'T FAIR.

45
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,041
- YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

46
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,958
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT.

47
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,583
BUT IT'S NOT AS IF IT TALKS
TO ME IN WORDS.

48
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,875
I THINK I TOLD YOU THAT AS WELL.
- ( beeps )

49
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,250
- BUT I KNOW THAT THE CITY
IS TALKING TO ME, TOO.

50
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,666
- ( telephone ringing )

51
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,791
- ( camera shutter clicking )

52
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,791
- Yoshii: AFTER ALL,
WE ALL BREATHE THE SAME AIR.

53
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,291
COME ON OVER HERE,
EVERYBODY.

54
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,833
WISHES DO GET HEARD, I GUESS.

55
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,833
UH-OH.

56
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,041
HUH?

57
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,541
- NO ONE CAN SAY THAT.
I'M NOT JUST A--

58
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,708
- ( engine revving )

59
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,166
- I WON'T LET THEM.

60
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,458
- ( telephone ringing )

61
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,916
- MICHIKO, ANY REPORTS
ON THE PACKAGE

62
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,458
FOR WHICH WE INITIATED
THE SEARCH?

63
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,333
- NO, NOT AS OF YET, SIR.

64
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,208
- WHICH ONES FROM TSUJINAKA'S
OFFICE ARE ON THE JOB NOW?

65
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,833
- TAKABE, MASHIMO AND ISHII,
I BELIEVE.

66
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,833
- ISHII.
BRING HIM TO ME

67
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,833
- ( shouting )

68
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,833
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO REPORT?

69
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,666
- YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD IT
IF THERE WAS.

70
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,208
THERE'S NOTHING.
I MEAN IT.

71
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,291
I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE DOING
ALL THIS

72
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,750
FOR THAT LITTLE SCUM.

73
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,125
- DO YOU KNOW WHETHER
HE'S SCUM OR NOT?

74
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,833
- HUH?

75
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,500
- IF HE REALLY IS SCUM,
THEN YOU ARE THE ONE

76
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,708
WHO MADE HIM LIKE THAT.

77
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,708
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

78
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,750
GIVE MY REGARDS
TO MR. TSUJINAKA.

79
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,208
- ( panting )

80
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,583
- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE MY LEG.

81
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,583
- YOU ARE?

82
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,458
- MY NAME IS YOSHII.
HOW DO YOU DO?

83
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,208
THAT FOOT OF YOURS LOOKS
LIKE IT'S IN PAIN.

84
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,000
( laughs ) I FORGOT.
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR, NOT ME.

85
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,625
- NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.
ARE YOU WITH THE ORGANO?

86
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,250
ONISHI'S THE ONLY ONE
I MAKE CONTACT WITH.

87
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,250
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD
ABOUT YOU.

88
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,250
- SO WHO ARE YOU?

89
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,416
- IN THE BEGINNING,

90
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,958
YOU WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE GATES.

91
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,666
I REALLY DO LIKE YOU.

92
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,708
- TELL ME.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

93
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,041
- IT CHEATS
THE IMMUNOLOGICAL RESISTANCE

94
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,750
IN NORMAL TRANSPLANTATION
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS,

95
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,500
AS IF ASSIMILATION WAS MEANT
TO HAPPEN FROM THE BEGINNING.

96
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,000
ALL THANKS TO RAFFIA,

97
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,583
A KIND OF MOSS THAT CAN ONLY
BE COLLECTED IN THE CENTER

98
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,958
OF THIS CITY.
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

99
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,958
- RAFFIA.
THAT'S WHAT GAVE THIS CITY

100
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,000
IT'S RAISON D'ETRE.

101
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,625
THANKS TO IT, WE--
THE HUMAN SPECIES--

102
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,250
THAT MAY HAVE OTHERWISE
GONE EXTINCT LONG AGO,

103
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,583
CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST.

104
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,958
IT MAY BE A VERY
UNNATURAL MEANS.

105
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,458
NONETHELESS,
IT WAS DISCOVERED HERE.

106
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,083
I WONDER IF IT WAS GIVEN
TO US BY GOD

107
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
TO LET US KNOW THAT WE HUMANS
WERE ALLOWED

108
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,916
TO CONTINUE EXISTING, DOC.

109
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,458
- ACTUALLY, MY FOOT DOES HURT.

110
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,166
- HOW'D IT GO?

111
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,125
- WHO THE HELL DOES ONISHI
THINK HE REALLY IS?

112
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,500
- YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
FROM OUTSIDE THE GATES

113
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,583
WITH A NOBLE CAUSE OF GIVING
GOD'S BLESSING

114
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
TO NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE ABOVE GROUND,

115
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,625
BUT ALSO THOSE WHO LIVE
IN THE CITY,

116
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,666
OR PERHAPS YOU DID.

117
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,583
- THE CLASS IS STILL
IN A FASHION THE RULING PARTY

118
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,541
OF THIS WORLD.

119
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,791
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT.

120
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,333
BUT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
THAT CAN GO THROUGH THE GATES,

121
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,625
AREN'T YOU?

122
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,583
- I KIND OF LIKE
BEING HERE.

123
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,416
IT MAY BE THE FIRST TIME
I SEE HUMANS

124
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,166
BEHAVING SO HUMAN.

125
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,666
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

126
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,916
EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE.

127
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,041
- A GODDESS WITH THE POWER
TO MECHANIZE HUMANS.

128
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,625
I SEE.

129
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,291
- BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
REMAINING ROAD LEFT

130
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,458
TO EVOLUTION.

131
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,125
RAFFIA WASN'T DISCOVERED JUST

132
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,000
TO TRANSPLANT ONE HUMAN'S
ORGANS TO ANOTHER.

133
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,666
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

134
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,416
- Man:
WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?

135
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,916
WHICH ONE?  HUH!

136
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,625
( screaming )

137
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,375
- ( laughing )

138
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,666
HUH?

139
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,458
YOU, GET OUT OF MY WAY!

140
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,916
( screams )

141
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,625
- ( telephone ringing )

142
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,750
- LOOK, SON, IF YOU GOT
NOTHING ELSE TO DO,

143
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,750
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
IN THIS MARKET?

144
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,333
THOSE RACAN PUNKS ARE
REALLY GETTING

145
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,750
"STICKY FINGER" THESE DAYS.

146
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,250
HONESTLY,
I'M PAYING FOR PROTECTION,

147
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,541
BUT THEM GUYS
IN THEIR FANCY SUITS

148
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,583
DON'T EVER DO A THING FOR ME.

149
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,250
- WE'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD
FROM THE AZAKI OFFICE

150
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,625
THAT A MAN BELIEVED TO BE
OUR PACKAGE IS IN THE MARKET.

151
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,625
- REMIND THEM ONCE AGAIN
NOT TO KILL HIM.

152
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,333
- ( screams )

153
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,375
- TEN YEARS AGO ONISHI
WAS JUST A PUNK.

154
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,875
( grunts )
- WAIT. STOP THE CAR!

155
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,333
- ( tires screech )
- ( panting )

156
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,458
- ISHII,
YOU BETTER NOT DO IT NOW.

157
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,541
IF YOU KILL HIM, YOU'RE GONNA
BE PUTTING ALL OF US

158
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,250
IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION.

159
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,000
- THIS GUY MAKES ME SICK.

160
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,500
