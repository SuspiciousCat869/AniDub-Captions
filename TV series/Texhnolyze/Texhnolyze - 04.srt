1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,791
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,375
- Doc: THE CURRENT
TEXHNOLYZE UNITS ARE NOW

6
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,500
IN THEIR FOURTH GENERATION.

7
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,750
COMPARED TO THE EARLIER MODELS,
THEIR STRENGTH

8
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,458
AND RESPONSIVENESS
HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY IMPROVED.

9
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,750
BEFORE I CAME HERE,
THE PRIORITY WAS PLACED MAINLY

10
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,666
ON HOW TO COVER UP
THE ARTIFICIAL FEELING

11
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,875
AND HOW TO REDUCE
THE SENSE OF DISCOMFORT.

12
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,666
BUT I CONSIDERED IT MEANINGLESS

13
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,333
TO GIVE THE TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS
THE SAME SPECIFIC GRAVITY,

14
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,416
STRENGTH AND MUSCULATURE
AS NORMAL LIMBS

15
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,375
WHEN THEY CAN NEVER BE
EXACTLY THE SAME AS HUMAN LIMBS.

16
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,000
SO I'VE BEEN DRAMATICALLY
IMPROVING

17
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,375
THE UNITS' CAPABILITIES.

18
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,833
- ( gasping )

19
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,250
- YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?
- HUH?

20
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,750
- Yoshii: THE TRUE RULER OF LUX
IS AN ORGANIZATION KNOWN

21
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,750
AS THE ORGANO.
THE CITY WAS ORIGINALLY UNDER

22
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,750
THE AUTONOMOUS CONTROL
OF THE CHIEF OF GABE,

23
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,250
WHICH WAS ALSO CALLED
THE CHIEF OF THE MOUNTAIN,

24
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,750
BUT THE ORGANO TOOK OVER USING
ITS VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION

25
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,458
AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONAL
STRENGTH.

26
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,833
- IS IT TIME?

27
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,000
GET THE CAR.
- ALL RIGHT.

28
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,500
- Man: THE CITY DOES NOT WISH
FOR A SPECTACLE NOW.

29
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,541
- Doc: THE CORE TECHNOLOGY
OF A TEXHNOLYZED LIMB

30
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,291
CAN BE DIVIDED
INTO SEVERAL PHASES.

31
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,583
THE MOLECULAR ENGINEERING PHASE,

32
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,500
THE MECHANICAL
ENGINEERING PHASE,

33
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,750
AND THE BIOPHASE
THAT LINKS THE TECHNOLOGY

34
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,458
TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

35
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,958
IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS MACHINE,

36
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,583
WHICH IS NOTHING LESS
THAN A MASTERPIECE,

37
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,375
OPERATE PROPERLY,
A TEXHNOLYZED UNIT JOINS

38
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,791
WITH A HUMAN BODY USING
A NANOCARBON INTERMEDIARY.

39
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,291
A TEXHNOLYZE UNIT
TARGETS THE CORNEA

40
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,041
AND CONVEYS NEUROINFORMATION
RECIPROCALLY

41
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,041
WITH THE MOTOR AREA.

42
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,583
A TEXHNOLYZED HUMAN SEES
THE INFORMATION

43
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,583
TRANSMITTED DIRECTLY
INTO THE EYE

44
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
BY THE TEXHNOLYZE UNIT.

45
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,750
IT MAY BE ANNOYING,
BUT IT'S NECESSARY

46
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,333
FOR A TEXHNOLYZE TO MONITOR
WHETHER HIS UNIT

47
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,833
IS OPERATING PROPERLY OR NOT.

48
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,125
SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
BEAR WITH IT.

49
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,333
AND THERE IS ONE MORE PHASE
TO TEXHNOLYZATION.

50
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,666
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.

51
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,833
IT'S KNOWN AS
THE BLACK MAGIC PHASE.

52
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,750
THAT WAS YOUR FATHER'S WORK
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

53
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,708
YES, RAFFIA.

54
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,333
MAN HAS BEEN REPEATING

55
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,750
THE PROCESS OF TRIAL AND ERROR
FOR AGES

56
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,791
IN ORDER TO FIND THE MEANS
TO COMPENSATE FOR LOST LIMBS.

57
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,833
REGENERATION OF BODY PARTS
THROUGH TISSUE ENGINEERING

58
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,541
IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US NOW.

59
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,833
TRANSPLANTATION OF OTHER
INDIVIDUAL'S BODY PARTS

60
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,625
OFTEN PROVOKES SHARP REJECTION
BY OUR BODIES.

61
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,208
THE ONE THING THAT ELIMINATES
THAT REJECTION

62
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,666
IS THAT WHICH CAN
ONLY BE COLLECTED

63
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,875
FROM DEEP WITHIN
THE GROUND OF LUX.

64
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,041
RAFFIA.

65
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,750
I'M SORRY.
DO I TALK TOO MUCH?

66
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,416
BUT IT CAN'T BE HELPED,

67
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,208
SINCE INFORMED CONSENT
IS AN OBLIGATION.

68
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,416
I NEED COOPERATION

69
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,958
FROM MY TEST SUBJECTS.

70
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,916
IT'LL BE VERY NICE
IF YOU CONSENT.

71
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,291
- WHY?

72
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,208
WHY ARE YOU DOING
ALL THIS FOR ME?

73
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,041
- I WAS TOLD IT WAS AROUND HERE.

74
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,291
HELLO THERE,

75
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,791
MR. ONISHI.

76
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,500
- ( machines beeping )

77
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,541
- THE ANESTHETIC WON'T MAKE YOU
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

78
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,208
NOW WATCH CAREFULLY
WHAT'S BEING DONE TO YOU.

79
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,750
- Man: ARE WE MERELY BEINGS
BORN INTO A FATE

80
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,416
ONLY TO SERVE THE WISHES

81
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,250
OF THOSE WHO STAND ABOVE US?
- NO, SIR.

82
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,833
- ARE WE MERELY BEINGS
WHO SELFISHLY PURSUE

83
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,291
OUR OWN DREAMS OF HAPPINESS?
- NO, SIR.

84
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,291
- WHAT DO WE THE SALVATION UNION
WANT AND SEEK?

85
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,250
- ( speaking Japanese )

86
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,083
- HMM?

87
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,958
- I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU
DIDN'T BRING YOUR ENTOURAGE.

88
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,958
- I CAME HERE TO TALK.  THERE'S
NO NEED FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

89
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,708
- SO I SEE.  AN ATTITUDE
WORTHY OF THE MAN

90
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,875
WHO BECAME
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

91
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,875
OF THE ORGANO
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE.

92
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,625
- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMPLIMENT.
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE

93
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,833
TO HAVE OUR CONVERSATION
SOMEWHERE QUIET.

94
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,333
- ALL OF MY MEN
ARE BLOOD BROTHERS.

95
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,916
THOSE OF THE SALVATION UNION
ARE OF ONE HEART

96
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,375
AND ONE SOUL.
- WELL, AND ARE YOU

97
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,208
OF ONE HEART AND ONE SOUL
WITH THOSE BLIND IDIOTS

98
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,958
WHO SEND OUT THEIR
PATHETIC UNDERLINGS

99
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,375
TO TRY AND ASSASSINATE ME?
- HMM.

100
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,541
- ( whispers inaudibly )

101
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,916
- WE DO HAVE A ROOM
TO RECEIVE OUR GUEST.

102
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,375
- ( machines beeping )

103
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,291
- AS I HAD IMAGINED,

104
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,833
LUX IS A VERY INTERESTING WORLD.

105
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,833
PEOPLE'S BODIES' SELF-REPAIR
CAPABILITY

106
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,333
HAS DEGRADED HERE AS WELL,

107
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,500
BUT MAYBE FOR THIS REASON--

108
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,583
ALL THE VIOLENCE THAT TAKES
PLACE HERE,

109
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,916
THE MEANS USED BY THE STRONG
TO PREY ON THE WEAK,

110
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,333
IS TO DESTROY THE OTHER'S
BODY PARTS.

111
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,833
LUX IS RULED BY POWER.

112
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,333
HOWEVER, A GROUP OF RESIDENTS
KNOWN AS THE CLASS

113
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,000
HAVE SHUT THEMSELVES UP
IN THEIR OWN PRIVATE WORLD.

114
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,375
THEY ARE ALL BUT NON-EXISTENT.

115
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,041
ONLY THOSE WHO ASSERT THE FACT
THAT THEY ARE ALIVE

116
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
ARE UNDER THE RULE
OF THE ORGANO.

117
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,750
- ( beeping continuing )

118
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,583
- ( loud buzzing )

119
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,666
- ( panting )

120
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,875
( coughs )

121
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,041
- ( continues panting )

122
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,083
- ( laughing )

123
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,333
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE IT BACK?

124
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,208
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT UP ALREADY, OLD MAN?

125
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,583
- GIVE IT BACK.
YOU CAN TAKE THE GUN WITH YOU.

126
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,958
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

127
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,875
YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE US THE GUN?

128
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,666
- WHO THE HELL DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE?

129
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,666
- I'M JUST A TOURIST.

130
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,333
- AND IS THIS BAG
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

131
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,083
- COME ON, GUYS.  YOU BETTER
JUST GIVE ME BACK MY BAG.

132
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,583
- SHUT UP, MAN.  WHERE DID YOU
GET A GUN LIKE THIS?

133
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,666
IS THERE A LOT MORE
WHERE IT CAME FROM?

134
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,250
- DON'T KNOW.

135
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,208
- YOU ASSHOLE!

136
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,458
HOW ABOUT I STOP YOUR DUMB ASS
FROM EVER FOLLOWING US AGAIN?

137
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,458
- HUH?

138
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,375
- YOU BASTARD!  HUH?
( grunts )

139
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,458
- HE'S TEXHNOLYZED?

140
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,458
- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
KIND OF NICE.

141
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,083
- BASTARD! ( grunting )

142
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,625
- STOP IT, YOU ASSHOLE!

143
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,833
- Man:
MAY I ASK YOU TO LET THEM GO?

144
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,291
- SHINJI.
- KILL THIS GUY FOR US, SHINJI.

145
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,291
- SHUT UP.  STAY DOWN.

146
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:32,083
- I ASSUME YOU'RE THE LEADER
OF THE RACAN.

147
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,416
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR THEIR MISBEHAVIOR.

148
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,791
THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE
OF IDIOTS.

149
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,291
- OKAY, AS LONG AS MY BAG
IS RETURNED.

150
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,791
- YOU.

151
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,416
- Doc: HANG IN THERE.

152
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,208
THE TEXHNOLYZE UNIT
IS NEGOTIATING

153
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,916
WITH YOUR
MOTOR CONTROL AREA.

154
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,916
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE
NORMALLY BEFORE LONG.

155
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,666
RIGHT.  NO, THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO NEED

156
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,916
FOR YOU TO BE CONCERNED.

157
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,041
I WON'T EVEN CONSIDER
APPLYING THE PROCESS

158
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,750
INTRODUCED ON THIS SUBJECT
TO YOUR UNIT.

159
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,291
IF YOU ASK,
I'LL WATCH OUT FOR IT.

160
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,041
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DAMAGE
TO YOUR LEG NOW?

161
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,416
ALL RIGHT, THEN LET'S SEE HOW
IT WORKS AS IT IS FOR A WHILE.

- WELL, TO BE FRANK,
THAT'S OF NO CONCERN TO ME.

168
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,458
ARE YOU ASKING THAT
AS A PERSONAL FAVOR?

169
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,166
OR IS IT AN ORDER
AS THE ORGANO'S REPRESENTATIVE?

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,458
( gasps )
- ( grunting )

171
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,083

172
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,833

IS MY ARM?

I WAS THE ONE THAT GRANTED
YOU THAT WISH.

179
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,541
