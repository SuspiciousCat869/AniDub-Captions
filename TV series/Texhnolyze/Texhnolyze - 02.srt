1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,625
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

- ( grunting )

7
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,125
- IN GABE?  HOW MANY BULLETS?

8
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,791
THE SAGE'S BODYGUARDS
ARE ALL OUR MEMBERS.

9
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,708
THEY'RE CAPABLE ENOUGH
FOR THE JOB.

10
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,250
- DON'T RETALIATE FOR THE
UNION'S ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

11
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,708
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

12
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,333
- ( man whimpering )

13
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,125
- YOU KNOW, THAT I WISH YOU
WOULDN'T CHANGE FOREVER, TOO.

14
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,458
JUST LIKE THIS LEG.

15
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,625
- ( tool ratchets )

16
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,000
- YOU SAY THAT SO SWEETLY,

17
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,708
KNOWING FULL WELL THAT
YOUR TEXHNOLYZED LEGS

18
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
WON'T LAST FOREVER.

19
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,416
YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND CONNECT TO IT.

20
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,583
- ( whimpering )

21
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,208
- ( screaming )

22
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,583
( screaming continuing )

23
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,958
- Man:
GO AROUND TO SECTION 18.

24
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,458
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

25
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,833
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

26
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,250
- ( horn honks )

27
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,291
- ( mumbles )

28
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,875
- I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

29
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,541
WE WERE JUST TAKING CARE
OF A LITTLE MISMANAGEMENT

30
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,125
IN MY COURTYARD.

31
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,958
WE'LL CLEAN IT UP COMPLETELY.

32
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,291
- MR. IDA, MUST I REMIND YOU
ONCE AGAIN

33
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,500
THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT
TO THE ORGANO ANY VIOLATION

34
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,625
OF OUR REGULATIONS,
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

35
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,041
- OH, OF COURSE NOT, BUT THIS
IS NOTHING AS IMPORTANT ENOUGH

36
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,250
TO EVEN TROUBLE
THE ORGANO.

37
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,833
IT WAS SIMPLY A CASE
WHERE ONE OF OUR GAME DOGS

38
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,625
WASN'T TAMED PROPERLY.

39
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,833
- WE HAVEN'T HAD A SPECTACLE
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME.

40
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,333
THAT'S WHY I WAS GETTING BORED,

41
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,166
BUT THIS DOG MUST HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

42
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,000
WHAT A PITY.

43
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
SCUM LIKE THIS CANNOT RECEIVE

44
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,958
THE BENEFITS FROM RAFFIA EVER.

45
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,625
SCUM CAN NEVER RECEIVE THE GIFT
OF BEING TEXHNOLYZED.

46
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,166
BUT IT'S MY CHOICE WHETHER ONE

47
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,583
HAS TO LIVE NEEDLESSLY OR NOT.

48
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,875
MR. IDA, I'M SURE THIS IS ENOUGH
TO SATISFY YOU.

49
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,041
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR ANY
OF YOU TO DO HERE.

50
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,000
- ( whimpering )

51
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,333
- YOU SAID YOU CAME DOWN HERE
FROM THE SURFACE.

52
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,125
- YES, IT TOOK FOUR DAYS MORE
THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED

53
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:04,333
TO COME DOWN ALL THOSE STAIRS.
- WHY DID YOU COME TO LUX?

54
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,958
- WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY PARTICULAR REASON.

55
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,500
I THOUGHT THAT I JUST
WANNA BE HERE.

56
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,500
- BIG UNCLE, YOU GOT A TELECOM
FROM THE ORGANO.

57
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,583
- YES, THERE WAS.  HOWEVER,
BECAUSE OF A VERY KIND VISITOR,

58
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,916
THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL.

59
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,875
- YES, I THINK THEY WERE KIDS
FROM THE UNION.

60
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,583
NO, I'M GOING TO BE MORE CAREFUL
FROM NOW ON.

61
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,333
SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT GABE.

62
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,416
HOWEVER, I THINK YOU BEST
BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

63
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,916
AROUND YOU, MR. ONISHI.
- ( clicks )

64
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,625
- RAN HAS A SPECIAL GIFT.

65
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,625
SHE CAN SEE THE FUTURE.

66
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,833
- THE FUTURE?
- ONLY THE NEAR FUTURE.

67
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,458
HOWEVER, THE FUTURE IS FLUID

68
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,375
AND CAN CHANGE
IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

69
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:09,041
RAN SEES ONLY ONE VERSION
OF MANY POSSIBILITIES.

70
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,375
- ( grunting )

71
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,166
- Man: THIS VILLAGE OF GABE
IS THE LAND

72
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,333
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED
TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN

73
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,208
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LUX.

74
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,000
BUT NOW,
MOST PEOPLE FROM GABE

75
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,083
WENT BACK TO LIVE
IN THE CITY.

76
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,791
- EVERYTHING LOOKED SIMILAR
AND DIFFERENT

77
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,833
TO HOW I IMAGINED IT.

78
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,083
- I ASSUME YOU'RE
GOING TO THE CITY.

79
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,583
- YEAH, I AM.
- YOU'VE REALLY DONE A LOT

80
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,250
FOR ME.
- ON THE CONTRARY,

81
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,125
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS
KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE ME

82
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,875
FOOD AND SHELTER.

83
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,000
I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW
WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE,

84
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,666
BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING
IN RETURN.

85
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,000
RAN IS GOING BACK
TO THE CITY TODAY.

86
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,708
SO I'LL HAVE HER TAKE YOU THERE.

87
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,291
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR KIND OFFER, SIR.

88
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,041
- I JUST REALIZED YOU
NEVER TOLD ME YOUR NAME.

89
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,750
- MY NAME?

90
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,875
I'M KAZUHO YOSHII,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME YOSHII.

91
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,166
- YOUR PRESENCE HERE
MAKES ME WONDER.

92
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,916
DOES THE FACT THAT YOU MADE IT
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO LUX

93
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,125
MEAN THAT IT'S POSSIBLY A GOOD
THING FOR BOTH OF US.

94
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,250
OR POSSIBLY A BAD THING
FOR BOTH OF US?

95
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,583
- RAN MUST KNOW THE ANSWER,

96
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,750
BUT WHICH ONE IS IT?

97
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,291
- SO IS NOW THE TIME
TO HAVE A SPECTACLE?

98
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,291
- THE SALVATION UNION HAS
ALWAYS BEEN VERY QUIET

99
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,958
IN THE CITY UNTIL RECENTLY.

100
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,291
I NEVER THOUGHT
THEY'D ATTACK THE SAGE.

101
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,375
- THE SAGE SAID NOT
TO TAKE ANY REVENGE.

102
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,958
- WE WON'T TAKE REVENGE
DIRECTLY.

103
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,333
JUST SHOW WHAT REALITY IS
TO THE FANATICAL BELIEVERS.

104
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,333
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
AS THE ORGANO.

105
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,666
- THE YOUNGER FELLOWS ARE
ITCHING BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD

106
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,833
A SPECTACLE
FOR A LONG TIME.

107
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,333
LET THEM BLOW SOME STEAM.
I'LL SANCTION IT.

108
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,708
- ( man panting )

109
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
( labored breathing )

110
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,958
- Man:
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SPECTACLE,

111
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,625
THOUGH IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

112
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,375
I'VE GOTTEN FED UP
WITH THE TROUBLEMAKERS

113
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,166
FROM THE SALVATION UNION.

114
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,625
OH, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON

115
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,000
WHO WOULD EVER WORK
FOR MONEY,

116
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,125
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO REMIND YOU THAT THE THING

117
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,250
THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS
YOUR STRONG CURIOSITY.

118
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,333
HMM.  OH, PARDON ME.
WHAT I REALLY MEANT TO SAY

119
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,250
WAS YOUR SENSE OF PURE

120
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,291
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTAL
SPIRIT.

121
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,541
- Man:
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

122
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,291
- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
A SPECTACLE.

123
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,958
IT'S BETWEEN THE SUITS
AND MOST OF THE BABY GANGS.

124
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,166
- THERE'S NO POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE
FOR THE ORGANO

125
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,208
IF THEY START UP A WAR NOW.

126
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,625
- THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE
A POWER PLAY.

127
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,000
( laughs )

128
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,125
- GOOD LUCK.

129
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,708
THE AUTHORITIES
AND CRAPPY GANGS

130
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,083
ARE BOTH A BUNCH OF PUSSIES.

131
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,083
HEY, YOU.

132
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,458
YEAH, YOU, STUMPY.

133
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,750
HEY!

134
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,416
DON'T JUST STAND THERE
LIKE A LOG.

135
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,750
MOVE YOUR ASS!

136
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,791
- HE JUST LOST THEM.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED,

137
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,041
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME
BEFORE YOU BECAME LIKE THAT.

138
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,625
- HEY, SHINJI, WAIT UP.

00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,833
TO GET INTO THE CITY
EXCEPT THIS?

142
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,416
DO YOU ALWAYS TAKE THIS?

143
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,916
ALWAYS ALONE?

144
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,416
WHAT'S INSIDE THE BASKET?

145
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,583
- FLOWERS.
I SELL THESE.

146
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,208

HE SEEMS
LIKE AN IMPORTANT PERSON.

155

SO...

156
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,000
DO YOU LIKE
YOUR GRANDFATHER?

157
