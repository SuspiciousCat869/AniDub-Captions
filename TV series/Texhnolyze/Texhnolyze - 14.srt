1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,291
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,958
- Ran: IN THE END,

6
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,375
YOU WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING.

7
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,458
YOU WILL HURT MANY PEOPLE.

8
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,000
YOU WILL BE ALL ALONE

9
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,791
IN THE END.

10
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,166
- Onishi: I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT HE PERSONALLY


11
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,875
KNEW THE SEER.


12
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,750
PERHAPS, THE EXPERIENCE
WILL BE GOOD FOR HIM.


13
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,083
AFTER ALL, RUSHING OFF
TOWARDS ONE'S DOOM

14
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,500
IS THE EASIEST THING
TO DO.

15
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,250
- HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE
CHANGED TO ME.

16
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,500
- NOBODY GOES UNSCATHED

17
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,333
WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THEIR FUTURE.

18
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,833
I NEED A LITTLE REST.

19
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,666
- Doc: I'VE BEEN SENDING YOU
REPORTS AS WE AGREED.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,291
NOW HOW ABOUT YOU KEEPING
YOUR WORD IN RETURN.

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,541
I WON'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE THIS!

22
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,583
- GIMME A GOOD ONE.

23
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,000
I'VE BEEN WORKING
TOO HARD THESE DAYS.

24
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,958
AND IT'S BEEN TAKING
A REAL TOLL ON MY BODY.

25
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,666
- ( gasps )

26
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,958
- ( gunshot )

27
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,541
- Doc: WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH THIS JUNK?

28
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,416
- Man: WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THERE ARE BUYERS.

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,375
- WHO?

30
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,458
THE CLASS?

31
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,916
WHY DO THEY NEED THIS JUNK?

32
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,083
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME RAFFIA HERE.

33
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,083
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT,
HUH?

34
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,875
- HOW MUCH?

35
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,333
- ( laughs )

36
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,625
- ( gasps )
- I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY.

37
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,791
THE RAFFIA SUPPLY IS REALLY
SCARCE THESE DAYS.

38
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,250
SOME OF THE DIGGERS USED
TO BRING SOME TO ME,

39
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:26,083
BUT NONE OF 'EM COME
THESE DAYS.

40
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,583
- ( whimpers )

41
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,833
LET GO OF ME.

42
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,708
- COME AGAIN. ( laughs )

43
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
- Woman: IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY
COMFORTABLE, DOES IT?

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,750
- Onishi:
DON'T RETURN SOMEONE'S FAVOR

45
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,166
BY COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.
- I'M SORRY.

46
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,750
- EXECUTIVES FROM TWO OFFICES
WERE ATTACKED.

47
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,208
AND SONODA'S OFFICE RECEIVED
A RETALIATION IN THE SAME NIGHT.

48
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,666
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
IGNORING TSUJINAKA AND IZAKI,

49
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,000
SONODA HAS ALWAYS MADE SURE
TO KEEP THE YOUNGER MEMBERS

50
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,333
OF HIS OFFICE IN LINE.

51
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
THERE'S NOTHING GAINED
BY SETTING HIM UP.

52
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,583
- THOSE THREE OFFICES
ARE MAKING INQUIRIES

53
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,541
THROUGH THEIR LOWER LEVEL
MEMBERS TO LEARN THE TRUTH

54
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,833
ABOUT THIS MATTER.

55
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,041
- THEY CANNOT SEE
THE REAL ENEMY.

56
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,833
- BUT HE DOES EXIST.

57
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,833
WE ALMOST GOT KILLED IN GABE.

58
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,166
- SO YOU FINALLY DECIDED
TO OPEN THAT MOUTH OF YOURS.

59
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,208
AT LEAST YOU SEEM TO BE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

60
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,875
- ( telephone rings )

61
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,875
- ( picks up telephone )
WHAT IS IT NOW?

62
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,666
LET ME SEE YOUR HAND.

63
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,250
NOT THAT ONE.

64
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,250
MOVE IT.

65
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,250
RIGHT.

66
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,000
I'LL SEND HIM OVER.
GOODBYE.

67
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,000
- ( clicks )

68
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,500
- GO AND HAVE DOC
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

69
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,833
AND CHECK ON HER AS WELL.

70
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,666
YOUR MIND IS WORKING SOMEWHAT
QUICKER NOW, ISN'T IT?

71
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,083
IF THEY'RE SEEKING TO TAKE OUR
LIVES, THEN IT'LL COME

72
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,333
AS NO SURPRISE THE DOCTOR
MAY BE BE IN DANGER AS WELL.

73
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,500
BUT BE CAREFUL.  THAT DOCTOR
IS QUITE AN INTUITIVE WOMAN.

74
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,208
- YOU'RE LOOKING VERY SHARP.

75
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,875
FIRST ONISHI AND NOW YOU.

76
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,916
I FEEL GOOD WHEN THE MEN I TAKE
A SPECIAL INTEREST IN

77
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,708
GET AHEAD IN THE WORLD.

78
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

79
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,958
- I JUST FEEL LIKE CELEBRATING.

80
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,708
LET'S HAVE A TOAST.

81
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,166
YOU START FROM THE OUTSIDE.

82
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,125
YOU STILL LACK CULTURAL
SOPHISTICATION.

83
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,000
- ( silverware clatters )
- ( laughs )

84
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,708
I'M VERY SORRY.  YOU CAME HERE
TO HAVE YOU HAND FIXED.

85
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,875
THEY'VE COMPLETELY BECOME PART
OF YOUR BODY.

86
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,875
DO YOU REMEMBER?

87
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,291
IN THE BEGINNING,

88
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM.

89
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,791
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

90
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
DO YOU STILL THINK THAT WAY?

91
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,458
THAT ARM AND LEG HAVE SHOWN
YOU MANY THINGS, HAVEN'T THEY?

92
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,541
- JUST SOME LEFT OVER MEMORIES
FROM MY PARENTS.

93
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,958
- DO YOU WANT TO SEE
MANY MORE THINGS?

94
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,958
- ( beeps )
- ( grunts )

95
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,708
- THAT'S NOTHING WE SHOULD MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF.

96
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,583
IT'S JUST THOSE WHO
DON'T WANNA STEP OFF THE STAGE

97
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,416
AND LOSE THE ATTENTION
THEY'VE GAINED.

98
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,333
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.
THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT IT.

99
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,708
- YOU SOUND UNCONCERNED.
YET, YOU OR I COULD BE NEXT.

100
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,750
- WHAT ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

101
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,333
THEN AGAIN,
IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES,

102
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,125
I'D PROBABLY BE FEELING
THE SAME WAY AS YOU ARE.

103
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,125
JUST BE PATIENT.

104
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,208
THE CHANCE WILL PRESENT ITSELF.

105
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,625
YOU'LL GET YOUR RIGHTFUL
POSITION BACK SOONER OR LATER.

106
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,541
IN THE MEANTIME,
LET'S JUST SIT BACK

107
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,583
AND WATCH THEM
DESTROY THEMSELVES.

108
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,625
- ( beeping )

109
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,208
- THIS IS A NEW EXPERIENCE.

110
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,458
YOU ARE NOW THE MOST EVOLVED
PERSON IN THIS CITY.

111
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,250
WHEN THEY SEE YOU, EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN STRIVING FOR

112
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,250
WILL BECOME CLEAR TO THEM,

113
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,625
ESPECIALLY HOW THEY SHOULD

114
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,625
UTILIZE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY.

115
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,000
YOU'RE QUITE ADORABLE,

116
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,625
DEAR BOY.

117
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,541
TIME TO GO NOW.

118
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,041
YOU'RE FREE.

119
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,041
NOW BE A GOOD BOY
AND LIE STILL.

120
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,083
- ( door closes )

121
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,083
- ( engine turns over )

122
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,500
- ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S GO.

123
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,375
- WHERE AM I GOING?

124
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,416
- JUST DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.
THAT'S ALL.

125
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,375
- YES, SIR.

126
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,125
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHERE?

127
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,708
- I'M GOING HOME.

128
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,083
- HOME?
- MY REAL HOME.

129
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,500
I NO LONGER NEED TO STAY
IN THIS CITY.

130
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,375
- WHAT ABOUT US?  WHAT NOW?

131
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
- US?

132
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,000
YOU MEAN ONISHI AND YOURSELF.

133
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,083
EVEN IF I'M GONE, YOU CAN AT
LEAST GET YOUR TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS

134
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,375
REPAIRED IN THE CITY.

135
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,666
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE
BESIDES YOURSELF.

136
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,416
HOW CAN THAT BE WHEN YOU
WON'T EVEN FALL FOR ME?

137
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,291
SO IS ONISHI THAT FASCINATING?

138
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,708
NOW I'M MAD.

139
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,333
BUT YOU, DEAR BOY,
SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

140
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,875
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.

141
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,375
AS A REWARD,

142
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,333
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
CULTURAL SOPHISTICATION.

143
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,000
A MAN'S CHARM IS ESSENTIALLY
SOPHISTICATION.

144
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,958
AND AS A RESULT, HIS IDEALS
ARE LED BY IT.

145
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,208
I'LL TURN YOU INTO MUCH MORE
OF A MAN THAN ONISHI EVER WAS.

146
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,875
I'LL TEACH YOU THAT
TEXHNOLYZATION DOES NOT EXIST

147
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,208
FOR THE PURPOSE OF VIOLENCE.

148
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,708
- TAKE ME BACK RIGHT NOW.

149
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,583
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
UNDERSTANDING, DO YOU?

150
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,833
EVERYTHING IS AT MY WILL,

151
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,333
INCLUDING YOU

152
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,000
AND HOW THE PEOPLE
OF THIS CITY WILL EVOLVE.

153
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,583
- DETACH IT AND CONNECT IT
TO THE OTHER ONE.

154
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,583
- HEY.  HEY!

155
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,583
- YES.

156
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,583
- WHERE'S THE REST?

157
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,375
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT WE
CAN'T BRING THEM ALL AT ONCE.

158
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,166
- THEY SAY THE SOONER
YOU DELIVER,

159
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,583
THE MORE YOU GET PAID.
- THEY SAY?

160
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,541
SERIOUSLY.  ARE YOU GONNA
START A WAR OR SOMETHING?

161
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,625
- JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

162
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,875
WE'LL BE BACK IN FIVE DAYS.

163
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,583

00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,500
OPEN IT.

166
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,375
I ALREADY KNOW.

167
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,000
YOU'RE COLLECTING RESOURCES
FOR TEXHNOLYZATION.

168

IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT YOU
ACKNOWLEDGED MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

174

TEXHNOLYZATION AND HUMANKIND

175
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,791
CAN BE MERGED EVEN FURTHER.

176
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,791
IN JUST A FEW GENERATIONS,

177
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,500
THEY WOULD BE PERFECT
HUMAN BEINGS.

178
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,041

WHY?  WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

187
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,458
- ( gasps )
- ( explosion )

188

190
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,416
WHY?

191
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,458
WHAT DID I DO?

192
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,208
WHY DON'T THEY NEED ME?

193
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,250
- YOUR HOME, IT'S IN THERE,
ISN'T IT?

194
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,250
- YES.

195
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,541
- WHAT'S IT LIKE THERE?

196
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,291
- WHAT'S IT LIKE THERE?
IT'S JUST A CITY.

197
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,041
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE,

198
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,750
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND.

199
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,791
- IF I CAN'T KNOW,
IF I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,

200
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,250
IS THAT WHY I'M GOING TO
BE LEFT ALL ALONE?

- WHAT?

202
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,208
- SINCE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,

203
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,458
WILL I DESTROY EVERYTHING?

204
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

205
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,250
- THEN TEACH ME SOMEDAY.

206
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,875

THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT.

00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,041
ALL OF IT...

213
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,541
GONE.

214
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,416
- NOT YET.

NOT ALL OF IT'S GONE YET.

216
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,208
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

217
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:20,750
SOONER OR LATER,
EVERYTHING WILL BE GONE.
