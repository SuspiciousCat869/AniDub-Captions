1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,750
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,916
- Man: RAN.

6
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,666
THE DAY HAS COME AT LAST.

7
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,500
I WISH I COULD SEE YOUR FACE
ONE LAST TIME,

8
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,666
BUT MY WISH WILL NOT BE GRANTED.

9
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,375
I KNOW THOSE WHO
ARE BORN IN GABE,

10
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,250
ARE EXPECTED TO ACCEPT
THE SEER'S WORDS


11
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,291
WITHOUT RESERVATION YET.


12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,208
NOW WHEN IT'S MY TURN
TO FACE DEATH,

13
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,416
I AM UTTERLY CONSUMED
WITH FEAR.

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,708
IT'S SHAMEFUL.

15
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,125
BUT PLEASE.

16
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,291
BE WITH ME IN
MY FINAL MOMENT, RAN.

17
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,125
IF MY DEATH IS

18
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,333
TO HAVE ANY MEANING--

19
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,583
- ( gunshot )

20
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,458
- SO KUGAYAMA HAS LEFT US.

21
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,958
- IT SEEMS SO.

22
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,125
- HIS DEATH MAKES THE SIXTH.

23
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,833
HAVE YOU NOTIFIED THE REMAINING
THREE ABOUT HIS PASSING?

24
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,458
- NOT YET, SIR.

25
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT YET?

26
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,583
- WHAT I SAY NOW,

27
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,833
I SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOU, GREAT SAGE.

28
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:37,250
EVEN THOUGH THINGS HAPPENING
HAVE BEEN FORETOLD BY THE SEER,

29
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,125
I CANNOT AGREE WITH THE IDEA
THAT WE MUST DO NOTHING

30
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:44,500
BUT SIT BACK AND WATCH
THE PEOPLE OF GABE BE MURDERED.

31
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,916
- IT IS WRONG OF YOU TO THINK
THAT THEY WERE MURDERED.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,291
IT WAS SIMPLY
THE INEVITABLE FACT

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,916
THAT THEIR TIME HAD COME.
- BUT, SIR.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,708
- THE WORDS OF THE SEER
FORESHADOW WHAT EVENTUALLY

35
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,583
BECOMES REALITY,

36
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,416
A REALITY WE HAVE NO ABILITY

37
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,833
TO EITHER AVOID OR ESCAPE.

38
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,958
YOU MUST GIVE UP THE FOLLY
OF TRYING

39
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,541
TO CHANGE WHAT MUST BE.

40
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,541
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF
THE SEER'S WORDS ARE EVER LOST

41
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,791
TO US, THEN REALITY WILL
BE LOST TO US AS WELL.

42
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,000
THAT IS HOW IT IS
ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC,

43
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,791
IS IT NOT?

44
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,541
WHICH IN TURN MEANS THAT
GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE

45
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,166
OF THE SEER, GABE IS COMPLETELY
LOST IN THE DARK

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,791
AS TO WHAT TO DO,
EVEN TODAY.

47
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,250
THEN I HAVE TO MAKE A REQUEST.

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,875
YOU MUST DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SEER.

49
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,000
- THE SEER IS STILL
MUCH TOO YOUNG.

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:36,666
SHE CANNOT ENDURE TO SEE WHAT
SHE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE.

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,458
EVENTUALLY, SHE WILL ACCEPT
HER POSITION IN THIS WORLD

52
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,541
AND ONLY THEN
WILL SHE SPEAK TO US

53
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,166
WHEN SHE IS WILLING.

54
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,666
- AND WHEN WILL THAT BE?

55
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,041
IF YOU CANNOT GIVE
US THAT ANSWER,

56
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,708
THEN WE REQUEST PERMISSION
TO ACT

57
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,750
REGARDLESS OF THE SEER'S WORDS.

58
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,625
- ( groans )

59
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,916
- TELL ME WHY.

60
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,916
WHY?

61
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,750
- Onishi:
WAIT FOR ME HERE.

62
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,416
- THE EXECUTIVE MEETING STARTS
AT 1:00.

63
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,625
- I KNOW.

64
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,333
- ( alarm sounding )

65
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,416
- ( gun cocks )
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

66
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,666
- WHY DID YOU DISAPPEAR
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

67
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,416
- NO REASON.

68
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
IN FACT, I DON'T RECALL
EVER DOING SUCH A THING.

69
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,250
- IF YOU BECOME COMPLETELY
UNREACHABLE,

70
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,500
THEN IS THAT NOT THE SAME
AS DISAPPEARING?

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,416
I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,916
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE HILL.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,125
DOC, I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.

74
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,541
- WHERE'S KAKU?
- UH...

75
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,875
UH...

76
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,000
- YOICHI AND THE OTHERS?

77
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,333
- DIDN'T YOU SEE THEM OUTSIDE?

78
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,916
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST HANGING
AROUND SOMEWHERE.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,750
- HEY, GORO,
HOW MANY OF US ARE LEFT?

80
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,875
- I THINK THERE'S MORE THAN 20.
- YOU THINK?

81
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,125
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
A HOLD OF HITOSHI AND MARU

82
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,375
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

83
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,625
- I GET IT.

84
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,041
- WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE STILL
AT HOME JUST SLEEPING.

85
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,375
- YOKO.
- SHINJI.

86
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,916
- IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE,
THEN LEAVE.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,250
YOU'RE FREE.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

88
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,541
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT,
SHINJI?

89
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,583
- I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH
AT LEAST.

90
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,916
DON'T PITY ME.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,541
I WON'T TOLERATE IT.
NOT EVEN FROM YOU.

92
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,375
I DON'T THINK WE'D GAIN ANYTHING
BY BECOMING GOOD PALS

93
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,250
WITH THE GHOSTS.

94
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,083
BUT IF WE FIGHT AGAINST THEM,
IT'LL CERTAINLY BE A LOT

95
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,291
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH.

96
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,666
I DON'T LIKE THIS
SITUATION ONE BIT.

97
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,083
THIS THING COMPLETELY SUCKS!

98
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,083
- Man:
THIS ISN'T TREASON.

99
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,166
IT'S A DISILLUSIONMENT
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

100
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,250
DUE TO AN IDEOLOGICAL
EVOLUTION.

101
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,041
WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO ENCOUNTER A GREATER BEING

102
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,333
WHO IS CAPABLE OF REALIZING OUR
IDEALS IN A MORE EVOLVED FORM.

103
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,041
AND THAT IS THE REASON
WE ARE LEAVING.

104
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,291
BUT THE REASON WE CHOOSE NOT
TO INVITE YOU TO COME WITH US

105
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,041
AT THIS TIME IS THAT WE HOPE
YOU WILL IDEOLOGICALLY EVOLVE

106
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,541
BY YOUR OWN ACCORD.

107
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,458
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
THAT I'M TRYING TO SAY?

108
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,458
THAT LEFT ARM OF YOURS.

109
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,208
I'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT
SINCE LONG AGO.

110
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,625
- WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
IS BECAUSE I WAS TEXHNOLYZED

111
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,291
IT'S GIVEN ME THE CLARITY
TO GRASP THE EVILS

112
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,916
OF TEXHNOLYZATION.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,750
TEXHNOLYZATION IS THE ENEMY
OF THE BODY.

114
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,708
IT AFFECTS THE BODY.
IT AFFECTS THE MIND.

115
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,583
AND EVENTUALLY, IT AFFECTS
THE MAN HIMSELF.

116
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,583
- AND YET, YOU COULD NOT PREACH
THE UNION IDEALS

117
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,875
THAT YOU VALUE SO DEARLY

118
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,958
WITHOUT HIDING YOUR LEFT ARM.

119
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,958
YOUR ACTIONS ARE LUDICROUS
AS WELL AS PATHETIC.

120
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,916
SUCH FLAWS IN MEN ARE WHAT
HE DESPISES THE MOST.

121
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,125
IT IS MY SINCERE
HOPE THAT ONE DAY

122
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,916
YOU WILL REALIZE
YOUR OWN IDEOLOGICAL

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
AND PHYSICAL VULNERABILITIES,
ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE WILLING.

124
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,291
I WILL TAKE SOME 60 MEN
WITH ME.

125
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,625
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT
I HOPE YOU WILL ONE DAY

126
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,958
JOIN US IN OUR ACTIVITIES.

127
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,750
GOODBYE.

128
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,500
- IT'S NOT AS IF THESE THINGS
WERE JUST HAPPENING

129
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,166
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

130
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,083
IT'S JUST THAT WHAT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN THERE

131
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,458
IS NOW BECOMING MORE APPARENT.

132
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,041
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE TAKING PART IN IT

133
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,250
SINCE YOU'RE A MEMBER
OF THE CLASS.

134
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,875
- I THOUGHT I WAS,

135
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,958
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

136
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,333
- I WAS INVITED.
HE CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME

137
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,166
THAT I WOULD BE WISE
TO TAKE PART IN IT.

138
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,333
- SO YOU MET HIM.
YOU SAW WHO HE WAS.

139
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,750
- I DID NOT SEE HIS FACE,

140
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,166
BUT HE GAVE ME
SOME INSANE SPEECH.

141
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,416
I COMPLETELY REJECTED
HIS INVITATION OF COURSE.

142
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,416
NOW, DOC, YOU MUST TELL ME
WHO THAT MAN IS.

143
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,708
- BUT WILL YOUR KNOWING
CHANGE ANYTHING?

144
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,250
- HE SEEMED FAMILIAR.

145
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,916
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE MET HIM
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

146
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,166
ALTHOUGH I CANNOT BE CERTAIN.

147
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,916
- YOU MUST BE SERIOUSLY
MISTAKEN.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,250
EVEN WITHIN THE CLASS,
ONLY A SELECT FEW

149
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
ARE ALLOWED TO MEET
FACE-TO-FACE

150
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,375
WITH SOMEONE THAT HIGH UP.

151
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,791
- IS HE SERIOUS
ABOUT WHAT HE'S PLANNING?

152
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,875
- HE'S QUITE SERIOUS.
HE'S GOING TO REMAKE LUX

153
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,958
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN
CRAZY IDEOLOGY.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,083
AND HE IS IN THE PROCESS
OF MAKING IT HAPPEN.

155
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,375
HE USED TO BE REGARDED
AS A HERETIC WITHIN THE CLASS,

156
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,416
BUT NOW BECAUSE OF HIM,
THE CLASS HAS TRIED

157
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,083
TO ELIMINATE MY IDEAS
BY ELIMINATING ME ENTIRELY.

158
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,083
THEIR MESSAGE IS CLEAR.

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,833
THEY NO LONGER HAVE ANY USE
FOR ME.

160
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,750
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

161
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,000
NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY,

162
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,750
THIS CITY IS GOING TO CHANGE.

163
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,750
NO ONE CAN STOP IT.

164
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,416
NOT EVEN YOU.
NOT ANYONE.

165
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,708
- I WANNA GET SOME FRESH AIR.

166
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,375
SINCE I'M GOING,
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD

167
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,833
COME ALONG WITH ME.

168
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,958
- Man: HOW'S THE ORGANO?

169
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,875
HOW ARE YOU FITTING IN?

170
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
( laughs )

171
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,250
YOU STILL DON'T LIKE
TO TALK MUCH, DO YOU?

172
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,375
BUT SEEING THAT YOU HAVEN'T
QUITTED AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

173
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,291
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY
YOU HATE IT.

174
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,041
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

175
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,041
I'M NOT SURE AT ALL.

176
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,708
I'VE BEEN OFTEN ASKING MYSELF

177
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,958
WHY I'M HERE AS I AM NOW.

178
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,000
- Ran:
YOU WILL HURT MANY PEOPLE.

179
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,000
- ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT THE SEER SAID?

180
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,541
FORGET ABOUT IT.

181
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
WORDS ARE MERELY NOTHING
MORE THAN WORDS.

182
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,833
- BUT MY FUTURE.
- WHAT GOOD IS IT TO KNOW

183
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,250
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

184
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,416
ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE
EXACTLY LIKE THE PEOPLE OF GABE

185
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,791
AND JUST GIVE UP
ON EVERYTHING AND DO NOTHING?

186
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,375
OR WASTE YOUR LIFE AWAY
JUST LANGUISHING?

187
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,166
I DIDN'T WANNA DO EITHER.
THAT'S WHY I STAYED HERE

188
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,833
IN THE CITY INSTEAD
OF GOING TO GABE.

189
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,875
I FELT LIKE SHAPING
MY OWN FUTURE.

190
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,666
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO, SON?

191
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,875
NOW GO AHEAD,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

192
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,833
- I'M NOT SURE.

193
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,541
- THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD
DO IS TO FIND THAT OUT.

194
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,541
ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT,

195
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,541
THEN THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

196
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,375
THE ONLY THING LEFT
WILL BE TO GO OUT AND GET IT.

197
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,166
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHY
HE SENT YOU HERE TO SEE ME.

198
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,875
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

199
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,625
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
HE REALLY WANTS FROM YOU,

200
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,666
FOR WHAT REASON
ARE YOU HERE GUARDING ME?

201
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,875
THINK ABOUT IT.

202
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,916
KEEP THINKING
AND SOONER OR LATER

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,875
THE SEER'S WORDS WILL
BECOME EMPTY IN MEANING,

204
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,083
AS THEY SHOULD.

205
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,041
- THERE'S A PROBLEM.
- HMM?

206
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,375
- I KNOW I'M LATE.
MY APOLOGIES.

207
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,750
- THERE'S NO WORRY.

208
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,541
ALTHOUGH THIS IS
A REGULAR MEETING,

209
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,291
THIS ONE WON'T TAKE LONG.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

210
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,666
- LET ME GET STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.

211
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,291
THE ORGANO IS COMING TO AN END
AS OF TODAY.

212
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,791
FROM NOW ON,

213
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,041
THE CITY OF LUX WILL BE GOVERNED
DIRECTLY BY THE CLASS.

214
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,916
THEY'VE DESIGNATED ME
TO SERVE AS THEIR CONDUIT.

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,250
FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE TO FOLLOW
ALL MY INSTRUCTIONS

216
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,916
WITHOUT EXCEPTION.
THIS HAS BEEN ALREADY DECIDED

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,250
AND IS NOT A MATTER
FOR DISCUSSION.  THAT'S IT.

218
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,750
- THIS IS A COUP.

219
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,250
- I BELIEVE I GAVE YOU AMPLE
CLUES THAT THIS WAS COMING.

220
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,250
- HMM.

221
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,083
STILL AS A FORMALITY, WE MUST
TAKE A VOTE ON THE SUBJECT.

222
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,083
ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT ACCEPT
WHAT KOHAKURA SAID,

223
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,791
STAND UP.

224
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,500
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

225
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,000
- GREAT FATHER ONLY TOLD ME

226
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,500
THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW
YOUR DECISIONS, MR. ONISHI.

227
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,833
-  HOW DISAPPOINTING.
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

228
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,708
THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
THE SAME DREAM THAT I WAS.

229
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,291
THE NEXT TIME THAT WE MEET,

230
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,500
YOU'D BETTER NOT
TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.

231
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,375
- NOTHING SEEMED OUT
OF THE ORDINARY

232
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,500
UNTIL A FEW MINUTES AGO.

233
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,666
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
IN HERE?

234
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,750
- SASAKI WENT TO CHECK IT OUT,
BUT STILL HASN'T RETURNED.

235
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,208
- WE'RE GOING BACK INSIDE THEN.

236
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,041
YOUNG MAN, IF YOU SEE THEM
COME BACK IN HERE,

237
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,541
KILL THEM
WITHOUT HESITATION,

238
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,500
BUT DO IT WITHOUT HARMING
THE OTHER PATIENTS.  UNDERSTOOD?

239
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,500
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

240
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,375
- IT WAS NO GOOD
INSIDE THE ROOM, SIR.

241
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,250
THEY WERE ALL KILLED--
- ( gunfire )

242
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,750
- ( gasping )
- ( grunts )

243
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
- WHAT?

244
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,416
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

245
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,458
- ( grunting )

246
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,916
- GET OUT OF MY WAY,
YOU BASTARD.

247
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,375
- ( whirring )
- All: HUH?

248
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,291
- GIVE IT UP.
YOUR TIME IS OVER.

249
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,541
- WE HAVE COME TO GET YOU,
SIR.

250
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,416
- Man: COMPLAINING?

251
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,416
WHAT ARE THEY COMPLAINING ABOUT?

252
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,250
- Boy: THEY'RE BORED BECAUSE
THE PEOPLE OF GABE

253
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,625
ARE NOT OFFERING
ANY RESISTANCE.

254
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,166
- TELL ME, WHO ARE THEY?

255
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,166
- MAINLY ONES WHO USED
TO BE MEMBERS OF THE RACAN.

256
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,625
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, WE
MUST DO OUR BEST TO HELP THEM.

257
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,458
DON'T JUST CUT OFF AN ARM
OR A LEG,

258
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,375
BUT ALL FOUR LIMBS
FROM EVERY ONE OF THEM

259
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,958
AND REPLACE THEM ALL
WITH NEW UNITS.

260
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,333
THEY MUST ONLY UNDERSTAND
MY IDEOLOGY.

261
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,333
BUT IT'S POINTLESS UNLESS
THEY PHYSICALLY

262
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,333
UNDERSTAND ME AS WELL.

263
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,583
- AS YOU WISH, SIR.

264
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,875
- HOW IRONIC THAT I'M GOING TO
GABE AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

265
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,875
- THIS CITY IS VERY DANGEROUS.
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN

266
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,083
TO YOU NOW, THERE WILL BE
NO HOPE OF RESTORING THINGS

267
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,583
EVEN IF THERE IS STILL
HOPE OTHERWISE.

268
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,125
- KEIGO.

269
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,833
JUST GIVE UP THE ORGANO.

270
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,208
IT EXISTED MERELY
FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE.

271
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,083
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S TO BE
DISSOLVED AT THIS POINT.

272
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,375
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

273
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,000
YOU MAY USE ALL OF MY MEN
HOWEVER YOU LIKE.

274
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,375
- GREAT FATHER.
- YOUNG MAN.

275
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,916
I'LL BE SEEING YOU AGAIN.

276
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,875
- I MUST THANK YOU.
THAT WAS EXCELLENT WORK.

277
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,833
- BUT I-- ( gasps )
- HMM?

278
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,166
- Man: TO ALL OF YOU

279
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,458
WHO ARE CAPABLE
OF HEARING MY WORDS,

280
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,125
LISTEN TO ME.

281
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,916
I AM PLEASED TO TELL YOU
THAT LUX 100 YEAR HISTORY

282
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,208
OF BLOODSHED AND DISORDER

283
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,333
IS COMING TO AN END AT LAST.

284
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,333
AS OF TODAY,

285
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,291
LUX WILL BE GOVERNED
DIRECTLY BY US--

286
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,416
THE CLASS.

287
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,291
MY PEOPLE, DO NOT BE AFRAID.

288
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,791
OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS

289
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,000
TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL NEW
AND PROSPEROUS LUX.

290
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,541
WE WILL PROVIDE UNWAVERING
SUPPORT FOR YOU

291
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,625
TO OBTAIN
BEAUTIFUL BODIES

292
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,125
UNDER THE PROPER IDEOLOGY.

293
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,750
THE FIRST OF THESE NEW CITIZENS,

294
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,250
SOLDIERS WITH BEAUTIFUL BODIES
ARE NOW MARCHING

295
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,916
INTO THE NEW CITY.

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,833
THEY ARE THE SHAPES.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,250
HARUHIKO, AT LONG LAST THE HILL
IS FINALLY COMING INTO VIEW.

298
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,125
- Man: MY PEOPLE, I ASK YOU
TO FOLLOW THEM.

299
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,666
MY PEOPLE, I ASK YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME.

300
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,833
BELIEVE IN MY IDEALS,

301
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,875
BELIEVE IN MY VOICE,

302
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,791
BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE
OF THE NEW PEOPLE

303
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,291
AND THE NEW CITY.

304
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,916
BELIEVE IN THE MANIFESTATION
OF MY SPIRIT!

305
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,750
- Onishi: IT'S OVER.

306
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,875
IT SEEMS WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TIME TO THINK.

307
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,666
- WE'LL DESTROY
EVERY ONE OF THEM!

308
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,208
- ( theme music playing )

309
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,333
- ( singing in Japanese )
