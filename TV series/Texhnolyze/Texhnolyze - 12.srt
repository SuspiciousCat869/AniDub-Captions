1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,625
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,625
- Man: UNFORTUNATELY, THE AMOUNT
OF RAFFIA BEING DUG UP

6
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,958
IS IN FACT DIMINISHING.

7
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,083
THEY'RE AREN'T A LOT OF SPOTS

8
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,416
LEFT WHERE WE CAN DIG, EITHER.
- ( bell rings )

9
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,958
- WELL, YES, OF COURSE.

10
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,500
I DO UNDERSTAND.

11
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,500
WHAT?  WHAT SUSPICION?

12
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:06,083
WELL, BECAUSE I JUST WANNA KNOW.
THAT'S ALL.

14
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,708
THAT'S VERY TRUE.

15
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,791
IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
RIDICULOUS ACCUSATIONS,

16
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,625
WE'LL GO TO THE ORGANO.

17
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,541
- ( crashing )

18
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,458
- HMM?

19
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,416
HMM?  OH!

20
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,208
- ( gunshots )

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
- All: HUH?

22
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
- Man: YOU THINK YOU
CAN MESS WITH ME?

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,750
THIS AREA IS GONNA BE MADE
INTO THE RACAN'S TERRITORY.

24
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,750
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE PAYING
A LOT OF MONEY, DO YOU, GRANDMA?

25
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,625
AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

26
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,000
WE'RE JUST THE SAME
AS YOU PEOPLE.

27
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,500
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ROB YOU.

28
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,208
IT'S AGAINST MY BETTER NATURE

29
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,541
TO WRING A LOT
OF MONEY OUT OF YOU.

30
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,250
HMM?  HUH?

31
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,291
WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT YOU,
YOU KNOW?

32
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,166
YOU WANNA COME WITH ME?

33
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,125
I'LL SHOW YOU A GOOD TIME.

34
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,875
HUH?

35
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,541
WHAT?

36
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,583
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,333
HA!  LOSERS FROM GABE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK

38
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,458
TO THE MOUNTAIN AND SQUIRM
AROUND IN SOME PIG GREASE?

39
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,125
HUH?  ( grunts )

40
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,500
YOU BASTARDS WILL NEVER
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

41
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,250
- HEY!

42
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,041
- Toyama: TELL ME.

43
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,541
DO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE
IN YOUR BODY?

44
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,333
WITH THAT NEW ARM,

45
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,875
YOU THINK YOU HAVE NO NEED
FOR ANY OTHER WEAPON?

46
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,416
- WEAPON?

47
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,583
- A SWORD IS JUST AN OUTDATED
WEAPON THE PEOPLE OF GABE USED

48
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,208
IN THE OLD DAYS.

49
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,708
GUNS ARE MORE POPULAR THESE DAYS
'CAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLER.

50
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,708
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ANY OF THIS?

51
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,875
- YOU ARE NO LONGER
A GAME PLAYER.

52
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,541
IN LUX, USING AXES AND GUNS TO
FIGHT IS THE WAY OF THE LOWLIFE.

53
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,666
- BUT I HAVEN'T CHANGED
FROM BEFORE.

54
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,666
- PROBABLY NOT.

55
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,375
BUT YOU ARE NOW A MEMBER
OF THE ORGANO.

56
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,500
AND YOU MUST LEARN
THAT A MEMBER MUST ALWAYS SHOW

57
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,333
ABSOLUTE STRENGTH
TOWARDS NON-MEMBERS.

58
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,083
- WHAT A PAIN.

59
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,958
- YES, IT'S QUITE A PAIN.

60
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,458
YES, YOU MUST MAKE THE SWORD

61
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,458
AN EXTENSION OF YOUR FINGERS.

62
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,416
- LIKE I SAID, WE SHOULD GO
SET UP OUR DEN OVER THERE,

63
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,791
AND THEN WE SHOULD BEAT UP
WHOEVER DISOBEYS US.

64
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,791
THAT'LL TEACH 'EM A LESSON,
YOU KNOW?

65
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,833
AND ONE MORE THING,
LET ME BE IN CHARGE

66
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,500
OF SOME OF OUR SOLDIERS.
COME ON.

67
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,208
- IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU STOPPED
ACTING LIKE A SPOILED BRAT.

68
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,166
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
( grunts )

69
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,666
- HMM?

70
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,875
HEY, SO WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

71
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,083
WE REALLY GOTTA DECIDE QUICKLY
ON THE LOCATION OF OUR NEW DEN.

72
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,125
- YEAH.

73
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,333
- SHINJI, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

74
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,583
- HAL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR
CAPABILITIES TO FIGHT A WAR?

75
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,416
- WELL, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
IF WE MAKE A BUNCH OF FOOLS

76
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,375
OF OURSELVES AGAIN
IN ANOTHER SPECTACLE,

77
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,000
THE GUYS BELOW US WILL--
HEY, YOKO.

78
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,708
WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET US SOME DRINKS?

79
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,541
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
GET US SOMETHING TO EAT TO.

80
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,000
- SURE, AFTER MY HAIR DRIES.

81
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,250
- JUST GO.
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

82
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,208
SHINJI, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

83
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,958
- WHATEVER'S FINE.

84
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,500
- ( scoffs )
YOU TWO ARE SO PATHETIC.

85
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,666
YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER
TO DO THAN CHAT THE DAY AWAY.

86
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,750
- Toyama: THE MANAGER
OF THE DIG SITE WAS KILLED.

87
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,583
- RIGHT.

88
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,375
BUT THANKS TO MIZUNO'S
BLUNDERED POWER GRAB,

89
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,416
THE MANAGEMENT HAS GONE HAYWIRE.

90
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,833
APPARENTLY, THEY KILLED
THE ASSASSIN,

91
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,833
AN EXPENDABLE UNDERLING
NO DOUBT,

92
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,833
WITHOUT EXTRACTING INFORMATION
FROM HIM.

93
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,791
- Toyama:
COULD IT BE THE UNION?

94
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,750
- IF IT IS, THEN WE
HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

95
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,875
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

96
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,375
- WHY DON'T YOU GO ALONG
WITH TOYAMA?

97
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,791
- WHY DID THE CHIEF
LET HER COME HERE

98
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,666
ALL BY HERSELF?
- I DON'T KNOW.

99
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,208
MAYBE SHE'S TAKING A FIELD TRIP.
- ( laughing )

100
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,750
- IT'S NOT FUNNY. IF SOMETHING
EVER HAPPENS TO HER,

101
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,166
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL BE ABLE
TO DEAL WITH IT ON OUR OWN.

102
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,375
- THE ORGANO GUYS
WON'T TOUCH HER.

103
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,166
BUT WHO KNOWS ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHO SHE IS?

104
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,250
- THOSE WHO DO KNOW
ARE MORE DANGEROUS.

105
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,375
( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW.

106
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,625
MAYBE WE SHOULD REPORT
THIS BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN.

107
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,708
- HMM.  HUH?

108
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,208
- Man:
YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH.

109
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,208
I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE IKUSEI'S SON.

110
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,875
YOU'RE TALLER, BUT THERE'S
A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE.

111
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,958
HOW ARE YOU?  IT'S BEEN A VERY
LONG TIME SINCE I LAST SAW YOU.

112
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,125
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER DOING?

113
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,125
I SEE.

114
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,916
- MY FATHER--
NO, NEVER MIND.

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,291
I ALREADY KNOW.
- YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS--

116
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,041
- BEING PAID FOR SELLING OUT
HIS OWN PEOPLE, WASN'T HE?

117
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,916
- THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
- SOLD OUT HIS OWN PEOPLE
AND DIED MISERABLY.

119
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,958
THE BASTARD LOST EVERYTHING
AND HAD ONLY HIMSELF TO BLAME.

120
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,750
- Ran: I CAN SEE

121
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,208
EVERYTHING.

122
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,625
BUT--

123
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,750
- Toyama: WE THE PEOPLE OF THE
LUX ARE KEPT ALIVE BY THE CLASS

124
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,375
IN ORDER TO COLLECT RAFFIA.

125
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,125
DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE ABOVE
NEED RAFFIA SO BADLY?

126
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,916
- THAT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,875
- YOU HAVE HEARD WHY
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE

128
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,250
THAT PRODUCES RAFFIA,
HAVE YOU NOT?

129
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,583
THAT IN THE OLD DAYS,
A COUNTLESS NUMBER

130
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,291
OF BODIES WERE BURIED HERE.

131
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,875
- NO, I NEVER HEARD THAT.

132
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,791
- I BELIEVE YOUR FATHER
WAS A WATCHMAN HERE, WAS HE NOT?

133
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,583
FATHERS ARE JUST STRANGERS
THAT HAPPEN TO BE RELATED

134
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,541
TO YOU BY BLOOD.
- ( chiming )

135
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,416
- THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY
ABOUT THE MURDERED MANAGER.

136
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,750
APPARENTLY HE OFTEN WENT OUT
TO MEET WITH SOMEONE.

137
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,083
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

138
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,583
- WE HAVE TO FIND OUT

139
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,708
WHO HE WAS MEETING WITH.

140
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,750
- Man: THAT LADY DOCTOR
FROM THE CLASS IS TAKING CARE

141
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,041
OF THOSE LEGS OF YOURS, RIGHT?

142
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,041
- Onishi:
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

143
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,000
- DON'T YOU WANNA SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE UP ON THE HILL?

144
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,000
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE'RE
WASTING TIME WORRYING

145
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,333
AND FIGHTING ABOUT LITTLE PIECES
OF TERRITORY.

146
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,125
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
I DON'T WANNA GROW OLD

147
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,458
IN THE SAME WAY
AS THOSE OLD BASTARDS DID.

148
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,791
- DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
WISE TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING

149
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,291
SUCH DANGEROUS REMARKS?

150
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,708
- LOOKING BACK AT THAT
PYROMANIAC FROM THE SURFACE,

151
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,666
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
HIS IDEA ITSELF WASN'T SO BAD.

152
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,625
- SO WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

153
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,666
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

154
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,208
- NOTHING.

155
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,666
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET ANYTHING
FROM YOU FOR THE MOMENT.

156
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,000
HOWEVER,
IT WOULDN'T HURT TO KNOW

157
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,708
WHAT I CAN GET.

158
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,958
- LIKE DOC.

159
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,583
SHE'S JUST A WOMAN WHO ABANDONED
THE CLASS TO COME HERE.

160
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,541
- YES, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
I WANT TO KNOW.

161
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,541
I'LL HAVE YOUR OFFICE READY
FOR YOU VERY SHORTLY.

162
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,333
- THE MURDERED MAN WAS
APPARENTLY ILLEGALLY SELLING

163
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,208
PART OF HIS SHIPMENT
OF RAFFIA.

164
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,750
- THAT HURTS.

165
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,291
- TELL ME.
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

166
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,916
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA SEE IT.

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,416
- SEE WHAT?

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,875
- YOUR FUTURE.
I DON'T WANT THE FUTURE

169
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,791
THAT I SOUGHT FOR YOU
TO COME TRUE.

170
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,375
- MY WHAT?  TELL ME.

171
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,416
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

172
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,625
PLEASE TELL ME,
WHAT DID YOU SEE ABOUT ME?

173
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,000
IT'S MY FUTURE.
I WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT.

174
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,708
- ICHISE.
- ( gasps )

175
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,625
- ( Ran screaming )

176
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,875
- HELP.  SOMEONE.

177
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,458
- Man:
BRING HER OVER HERE.

178
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,541
SHE JUST GOT A LITTLE UPSET.
THAT'S ALL.

179
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,041
- RAN.

180
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,458
SHE SAID THAT SHE'D
SEEN MY FUTURE.

181
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,208
- THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S A SEER.

182
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,875
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TELL YOU.

183
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,208
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN RESENTING
YOUR FATHER ALL THIS TIME.

184
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,000
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

185
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,166
BUT YOU'RE NOT BEING
FAIR TO HIM.

186
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,500
IKUSEI DIDN'T BETRAY
HIS PEOPLE.

187
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,750
OTHERS CAME TO HOLD GRUDGES
AGAINST HIM

188
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,208
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING
TO PREVENT US DIGGERS

189
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,708
FROM SELLING RAFFIA
THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS.

190
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,041
IF ANYONE DID THAT,
IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS CRIME.

191
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,083
AND THAT PERSON
WOULD HAVE TO BE PUNISHED.

192
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,500
THAT'S WHY IKUSEI KEPT
HIS MOUTH SHUT.

193
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,166
KEPT IT SHUT AND DIED QUIETLY.

194
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,291
- NOW TELL ME WHO FRAMED
MY FATHER.

195
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,541
- WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO
FOR YOU TO KNOW NOW?

196
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,041
- ( grunting )

197
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,458
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW ME?

198
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,916
TELL ME.

199
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,833
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU?

200
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,375
- MY MOTHER KNEW.

201
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,083
- THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
RIGHT NOW.

202
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,958
YOU SHOULDN'T GET IDEAS
ABOUT SETTLING OLD SCORES.

203
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,416
- AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY TO ME?

204
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,583
- Onishi: WELL, I DO NOT
THINK THERE'S ANY NEED

205
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,541
FOR YOU TO BE ALARMED
AT THIS POINT.

206
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,500
HOWEVER, THERE'S NO HARM
IN BEING TOO CAUTIOUS.

207
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,250
- IT'S NOT A BAD THING
TO HAVE AMBITION.

208
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,750
IN FACT, I'D SAY IT'S
RATHER NECESSARY HERE IN LUX,

209
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,916
BUT HAVING AMBITION WITHOUT
REGARD FOR ONE'S POSITION

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,875
WOULD ONLY HURT ONESELF.

211
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,500
- I BELIEVE I AM
WELL AWARE OF THAT, DOC.

212
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,750
- OH, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

213
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,583
I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT

214
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,208
BECAUSE I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE ADJUSTING

215
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,750
TO YOUR LEGS.

216
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,083
- AT ANY RATE,

217
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,958
I'M MERELY OFFERING YOU
THIS PIECE OF ADVICE.

218
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,875
THE ORGANO IS NOT MONOLITHIC.

219
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,791
GOODBYE.

220
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,208
- IT'S TIME
FOR THE EXECUTIVE MEETING.

221
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,958
PARDON ME FOR SAYING,

222
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,458
BUT I THINK YOU NEED SOME REST.

223
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,125
PERHAPS IN MY APARTMENT.

224
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,291
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR CONCERN.

225
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,666
- Toyama: I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE UNION WHO APPROACHED HIM

226
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,166
WITH THE IDEA OF SELLING
RAFFIA ILLEGALLY.

227
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,041
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE THE CASE.

228
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,625
AND OF COURSE, IT WASN'T
THE RACAN, EITHER.

229
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,500
IT SEEMS MY WAY OF THINKING
IS TOO OLD-FASHIONED.

230
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,208
I THOUGHT IN ORDER
TO GAIN POWER,

231
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,833
ONE MUST BE
AMONG THE POWERFUL.

232
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,333
BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST
AN OBSOLETE IDEA.

233
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,208
DO YOU MISS IT HERE?

234
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,375
- ( shouting )

235
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,875
- ( cheering )

236
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,875
- GET 'EM!  GET 'EM!
GET 'EM!  GET 'EM!

237
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,250
- IT'S YOU.

238
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,083
- DO YOU HAVE BUSINESS
WITH HIM?

239
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,083
- NO, NOT AT ALL.  SORRY.

240
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,375
- WE HEARD THERE WAS A MAN
WHO RECENTLY SPENT A GOOD DEAL

241
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,041
OF MONEY DOWN HERE.
- ( laughing )

242
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,333
EVERYBODY WHO COMES HERE ALWAYS
SPENDS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY.

243
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,416
- IS THAT THE ANSWER
YOU WISH TO GIVE ME?

244
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,208
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT,
SIR.

245
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,916
PERHAPS THOSE GUYS BACK THERE.

246
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,208
THEY SEEM TO BE BETTING A LOT
MORE THESE DAYS.

247
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
- I SEE.

248
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,333
- ( laughing )

249
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,541
- YOU SEEM TO BE DOING
QUITE WELL.

250
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,500
TELL ME.  HOW CAN YOU AFFORD
TO SPEND SO MUCH?

251
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,458
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

252
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,333
- WE JUST SAVED, RIGHT?

253
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,875
USING JUST WHAT WE MANAGED
TO SCRAPE FROM OUR WAGES.

254
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,541
HEY, RELAX, HAVE A DRINK.

255
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,958
- ( cheering )

256
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,625
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

257
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,666
- HUH?

258
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,458
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
FRAMED MY FATHER.

259
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:50,958
- ( growls )

260
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,208
- ( crowd cheering )

261
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,500
- ( panting )

262
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,375
- ( theme music playing )

263
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,916
- ( singing in Japanese )
