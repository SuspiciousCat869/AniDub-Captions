1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,666
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,625
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY.

6
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,458
- THERE IS A BOY WHO LONGS
FOR THE WORLD ON THE HILL.

7
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,166
AND I WANT TO SHOW IT TO HIM.

8
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,875
I WANT TO LET HIM KNOW
WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

9
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,916
- WHAT GOOD IS THAT
GOING TO DO?

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,166
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO HURRY THIS?

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,291
- I'M NOT IN A HURRY AT ALL.

12
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,625
THIS CITY IS PICKING UP SPEED
ON ITS OWN.

13
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,416
THOUGH YOU PROBABLY
CAN'T KEEP UP.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,291
I WANNA LET THE YOUNG PEOPLE
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M THINKING.

15
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:23,000
JUST LIKE THIS ONE AND THE ONE
WE'RE GOING TO VISIT NOW.

16
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,125
- ( panting )

17
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,583
- ( screaming )

18
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,083
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,000
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- ( explosion )

20
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,125
- WE'RE NOT OPEN JUST YET.

21
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,625
- HEY, IF YOU SEE ONISHI,
YOU TELL US RIGHT AWAY.

22
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,625
GOT THAT?
- ( men running )

23
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,208
- HMM.  THE LEAST YOU COULD
HAVE DONE IS SHUT THE DOOR.

24
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,625
I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S ALL I COULD GET

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,625
IN THE LITTLE TIME I HAD.

26
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,000
- IT'S NOT MUCH.

27
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,791
- DON'T ACT LIKE A STRANGER.

28
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
I HAVE NO USE FOR IT.

29
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,541
IT'S JUST LIKE TEN YEARS AGO.

30
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,541
- HE'S NOT AT THE WOMAN'S PLACE,
EITHER.

31
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,541
- WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NO RUSH
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

32
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,416
- MR. TSUJINAKA AND MR. IZAKI
HAVE BOTH SENT US A MESSAGE.

33
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,375
THEY'D LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE
A FEW OF THEIR MEN

34
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
DURING THIS TIME OF CRISIS.

35
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,041
- TSUJINAKA AND IZAKI?

36
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,791
THOSE OLD FARTS.
THEY CAN SEE I MEAN BUSINESS.

37
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,083
AND NOW THEY'RE EAGER
TO COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

38
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,833
- SONODA AND KOHAKURA?
- NOTHING.

39
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,416
- WELL, IT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD
TO CREATE A FACTION

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,375
WITH A BUNCH OF HALFWITS,

41
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,208
ESPECIALLY IF THOSE TWO
GET IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER.

42
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,833
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

43
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,833
SINCE WE'VE GOT ENOUGH MANPOWER,

44
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,041
GO SNATCH A SLICE
OF THE RACAN'S TERRITORY.

45
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,000
- RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

46
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,708
- WE'LL DEPLOY MEN FROM
THE TSUJINAKA AND IZAKI OFFICES

47
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,041
TO THE FRONTLINE.

48
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,791
- I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

49
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,833
- I HEARD THAT YOU WERE HERE,
MR. SONODA.

50
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,458
IT'S THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY
FOR THEM TO IGNORE YOU.

51
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,125
YOUR OFFICE HAS THE GREATEST
STRENGTH AMONG US.

52
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,833
- I HEAR MIZUNO'S ACTING
LIKE HE'S IN CHARGE.

53
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,833
HOWEVER, IF IT'S BETWEEN
MIZUNO AND KEIGO--

54
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,833
- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
YOU REALLY DIDN'T LIKE KEIGO.

55
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,208
- AND WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
ON THIS, MR. KOHAKURA?

56
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,416
- IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION,

57
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,333
MIZUNO WILL TAKE
ALL THE CREDIT.

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,416
- I'M GOING TO FOLLOW
YOUR EXAMPLE--

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,083
AVOID POINTLESS CONFLICTS AND
WAIT IT OUT UNTIL EVERYONE ELSE

60
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,791
IS EXHAUSTED.
- HMM.

61
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,791
- ( door opens )
- HMM?

62
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,458
- SHINJI, SOME OF THE ORGANO
HAVE MOVED IN

63
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,916
AND STARTED PROWLING AROUND
IN OUR TERRITORY.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,458
- SHINJI.

65
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,333
- ALL WHILE WE
IN THE SALVATION UNION

66
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,500
WERE BUSY KILLING EACH OTHER.
NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

67
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,291
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON
WHY ONISHI SHOWED UP ALONE.

68
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,541
- WHAT'S STRANGE IS THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR ONISHI AS WELL.

69
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,458
- FOR HIM, TOO?

70
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
HOW MANY OF US
DO WE HAVE READY TO GO?

71
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,125
- I'D SAY ABOUT 60%, BUT SOME
OF THE OTHERS ARE STILL HURT.

72
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,458
- PERHAPS IT'S
MORE LIKE SOME

73
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,250
OF THE OTHERS
RAN OUT ON YOU.

74
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,416
- HMM?

75
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,916
JUST LIKE YOU.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- YOU TOLD ME THAT THE RACAN
WAS MADE UP OF VOLUNTEERS.

77
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,208
THEN THEY'RE ALSO FREE
TO BAIL OUT.  AM I RIGHT?

78
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,958
IN A TIME OF ABSOLUTE CHAOS,

79
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,291
A SYSTEMATICALLY GOVERNED GROUP
IS STRONGER THAN ONE THAT'S NOT.

80
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,875
IF YOU WENT HEAD TO HEAD
WITH THE ORGANO,

81
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,750
THE RESULTS WOULD BE
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

82
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,416
- YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS,

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,625
SO SHUT THE HELL UP.

84
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,166
- THEN I GUESS YOU MUST HAVE
A BETTER IDEA

85
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,958
OF HOW
WE SHOULD HANDLE THIS.

86
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,500
- MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

87
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,833
THERE'S SOMEONE.  SOMEONE
FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL

88
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,208
THAT'S VISITING THE CITY NOW.

89
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,708
- YOU DON'T MEAN--

90
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,708
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

91
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,916
- A CHANCE.
MAYBE A SMALL ONE.

92
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,375
NOW THAT THE DIG SITE
HAS BEEN VANDALIZED,

93
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,500
THEIR TRUST IN THE ORGANO
HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT SHAKEN.

94
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,208
SO THERE'S ROOM FOR US
TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT.

95
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,208
- TO WIN A THREE-SIDED WAR,

96
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,708
YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS
THE SAME WAY

97
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,208
AS YOUR OPPONENTS.

98
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,166
AS IT HAPPENS, WE'RE ON
OUR WAY TO GO TAKE A LOOK.

99
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,000
WANNA JOIN US?

100
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,125
- SHINJI, DON'T LISTEN
TO ANY OF THIS GUY'S CRAP.

101
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,791
- UNTIL I GET BACK,
DON'T MAKE ANY MOVES

102
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,083
WITHOUT MY OKAY.
YOU GOT THAT, HAL?

103
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,083
- SPLIT UP INTO GROUPS AND GO
PATROL AROUND THE BORDERS.

104
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,583
- BUT SHINJI SAID NOT TO.

105
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,250
- SHINJI JUST SAID NOT
TO ATTACK.

106
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,833
WHO THE HELL WOULDN'T BE
ON THE ALERT

107
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,083
WHEN THE ENEMY HAS STARTED
CAMPING OUT IN HIS FRONT YARD,

108
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,625
YOU FRIGGIN' MORON?!
- ( engines revving )

109
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,166
- LOOK, IT'S ONISHI.

110
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,625
- TERU.

111
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,375
- ( grunting )

112
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,166
- ( grunting )

113
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,166
- ( shouts )
- THERE WAS A STRANGER

114
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,958
WHO RECENTLY VISITED
YOUR HANGOUT.

115
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,500
- ( gagging )
- WHERE IS HE?

116
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,458
I DON'T KNOW!
- ( flesh rips )

117
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,625
- ( choking )

118
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,875
( screams )

119
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,375
- TALK.

120
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,375
SO YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

121
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,833
LET'S GET GOING.

122
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,250
- ( coughing )

123
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,208
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
GREAT FATHER?

124
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,791
- WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

125
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,750
- APPARENTLY, THE ODOR IS
DISTURBING TO THE DELEGATES,

126
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,916
SO THE CHAMBER IS BEING
RECLEANED.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,458
- I SEE.

128
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,875
- GREAT FATHER, HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO EXPLAIN

129
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
ABOUT KEIGO
TO THE DELEGATE?

130
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,791
- I AGREE THE
WAY KEIGO DEALT

131
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,583
WITH NAKAHARA'S YOUNG MEN
WAS HARSH.

132
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,083
HOWEVER, IT MAY AS WELL BE PROOF
THAT HE IS TRULY CONCERNED

133
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,208
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION'S FUTURE.
- SIR.

134
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,458
- HUH.

135
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,125
WHEN THE LIKES OF MIZUNO
ARE ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL,

136
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,416
THAT'S THE END OF THE ORGANO.

137
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,416
DO YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN
HE VISITED ME IN THE HOSPITAL?

138
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

139
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,166
- NOT EVEN ONCE.

140
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,916
BUT KEIGO COMES EVERY WEEK.

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,083
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, YOU NOTICE
SUCH THINGS WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.

142
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,625
SABU, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT ULTIMATELY MATTERS

143
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,250
IN A MAN.

144
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,833
- SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CLASS.

145
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,416
- YES, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE
OF THE CELESTIAL WORLD

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,291
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LONGING FOR.

147
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,250
BUT IN TRUTH,

148
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,083
THEY ARE NOTHING
BUT WEAK INVALIDS.

149
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,708
- HUH?

150
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,208
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

151
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,958
- THE ORGANO IS YOUR MOST
HATED ENEMY, RIGHT?

152
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,000
- ( grunting )

153
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,000
- ( gasps, grunts )

154
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,583
- WHAT THE HELL DID
YOU DO THAT FOR?

155
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,583
- JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
AND WATCH.

156
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,416
I'LL DESTROY WHAT'S KEEPING

157
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,833
YOUR POWER BOTTLED UP FOR YOU.

158
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,541
- ( gun cocks )

159
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,875
- YOU'RE ACTING SILLY.

160
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,500
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED OUT
THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND?

161
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,458
- NOW I GET IT.
YOU'RE THE ONE HOPPING AROUND

162
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,541
AND SETTING THINGS UP.

163
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,916
IT'S TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,416
THE WAY YOU SHOW UP
ONLY WHEN IT SUITS YOU.

165
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,375
LIKE TODAY.

166
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,958
THEN IT YOU WHO BLEW UP
OUR DEN, WASN'T IT?

167
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,416
- I GUESS YOU'RE EVEN SMARTER
THAN I FIRST THOUGHT.

168
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,875
- ANSWER ME.
- WHAT IF I DID?

169
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,875
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

170
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,750
- TO GIVE AN ANSWER SIMPLE
ENOUGH THAT EVEN YOU

171
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,583
CAN UNDERSTAND,
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I CAME

172
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,041
FROM A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT WORLD.

173
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,291
IF THAT MAN DIES HERE,

174
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,416
IT WILL LEAD
TO VERY EXCITING THINGS,

175
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,166
DON'T YOU THINK?

176
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,125
THAT'S WHEN YOU COME
INTO THE PICTURE.

177
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,625
- YOU'RE JUST HAVING FUN
MESSING THINGS UP.

178
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,375
BUT IN THE END,
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE DOING.

179
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,833
- AND YOU'RE DOING
THE EXACT SAME THING.

180
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,666
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW
WHAT TRULY LIES BEYOND.

181
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,083
BUT I HAD REALLY HOPED
THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

182
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,458
- IF IT WAS ME,
I'D DO BETTER.

183
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,541
I WON'T LET YOU KILL THAT MAN.
- ( gun cocks )

184
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,958
- THIS SPECTACLE IS ONE BIG
EVENT THAT I'M ORGANIZING.

185
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,416
I'M DOING THIS IN ORDER
TO CREATE A LEADER

186
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,541
WHO WILL AWAKEN YOU ALL.

187
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
AND I'M THINKING
ABOUT GIVING YOU A CHANCE

188
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,375
TO BE THE FIRST ONE
TO STEP FORWARD

189
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,250
AND TAKE THAT POSITION.

190
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,416
SO BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

191
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,250
THAT NO ONE IN THIS CITY
IS TRULY AWAKE.

192
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,916
- Man: IS IT BEYOND THE ORGANO'S
ABILITY TO GOVERN THIS PLACE?

193
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,250
- Man #2: NO, ABSOLUTELY
BY NO MEANS IS IT.

194
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,791
- Man #3: ONCE RAFFIA IS LOST,
THIS CITY IS WORTHLESS.

195
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,125
YOU WILL BE WORTHLESS AS WELL.

196
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,500
- THE DAMAGE TO THE DIG SITE
IS VERY MINOR.

197
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,375
AND THE RECOVERY IS JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

198
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,708
- Ishii: ONISHI.

199
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,041
- GET DOWN!
- ( gasps )

200
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,958
- DAMN.
- ( gun cocks )

201
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,083
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

202
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,916
- NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

203
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,458
- NO, DON'T GO.

204
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
IF YOU GO.

205
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,000
- MR. ONISHI.

206
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,583
YOU'RE DETERMINED TO GET
IN MY WAY

207
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,666
EVERY TIME, AREN'T YOU?

208
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,125
I HEARD YOU CAN HEAR THE VOICE
OF THE CITY.

209
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,500
SO TELL ME,

210
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:13,000
WHAT'S IT SAYING
ABOUT ME?

211
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,250
OH, BY THE WAY,
YOUR WIFE WAS PITIFUL.

212
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:21,250
DIED SO EASILY OR MAYBE IT
WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR HER.

213
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,458
AFTER ALL, SHE WAS
HALF-DEAD ALREADY.

214
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,000
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU, MR. ONISHI.

215
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
- ( gasps )

216
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,375
- ( coughing )

217
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,166
( gasping )

218
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,833
- MR. ONISHI,

219
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,375
IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU'D CRY
AND SCREAM AT LEAST A LITTLE

220
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,625
SINCE I CAN'T ENJOY THINGS
LIKE THIS ABOVE GROUND.

221
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,333
- YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

222
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:30,208
- ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS YOU,
MR. ONISHI.

223
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,666
ALTHOUGH MY METHODS
ARE FAR MORE ADVANCED

224
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,416
THAN YOURS APPEAR TO BE
BECAUSE I CAME FROM THE OUTSIDE,

225
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,708
I CAN SEE A LOT OF THINGS.

226
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,125
MR. ONISHI,
AS BLIND AS YOU ARE,

227
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,375
IT'S NO FUN BEING ALIVE,
IS IT?

228
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,625
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
AND JOIN YOUR WIFE?

229
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,458
- Toyama: HEY.

230
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,416
- Yoshii: GET LOST.

231
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,333
- ( grunts )

232
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,708
- ( screaming )

233
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,250
- ( panting )

234
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,291
- ( panting )

235
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,500
- ( groaning )

236
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,791
- Ran:
AFTER ALL...

237
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,708
NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

238
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,750
- Yoshii: SAKIMURA.

239
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,375
- YOSHII...

240
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,375
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

241
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,750
- ( gunshot )

242
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,500
- ( theme music playing )

243
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,250
- ( singing in Japanese )
