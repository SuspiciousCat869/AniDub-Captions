1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,833
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,500
- Man: I COULD SIMPLY CONTINUE
TO LIVE AS I HAVE,

6
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,791
BUT I'VE GROWN WEARY OF IT.

7
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,208
MOTHER AND THE OTHERS,

8
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,375
THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING
OR SAY ANYTHING.

9
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,916
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
IS IT THAT YOU WANT
MY LOVE AGAIN?

11
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,416
THEN YOU SHALL HAVE IT.

12
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,333
- WHY DID YOU DO IT?

13
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,000
AS I WATCHED YOU
MURDER THOSE MEN,

14
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,375
IT WAS AS IF YOU
HADN'T CHANGED AT ALL

15
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,375
FROM WHO YOU WERE BEFORE.

16
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,750
IF THAT'S SO, THEN HAVE
YOU GIVEN UP ON YOURSELF?

17
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,291
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

18
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,833
- ALL RIGHT.
I'VE ALREADY LECTURED TO YOU

19
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,666
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT
I SHOULD HAVE.

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,375
NOW THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

21
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,250
NO, MAYBE I SHOULD SAY
IT'S UP TO MR. ONISHI.

22
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,125
AT ANY RATE,
MY CONGRATULATIONS

23
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,500
TO THE FULL SCALE REOPENING
OF THE ONISHI OFFICE

24
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,750
AND TO YOUR BECOMING
AN OFFICIAL MEMBER.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,625
HERE IS MY LAST PIECE
OF ADVICE FOR YOU.


26
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,875
- I'VE BROUGHT YOU THE COMPLETE
REPORTS ON THE RECENT SERIES

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,083
OF DISTURBANCES.

28
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,083
THE OFFICE MANAGER REQUESTS
THAT YOU REVIEW THEM

29
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,375
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

30
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,791
- IT'S JUST THE SAME OLD THINGS.

31
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,958
- THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
NEW WRITTEN IN THESE REPORTS.

32
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:26,833
- THEN WHY BRING THEM
TO ME?

33
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,458
- JUST A FORMALITY.

34
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,208
- ( sighs )

35
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,166
- MR. IWATA ASKED ME WHY
YOU WERE GOING TO GABE

36
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,958
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

37
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,416
- I'M GOING THERE BECAUSE
IT IS A TIME LIKE THIS.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,833
TELL HIM THAT.

39
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
- I HAVE ALREADY TOLD
MR. IWATA THAT.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,458
- FINE THEN.

41
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,375
I NEED SOME TIME ALONE.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,416
- YES, SIR.

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,125
- WHOOPS.

44
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,333
- NOW WHAT?

45
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,166
- ( laughs )

46
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,333
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION
TO SIT HERE.

47
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,166
WANT SOME?

48
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,458
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE
REALLY LUCKY.

49
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,875
MAKING SO MUCH TROUBLE
LIKE THAT,

50
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,958
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED
TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN

51
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,583
AND DECLARED EXPENDABLE
BY ANY OTHER OFFICE.

52
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,041
ALTHOUGH BEING
AS OLD AS I AM,

53
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,583
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE AXE
AT ANY OTHER OFFICE.

54
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,250
SO I GUESS WE BOTH MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE

55
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,625
WHEN WE DECIDED
TO WORK FOR HIM. ( laughs )

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,416
- IF YOU CONTINUE
TO SIT THERE LIKE THAT,

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,583
YOU WILL CATCH A COLD.

58
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,333
PLEASE, FINISH UP QUICKLY, RAN.

59
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,916
LET'S GO.
YOUR SITTING HERE AND HESITATING

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
TO FULFILL YOUR DUTY
WILL NOT CHANGE A THING.

61
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,625
- ( hydraulic brakes hiss )

62
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,833
- THIS PLACE HASN'T CHANGED
AT ALL.

63
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,791
- THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
IT CAN'T CHANGE.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,833
COMPARED TO THE CITY,

65
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,166
THIS PLACE MUST BE VERY BORING.

66
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,000
- THE CITY DOESN'T CHANGE,
EITHER.

67
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,458
AND THAT PLACE
IS FAR MORE VICIOUS.

68
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,625
- I HEARD YOU RECENTLY
LOST YOUR WIFE.

69
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,958
- YES.

70
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,041
- MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.

71
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,916
- Sage: THE VOICE OF THE CITY
HAS STOPPED.

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,208
- Onishi: YES, IT'S NOT AS IF
THE VOICE OF THE CITY

73
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,166
IS SOMETHING THAT
I CAN HEAR AT WILL.

74
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,583
BUT IT HAS BEEN SILENT
TOO LONG.

75
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,208
I FEEL AS THOUGH THE CITY'S
WILL HAS RECEDED.

76
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,875
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DECIDED

77
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,708
TO MAKE THE JOURNEY HERE.

78
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,583
- BECAUSE OF AN OUTSIDER'S
INTERFERENCE,

79
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,250
THE CITY HAS FALLEN
INTO DISORDER.

80
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,166
- I AM VERY SORRY.

81
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,708
AS A RESIDENT OF GABE,
THERE IS NO ADVICE I CAN GIVE.

82
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,708
EVER SINCE OUR ANCESTORS
BUILT THE CITY LONG AGO,

83
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,791
SIMILAR INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN
PLACE COUNTLESS TIMES.

84
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,083
A CITY IS BORN.

85
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,708
EVENTUALLY IT IS DESTROYED.

86
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,041
THE DESTROYER OF THE CITY
IS IN TURNED DESTROYED

87
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,166
AND THE CITY IS REBORN AGAIN.

88
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,208
ULTIMATELY, THE CYCLE
REPEATS ITSELF.

89
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,208
THAT IS THE WAY OF THE CITY.

90
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,250
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS
HAS ALWAYS BEEN INEVITABLE?

91
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,083
- IT IS.

92
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,666
THE RESIDENTS OF GABE
HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE

93
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,000
KNOWING THIS INEVITABILITY.

94
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,166
- IS THERE ANY WAY LEFT FOR US?

95
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,750
- THERE MAY BE A WAY,

96
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,875
BUT YOU'LL NOT FIND IT
IN LUX.

97
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,500
THAT IS
IF YOU'RE STILL WILLING

98
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,750
TO RECEIVE ADVICE.

99
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,708
- HUH?

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,083
- SO YOU HAVE AN APPRECIATION
FOR THE BEAUTY OF FLOWERS.

101
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,541
SO TELL ME,
WHY ARE YOU IN THE ORGANO?

102
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

103
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,500
- YOU LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE.

104
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,291
YOU SEEM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE
ACTING AS A LONER.

105
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,958
BUT YOU LOOK REALLY OUT
OF PLACE IN AN ORGANIZATION.

106
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,625
I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU.

107
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,958
IT'S JUST ADVICE.

108
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,291
A GUY LIKE YOU DOESN'T SEEM
HE'D BE HAPPY BEING

109
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,416
PART OF THE ORGANO.

110
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
IF YOU WANNA GO,
THEN GO.

111
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,958
THE LONGER YOU STAY,

112
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,833
THE MORE DIFFICULT IT GETS
TO LEAVE.

113
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,791
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M NOT TRYING TO FIGHT YOU.

114
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,458
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST YOU.
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THIS.

115
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,291
- HMM?

116
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,083
- WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU WISH TO SEE?

117
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,666
- THIS MAN'S FUTURE.

118
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,875
AND THE FUTURE OF THE CITY
OF LUX.

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,791
- THE SEER WILL SPEAK
TO YOU NOW.

120
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,916
- YOU.

121
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,041
YOU ARE IN DANGER
OF BEING DESTROYED

122
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,583
BY WHAT YOU LOST
IN THE PAST.

123
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,916
YOUR LEGS.

124
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,458
YOUR LEGS

125
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,833
BEING DESTROYED.

126
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,208
COLLAPSING.

127
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,916
BOTH THE CITY AND HE.

128
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,375
- AND WHO?

129
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,000
- I DON'T WANNA SEE ANYMORE.

130
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,291
- Sage: A FEMALE CHILD WHO HAS
THE ABILITY TO SEE IS BORN

131
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,041
INTO EVERY GENERATION
WITHIN GABE.

132
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,666
SHE SEES THE FUTURE
OF EVERYTHING,

133
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,541
EVEN WHEN SHE DOESN'T WISH TO.

134
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,333
THAT IS A SEER.

135
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,333
WE ABIDE BY THE WORDS
OF THE SEER

136
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,750
BECAUSE THEY TELL US
OF OUR FUTURE.

137
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,000
HOWEVER, THIS GIRL HAS NOT
ACCEPTED SUCH

138
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,500
A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY YET.

139
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,625
SHE CAN'T ACCEPT THE FUTURE THAT
SHE SEES FOR OTHER PEOPLE

140
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,000
AND FOR HERSELF.

141
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,166
- FINDING ANY PERSON WHO IS
CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SUCH THINGS

142
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,125
AS FATE AND DESTINY SO EASILY
IS VERY RARE,

143
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,541
IS IT NOT?

144
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,000
- YOUR WORDS ARE NOT THE
LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF GABE,

145
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,208
BUT OF YOUR PEOPLE.

146
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,791
WHAT IS IT?

147
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,333
- HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU
THAT HE SAW A SUSPICIOUS MAN

148
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,458
LURKING INSIDE THE FACTORY
JUST BEFORE.

149
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,458
- A SUSPICIOUS MAN?

150
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,458
- AND THAT A LARGE QUANTITY
OF SMALL ARMS

151
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,458
ARE BEING MANUFACTURED
INSIDE.

152
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,458
- GREAT SAGE.

153
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,625
MAY I PLEASE BE ALLOWED
TO SEE IT?

154
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,333
WHO ARE THESE FOR?

155
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,208
YOUR SILENCE IS NOT AN ANSWER.

156
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,500
NOW I SEE.

157
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,333
- ( grunting )

158
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,250
- ( screaming )

159
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,791
- ( gunshot )

160
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,333
- Man: I'M VERY SORRY, SIR.

161
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,875
I HAD NO TIME TO THINK.

162
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,916
- NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT.
AFTER ALL, YOU DID SAVE HIM.

163
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,125
- Sage:
DOES THIS MEAN THAT GABE

164
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,500
AND THE UNION ARE
SOMEHOW CONNECTED?

165
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,250
- Onishi: THE QUESTION IS,

166
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,833
WHO NEEDS SUCH A LARGE QUANTITY
OF WEAPONS?

167
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,541
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT
THE UNION COULD AFFORD IT.

168
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,000
THE SAME GOES WITH THE RACAN.

169
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,291
IT'S ALSO UNLIKELY THAT
GABE ITSELF IS IN NEED OF THEM.

170
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,916
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE ME?

171
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,000
- GO ASK THEM DIRECTLY.

172
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,000
- TELL ME, WHY DO YOU
EVEN BOTHER WITH ME?

173
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,666
- BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE
OF MY MEN NOW.

174
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,750
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO ACT IN SUCH
A RECKLESS MANNER ANYMORE.

175
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,791
AND I OWE YOU.

176
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,333
- BUT STILL,

177
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,791
THAT MUST BE A PAIN.

178
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,958
- IT'S A MATTER OF PROTOCOL.

179
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,791
AS LONG AS YOU'RE A MEMBER
OF THE ORGANO,

180
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,000
EVERYTHING YOU DO REFLECTS
UPON THE ORGANIZATION.

181
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,291
I WILL NOT HAVE YOU GO AROUND
KILLING PEOPLE

182
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

183
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,875
EVEN IF IT IS TO AVENGE
YOUR FATHER'S DEATH.

184
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,625
QUIT ACTING EMOTIONALLY.

185
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,875
YOU MUST LEARN
TO START USING YOUR HEAD.

186
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,791
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR LEGS THEN?

187
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,916
YOU LOST THEM BECAUSE YOU WERE
BEING RECKLESS, WEREN'T YOU?

188
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,166
- ( sighs )

189
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,166
I SOLD THEM.

190
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,541
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

191
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,791
WHEN I WAS A KID,
THERE WAS A BOY

192
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,583
WHO'D BEEN BORN
WITHOUT NORMAL LEGS,

193
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,625
AND THEY'D MADE AN OFFER

194
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,375
TO BUY LEGS FOR HIM
FROM A CHILD OF A SIMILAR AGE.

195
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:20,208
IT FELT ALMOST LIKE I WAS BEING
PRESSURED INTO DOING IT,

196
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,875
BUT I ALONE MADE THE DECISION.

197
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,458
STILL, I WAS JUST A KID.

198
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,916
I WAS TOO NAIVE.

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,916
I SOLD MY LEGS
TO PAY FOR MY NAIVETE.

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,583
BUT NOW I THINK IT WAS
FOR THE BEST.

201
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,750
WITHOUT THE LEGS I HAVE,
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE

202
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,041
TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CITY,

203
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,708
AND I WOULD NOT BE WHO I AM.

204
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,750
THESE ARE NOT JUST A SUBSTITUTE
FOR MY LEGS.

205
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750
THESE ARE MY LEGS.

206
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,750
YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR LIMBS
TRULY YOUR OWN AS WELL.

207
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,041
DWELLING ON THE PAST
ISN'T HEALTHY.

208
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,791
- PLEASE GET OUT,
BOTH OF YOU.

209
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,958
- WHY?

210
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,875
- THAT UNION MAN
WHO WAS SNEAKING AROUND

211
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,250
WAS AN UNEXPECTED ELEMENT.

212
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,708
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU KILLED HIM
ON PURPOSE?

213
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,708
- I DID.
- WHO DID YOU SELL OUT TO?

214
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,166
- WELL, IF I COULD
TELL YOU THAT,

215
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,250
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO KILL YOU
LIKE THIS.

216
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,666
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE MORE SECURE GROUP

217
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,000
TO BE IN THAN THE ORGANO.

218
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,833
I'M NOT SO YOUNG ANYMORE.

219
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,625
I HAVE NO FUTURE CLINGING
TO THE ORGANIZATION.

220
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,458
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, IT
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TURNING POINT.

221
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,500
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

222
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,500
I NEVER BELIEVED IN LOYALTY.

223
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,500
- BECAUSE YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE,
I NEVER DISLIKED YOU.

224
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,333
- ( gun cocks )
- AND YOU, BOY, REMEMBER.

225
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,833
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

226
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,000
LEAVE THE ORGANO
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

227
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,833
MR. ONISHI,

228
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,333
IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

229
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,500
- ( grunts )

230
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,833
- OH!
- TALK.

231
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,500
TELL ME WHO BOUGHT YOU OFF.

232
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,500
- ( grunts )

233
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,541
- WHO IS THE ONE
WHO BOUGHT YOU OFF?

234
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,541
HUH?

235
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,250
- MR. ONISHI, IT'S YOUR
CONTINUAL WEAKNESS

236
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,583
THAT COULDN'T BRING YOURSELF
TO KILL ME.

237
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,666
- TELL ME WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT.

238
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,708
- Sage: UNFORTUNATELY,
IT IS NOT YET TIME,

239
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,708
FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

240
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:27,291
MR. ONISHI, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

241
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,583
BUT I WILL TELL
YOU ONE THING NOW.

242
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,333
WE ABIDE BY NOTHING OTHER
THAN THE WORDS OF THE SEER.

243
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,708
AND NO ONE ELSE.

244
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,041
- RAN.

245
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,000
- THAT IS EVERYTHING THAT
WE CAN TELL YOU FOR NOW.

246
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:48,083
LEAVE.  YOUR COMPANIONS
ARE WAITING AT THE STATION.

247
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,291
- RAN.

248
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,375
RAN.
- THE FUTURE.

249
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,208
THE ONE THAT I SAW FOR YOU,

250
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,041
IN THE END,

251
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,708
YOU WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING.

252
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,083
YOU WILL HURT MANY PEOPLE.

253
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,166
YOU WILL BE ALL ALONE

254
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,750
IN THE END.

255
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,708
- ( sighing )

256
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,833
NEVER.
I WON'T DO IT.

257
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,666
I CAN'T.  I CAN'T.

258
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,291
I'LL NEVER END UP
BEING LIKE THAT.

259
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,541
- I WISH.

260
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,000
I WISH THAT COULD BE SO.

261
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,541
BUT THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN

262
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,375
ARE BEGINNING TO COME TRUE.

263
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,041
- WAIT, RAN.

264
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,875
RAN!

265
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,375
RAN!

266
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,750
- Man: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

267
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,875
PLEASE WATCH ME,

268
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,833
MY DEAR SISTER.

269
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,375
- ( theme music playing )

270
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,750
- ( singing in Japanese )
