1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,750
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,625
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,625
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,666
- ( footsteps )

6
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,791
- ( clanging )

7
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,583
- ( gunfire )

8
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,250
- DAMN IT.
( grunts )

9
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,750
( grunts )

10
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,375
- ( shouts )
- ( grunts )

11
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,750
- ( gasps )

12
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,125
- YOSHII.

13
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,500
IS THIS WHAT YOU
WANTED TO DO?

14
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,041
( grunts )

15
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,125
- ( clanging )

16
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,791
- ( piano playing )

17
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,375
- Doc:
THIS CITY IS FINISHED.

18
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,500
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE
TURNED INTO A FREAK LIKE THEM.

19
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,166
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN.

20
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE A HERO.

21
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,666
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME,
AREN'T YOU?

22
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,875
YOU CAN JUST LEAVE ME HERE.

23
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,875
- I MADE A PROMISE
TO ONISHI.

24
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,500
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE,

25
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,625
FULFILLING
YOUR DUTY OR NOT?

26
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,541
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 
IF HE'S STILL ALIVE.

27
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,541
- KEIGO ONISHI.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

28
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,416
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU, SEE?

29
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
( chuckles )

30
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,583
- ( beeping )

31
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,833
- IT SEEMS THAT THEY'RE
NOT ATTACKING

32
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,291
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

33
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,125
LET'S GO.

34
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,500
- ( beeping continues )

35
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,958
- HEY, HAL?

36
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,583
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A SECOND.

37
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,125
WITH A BODY LIKE THAT, 
HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE

38
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,666
TO MAKE LOVE
TO A WOMAN? 

39
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,666
- ( match lights )

40
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,500
- ( exhales )

41
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,041
- SHINJI?

42
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,041
WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW?

43
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,916
- THERE'S SOMETHING 
I'VE STILL GOTTA DO.

44
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,791
- ( humming )

45
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,750
- I GAVE AN ORDER TO THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE REMAINING HERE.

46
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,416
I TRUST YOU WILL SUFFER
NO INCONVENIENCE.

47
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,083
- WHY IS IT INEVITABLE
THAT YOU MUST GO?

48
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,583
THIS PLACE BELONGS TO
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE. 

49
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,625
- THAT MAY BE TRUE,

50
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,000
BUT WE CAN NO LONGER
AFFORD TO LOSE THE SEER.

51
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,458
- ( clanging )

52
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,125
- Kohakura: MR. KANO,

53
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,458
MY ARM HAS SUDDENLY
BECOME NUMB,

54
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
AND I HAVE
A SPLITTING HEADACHE.

55
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,583
- Kano: THAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU ARE IN A WEAKENED

56
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,791
PHYSICAL CONDITION.

57
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,666
- I NEED A TREATMENT.

58
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,791
- IF GANGRENE IS ALREADY
SET INTO YOUR BRAIN,

59
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,125
THEN IT'S HOPELESS.

60
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,416
- Kohakura:
THAT CAN'T BE.

61
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,083
- HAVE YOU FOUND 
KEIGO ONISHI YET?

62
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,750
- I'M SORRY,
BUT WE HAVEN'T.

63
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,458
- AS LONG AS HE'S ALIVE,

64
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,125
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO UNITE
ALL THE SCATTERED FORCES.

65
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,083
IT WILL BE TROUBLESOME
IF THE IGNORANT MASSES

66
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,333
START SUPPORTING HIM.

67
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,791
- I MIGHT HAVE A PLAN, SIR.

68
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,500
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT 
THE SEER IS IN THE CITY.

69
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,791
- THE SEER?

70
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,333
SHE HAS THE POWER
TO BRING TOGETHER

71
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,666
THE IGNORANT MASSES.

72
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,500
- DO YOU WANT TO 
KNOW YOUR FUTURE,

73
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,416
MR. KOHAKURA?

74
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,416
- ( gasps )
YES, I DO. 

75
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,041
- Kano: RUBBISH.

76
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,416
- Doc: THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO MEET ONISHI.

77
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
THE ORGANO
IS FINISHED NOW.

78
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,250
AND SO IS HE.

79
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,500
GIVE IT UP.

80
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:12,250
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH
TO FULFILL YOUR DUTY.

81
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,541
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
THIS WORLD FROM THE BEGINNING.

82
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,750
IF YOU JUST
TELL YOURSELF THAT,

83
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,750
IT WILL BE EASIER
TO LEAVE.

84
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,208
- BUT STILL...

85
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,875
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

86
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,708
- ( chuckles )

87
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,208
THE BOTH OF YOU
ARE COMPLETE IDIOTS.

88
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,166
YOU AND ONISHI.

89
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,875
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TRUST
IS WHAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU.

90
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,541
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN
EXPRESS ANYTHING

91
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,500
IS THROUGH THE ANGER
YOU HAVE AT THE MOMENT.

92
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,416
I WANT YOU TO
JUST HOLD ME.

93
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,250
I'M FEELING AFRAID,

94
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,458
SO PLEASE?

95
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,458
HARDER.

96
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,500
MORE.

97
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,250
( sighs )

98
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,166
THIS IS HOW MY WORK
SHOULD BE USED.

99
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,250
LET'S LEAVE THIS CITY.

100
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,791
IF WE GO TO GABE

101
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,458
WE MIGHT STILL BE ABLE
TO FIND A PLACE TO SURVIVE.

102
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,000
- AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

103
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,958
( gasps )

104
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,000
- MR. ONISHI?

105
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,833
- JUST GO.

106
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:22,916
GET DOWN!

107
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,208
- ( door slams )

108
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,208
- I'M SORRY.

109
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,041
- ( electricity humming )

110
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,791
- SO WHERE'S YOUR
PRETTY LITTLE SECRETARY?

111
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,458
I GET IT.

112
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,791
SO YOU WERE THINKING 
THE SAME THING AS ME.

113
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,416
- ( door opens )

114
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,166
- Onishi: WHOEVER LET US IN
IS TELLING US TO PROCEED.

115
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,166
- Shinji: THERE'S NOTHING
SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PLACE.

116
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,375
- Grandmother #3: ARE WE HAVING
RAIN, THUNDER, OR WIND NOW?

117
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,041
- Grandmother #2: WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HERE.

118
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,166
- Grandmother #3: DID THEY WIN
AND ALSO LOSE THE WAR?

119
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,833
- Grandmother #1: SHH.
THE GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED.

120
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,500
- Grandmother #2:
YOU'VE COME TO SEE US.

121
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,166
- Grandmother #3: FINALLY.

122
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,250
- SO I GUESS IT WAS YOU.

123
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,875
- IT SEEMS YOU WERE
LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION.

124
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,208
- THAT'S EAVESDROPPING.

125
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,666
- THOSE LEGS MADE YOU DO IT.

126
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,875
- MY LEGS?

127
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,875
- Grandmother #1: 
KANO HAS CHANGED.

128
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,875
HE'S BECOME A BIGGER FOOL.

129
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,875
- Grandmother #2:
ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR SORDID LEGS.

130
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,750
- Grandmother #1: BUT WE
MADE SURE TO PROMPTLY DUMP

131
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,541
THOSE LEGS OF YOURS.

132
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,875
- Grandmother #3: KANO HAD
NO NEED OF SUCH THINGS

133
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,208
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

134
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,250
- KANO?

135
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,375
- Grandmother #2:
YOU MUST STOP KANO'S GAME.

136
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,250
- Grandmother #1:
KANO'S GAME HAS GONE TOO FAR.

137
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,750
- Grandmother #3:
THE ONLY THING KANO WANTS

138
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,291
IS TO HAVE A BIGGER PLAYGROUND.

139
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
- Shinji:
A BIGGER PLAYGROUND?

140
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,250
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

141
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,916
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
THE CLASS UNIFYING

142
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,916
AND RECONSTRUCTING
THE CITY.

143
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,916
- Grandmother #1:
HE'S BEING SELFISH.

144
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,416
HE JUST WANTS TO GO
BACK TO THE WORLD ABOVE

145
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,125
AS SOON AS HE CAN.

146
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,875
- Grandmother #2: AND DO
WHATEVER HE LIKES THERE.

147
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,000
- Grandmother #3: YOU PEOPLE ARE
NOTHING MORE THAN HIS PAWNS.

148
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,916
- Grandmother #1: YOU MUST
NOTIFY THE WORLD ABOVE.

149
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,916
- Grandmother #2:
YOU MUST SOUND THE ALARM.

150
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,916
- Grandmother #3:
YOUR GUIDE IS WAITING FOR YOU.

151
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,541
- ( Shinji chuckles )

152
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,625
- Onishi: SO I GUESS
YOSHII WAS RIGHT.

153
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,833
I WAS TOO IGNORANT.

154
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,166
IMAGINE THAT.

155
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,250
I WAS DESPERATE TRYING
TO GET TO THIS PLACE

156
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,291
ALL THESE YEARS.

157
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,291
- TOO BAD YOU LOST
YOUR LEGS FOR NOTHING.

158
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,958
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

159
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,083
ARE YOU REALLY GOING?

160
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,291
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT I'M NOT GOING.

161
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,208
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
WHO KILLS THIS KANO GUY.

162
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,875
HUH?

163
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,375
- HMM?

164
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,958
- Shinji: I KNOW YOU.

165
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,833
I SAW YOU HANGING
AROUND WITH YOSHII.

166
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:52,875
- Kano: SO THEY SENT
ONISHI ABOVE GROUND.

167
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,166
I SUPPOSE THEY THINK 
THEY'VE OUTWITTED ME.

168
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,208
THEY GAVE BIRTH TO FATHER,

169
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,875
MATED WITH HIM,

170
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,333
AND GAVE BIRTH TO ME.

171
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,875
I WISH I HAD TORN
THEIR WOMBS APART

172
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,583
WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT.

173
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,666
- HUH?

174
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,583
- Doc: SO THAT'S THE SEER.

175
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,708
( gasps )
THE TRAIN IS HERE.

176
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,875
( panting )

177
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,666
- ( gasps )

178
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,708
- HEY.

179
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,416
- Doc: I HAD A FEELING
IT WOULD BE SOMEWHERE WARM.

180
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,916
THE PLACE THAT PEOPLE
OF THE CLASS WOULD BE

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,250
ALLOWED TO
GO UP TO ONE DAY

182
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,250
IN THE FAR FUTURE.

183
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,750
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
THAT SUCH A PLACE

184
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,250
ACTUALLY EXISTS.

185
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,291
- Onishi:
DOC, GO ABOVE GROUND FOR ME,

186
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,375
AND TELL THEM ABOUT THE
HORRIBLE STATE OF THIS CITY

187
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,208
AND ABOUT KANO'S PLANS.

188
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,958
- Shinji: LOOKS LIKE THAT GUY
WANTS TO BE YOUR GUIDE.

189
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,125
- ICHISE, I WANT YOU 
TO GO ALONG WITH HER.

190
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,125
I SUPPOSE THE PEOPLE ABOVE
WILL LISTEN TO DOC.

191
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,125
THAT IS, IF THEY'LL
LISTEN TO ANYONE.

192
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,791
BUT STILL...

193
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,625
IT'S THE PLACE THAT
DROVE YOSHII DOWN HERE

194
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,791
TO INCITE ALL THIS CHAOS.

195
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
ICHISE,

196
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,416
WE'VE ALL BEEN TRAPPED
IN A SMALL WORLD.

197
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,458
NOW WE'VE COME TO THIS.

198
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,125
BUT YOU'RE STILL YOUNG.

199
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,708
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO
AND SEE MANY THINGS.

200
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,708
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.
I'M NOT--

201
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,708
- ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THAT GIRL? 

202
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,166
THE ONE WHO'S GATHERING
PEOPLE AT THE OBELISK? 

203
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,833
- YOU MEAN THE SEER?

204
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,500
- Doc: WITH ALL THOSE
PEOPLE AROUND HER,

205
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,666
THOSE FREAKS WON'T BE
ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. 

206
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,166
- ICHISE, AS OF NOW

207
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,291
YOU NO LONGER
OWE ME ANYTHING.

208
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,166
- ( panting )

209
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,500
- ( theme music playing )

210
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,916
- ( singing in Japanese )
