1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,916
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,375
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,333
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
- Doc: IT'S OPEN.

6
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,666
- Man on radio:
THE BIRD SINGS ON THE FINGER.

7
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,166
I REPEAT,
THE BIRD SINGS ON THE FINGER.

8
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,541
I REPEAT,
THE BIRD SINGS ON THE FINGER.

9
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,125
I REPEAT,
THE BIRD SINGS ON THE FINGER.

10
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,083
I REPEAT...

11
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,541
- FOR NO REASON
I ALWAYS HAD THIS THOUGHT.

12
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,041
I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT 
THE PEOPLE OF THE CLASS

13
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,208
COULD COME BACK ABOVE GROUND
IF WE WANTED TO.

14
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,333
BECAUSE WE'RE THE PEOPLE

15
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,083
WHO SHOULD BE LIVING
ABOVE GROUND BY RIGHT.

16
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,375
- MY JOB TO TAKE YOU HERE.

17
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,375
I DID IT.
I'M LEAVING.

18
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,708
- I THOUGHT...

19
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,125
IN MY INFINITE WISDOM,

20
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,375
THAT TEXHNOLYZATION
WAS THE VERY MEANS NEEDED

21
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,833
FOR MANKIND TO EVOLVE 
INTO THE NEXT SPECIES.

22
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,750
BUT NOW...

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,833
WHILE WE WERE
STRUGGLING DESPERATELY

24
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,333
TO SURVIVE UNDERGROUND,

25
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,458
THE PEOPLE ABOVE GROUND HAD
LONG GIVEN UP ON SURVIVING.

26
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,833
- THIS ENTIRE PLACE,
IT'S ONLY FOR DEAD PEOPLE.

27
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,041
- HUH?

28
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,083
- THERE'S NO ONE STILL
ALIVE IN THIS PLACE.

29
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,041
- THEY JUST SIT COMFORTABLY

30
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,250
AND WAIT FOR
THE HUMAN SPECIES

31
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,166
TO REACH ITS FINAL END.

32
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,750
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,125
THIS IS HADES.

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,125
- THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING BACK.

35
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,625
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DOC?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,875
- I'M ALREADY
ONE OF THE DEAD.

37
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
- ( door closes )

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,708
- ( elevator dings )

39
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,083
- ( sighs )

40
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,666
- ( monitor beeps )

41
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,166
- Yoshii: MR. SAKIMURA?
- HUH?

42
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,958
- I HEARD YOU'RE GOING
DEEP UNDERGROUND.

43
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,208
I REALLY WISH I WAS.

44
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,583
I'VE BEEN APPLYING FOR IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

45
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,125
- YOSHII...

46
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,583
- I'LL GET THERE ONE DAY.
I'M SURE.

47
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,375
COME ON, MR. SAKIMURA,

48
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,083
WHY DIDN'T YOU DECLINE?

49
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,750
I THOUGHT NOBODY BUT ME
WOULD WANT TO GO UNDERGROUND.

50
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,916
- INITIALLY,
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,583
BUT I THOUGHT--

52
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,583
- ( alarm beeps )
- HUH?

53
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,708
- Man on radio: 38 39, 40.

54
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,250
I REPEAT TWICE,

55
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,583
38, 39, 40.

56
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,375
I REPEAT TWICE,

57
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,916
38, 39, 40.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
I REPEAT TWICE...

59
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,291
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

60
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,916
THE WIDOW'S VEIL

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,833
IS IN THE SUN'S LUNCH.

62
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,833
I REPEAT,
THE WIDOW'S VEIL...

63
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,583
- LOOK,
THAT'S THE CLEAREST GHOST

64
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,875
I'VE EVER SEEN.

65
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,875
- YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES
WHO ARE GHOSTS.

66
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,625
- THIS IS A SURPRISE.

67
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,291
YOU'RE ALIVE.

68
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

69
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,041
- WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

70
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,041
IF SITTING HERE
DAY AFTER DAY

71
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,916
ONLY REMINISCING
ABOUT THE PAST

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,416
CAN BE CALLED LIVING,
THEN I GUESS WE ARE. 

73
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,833
- THAT IS IF WE WHO ARE
BARELY HOLDING ONTO OUR SANITY

74
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,833
BY HAVING OUR GHOSTS
WALK AROUND

75
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,791
CAN BE CALLED LIVE HUMANS.

76
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
- Ichise: YOU WANNA DIE NOW?

77
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,875
- OH, MR. SAKIMURA.

78
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,958
YOU LOOK LIKE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT MAN.

79
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,708
IT SEEMS THAT YOU'VE
BECOME SO MUSCULAR. 

80
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,708
- I WAS DOING PHYSICAL LABOR.

81
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,541
DOWN BELOW.

82
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,708
- HOW LUCKY FOR YOU.
WHAT KIND OF LABOR? 

83
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,041
- TRAIN OPERATOR MOSTLY.

84
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,708
- I SEE.
A TRAIN OPERATOR.

85
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,500
- UH, SIR?

86
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,000
- YES?

87
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,208
- IT SEEMS A TRAIN
IS COMING UP FROM LUX,

88
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
THE UNDERGROUND CITY.

89
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,250
- DO YOU KNOW WHO'S COMING?

90
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,000
- PROBABLY.

91
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,333
A FULLY-ARMED
TEXHNOLYZED FORCE.

92
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,708
- OH?  WHAT ARE THEY
COMING HERE FOR?

93
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,708
- I THINK THEY'RE COMING
TO THE SURFACE WORLD

94
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,208
AS THE VANGUARD OF
THEIR ATTACK AGAINST US.

95
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,541
- OH, I UNDERSTAND NOW.

96
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,583
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE REPORT, MR. SAKIMURA.

97
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,041
- ( gasps )

98
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,958
- WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

99
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,416
- NO, SIR.

100
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,208
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

101
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,125
- ICHISE.

102
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,750
- AND WHAT IS YOUR
LAST NAME, YOUNG MAN?

103
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,041
- DON'T HAVE ONE.

104
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,458
- OHH.

105
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,791
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

106
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,291
EVERY HUMAN BEING
IS ON HIS OWN.

107
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,750
NO POINT BEING BOUND
BY A NAME.

108
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,125
I SUPPOSE THAT YOUR PARENTS
MUST BE A GREAT DEAL

109
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,333
YOUNGER THAN ME

110
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,375
TO HAVE SUCH
A YOUNG SON AS YOU.

111
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,458
- THEY'RE LONG GONE.

112
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,125
BOTH MY MOTHER AND FATHER.

113
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,958
- YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WAIT MUCH LONGER.

114
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,958
BE PATIENT.

115
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,958
( grunts )

116
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
I'LL MAKE SOME COFFEE.

117
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,791
- YOU CAN'T NOW, BUT...

118
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,166
- HMM?  WHAT'S THAT?

119
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,000
- YOU SHOULD COME
TO LUX SOME DAY. 

120
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,250
THE PEOPLE OF LUX
ARE AT LEAST ALIVE.

121
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,875
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

122
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,375
- ( sighs )

123
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,500
THANK YOU.

124
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,833
I'M GOING NOW.

125
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,166
- OH, YOU ARE?

126
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,500
ICHISE?

127
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,916
I JUST THOUGHT...

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,125
IF YOU WOULD
STAY HERE FOREVER...

129
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,833
IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT.

130
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,208
THE EMPTY DREAM
OF A GHOST.

131
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,083
- ( door opens )

132
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,541
( door closes )

133
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,083
- TAKE ME TO
THE TRAIN STATION.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,541
- ( beeping )

135
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,916
- GOOD-BYE, LUX.

136
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,625
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

137
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,708
NO, THEY CAN'T.

138
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,375
( murmurs )

139
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,000
- ( panting )

140
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,375
- ( gunfire )

141
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,541
( gasps )

142
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,041
- ( sighs )

143
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,541
THE SKY IS HIGH.

144
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,125
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S
ABOUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.

145
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,666
YOU KNOW,
I JUST GOT HERE.

146
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,333
YOU COULD GIVE ME A MOMENT
OR TWO TO REST.

147
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,666
- THEN STAY.

148
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,708
I'M GOING BACK.

149
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,666
- GO BACK AND THEN DO WHAT?

150
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,708
IS THERE SOMEONE
WAITING FOR YOU?

151
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,375
( chuckles )

152
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,541
THAT SEER GIRL
FROM GABE PERHAPS.

153
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,041
SHE'S CAPTURED BY NOW.

154
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,250
MR. KANO WANTED HER.

155
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,708
- ( groans )

156
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,916
- ( chuckles )

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,375
MAYBE ONISHI?

158
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,125
I THOUGHT HE WAS
A LITTLE SMARTER

159
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,708
THAN HE ACTUALLY WAS.

160
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,708
IT SEEMS HE CRAWLED
UNDER THE OBELISK. 

161
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,125
I'M SURE HE MUST
BE DEAD BY NOW. 

162
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,208
- ( gunshots )

163
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,083
- NOW THAT THE TUNNEL
IS DESTROYED,

164
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,250
KANO WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEND HIS SOLDIERS

165
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,041
UP HERE FOR SOME TIME.

166
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,916
YOU AND I CAN'T
GO BACK EITHER.

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,958
- ( explosion )

168
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,375
- ( beeping )

169
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,125
- I HAVE NO HATRED
TOWARD YOU.

170
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,416
IN FACT,
I RATHER LIKE YOU.

171
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,916
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO
KILL YOU MYSELF.

172
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,250
- I SEE.

173
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,458
SAME GOES FOR ME.

174
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,000
- ( grunts )

175
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,666
- ( grunts )

176
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,416
- ( gasps )

177
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,708
- Doc on radio: I BELIEVE
WHAT ATTRACTED ME

178
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,833
TO ICHISE WAS HIS EYES.

179
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,166
THEY WERE SPECIAL.

180
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,166
HIS EYES ARE THE EYES
OF OUR PARENTS' PARENTS.

181
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,166
THE EYES THAT THE FIRST
IMMIGRANTS TO LUX ALL HAD.

182
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,333
REPRODUCTION.

183
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,500
THAT'S THE REASON THEY WERE

184
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,583
DRIVEN UNDERGROUND 
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

185
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,458
I NEVER HAD ENOUGH
COURAGE TO GO THROUGH

186
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
THE PROPER TESTING,

187
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,000
BUT I KNEW FOR SURE
FROM EARLY ON

188
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,166
THAT I LIKED THE ABILITY
TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING.

189
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,916
IN A SENSE,

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,166
ICHISE WAS CARRYING
MY CHILD.

191
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,583
I WAS HOPING TO SEE
HOW MUCH POWER

192
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,708
ICHISE'S TEXHNOLYZED LIMBS
WOULD GAIN

193
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,958
FROM THE ADDITION
OF MY CELLS

194
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,583
CULTIVATING HIS BIO-CIRCUIT.

195
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,458
BUT THAT'S NO LONGER
POSSIBLE NOW.

196
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,250
- ( panting )

197
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,416
- I'M HAVING SUCH
A WONDERFUL TIME.

198
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,833
I FEEL SO FORTUNATE

199
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,875
THAT WE CAN TRY TO
KILL EACH OTHER LIKE THIS.

200
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,958
- ( footsteps approaching )

201
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:18,958
- ( grunts )

202
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,958
- ( sighs )

203
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,958
( grunts )

204
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,916
- ( grunts )

205
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,166
- I THANK YOU, BROTHER.

206
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,750
- I'M VERY GLAD
THAT I CAME.

207
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,291
- SO IT'S YOU.

208
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,458
- WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD

209
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,166
THAT THE REASON YOUR PEOPLE
WERE ISOLATED UNDERGROUND

210
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,333
WAS TO PROTECT US,
THE THEONORMAL.

211
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
BUT NOW I SUSPECT
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

212
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,416
ANOTHER REASON THAT
WASN'T TOLD TO US. 

213
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,083
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE THEONORMAL 

214
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,833
ARE ON THE VERGE
OF EXTINCTION AS A SPECIES.

215
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,500
DESPITE OUR UPMOST EFFORTS
TO ELIMINATE DANGEROUS ELEMENTS,

216
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,666
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DELAY
OR ANNIHILATION.

217
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,208
NO MIRACLE HAPPENED

218
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,875
THAT WOULD BRING US INTO
THE NEXT STEP OF EVOLUTION.

219
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
I'M STARTING TO
BELIEVE THAT MAYBE

220
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,000
OUR PARENTS' PARENTS GENERATION

221
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,333
HAD PINNED ALL THEIR
HOPES FOR SURVIVAL

222
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,666
UPON YOUR PEOPLE.

223
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,666
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN MY SPECULATION.

224
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
- HOW SELFISH.

225
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,000
OF BOTH YOU AND
YOUR PARENTS' PARENTS.

226
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,375
- WE DESTROYED THE STAIRCASE
AND THE AIRSHAFT.

227
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,041
THE PEOPLE UNDERGROUND WON'T
BE ABLE TO COME UP HERE ANYMORE.

228
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,375
NEITHER WILL YOU.

229
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,041
I KNOW IT'S
A SELFISH REQUEST,

230
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,708
BUT I'D LIKE YOU
TO STAY HERE.

231
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,083
- THE STAIRCASE IS DESTROYED,

232
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,250
BUT THE AIRSHAFT ITSELF
ISN'T BLOCKED.

233
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,625
- THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

234
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,666
- ( breathing heavily )

235
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,750
( gasps )

236
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,500
IT'S YOU.

237
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,416
I WANT--

238
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,416
I MEAN,
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

239
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,125
FOR A LONG TIME...

240
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,791
IT WAS EVER SINCE
MOTHER HAD DIED. 

241
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,458
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS YOU WHO KILLED HER.

242
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE CORRUPTED
BY WORTHLESS THINGS LIKE MONEY.

243
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,125
I NEVER THOUGHT...

244
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,666
I NEVER EVEN IMAGINED THAT
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN FRAMED

245
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,500
BY SOME FILTHY BASTARDS.

246
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,458
I'M VERY SORRY...

247
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,666
FATHER.

248
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,458
- ( theme music playing )

249
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,125
- ( singing in Japanese )
