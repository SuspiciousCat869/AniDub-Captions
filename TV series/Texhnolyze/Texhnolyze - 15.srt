1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,333
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,833
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,208
- ( cars approaching )

6
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,125
- HUH?
THEY'RE COMING NOW.

7
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,166
- ( no audio )

8
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,333
- HEY, SINCE WHEN DID TOYAMA
BECOME TSUJINAKA'S BOY?

9
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,375
- MUST HAVE BEEN RECENTLY.

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,625
- THAT'S A SURPRISE.

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,541
HE WAS A FAVORITE OF KOHAKURA,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,583
- MAYBE HE RECEIVED
TOO MUCH FAVOR.

13
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,208
- ( screaming )

14
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,291
- ( gasping )

15
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,125
- MR. KOHAKURA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,916
- KOHAKURA, ARE YOU HURT?

17
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,333
- YEAH, BUT IT JUST GRAZED ME.

18
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,166
- HUH?  I KNOW HIM.

19
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
HE'S ONE OF MR. TSUJINAKA'S.

20
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,375
- HEY, SHINJI, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE LOST CONTACT

21
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,666
WITH TAKA THIS TIME.

22
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,916
- HE'S THE FOURTH ONE
IN TWO WEEKS.

23
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THEY PROBABLY JUST
SWITCHED SIDES

24
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,416
OVER TO THE ORGANO OR UNION,

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,333
BUT I HEARD THERE'S
A STRANGE STORY BEHIND IT.

26
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,916
THE LAST GUY WHO SAID THEY SAW
TAKA WAS YUKIO.

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
AND YUKIO TOLD ME TWO NIGHTS
AGO

28
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,916
TAKA WAS WALKING UP EAST 10TH
WITH A HUGE PALE WHITE GUY

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,708
WHO LOOKED LIKE A GHOST.

30
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,625
- EVERYTHING'S MISSING.

31
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,500
- HUH?  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?  WHAT'S MISSING?

32
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,958
- SOME MEMBERS OF THE ORGANO
AND THE UNION

33
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,708
HAVE DISAPPEARED, TOO.
- HEY, SHINJI!

34
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,833
- SHINJI.

35
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,041
HEY, WAIT.  SHOULDN'T--

36
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,291
OH!

37
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,333
- Tsujinaka:
DAMN THAT KAWAMATA.

38
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,958
THANKS TO HIM,
WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

39
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,333
- HOWEVER...

40
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,875
HE SEEMED TO BE PRETTY MUCH
IN A WEAKENED CONDITION.

41
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,166
THERE'S NO WAY TO BE SURE
HE WAS AIMING FOR SONODA OR NOT.

42
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,875
- WE CAN'T GET OFF
WITH AN EXCUSE LIKE THAT.

43
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,875
WHEN DID WE FIRST LOSE CONTACT
WITH KAWAMATA?

44
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,000
- IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

45
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,458
- AND DID HE STILL HAVE
HIS ARM BACK THEN?

46
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,583
- YES, BUT HE HAD BEEN
BEHAVING STRANGELY

47
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,083
EVEN BEFORE THAT,

48
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,500
SAYING THAT HE'D SEEN A GHOST.

49
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, A GHOST?

50
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,625
- I'VE HEARD ABOUT
SOME SIMILAR INCIDENTS.

51
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,666
MEMBERS OF THE IZAKI
AND GOTO OFFICES SEEM

52
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,291
TO BE MISSING AS WELL.

53
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,125
SOME SAY THEY SAW GHOSTS
ABDUCT THOSE PEOPLE.

54
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,208
- I RECALL HEARING
ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE

55
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,375
OF ONE OF IZAKI'S YOUNGER MEN
AS WELL.

56
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,583
WHO'S SETTING
THE WHOLE THING UP?

57
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,458
THE UNION?

58
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,375
- I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE.

59
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,541
- Tsujinaka:
EXPLAIN, TOYAMA.

60
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,833
- REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
IN GABE.

61
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,291
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY
THAT IT IS NEITHER THE UNION

62
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,833
NOR THE RACAN.

63
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,833
- KOHAKURA.  NO, SONODA.

64
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,625
- HEY.
- ( gasps )

65
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,625
- WHERE'S ONISHI?  HE'S NOT
HANGING WITH YOU TONIGHT?

66
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,750
- OF COURSE, I AM TAKING
SONODA'S FEELINGS

67
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,166
INTO CONSIDERATION,

68
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,666
BUT I WANT TO INVESTIGATE
A LITTLE MORE.

69
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,875
YES, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU COULD TELL THEM.

70
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,208
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

71
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,583
TOMORROW SONODA AND KOHAKURA
ARE GOING TO VISIT

72
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,250
GREAT-FATHER GOTO
IN THE HOSPITAL.

73
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,000
I ASKED THEM TO INCONVENIENCE
THEMSELVES BY TAKING YOU ALONG.

74
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,166
SO PAY YOUR RESPECTS PROPERLY.

75
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,291
- HMM.

76
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,625
- YOU SHOULD GET A HAIRCUT.

77
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,833
I SHOULD ALSO MAKE YOU
WEAR ONE OF THESE,

78
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,291
BUT I DOUBT YOU'LL...

79
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,750
- I'LL WEAR IT.
- HMM?

80
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,750
- THAT THING.
THE ONE AROUND YOUR NECK.

81
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,833
- WAIT HERE.

82
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,708
I'LL BRING YOU SOME OF MINE.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,916
- FUNNY.  I NEVER IMAGINED
THEY'D RUN INTO YOU

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,041
AT A PLACE LIKE THAT.

85
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,958
SO TELL ME.

86
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,958
ARE YOU ON AN ERRAND
FOR ONISHI?

87
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,500
- NOT REALLY.

88
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,875
- I'VE BEEN TOLD THINGS
ARE GETTING PRETTY UGLY

89
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,250
IN THE ORGANO THESE DAYS.

90
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,083
- IT'S NONE OF THE ORGANO'S
BUSINESS OR HIS,

91
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,500
FOR THAT MATTER,

92
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,083
WHERE IT IS THAT I WANT TO GO

93
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,708
OR WITH WHOM I WANT
TO HAVE DINNER.

94
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,041
- SERIOUSLY?

95
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,708
- UNLESS I ASSURE YOU
ABOUT THAT,

96
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,500
YOU'LL BE TOO AFRAID
TO HIT ON ME.

97
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,708
- HMM.

98
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,125
EVEN IF THERE
IS A CATCH,

99
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,416
I FEEL LIKE BEING FOOLED
BY YOU.

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,416
- ( grunts )

101
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,458
- HUH?

102
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,458
- SHINJI AND THAT WOMAN.

103
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,041
HAL.

104
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,083
- OH!
- HUH?

105
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,583
YOKO.

106
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,625
- HEY, WAIT UP.

107
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,333
- WASN'T THAT ENOUGH?

108
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,125
I HAD A GOOD TIME,
MR. LEADER OF THE RACAN.

109
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,833
- WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE NIGHT'S JUST GOTTEN STARTED.

110
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,666
- BE CAREFUL.

111
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,500
DIDN'T YOU KNOW,

112
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,666
BUT ONISHI SOMETIMES HEARS
THE VOICE OF THE CITY.

113
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,416
HE'S THE MAN WHO WAS
SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN

114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,625
BY THE CITY OF LUX.

115
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,166
THERE IS NO OTHER MAN LIKE HIM
IN THIS CITY,

116
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,125
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR
WISHING YOU COULD BECOME HIM.

117
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,666
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

118
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,500
- I'M SAYING

119
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,375
THAT YOU WANNA BE
JUST LIKE HIM.

120
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,208
- ( electricity crackles )

121
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,916
- ( panting )

122
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,041
COME ON, GET OVER IT.

123
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,541
HE'S GONE NOW.

124
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,000
HEY, YOKO,

125
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,541
WILL YOU JUST LOOK AT ME?

126
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,416
WHY?

127
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,583
WHY IS HE SO SPECIAL?

128
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,083
( sighs, gasps )

129
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,625
YOKO.

130
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,791
- ( laughs ) YOU'LL GIVE
TOYAMA A HEART ATTACK

131
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,833
WHEN HE SEES
YOU LOOKING LIKE THAT.

132
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,833
- THAT HE WILL.

133
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,708
- JUST TRY YOUR BEST NOT
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL

134
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,333
TO GREAT FATHER GOTO.

135
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,583
ONISHI HAS GONE
TO SO MUCH TROUBLE--

136
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,500
SONODA, YOU SEE THEM?
- I KNOW.

137
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,791
THEY'RE TSUJINAKA'S MEN.
IT FIGURES.

138
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,958
THESE GUYS REALLY
WANNA START SOMETHING.

139
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,666
BOY, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

140
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,875
- ( grunts )
- MOVE IT!

141
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,458
- ( gasps )

142
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,708
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

143
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,583
- ( gunfire )

144
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,916
- DAMN YOU!

145
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,625
ASSHOLE!

146
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,958
- ( panting )

147
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,291
- THIS WAY!

148
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,125
- THANKS A LOT.
I OWE YOU BIG TIME.

149
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
- IF I LET YOU GET KILLED
RIGHT NOW,

150
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,541
ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE
INSIDE THE ORGANO.

151
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,583
- ( shouts )

152
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,916
- ( gasping )

153
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,166
SOUNDS LIKE ALL THE SHOOTING
HAS FINALLY STOPPED.

154
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,000
- IT SEEMS THAT BOY MUST
HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE REST.

155
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,375
SO EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

156
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,500
- SONODA!

157
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,791
- I GUESS HE MUST HAVE
MISSED ONE OF THEM.

158
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,625
- KOHAKURA, YOUR ARM.

159
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,125
- I'D LIKE TO SAY
I'M ALL RIGHT,

160
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,750
BUT I REALLY DID GET HIT
THIS TIME.

161
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,208
WELL, THEN LET'S JUST PRETEND
THAT HE'S YOUR KILLER.

162
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,833
- KOHAKURA,
WHAT ARE YOU--

163
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,791
- SORRY, MR. SONODA,
BUT YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT.

164
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,833
- IT MAY BE
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

165
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,625
REMAIN CALM AND LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

166
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,833
- WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

167
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,375
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?  AFRAID?

168
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,375
YES, I WANTED YOU
TO FEEL THAT EMOTION

169
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,041
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A DIFFICULT MAN TO BREAK.

170
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,500
THAT BORING PERSONALITY
OF YOURS

171
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,708
IS MAKING THIS CITY
EXTREMELY UGLY.

172
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,083
YET, YOU REMAIN QUITE UNAWARE
OF IT,

173
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,708
DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
REQUIRED TO BE AN EGOIST.

174
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,125
- WHAT?

175
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,333
- IN LUX, EVERYONE IS ENTITLED
TO ASSERT THEMSELVES.

176
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,541
A HUGE COUNCIL SYSTEM LED

177
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,333
BY A MIND THAT LACKS
SELF-AWARENESS.

178
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,291
THAT IS IMPURE.

179
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,875
- THINGS MUST BE PURE
AND MORE ARBITRARY.

180
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,541
SOPHISTICATED EGOISM AND STYLE
ARE NEEDED.

181
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,916
CONSIDER THAT ANY MASTERPIECE
COULD BE REDUCED

182
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,375
TO AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE
BY HAVING ANOTHER PERSON

183
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,541
ADD A BRUSH STROKE
TO THE PAINTING.

184
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,833
HARMONIOUS ORDER
IS JUST AN ILLUSION.

185
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,583
LET ME SHARE WITH YOU
HOW A CITY SHOULD BE.

186
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,125
I WILL CHANGE THIS CITY.

187
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,000
TO ME, YOU ARE
A BORING HUMAN BEING.

188
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:40,416
BUT YOU STILL HAVE VALUE
AS A NECESSARY RESOURCE.

189
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,125
- ARE YOU TELLING ME TO BECOME
A SOLDIER OF THE CLASS?

190
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,958
- HMM?

191
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,416
YOU SAW IT?

192
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,958
THE WHOLE THING?

193
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,625
AND NOW WHAT'LL YOU DO?

194
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,625
IF YOU ARE NO LONGER
A STRAY DOG,

195
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,791
IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS
A MEMBER OF THE ORGANO NOW,

196
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,291
YOU MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

197
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,125
THIS IS THE WAY WE DO THINGS.

198
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,041
THAT'S WHAT THE ORGANO
IS ALL ABOUT.

199
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,166
SONODA FORGOT IT
AND DIED BECAUSE OF IT.

200
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,000
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN I'M WITH YOU.

201
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,250
- THEN GO TAKE TSUJINAKA'S LIFE.
TOYAMA.

202
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,250
GIVE HIM THE SWORD.

203
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,583
- ARE YOU SURE NOW?

204
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,083
WITH THIS YOU CAN STOP
BEING A STRAY DOG,

205
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,000
BUT IN RETURN,

206
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,333
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
COLLARED AND CHAINED.

207
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,000
- YOUR ORGANIZATION,
THIS UGLY HARMONY

208
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,000
THAT YOU'RE SO DESPERATELY
TRYING TO PROTECT

209
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,083
WILL CEASE TO BE.

210
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,750
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

211
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,791
YOU CAN PUT AN END TO IT WITH
YOUR OWN HANDS JUST AS WELL.

212
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
- YOU SHOULD NEVER
UNDERESTIMATE ME.

213
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,708
DESPITE HOW I MAY APPEAR NOW,

214
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,375
I HAVE AN EGO
OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE.

215
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,083
- THERE'S NO NEED TO BE SO HASTY
IN MAKING A DECISION.

216
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,375
THERE IS STILL TIME.

217
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,333
- ( footsteps )

218
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,416
- ( door opens and closes )

219
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,416
- ( sighs )

220
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,208
- I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE ONE OF ONISHI'S MEN.

221
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,708
- I SEE.

222
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,875
I SCREWED UP, DIDN'T I?

223
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,208
- SONODA.

224
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,958
HE'S DEAD.

225
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,791
- SONODA IS DEAD,

226
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,458
AND NOW I WILL BE, TOO.

227
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,750
WHOSE PUPPETS HAVE WE BECOME?

228
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,541
HACKING ME UP IS NOT
GOING TO SOLVE ANYTHING.

229
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,000
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SHOULD BE DOING NOW?

230
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,000
- WHAT I SHOULD BE
DOING NOW IS--

231
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,916
- IT'S NO USE TRYING
TO TALK SENSE

232
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,500
INTO AN EXPENDABLE UNDERLING!

233
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,250
( shouts )
- ( gasps )

234
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,750
- THEY ORGANO IS
GOING TO GO DOWN.

235
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,791
DO YOU STILL THINK THAT YOU--

236
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,791
( shouts )
- ( gasps )

237
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:59,250
- I DID AS I SHOULD.

238
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,375
- WHAT'S UP WITH ALL OF YOU?
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

239
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,958
- SHINJI, I'VE DECIDED
TO QUIT THE RACAN.

240
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,041
- WHAT?
- IT'S NO GOOD STAYING HERE

241
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,166
ANY LONGER.
I JUST REALIZED THAT.

242
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,083
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GONNA QUIT?

243
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,291
- YOU SAID WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
FREE TO DO WHATEVER WE WANTED.

244
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,166
SO I'M FREE TO LEAVE HERE NOW
IF I WANT.

245
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,541
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?

246
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,958
- HAL, YOU CAN'T JUST
WALK AWAY LIKE THIS.

247
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,500
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS
FOR SO LONG.

248
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,625
- THINGS CAN'T REMAIN
AS THEY WERE BEFORE.

249
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,166
HEY, SHINJI,
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET,

250
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,541
I'LL HAVE CHANGED.

251
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,541
AND THEN, I THINK I'LL KILL YOU.
- Yoko: HAL.

252
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,333
- DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

253
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,916
- HAL.

254
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,791
SHINJI, YOU'RE LETTING HIM GO?
- LET HIM BE.

255
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,791
- ( scoffs )

256
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,125
- ( theme music playing )

257
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,750
- ( singing in Japanese )
