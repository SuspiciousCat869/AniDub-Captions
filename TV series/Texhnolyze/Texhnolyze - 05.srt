1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,291
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,583
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,458
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,791
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,541
- ( techno music playing )

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,833
- ARE YOU BORED?
- HUH?

7
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,166
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

8
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,416
MY EARS ARE A BIT--
MAYBE I'M JUST OLD.

9
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,958
ARE YOU BORED?
- THIS IS MY SPACE.

10
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,500
I CALL IT THE VIP ROOM.

11
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,250
- I'M SURPRISED YOU WOULD BE
ATTRACTED TO LIGHTS LIKE THESE,

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,916
OR OTHER THINGS.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
- ( woman laughing )

14
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,125
YEAH, YOU CAN DO IT.

15
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,291
- HEY, ISN'T THAT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND OVER THERE?

16
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,500
DON'T YOU MIND?

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,250
- SHE'S FREE.
IT'S HER CHOICE.

18
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,541
- REALLY?

19
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,125
- WE DON'T BELONG
TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING.

20
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,583
WE'VE GATHERED TOGETHER OUT
OF OUR OWN FREE WILL.

21
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,583
THAT'S WHY WE'RE UNITED.

22
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,791
- HMM.
YOU'RE A PHILOSOPHER.

23
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,250
- I HEARD THAT YOU COME
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

24
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,125
SO TELL ME,
WHAT'S IT LIKE OUT THERE?

25
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,958
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
FOR YOURSELF?

26
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,875
- IS THERE STILL
SOMETHING THERE?

27
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,125
- THERE PROBABLY IS
IF YOU THINK SO.

28
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,458
AND THERE PROBABLY ISN'T
IF YOU DON'T.

29
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,250
- DON'T ACT SO PRETENTIOUS.

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,625
- ANYTHING THAT'S REALLY FREE

31
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,916
CAN'T BE LEANING
ON ANYTHING ELSE.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,541
IT'S WANDERING.
IT'S LONELY, AND IT'S ARDUOUS.

33
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,291
YOU CAN'T HOPE FOR
ANY SECURITY OR REWARD

34
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,541
BEYOND THE NAME.
- NO REWARD NEEDED.

35
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,041
JUST PROOF.
- THEN THOSE LIGHTS.

36
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,041
- YEAH.

37
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,750
- YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU DON'T
BELONG TO ANYTHING.

38
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,875
BUT THAT'S A LIE.
- HUH?

39
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,166
- BECAUSE YOU BELONG
TO THIS CITY.

40
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,666
AND I'M SURE SO DOES
YOUR FREEDOM.

41
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
SO TELL ME,

42
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,958
WHERE'S THERE
A NICE PLACE I CAN GO TO?

43
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,708
WHERE I CAN FIND SOME WOMEN THAT
ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR MY AGE?

44
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,708
- WELL, HE HASN'T BEEN FOUND
AS OF YET.

45
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,500
- Doc: HE DOESN'T HAVE
A TEXHNOLYZED LIMB EXTERIOR.

46
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,208
HOW CAN ANYONE MISS IT?

47
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,041
- Man: I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT MY MEN KNOW ABOUT THAT.

48
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,416
UNTIL THEN.

49
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:02,333
- ( sighs )
WHAT AN IMPOSSIBLE DOCTOR.

50
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,125
MAKES YOU WONDER WHICH ONE
OF US IS THE CLIENT.

51
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,000
- SHALL I INFORM THE MEN
TO MAKE SURE?

52
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,375
- LEAVE THEM ALONE.

53
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,375
SOMEONE WILL BE ABLE
TO FIND THEM SOONER OR LATER.

54
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,708
- I UNDERSTAND.

55
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,208
- USUALLY ONE BORN
WITH STUPIDITY

56
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,208
IS SUPPOSED TO BE CURED
WHEN THEY DIE.

57
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,833
- ( grunting )

58
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,333
GO AWAY!

59
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,458
( shouts )

60
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,541
- SO...

61
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,416
WHAT KIND OF GIRL
WOULD YOU LIKE, HUH?

62
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,916
( clears throat )

63
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,083
DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,
BUT YOU GOT ANY MONEY?

64
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,666
- YEAH, SURE.

65
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,250
- THE CUSTOMER'S OWN TOYS
AIN'T ALLOWED INSIDE.

66
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,375
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LEAVE THAT OUT HERE.

67
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,875
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GOOD.

68
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,791
- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN THAT KIND OF PLAY,

69
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,708
THERE'S THIS GUY OUTSIDE.
HE CAN GET YOU SOMEONE.

70
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,416
( laughs )
ALTHOUGH I GOTTA TELL YOU,

71
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,041
THERE'S ONLY ONE GIRL
HE CAN GET YOU.

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,708
- ( gasps )

73
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,291
- SORRY.  YOU GOTTA GO.
HUH?

74
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,250
- I PREFER NOT TO BE TOUCHED
BY A MAN.

75
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,500
- ( sighs )

76
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
- Man: HEY, MISTER.
- HMM?

77
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,291
- COME HERE.  YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, EH?

78
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,291
- YEAH, HOPEFULLY SOMEONE
WITH EXPERIENCE.

79
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,291
- ( laughs ) I'VE GOT JUST
THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU.

80
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,416
HEY, COME OUT.

81
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,833
- HOW DO YOU DO?

82
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,375
- SHITHEAD!
I HATE STRAY DOGS.

83
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,666
I'LL KILL YOU IF I FIND YOU
FOOLING AROUND HERE AGAIN.

84
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,000
- ( laughing )

85
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,125
- Yoshii: SO YOU ARE
EXPERIENCED, AREN'T YOU?

86
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,916
EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING,
BUT I WONDER HOW OLD YOU ARE.

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,833
- DON'T MESS WITH ME.
YOU THINK I'M GONNA ANSWER THAT?

88
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,500
I DIDN'T LIKE YOU
THE MOMENT I LAID EYES ON YOU.

89
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,666
UGH! ( panting )

90
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,291
- YOU CAN DROP THE ACT.

91
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,666
I WON'T BE PROVOKED NO MATTER
HOW MUCH DIRT YOU THROW AT ME.

92
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,958
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

93
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,416
I DON'T HAVE A TASTE
FOR THAT KIND OF THING.

94
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,375
- WHAT IS IT THEN?
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

95
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,041
- TO BE HONEST,

96
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,166
I JUST WANNA TALK WITH YOU.

97
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,375
- HUH.  THAT'S THE ONE

98
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,958
ONISHI WAS TALKING ABOUT.

99
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,833
- LOOK AT THOSE FANCY
NEW LIMBS HE HAS.

100
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,500
- ( laughing )

101
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,916
- ( panting )

102
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,291
- ( gasps )

103
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,500
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

104
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,958
- THIS SEWER IS A MAZE
HE'LL NEVER GET OUT OF.

105
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,083
JUST AFTER HE DIES
A WRETCHED DEATH,

106
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,666
SOME SUCK-UP TO ONISHI
WILL FIND HIM.

107
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,291
- Woman:
UP TO THE SECOND BRIDGE,

108
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,166
THAT'S THE TERRITORY
OF THE SALVATION UNION

109
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,333
LED BY KIMATA.
BEYOND THE END OF THE ROAD,

110
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,625
BY THE HILL IS THE RACAN'S
TERRITORY.

111
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,833
IT'S A NEUTRAL ZONE
AROUND HERE,

112
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,333
BUT BEYOND THIS
EVERYTHING BELONGS

113
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,625
TO THE BIGGEST ORGANIZATION
IN LUX-- THE ORGANO.

114
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,208
WILL THAT DO?
- YEAH, THAT HELPS A LOT.

115
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,250
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT.

116
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,583
DO YOU EVER MEET
THE ORGANO'S EXECUTIVES AS WELL?

117
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,750
- YEAH, RIGHT.  DO YOU THINK
THEY DEAL WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME?

118
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,208
- HMM.
- I SEE.

119
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,625
YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE,
ARE YOU?

120
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,000
- DO YOU WANT TO GO UP
TO THE SURFACE?

121
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:51,000
- YEAH, AND STRAIGHTEN
MY LIFE OUT.

122
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,500
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

123
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
- 'CAUSE I'D BE KILLED.

124
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:09,625
- ( sighs ) SO WHAT DOES
IT TAKE TO BECOME LIKE THAT?

125
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,208
- EVERY MAN RUNS OUT OF THE ROOM
AS SOON AS HE SEES THIS.

126
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,750
SO I CAN'T HAVE ANYONE DECENT.

127
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,708
HE WAS A SOMEBODY ONCE,
YOU KNOW,

128
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,083
BUT A RIVAL GANG GOT HIM

129
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,333
AND, WELL,
MADE HIS EQUIPMENT USELESS.

130
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,916
THEN HE DECIDED
HE COULDN'T STAND

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,208
THE THOUGHT
OF ME BEING NORMAL.

132
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,791
- Yoshii: IF YOU LEAVE HERE,
HE WON'T BE WITH YOU.

133
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,875
THEN WON'T YOU MISS HIM?

134
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,541
- MISS HIM? ( laughs )

135
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,333
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

136
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,458
I'D RATHER FIND SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW ME.

137
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,708
IF THEY DON'T KNOW
I'M LIKE THIS,

138
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,083
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMEONE NICE OUT THERE.

139
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,291
WHO KNOWS?
I MIGHT EVEN GET LUCKY ENOUGH

140
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,500
TO MEET
SOMEONE NICE LIKE YOU.

141
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,791
- YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

142
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,000
- Woman: MY GOD.
- DON'T WORRY.

143
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,458
THIS IS JUST A PART OF MY BODY.

144
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,375
- ( panting )

145
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
( grunts )

146
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,041
( screams )

147
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,875
- DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL BE FREE.

148
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,875
- ( laughing )

149
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,750
OH!

150
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,958
- Yoshii: THIS PLACE IS
DEFINITELY BRIMMING

151
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,583
WITH THE ENERGY TO LIVE,

152
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,875
BUT HALF-MEASURES WON'T DO.

153
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,500
- ( panting )

154
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,541
( grunting )

155
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,375
( screaming )

156
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
- ( theme music playing )

157
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,750
- ( singing in Japanese )
