1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,083
- Man: IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,708
ANYTHING AT ALL,
COME TO ME.

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,208
I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,166
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,458
- WE WILL DESTROY 
EVERY ONE OF THEM!

6
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,208
- ( grunts )

7
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,625
- ( all shouting )

8
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,625
- ( men grunting, groaning )

9
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,750
- HUH?

10
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,791
- HUH?

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,166
- I SAID I'D KILL YOU

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,875
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.

13
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,958
BUT LOOKING AT YOU NOW,

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,458
YOU'RE NOT EVEN WORTH MY TIME
TO KILL.

15
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,208
- HEY.

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,833
YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND ME
AT THE DRAGON'S DEN.

17
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,291
- HMM.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,041
- ( gunshot )

19
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,750
- ( panting )

20
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,666
- THAT'S THE LAST.

21
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,166
I GUESS WE MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

22
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,291
- NO, THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

23
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,291
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
CHANGE STRATEGY.

24
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,791
WHEN WE GET BACK,
WE SHOULD INTEGRATE

25
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,791
ALL OFFICES WITH HEADQUARTERS.

26
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,791
- I WONDER HOW MANY ARE
STILL ALIVE.

27
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,791
- ( groaning )

28
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,208
- COME ON.
- ( groaning )

29
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,500
- SHINJI.

30
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,750
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD STAY HERE.

31
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,958
I HEARD BOTH THE ORGANO'S
AND UNION'S OFFICES

32
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,291
WERE CRUSHED BY THE GHOST.

33
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,625
MAYBE THIS PLACE WILL BE NEXT.

34
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,833
- THEN YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.

35
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,000
- WHAT?

36
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,833
- GO WHEREVER YOU WANT.

37
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,166
THE RACAN IS FINISHED
AS OF TODAY.

38
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,958
- WHY?

39
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,000
- Yoko: SHINJI!

40
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,000
- YOU CAN GO TOO, YOKO.

41
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,958
THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

42
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,958
- Yoko: SHINJI.

43
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,833
- Kano: YOU'RE SO CRUEL.

44
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,041
IF YOU'RE SO CURIOUS,

45
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,416
WHY DON'T YOU TOUCH IT

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,250
AND MAKE SURE FOR YOURSELF?

47
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,083
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

48
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,083
- WE'LL RESUME THIS LATER,
DEAR SISTER.

49
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,375
- THERE'S A DELAY IN
THE PROCUREMENT OF WEAPONS, SIR.

50
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,291
ALTHOUGH THE RECEIPT OF SHIPMENT
FROM GABE WAS RECORDED.

51
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,750
- ( paper rustling )

52
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,208
- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
IT'S BEING HELD UP

53
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,583
AT THE CLASS HILL?

54
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,875
YOU MAY GO.
- YES, SIR.

55
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,791
- NO LUCK, SIR.

56
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,625
IT SEEMS THAT ALL OF
THE DOCTORS IN THE CITY

57
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,166
ARE UNDER THE CONTROL
OF THE CLASS.

58
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,000
- HOW ABOUT DR. HIROKA?

59
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,666
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
FROM THE MEN WE SENT THERE?

60
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,083
- THEY JUST CALLED IN TO REPORT
THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVED,

61
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,291
THEY FOUND THE DOCTOR WAS
ALREADY DEAD.

62
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,666
- GO AND GET DOC.

63
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,625
WE NEED HER.

64
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,625
WHAT'S THE PROGRESS ON
THE SHUT-DOWN?

65
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,625
- Michiko:
I THINK IT'S ALMOST FINISHED.

66
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,625
THEY SHOULD START
ARRIVING HERE SOON.

67
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,000
- ( metal clanking )

68
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,708
- WHAT NOW?
YOU CAME ALONE?

69
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,333
- THAT'S BECAUSE...

70
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,000
I DIDN'T COME HERE
AS ONE OF THE SHAPES.

71
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,291
- SHAPES?

72
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,625
- HAL?

73
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,583
IS THAT YOU?

74
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,500
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BODY?

75
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,625
- OH, YEAH. I GUESS YOU HAVE A
SCORE TO SETTLE WITH ME.

76
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,458
- HAL, PLEASE COME BACK TO US.

77
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,958
WE CAN GET EVERYONE TOGETHER
LIKE BEFORE.

78
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,000
AND--
- IT'S TOO LATE.

79
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,541
NO!

80
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,500
THERE'S NO GOING BACK!

81
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,500
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!
BOTH OF YOU!

82
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,833
DAMN YOU!

83
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
I'M DIFFERENT.
GET IT?

84
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,083
DIFFERENT FROM THE SCUM
OF THIS CITY,

85
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,708
DIFFERENT FROM PEOPLE,
LIKE YOU!

86
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,791
- ( punches landing )

87
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,375
- ( panting )

88
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,500
- I CHANGED 'CAUSE
I WANTED TO BE STRONG.

89
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,125
I WANTED TO BE
STRONGER THAN YOU,

90
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,500
SHINJI.

91
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,708
AND THAT MAKES ME...

92
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,708
FREER THAN YOU.

93
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,666
- SO TO BE FREE,
YOU CHOSE TO LOOK LIKE THAT?

94
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,166
CAN'T YOU SEE YOU
SCREWED UP YOUR LIFE, IDIOT?!

95
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,000
- ( growling )

96
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,083
- HAL, STOP!
( gasps )

97
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,208
- AAH!

98
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,083
- ( gasps )

99
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,208
- ( groaning )

100
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,791
- ( Yoko whimpering )

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,875
( screams )

102
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,000
- Grandmother #1: MAYBE SO.

103
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,916
- Grandmother #2: VERY WELL.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,333
- Grandmother #3:
THE SOONER THE BETTER.

105
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,916
- IS THAT YOU, KANO?

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,583
- IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, MOTHER.

107
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,208
- WE WERE THINKING
IT WAS ABOUT TIME...

108
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
- THAT YOU'D COME TO SEE US.

109
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,750
- Kano: I CAME HERE TO HAVE
MY TOY RETURNED TO ME.

110
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,541
- DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY...

111
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,458
- WITH THE MISCHIEF THAT
 YOU ARE PLANNING TO DO.

112
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,583
- THE COMMON PEOPLE SERVE
A PURPOSE...

113
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,833
- AS THE BASE OF
 OUR LIVELIHOOD.

114
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,166
- THE TRADITIONAL
AND TIME-HONORED METHOD

115
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,083
OF GOVERNANCE...

116
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,083
- EXISTS IN HERE
FOR A REASON.

117
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,250
- I'M CERTAINLY AWARE OF THAT.

118
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,500
- ARE YOU INDEED, MY DEAR BOY?

119
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,666
- EVER SINCE HE WAS LITTLE...

120
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,125
- KANO HAS BEEN INCORRIGIBLE.

121
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,375
- Onishi: WITH THE SEER GONE,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE

122
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,375
BUT TO ACT ON
OUR OWN JUDGMENT.

123
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,666
- RAN HAS SEEN SOMETHING--

124
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,166
- SOMETHING THAT SHE CAN'T
TELL US ABOUT.

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,208
- Ran: THAT'S RIGHT.

126
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,166
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM.
ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

127
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,375
THERE'S NO USE
IN BEING AFRAID.

128
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,375
SEE?  IT'S ALREADY
BEEN DECIDED.

129
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,666
- Kohakura:
WHY?!  I'M NOT A SOLDIER!

130
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,833
I'LL BE MORE VALUABLE
TO THE ORGANIZATION

131
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,625
BY WORKING IN
A POSITION OF POWER,

132
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,125
TO HELP CONTROL THE SOLDIERS.

133
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,250
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY 
NO REASON FOR THIS.

134
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,708
WHY MUST I BE REQUIRED 
TO BECOME TEXHNOLYZED?!

135
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,250
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

136
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,125
IT'S BY PLACING THE RIGHT MEN
IN THE RIGHT POSITIONS

137
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,875
THAT AN ORGANIZATION IS ABLE 
TO COME TO ITS FULL STRENGTH.

138
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,416
IF MORE SHAPES ARE NEEDED,

139
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,333
THERE SHOULD BE MANY MEN
WHO ARE PHYSICALLY YOUNGER

140
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,750
AND MORE CAPABLE THAN I AM.

141
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,333
- THAT'S RUBBISH.

142
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,625
- ( Kohakura scoffs )

143
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,291
- ENOUGH.
TAKE HIM AWAY.

144
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,583
- ( chains clanking )

145
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,666
- GET OFF ME.

146
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,125
( groaning )

147
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,666
- THE ORGANO WILL SOON
CEASE TO EXIST.

148
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,166
AND YOU WILL ALSO CEASE
TO BE, SOONER OR LATER.

149
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
BUT I WANT YOU TO STAY ALIVE.

150
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,625
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MEMBER
OF THE ORGANO.

151
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,333
- TO ME, THE ORGANO IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A MEANS

152
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,375
TO KEEP SURVIVING.

153
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,791
- I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BY NOW

154
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,333
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE ORGANO.

155
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,333
SO WOULD YOU.

156
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,250
- BUT THE REALITY IS
THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY.

157
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,083
AND I CAN'T CHANGE NOW.

158
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,875
- YOU WANNA LIVE SO BADLY,
YOU'LL PAY ANY PRICE.

159
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,708
- YOU CAN'T LIVE AT ALL
UNLESS YOU PAY IN FULL.

160
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,250
- Kimata: SOME OF YOU MAY FEEL
THAT OUR GRAND IDEALS

161
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,916
ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE
BEFORE EVER WE REACH OUR GOALS.

162
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,250
HOWEVER, THAT IS FAR
FROM THE TRUTH.

163
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,750
THROUGH THIS BATTLE,
WE SHALL RISE UP

164
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,416
AS A SHINING EXAMPLE
OF DETERMINATION.

165
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,000
OUR SPIRIT SHALL BE
DEEPLY ETCHED INTO THE SOULS

166
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
OF THE CITIZENS OF LUX,

167
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,958
AND WILL CONTINUE
TO LIVE ON FOREVER.

168
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,750
HOWEVER, BEFORE WE GO
INTO BATTLE,

169
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,750
THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I MUST CONFESS TO YOU.

170
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,375
- ( all gasp )

171
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,875
- IN MY SEARCH FOR
BODY BEYOND THE BODY,

172
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,791
I ONCE SOUGHT
THE SALVATION OF MIND

173
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,833
THROUGH TEXHNOLYZATION.

174
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,500
HOWEVER, IT WAS A MISTAKE.

175
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,666
THE REASON I FORBADE YOU
FROM BECOMING TEXHNOLYZED...

176
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,291
AND ASKED YOU
TO TRAIN YOUR BODIES

177
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,833
WAS BECAUSE TEXHNOLYZATION
ERODES A MAN'S BODY

178
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,000
AND HIS SOUL.

179
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,750
SHOULD ANY OF YOU
BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME

180
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,916
AND FEEL DISCOURAGED
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE ME,

181
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,625
YOU'RE FREE TO 
LEAVE HERE NOW.

182
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,958
- SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

183
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,250
- Men: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

184
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,250
- Crowd: SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

185
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,416
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

186
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,416
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

187
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,791
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

188
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,208
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

189
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,041
- Doc: HAVE YOU SEEN
THEIR VERSION OF TEXHNOLYZATION?

190
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,125
YOU CAN'T EVEN CALL IT
TEXHNOLYZATION.

191
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,083
IT'S LAUGHABLE THAT
THEY'RE TURNING PEOPLE

192
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,041
INTO MERE WEAPONS LIKE THAT.

193
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,541
YET MY TEXHNOLYZATION WAS
DRIVEN AWAY

194
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,333
BY SUCH CHILD'S PLAY.

195
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,375
IT SEEMS I HAVE
NOTHING LEFT NOW.

196
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,166
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU CAN HELP THE INJURED.

197
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,125
- THERE'S NO POINT IN
TREATING INJURIES

198
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,375
WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD.

199
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,500
THE ORGANO IS FINISHED.

200
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,875
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

201
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,875
DIE WITH ONISHI?

202
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,541
- AYE.

203
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
- ( grunts )

204
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,333
- ( shouts, groans )

205
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,666
- ( metal clangs )

206
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,708
- PARDON ME. THE UNION
HAS STARTED THEIR ATTACK.

207
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,958
- Doc: NO MATTER WHERE WE GO,

208
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,541
WE'LL ALL DIE.

209
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,875
SO WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO DIE?

210
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,375
- I DON'T KNOW.

211
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,416
- YOU'RE MY MASTERPIECE.

212
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,916
BUT THE CLASS DOESN'T SEE
ANY VALUE

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
IN THE TEXHNOLYZATION
I'VE DONE TO YOU.

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,416
- YOU TOLD ME...

215
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,666
THAT I HAVE MY MOTHER IN HERE.

216
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,083
- I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

217
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,666
SORRY, I LIED.

218
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,666
I LIED TO YOU.

219
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,333
ACTUALLY...

220
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,250
I DUMPED WHATEVER WAS
INSIDE THE CONTAINER.

221
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,583
YOU SEE,
THE CELLS INSIDE OF IT

222
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,291
WERE LONG DEAD.
- ( grunts )

223
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,291
- ( gasps )

224
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,291
- ( groaning )

225
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,250
- ( gasping )

226
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,083
FORGIVE ME.

227
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,958
IF I HADN'T LIED,

228
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,250
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ACCEPTED
YOUR NEW LIMBS.

229
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,791
FORGIVE ME.

230
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,750
( struggled breathing )

231
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,708
- ( both panting )

232
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,291
- ( shouts )

233
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,375
- ( gasps )
- ( grunting )

234
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,333
- ( pounding on wall )
- ( grunting )

235
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,916
- JUST STOP.

236
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,166
- ( panting )

237
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,166
- YOU'LL BREAK IT.

238
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,125
- ( grunts )

239
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,083
- ( men shouting )

240
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,083
- ONISHI, YOU TOO?

241
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,916
- REVENGE IS SOMETHING 
WE BOTH HAVE IN COMMON.

242
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,666
- Man: CHANCELLOR,
MORE OF THEM ARE COMING!

243
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,500
- KOHAKURA?

244
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,958
- NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,

245
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,958
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY LEFT
FOR ME TO LIVE.

246
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,541
- THIS BATTLE IS
COMPLETELY FUTILE.

247
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,958
WITHDRAW YOUR MEN.

248
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,958
- ONISHI, THIS IS A BATTLE
TO SHOW OUR SPIRIT.

249
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,291
OUR STRUGGLE IS MEANT TO INSPIRE
THE COMRADES OF THIS CITY.

250
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,916
- KIMATA.

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,958
- THE OPERA HOUSE
LOCATED DOWN THE ROAD

252
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,916
IS THEIR HEADQUARTERS.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,750
I'M GOING TO GET THERE EVEN IF 
I'M THE ONLY MAN LEFT STANDING.

254
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,083
- FOLLOW HIM!

255
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,083
- ( men shouting )

256
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,833
- ( grunting )

257
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,541
- KIMATA!

258
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,166
- ( groans, shouts )

259
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,291
- ( shudders )

260
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,291
RETREAT!

261
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,416
EVERYBODY PULL OUT.

262
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,583
WE HAVE A TRUCK WAITING DOWN
AT THE END OF THE ALLEY.

263
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,791
GET ON IT.
THAT INCLUDES UNION MEMBERS.

264
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,791
- ( men shouting )

265
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,125
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

266
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,458
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

267
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,458
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

268
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,875
SHIN!  SHIN!
SEI!  KYUU!  SAI!

269
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,916
- GET UP.

270
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,625
- WE'RE HERE.

271
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,416
TIME TO GO.

272
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,750
SHALL WE?

273
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,791
- ( theme music playing )

274
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,541
- ( singing in Japanese )
