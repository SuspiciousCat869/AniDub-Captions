1
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,833
Autumn, yo!

2
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,250
Okay, slackers, listen up.

3
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,208
Our school field
trip is next week...

4
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,875
This year, we're going
to spend four days

5
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,333
and three nights in Kyoto.

6
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,708
I bet the chicks in Kyoto
are so hot they're sick.

7
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,375
Like you'd have
a chance, anyway.

8
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,291
Shut up, dude.

9
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,583
Like these punks ever listen.

10
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,916
What if I get hit on by
guys from other schools?

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,625
How, when guys from your own
school won't hit on you?

12
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,916
This is exciting;
I've never actually been

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,166
on a school trip like this.

14
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,166
Oh, these are a blast.

15
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,333
You're gonna love it.

16
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,583
At night, we always
talk about whatever

17
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,125
guys we're crushing
on at the moment.

18
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,041
It's true!

19
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,833
Who we're crushing on...?

20
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,833
My only crush is
on my big brother...

21
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,458
But... I can't tell
them the truth...!

22
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,416
I can't!

23
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,583
I can't!

24
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,041
I can't!

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,791
So... are you
a Kyoto virgin too?

26
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,916
Shut up!

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But yeah, I've never
been there either.

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,791
A city that old...

29
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,541
...the hotels have to
be loaded with history.

30
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,458
Let's go inside, right now.

31
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,458
Hold on... Isn't there
a jinx that couples

32
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,083
who start dating on a school
trip are doomed to fail?

33
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,416
Well... all I want
from Kosuda is a

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,916
one--time thing, so I'm
not really worried about it.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,583
You do realize you're
sucking on a pencil, right?

36
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,416
She's practicing for later,
if ya know what I mean.

37
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,291
Yay!

38
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,583
It's a school trip!

39
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,833
No chance to be alone...

40
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,208
Hey...!

41
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,375
Back when you were in school,

42
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,916
what were your
out--of--town trips like?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,041
I hate to say it, but you'll be
in groups most of the time,

44
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,625
so you won't get the chance
to be alone with Yamada...

45
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,833
Although you
should totally try to

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,583
kiss her again if you
get the opportunity!

47
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,333
Well yeah, I mean, obviously...

48
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,916
That's kinda my goal.

49
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,541
What, are you
a freaking mind reader?

50
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,625
How do you know we kissed?

51
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,083
I never said anything
to you about it!

52
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,000
Now you know...
before you kiss her again...

53
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,333
...you have something
you need to take care of.

54
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,416
Don't look at me like that.

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,750
I'm just talking about telling
her how you feel about her.

56
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,375
Tell her the truth...

57
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,333
Every girl wants to hear a guy
say those three little words.

58
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,208
They do--really?

59
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,625
She's right...

60
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,416
That is how I feel...
maybe I should say something.

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,958
And once she falls for that BS,

62
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,416
you can kiss her
wherever you want.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,666
I can?

64
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,750
Yeah.

65
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,291
Does she mean
wherever like wherever

66
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,291
or like wherever wherever?

67
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,416
Toothbrush...

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,625
toothpaste...

69
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
towel and some lotion.

70
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,333
What's up?

71
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,583
Are you getting ready
for the big trip?

72
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,500
Cool...!

73
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,208
A Kyoto Guidebook!

74
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,583
Well, you know me,
preparationess

75
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,958
is second to godliness.

76
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,500
Yeah, I get that.

77
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,916
The 7:40 Negai 101 is leaving

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
for Hiroshima from
Platform number fourteen--

79
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:09,833
Morning.

80
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,125
I don't like this early.

81
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,916
Oh, Kosuda, celebrate your

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,416
adorable innocence
while you still can...

83
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,708
Because within
the next three days...

84
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,875
...that lonely cherry of
yours is gonna be mine!

85
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,166
I won't have to listen to
slutty stories anymore...

86
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,750
Finally, I'll be able to
tell the good stuff myself!

87
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,625
He'll be talking about you, too.
You do get that, don't you?

88
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
Ladies and Gentlemen,
thank you for

89
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,250
riding the Negai,
number 101 today.

90
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,666
Let's get this show on the road!

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,666
To Kyoto!

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,625
We're already on
the road, genius.

93
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,166
I got a bunch
of snacks you guys...!

94
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,416
Check this out...
vinaigrette kelp chocolate!

95
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
Ewie!

96
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,916
Would anyone care to purchase
a cup of nice, hot coffee?

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
No way!
Gimme a beer!

98
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
Don't make me expel
you from this trip

99
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,916
before we even get started.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,291
We're all thinking the
same thing:

101
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,958
Miss Akai sounds really hot
when she gets pissed.

102
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,375
Look, it's Kosuda!

103
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,333
Kosuda!

104
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,833
Will you take our picture!

105
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,250
Yeah, sure!

106
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,000
If I give you my email,
will you send it to me later?

107
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,333
Well, I would, but this
isn't a digital camera.

108
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,208
Kosuda!
Take our picture too!

109
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,625
Okay.

110
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,500
Yet again everybody wants
him to take their picture,

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,041
and he thinks
he's Mister Popular.

112
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,541
Kosuda, will you buy me a soda?

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, okay!

114
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,458
Kosuda would you
mind putting my bag up?

115
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,458
Sure, no problem.

116
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,708
Yo, Kosuda...

117
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,291
You wanna massage
my shoulders next?

118
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,958
Well, he may not
think he's popular,

119
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,125
but he's still pissing me off
being so damn nice to everyone.

120
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,500
"The Ladies" are so
complicated, aren't they?

121
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,166
Is that for the movie studio?

122
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,666
Yeah my mom
went there last year...

123
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,708
She gave it to me.

124
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,583
Really?
Did she love it or what?

125
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,666
Totally. She talked
about it for weeks.

126
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,583
This is gonna
the best trip ever!

127
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,333
So true...

128
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,250
It shall be, epic.

129
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,416
This is awesome!

130
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,166
We're completely
surrounded by lady lumps!

131
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,958
I need to tell her how I feel...

132
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,125
...but how can I do that if we

133
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,250
don't get the chance
to be alone?

134
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,875
Kosuda, over here!

135
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,875
Don't forget to
take our picture, too!

136
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,458
But you better make
sure we all look cute!

137
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,083
No worries, there!

138
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,583
Thou art false to
thy would be hook up!

139
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,958
Maybe this isn't the time
to tell her how I feel.

140
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Traitorous rout-face!

141
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,833
Kosuda!
Come over here!

142
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,041
You need to at least be in
a few of the pictures too...

143
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Why don't I take a picture
of you and Yamada together?

144
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,916
No...!

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,708
I don't wanna be in the same
picture with a jerky traitor!

146
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,583
Bring it down, Drama.
Everybody's taking pictures.

147
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,750
Yeah... Okay!

148
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,791
I'd like that...

149
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,166
I wanna be in a
picture with Yamada.

150
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,083
--What?
--Wonderful...!

151
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,375
Hey,
Inside--the--Actor's--Studio,

152
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,708
go stand by him.

153
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,041
Fine, let's get it over with...

154
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,708
I don't have all day...

155
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,125
I'm only doing this
'cause it's for school.

156
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,208
Sure you are...

157
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,416
Say cheese...!

158
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,375
--Cheese!
--Cheese!

159
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,375
Now was that so hard?

160
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,583
Cheese!

161
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,500
We're in Kyoto!

162
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,916
Time to head back to the hotel!

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,958
Everyone still alive?

164
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,541
We've been here one day,
and we've had

165
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,125
to do everything
in a stupid group.

166
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,541
I couldn't break
away to save my life.

167
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,500
I thought that last temple was

168
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,041
gonna be a lot
higher than it was.

169
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah, but I bet back when it
was made it seemed pretty high.

170
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,333
Why does this jerk keep
talking about sightseeing?

171
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,875
He's supposed to be boning me!

172
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,083
A thousand years of culture,

173
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,625
and all you can think
of is bumpin uglies?

174
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,375
I'm so excited
about taking a bath.

175
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,875
Yeah, but before that, I could
go for some food, ya know?

176
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,166
I wonder what they're gonna
feed us for dinner tonight.

177
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,458
Typically, it would be a
special course dinner...

178
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Kyoto special course dinner!

179
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:47,833
Side dishes!

180
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,875
Dessert things!

181
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,125
All of this looks amazing!

182
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,416
I've never been so happy...

183
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,583
Thanks but I don't really
need you anymore.

184
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,500
Imagination, you will not
get the better of me...

185
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,416
Kosuda's not a
slave to good food...

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,083
Not even a little...

187
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,000
Otherwise, he might
actually know I'm alive.

188
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,333
Miyano?

189
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,583
You okay?

190
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,041
The girls' side
of the bathhouse.

191
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,291
I swear your breasts get
bigger every time I touch them.

192
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,666
They do!

193
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,666
But those tickle parties
and pillow fights help too.

194
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:24,958
Heck yeah...

195
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,000
Can you imagine what those girls

196
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,375
are getting away
with right now...

197
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,708
Am I right?

198
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:29,958
Bulge.

199
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,000
No, down boy!

200
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,166
Way to grow, Kosuda...

201
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,791
Damn; that big boy is scary.

202
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,041
I know!

203
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,166
Let's all whip em out
and have a size off...

204
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,583
Yeah!

205
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,958
Can you imagine what those guys
are getting away with in there?

206
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,458
You're such a perv!

207
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,500
Seriously, this entire bathhouse
fantasy has been all you!

208
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,916
Lights out!

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,583
Everyone get some sleep;
we've got a big day ahead of us!

210
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,666
Lights out is when all
the good gossip happens!

211
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,750
Time for dirty talk!

212
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,208
So, Takeshita
we'd all like for you to

213
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,375
tell us what your
first time was like.

214
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,791
Why are you asking me that?

215
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
Nice, Misato!

216
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,708
She hasn't even
told me the details

217
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
of blasting her cherry bomb yet.

218
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,916
Oh, come on,
you have been dating your

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,125
boyfriend for
like ever, haven't you?

220
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,125
There's no escaping now.

221
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,666
Even the shyest
girl in the world

222
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,625
would spill her guts here!

223
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,125
This is what overnight
school trips are all about!

224
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,416
How's it fair that
I'm the only one

225
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,541
who has to tell their story?

226
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,291
I would but I don't
have a story yet.

227
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,458
Well, that's not my problem!

228
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,291
Okay, if you want
I can tell you about

229
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,791
Katase's tragic first time!

230
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,125
You shut your fat mouth!

231
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,541
Didn't you tell me that
you lost it at some hotel?

232
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,875
What're you talking about?
I never told you where it was!

233
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,916
Where was it?

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,833
Were you wearing
your school uniform

235
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,833
when you went to the hotel?!

236
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,666
It wasn't at a hotel...!

237
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,208
Damn it, you're
doing this on purpose!

238
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,041
Fine I'll tell you...

239
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,541
...but only because I don't
want you guys making up lies.

240
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,416
Sweet!
It's about time!

241
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,208
Misato...!

242
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,083
Yamada...!

243
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,458
I'm seriously gonna kill you.

244
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,708
Gah, I hate this...
but let's start from the top.

245
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,208
Shut the hell up
and go to bed already!

246
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,208
Takeshita did it in
her boyfriend's room

247
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,416
after ninth grade graduation.

248
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,375
Shut up!

249
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,916
Go to sleep!

250
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,750
How'd Katase get
her Vagistan occupied?

251
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,708
Shut up!

252
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,000
Go to sleep!

253
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,500
I wanna know more about her...

254
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,958
Like, anything really.

255
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,250
I do want to tell
her my feelings, but...

256
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,041
...on the other hand...

257
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,041
I think going to places with
each other is kinda cool, too...

258
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,875
We're seeing things
we've never seen before,

259
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,125
which means we get
to experience it together.

260
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,541
I like that.

261
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
Okay...

262
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,708
This is the main
part of the temple...

263
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,125
Which means...

264
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,541
She seems to be
really into temples.

265
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,500
Quiet... like... a... ninja.

266
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,125
This is perfectly deserted
and out of the tourist zone!

267
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,583
Now, I just have to get
cherry stump back here...

268
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,375
How do I manage that...?

269
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,125
Duh!
I'll send him an email...!

270
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,250
Weird...

271
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,500
I wonder why I can
message my feelings

272
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,583
better than just
talking in person.

273
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,375
What's that...?

274
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,750
D'ya get an email?

275
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,666
Weird...
It must be spam.

276
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,125
Online dating site or something.

277
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,333
I wonder what he's thinking.

278
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,916
I can't wait to
hear back from him!

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,208
You're gonna be waiting a while.

280
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,083
Dem's the breaks, sistah.

281
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,291
Now, we will all sit
and practice meditation...

282
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,291
Renounce all
your earthy desires...

283
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,250
And do not be trapped
in worldly thoughts...

284
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,083
If I see you relax your focus,
I will then strike you...

285
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,583
If you are struck...
please bow.

286
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,500
I gotta be grateful
for getting hit?

287
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,875
Thank you, Mistress Yamada!

288
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,375
I've been very naughty!

289
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,416
You'll be doing that a lot.

290
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,791
What if I don't
get the opportunity

291
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,916
to tell her how I feel...?

292
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,291
And just think...

293
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,833
...If I did, that could
change everything...

294
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,875
You're right...

295
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,708
Make love to me...

296
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,416
Like that would happen.

297
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Is he having
Earthly desires or not?

298
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,958
He could at least
make up his mind.

299
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,541
Her thoughts are
in perfect order.

300
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,041
This girl is a
genuine inspiration.

301
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,458
She has already
mastered the way of Zen.

302
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,375
Keiichi...

303
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, brother,
oh brother where art thou?

304
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,375
I'll tear Yamada
into trashy little pieces!

305
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,583
Earthly desires are
swirling around in her mind,

306
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,333
but she shows
no trace of it at all.

307
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,208
What formidable
willpower this girl possesses!

308
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,375
There are
one hundred eight

309
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,416
Earthly desires in
one's heart...

310
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,750
One hundred eight...

311
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,958
By casting them
aside, you'll then be able

312
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,583
to clearly see the
path you seek.

313
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,375
Cast them aside,
and see the path I seek...

314
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,041
I wanna get laid...!

315
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,041
Oh, yeah!

316
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,000
I seek fornicating
with Kosuda...!

317
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,333
Bow chicka bow wow!

318
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,458
She's impressively decisive!

319
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,875
This PYT has already
achieved enlightenment!

320
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,250
B Gata H Kei.

321
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
On your left,

322
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,416
you can see Ogre Brand Tour's
Kyoto branch office building.

323
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,416
This building has
a thirty--year history.

324
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
It started out as
a main warehouse--

325
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,333
Wake up you
insensitive jerks and listen

326
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,958
to what the boring
lady has to say!

327
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Yamada...

328
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,333
I haven't even been able to
spend a second alone with him!

329
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,541
Favorite non--frog?

330
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,625
The sales guy alien
was my favorite.

331
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,666
Move faster, you lazy freaks!

332
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,541
Once the boat tour is over,

333
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,333
we've just got the
trip back home...

334
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,416
I bet I'm not gonna get the
chance to tell her at all now.

335
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,791
What's she doing?

336
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,375
What the crap?

337
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,791
We haven't moved on to any other
bases this entire freaking trip!

338
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,041
However...

339
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,541
if I work on him while
we're riding the boat,

340
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,083
maybe we can find a spot
on the train for copulation!

341
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,958
Yamada...!
I have to have you...!

342
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,083
I have to have you now!

343
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,291
Agh!

344
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,250
Rock out!

345
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,291
Cock out!

346
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,958
Yamada, what are you doing?!

347
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,583
Yamada, we better get on
the boat now or we'll miss it...

348
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,375
Huh?

349
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,625
What the hell...?

350
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,208
You two have literally
just missed the boat!

351
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,083
They left us.

352
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,750
What are we gonna do?

353
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,541
I have to tell you that I lo~

354
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,875
The trip causes a great fuss.

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,708
You guys are lucky!

356
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,250
You got a whole boat chartered
for just the two of you!

357
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,250
I'm finally sort of
alone with him...

358
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,166
I hope he's ready to have
the hell seduced out of him!

359
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,750
I see Mister Happy
is happy to see me.

360
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,333
Who am I kidding?

361
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,708
Holding his hand will
probably make him blow.

362
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,416
I'm so excited I feel like
I'm gonna explode.

363
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,916
I'm finally alone with her...

364
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,375
...sort of.

365
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,583
We're surrounded by all
this amazing scenery...

366
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,708
...it's the perfect time
to say something.

367
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,250
If I don't take
this opportunity,

368
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,708
I might not be able to tell
her 'til after we graduate...

369
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,875
Then, we probably won't see each

370
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,250
other again for,
like, ten whole years.

371
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,083
Yamada?

372
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,583
Hey, Yamada!

373
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,083
Do you know that loser?

374
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,041
No, never seen him before.

375
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,958
Hey, limp dick!

376
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,875
Quit your slacking!

377
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,791
No!

378
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,958
I don't want things to
end up like that with her!

379
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,458
Ohmigah! Hands...!
We can totally hold hands!

380
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,375
Gently...

381
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,333
Bulging.

382
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,916
It knows what
I'm thinking before I do!

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,666
So, we're going to sit here
like two frogs on a rock.

384
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,083
Is it gonna end like this
without anything happening?

385
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,166
Bummer.

386
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,208
We came this far
and we're finally alone,

387
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,291
but we're still about to
go back without a single

388
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,500
new base being covered...!

389
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,416
Is that really okay
with you, Kosuda...?

390
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,125
A high school trip is
a once in a lifetime thing...!

391
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,125
Once in a sexy,
super hot lifetime!

392
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,083
I can do it...

393
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,291
Just say the words...

394
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,166
I'm in...

395
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,708
I'm in lo...

396
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,458
This sucks...

397
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,916
Um...
Yamada...

398
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,916
I want to tell you something.

399
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,958
--I think you should know I'm in
--Jerk overboard!

400
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:01,833
You jack wagon!

401
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:02,875
After the way you've treated me,

402
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,250
you deserve
to fall in the river!

403
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,000
What did I do?

404
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,000
Man I can't believe
the trip is already over...

405
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,500
That was way too fast.

406
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,750
We never got the chance to
talk to Kyoto chicks, either.

407
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,166
We are not cool, my friends...

408
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,166
Even girls from our
school won't talk to us.

409
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,458
Yamada...

410
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,583
Nothing happened...

411
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,041
--Three entire days...
--Uh oh, I think we've lost her.

412
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,375
Three. Entire. Days...
...and nada.

413
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,458
Hey, Yamada...!

414
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,750
I heard that you
and Kosuda got to

415
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,333
ride on a boat tour
all by yourselves...

416
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,500
Did anything happen?

417
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,833
What?

418
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,875
Why don't you try looking
at him and then looking

419
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,041
at me and not
asking that again?!

420
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
Yeah...
It's cool...

421
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,708
I'm sorry...

422
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,708
And a bit relieved.

423
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,791
Get away from me!

424
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,083
Why are you so angry?!

425
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,458
Kosuda, don't
let that bum you out.

426
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,833
You got to spend time
with her alone, right?

427
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,291
Sounds awesome if you ask me.

428
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,666
Yeah, you two are
in different leagues.

429
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,583
This meat is
really good, you guys.

430
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,666
I guess...

431
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah, you're right.

432
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,250
Different leagues?
Is that why she got so upset...?

433
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,375
It makes sense though.

434
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,541
But then, why~

435
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,041
I dunno...
she's really confusing.

436
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,958
Are you feeling all
right Kosuda you look

437
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,041
kinda sick and
you're not eating at all...

438
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,333
In that case...
Can I have your meat?

439
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,875
Wow, way to
be sensitive, dude.

440
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,750
You are such a good
friend it's not even funny.

441
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,916
When we get back to Tokyo,

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,333
can I stop by your
house for a bit?

443
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,375
Yeah, sure.
I don't see why not.

444
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,500
Whatever!

445
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,625
You don't own me,
school trip couple!

446
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,458
You're gonna break
up tomorrow anyway!

447
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,250
Not that I blame you
or that that made sense,

448
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,458
but turn down
the bitterness, lady.

449
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,625
Wonderful news.

450
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,500
Nothing at all good
happened to Yamada.

451
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,208
I had fun, though.

452
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,500
I got the chance to meet
students from other schools.

453
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,833
I bought a special
souvenir for Keiichi, too!

454
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,833
Wow, Miyano!

455
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,166
You bought a lot of
crap to take home, huh?

456
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,750
Yeah...

457
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,500
They're for my family, Kazuki,
and accidentally for Kosuda too.

458
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,041
That's nice,
but you can't actually give

459
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,041
it to him because
that would be weird.

460
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,583
Misato!

461
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,625
Do tell, did anything
exciting happen?

462
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,000
As a matter of fact it did!

463
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,833
A group of guys from
another school totally

464
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,500
talked to me,
and it was awesome!

465
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,291
I don't think asking
for directions counts...

466
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,583
...like at all.

467
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,250
Tokyo...!

468
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,166
Arriving at Tokyo!

469
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Everyone's dismissed.

470
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,208
You're to go home
immediately, okay?

471
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
No exceptions!

472
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,583
The trip's not over until
you get home, understood?!

473
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,166
Can we go drown my
sorrows in sugary soda!

474
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,375
Can't...

475
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,166
Sorry. I promised to
meet someone after this.

476
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,375
No way! You are not
meeting your boyfriend!

477
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,333
Hey there...
Remember me?

478
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,416
The next stop is Oosedo...

479
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,916
After Oosedo,

480
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,208
this train will not make its
next stop until Igarashi...

481
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,166
I can't believe
nothing happened...

482
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,583
What's the deal, anyway?

483
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,083
Doesn't Kosuda like me anymore?

484
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,208
This is starting
to get ridiculous...

485
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,666
I dunno; maybe I just
need to find a different guy.

486
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,083
Yamada, wait!

487
00:18:59,041 --> 00:18:59,791
What the~?

488
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,791
What are you doing?

489
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,958
Catching up!

490
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,708
Catching up with what?

491
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,125
I've been trying
to catch up with you

492
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,458
ever since we switched trains...

493
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,875
...but I ended up
helping a little kid

494
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,791
that was all
alone during rush hour.

495
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,666
Then, someone thought I was
a pervert, which wasn't fun.

496
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,666
He followed me all this way...

497
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,625
That's not a
"nothing happened" at all.

498
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,666
That is totally a
"something happened"!

499
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,541
There's nothing to
discuss, Kosuda.

500
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,333
Please!

501
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,291
You have to listen to me!

502
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,458
No, it doesn't matter...

503
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,500
Look, I'm not even
into you, okay?

504
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,041
Listen to me!!!

505
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,791
It does matter...
I have something to say to you.

506
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,416
It matters...
because I...

507
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,875
It matters because I...

508
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,208
lo...

509
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,958
Lo...

510
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,083
Lo...

511
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,291
Looooo...
You...

512
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,791
I did it!

513
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,041
I finally told her how I feel
and it wasn't even a lie...!

514
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,916
I might not have
looked the coolest...

515
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
But I'm still glad
that I did it...

516
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,041
No matter how she responds,
I know I'll be okay...

517
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,625
That's not true.

518
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,500
What did he say?

519
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,000
I couldn't hear him at all!

520
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,041
Lo...

521
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,125
Like wearing
see--through lingerie?

522
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,875
Live for streaking?

523
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Maybe I heard him wrong...
but I swear he said love...

524
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,458
I mean, if he followed
me home just to tell me,

525
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,458
it would have to be good, right?

526
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,583
What an idiot!

527
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,791
Talk about living
in a dream world...!

528
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,958
I mean, as if!

529
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,583
Who does that photo
fan boy think he is?

530
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,958
Someone seems to
be overcompensating,

531
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,375
It's not like I'm happy
about it or anything...

532
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,750
But at least this will guarantee
I'll get to have sex with him.

533
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,583
Although, what if I'm wrong...?

534
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,166
He might not have said
what I think he probably said.

535
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,500
I like you better
with makeup on.

536
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,208
You have bad skin.

537
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,833
That stupid virgin photographer!

538
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,041
If that's what he really thinks,

539
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,583
wait till he gets a
load of me all naked!

540
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,458
No matter how angry she gets,
she's always ready to go.

541
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
Lo... Lo...

542
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,875
Huh?

543
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,041
Well, let me think...

544
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,958
He could have meant lecher.

545
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,333
No surely that's not it...

546
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,333
Maybe lewd.

547
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,916
I don't even know you...

548
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,291
Like there could be a guy who
wouldn't fall in love with me?

549
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,166
Right...

550
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,291
So what are you gonna tell him.

551
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,666
Huh?
What do you mean?

552
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
He confessed
his feelings to you,

553
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,625
now you have to
tell him yours...

554
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,166
That's kind of how
these things work.

555
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,375
No way, that's dumb!

556
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,666
Why would I do that?

557
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,916
She is unbelievable...

558
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,375
Let's try this slower.

559
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,041
Do you like him, or would
you rather just be friends?

560
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,625
A... sex...

561
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,666
...friend.

562
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,083
A sex friend is
not a friend, okay?

563
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,333
So you gonna tell him
you don't like him, then?

564
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,833
I might have
been too hard on her.

565
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,166
No!

566
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,750
If I say I don't like him,
how will we have sex?

567
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,250
Seriously?

568
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,791
I'm still glad I told her...

569
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,708
...but I wonder if she
didn't understand me...

570
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,291
I should talk to her.

571
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,500
Yamada!

572
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,541
Yamada?!

573
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,125
Damn it!

574
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,541
Why do I always run away just
when it starts getting good?!

575
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,375
The flowing river
never stops and

576
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,958
yet the water
never stays the same.

577
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,625
Foam floats upon
the pools scattering,

578
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,333
reforming,
never lingering too long...

579
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,500
So it is with man and all his
dwelling places here on Earth.

580
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,500
Hey, it's Kosuda, can we talk?

581
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,333
I'll be in the photography
club room during lunch...

582
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,541
Yamada!

583
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,833
Talk to me!

584
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,166
I guess that must be her answer.

585
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,416
A big fat no.

586
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,291
How am I supposed
to know what it

587
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,916
means to like
someone or not...?!

588
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,791
I just want to get deflowered!

589
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,458
He makes me feel stupid,
but he's stupid!

590
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,416
Stupid!

591
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:02,250
♪ closing song ♪

592
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,291
That stupid Kosuda...

593
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,666
I don't understand what it means
to like someone or not, hello!

594
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,958
Do you know me?!

595
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,916
Wait, Kosuda!
We're in the classroom!

596
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,791
Everyone's here!

597
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,666
Hold on a sec!

598
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,583
I'm in love with you, Yamada!

599
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,166
You idiot!

600
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,541
Next time, I'll show
you how bold I can be!

601
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,208
The other story
is about field day!

602
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,500
See you next time!
