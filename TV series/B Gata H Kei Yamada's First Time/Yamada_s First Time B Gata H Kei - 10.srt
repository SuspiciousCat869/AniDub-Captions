1
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,958
So um...
It's been awhile...

2
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,708
...since we went out I mean...

3
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,791
Would you ever give
me another chance?

4
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:44,750
Sure, whatever.

5
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't care.

6
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,791
And so, they're gonna
give it another go...!

7
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,125
This time, you better
get the goods

8
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,708
while the goods
are good to be got!

9
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,750
So you know...

10
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,583
H is for humpin'!

11
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,375
We've already kissed.

12
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,958
Do I have to do the deed next?

13
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,083
What if I'm not good at it?

14
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,625
Actually...

15
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,541
I've been trying hard not to
think about this, but what if...

16
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,375
Yamada...
Already has 'experience'?

17
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,333
You're kidding me, right...?

18
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,666
I bet Yamada and Kanejo
have tons of experience.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,500
They probably know techniques
we haven't even heard of before.

20
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,291
Yeah, they've gotta be right.

21
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,875
What about Misato?

22
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:21,958
What?!

23
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,625
You are freaking
kidding me right now?!!

24
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,541
No way in hell...

25
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,791
Absolutely not.

26
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,833
Come on, I know
you're a boob guy, but still...

27
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,791
You guys all know she's
going to get nailed by someone.

28
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,708
True, oh, and right
in the middle of it...

29
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,291
Premature ejaculator much?

30
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,416
She's not gonna be able to
help that loud mouth of hers.

31
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,875
Whatever; like that
would ever happen.

32
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,875
What if...

33
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,666
Wow... Hopeless and a
minuteman, fantastic.

34
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Die!

35
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,500
I bet Yamada would be
way worse than Misato.

36
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,583
Are you kidding me...?!

37
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,375
You don't have
a problem with that?!

38
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,333
You're so hard-core!

39
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,625
A hard-core masochist.

40
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,875
A two-pump chump is okay.

41
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,666
What are you doing?

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,166
I'm practicing what I'd say
in case Kosuda fails miserably.

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,500
You are seriously messed up.

44
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,458
Wow, you finished
before we even got started...

45
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,583
That's okay...
it happens all the time.

46
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,333
No way!

47
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,833
You can't blow before
you cross the threshold!

48
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,958
Poor guy...

49
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,125
He has no clue what
he signed up for.

50
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,083
The Kanejo Family.

51
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,708
Richy brother's
sparkling secret!

52
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,750
This time, I'll get
there really early...

53
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,916
Maybe Yamada will
be there early, too...!

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,958
Who am I kidding?

55
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,666
I wish we were
that much in synch.

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,041
Actually...

57
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,625
Guess who's already there!

58
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,291
Who the hell does
he think he is?!

59
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,541
This is unforgiveable.

60
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,083
I shouldn't have to wait!

61
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,125
I guess it could be my fault
for getting here an hour early.

62
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,541
Might as well lip gloss back up.

63
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,750
How you doin'?

64
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,958
You're late!
Let's go!

65
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,541
Awesome!

66
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,708
Note to self, start using that
how you doin' line all the time!

67
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,416
It's not easy being
me and by myself.

68
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,666
I always get hit on...

69
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,166
Being pretty is harder
than you might think.

70
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,041
Keiichi...!

71
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,541
Keiichi!

72
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,458
Where is he...?

73
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,208
How could he just disappear?

74
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,208
Oh, he went out for a bit, Miss.

75
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:09,791
Why...?

76
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,166
Oh, I swear...

77
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,041
I need to lock him up to
keep him from wandering off.

78
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,916
Well, now...

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,416
Let's not get carried away...

80
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,750
I brought tea; is there
anything specific you'd like?

81
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,583
Yes, a dungeon.

82
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
Ow. My back
went out again.

83
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,458
Are you okay, ma'am...?

84
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,083
Let me help you.

85
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,750
Mommy...!

86
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,916
Where are you?!

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,833
Mommy!

88
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,875
Come back!

89
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,000
Help...!
My water broke!

90
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
Sorry to trouble you...

91
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,791
...but could you tell me
where Jinbou-cho is...?

92
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
Did I say that right?

93
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,333
Or is it Jinbou-cho?

94
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,333
Jinbou-choo?

95
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,791
I'm supposed...
to be somewhere...

96
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,750
It's official!

97
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,916
That loser's late!

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,083
You're still five minutes early.

99
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,458
What an insensitive jerk!

100
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,125
He obviously should
have come here early

101
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,750
because he should
want to see me sooner!

102
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,041
Well, fine!
He's dead to me!

103
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:56,791
Dead!

104
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,208
Yamada!

105
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,708
You are dead to me!

106
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,375
Dead Mister Late-Face. Now
let's get to a hotel already!

107
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,666
I did it!
I finally asked him!

108
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,041
Yeah, keep on rolling, girl!

109
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,875
Get it while the getting's good!

110
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,000
A hotel?

111
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,166
Kanejo's big brother?

112
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,125
Yamada...!
I'm so sorry!

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,750
You thought I was him...?

114
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,000
Bummer.

115
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,541
That's Kanejo's
brother, isn't it?

116
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,583
About the other day...
I wanted to apologize.

117
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,583
A token of our new friendship.

118
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,833
What the hell do
you think you're doing?!

119
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,125
I was hoping I could make
it up to you somehow.

120
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,416
Look at that table.

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,000
That's like the
cutest couple ever!

122
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,125
They have to be models!

123
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
Yeah, they're gorgeous...

124
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,833
And I hate them.

125
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,375
Wait a minute...
Is someone else at their table?

126
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,750
I didn't even notice that guy.

127
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,583
I bet he gets that all the time.

128
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,375
What is happening right now?

129
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,541
I don't get it...!

130
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,000
Is this karmic punishment
for being late?

131
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,541
Why did I have to agree to this?

132
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,958
I hate it when
I'm overly nice to

133
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,208
make up for feeling awkward...

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,583
Well, I'm going to the bathroom.

135
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,791
I'm Keiichi Kanejo...

136
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,083
Good to meet you.

137
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,166
I'm Kosuda...

138
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,125
Nice meeting you too.

139
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,125
Is he in to Yamada?

140
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,833
Hey... so...

141
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,083
So what's the story
with you and Yamada?

142
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,000
Should I tell him
I'm dating her...?

143
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,208
There's no way I can
compete with a guy like that!

144
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,208
I'm... well...

145
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,375
I'm kinda...

146
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,833
Uh, we...
I just like her a lot!

147
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:29,791
Oh man...

148
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,375
Unrequited love...
That sucks.

149
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,125
It's not unrequited...
is it?

150
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,708
The important thing is you're
not 'dating her' or anything...

151
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,166
In that case,
I'm gonna ask her out.

152
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,208
You're cool with that, right?

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,416
I don't care how hot he is,
Kosuda is my priority...

154
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
He's my little cherry boy!

155
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,708
He's just a spoiled,
rich kid anyway;

156
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,166
like I need that drama...

157
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,458
He probably got deflowered
by one of his trampy maids.

158
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,875
And I'm sure he's
been practicing on

159
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
everything that's
looked at him funny.

160
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,500
Gah!
It's not fair!

161
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,041
Why can't I have his
awesome sex filled life?!

162
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,416
Kosuda? What's wrong
with your face?

163
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,541
Nothing...

164
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,583
I was just telling
him that I hoped you

165
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,458
were as into me
as I am into you.

166
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,458
Yeah, well, I'm not.

167
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,166
Did you hear
what she just said?!

168
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,416
I don't understand...

169
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,791
Is this what rejection is like?

170
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,333
I'm sorry, I must not
have made myself clear...

171
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,583
Would you like
to go out with me?

172
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,708
No!

173
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,875
No way...

174
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,750
Are you telling me
no because of Kosuda?

175
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,000
What?
Try making some sense!

176
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,458
It has nothing to
do with Kosuda, okay?

177
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,708
The point is I
can't go out with you.

178
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,416
Why not?

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,166
Because, obviously...
You're not rocking your v-card.

180
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,541
That girl just called him out.

181
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,791
And she did it so loud, too.

182
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,541
Yeah, I don't understand
why it's an issue.

183
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,083
You want a
guy who's a virgin...

184
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,333
Or else it's a deal breaker?

185
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,625
That's right.

186
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,625
Is that all she sees in me?

187
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,125
Sorry to disappoint you...

188
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,791
...but I'm actually
still carrying my...

189
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,541
..."v--card."

190
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,000
You've never done
the nasty before?

191
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,375
Why not?!

192
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,416
I'm curious as to why
you're so fixated on sex...

193
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,416
It's not necessarily
something that has to be done.

194
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,916
Don't act so pretentious!

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,625
FYI, this lady plans on getting
busy and staying that way!

196
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,708
I probably shouldn't say that...

197
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,125
What about if you're in love?
It should be okay then, right?

198
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,166
I like where
she's going with this.

199
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,041
No, I don't disagree...

200
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,875
It's just...

201
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,291
Believe me, I've had thousands
of women come on to me...

202
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,916
I've just never felt 'that way'
about any of them before.

203
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,416
I've eliminated every
single woman who

204
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,083
had even the slightest
chance of being the one...

205
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,958
I wanted to keep him pure.

206
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,333
The truth of the matter is...

207
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,125
I want my first
time to be special.

208
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,125
So he could have gotten his

209
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,666
freak on a million
times already,

210
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,041
but he chose not to because
he wants it to be "special"?

211
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,000
Can I shoot him, please?

212
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,500
Of course, all that's changed...

213
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,250
...now.

214
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,833
You're the first girl I've
ever asked out, Yamada.

215
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,083
If you wanna know the truth,

216
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,958
you're different from
all those other girls...

217
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,708
You're special.

218
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,291
What's he doing...?

219
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,416
Is he trying to change my mind?
Well, I'm not havin' it!

220
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,458
I don't believe him anyway...
He's popular.

221
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,541
There's no way he hasn't climbed
Mount Pork--o--lay--la yet.

222
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,708
You're no mountain
climber yourself.

223
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,333
A super, wicked
hot cherry boy...?

224
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,166
I didn't even think
such a thing existed.

225
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,375
If that's true, then
he's like perfect for me.

226
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,333
He's gotta be the finest piece
of virgin in the whole world.

227
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,125
Suppose he's telling the truth.

228
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,458
That means he's
the guy I've been

229
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,166
looking for my entire
high school career.

230
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,250
Crap, I think I'm late...

231
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,208
I forgot I'm supposed to
meet up with my sister.

232
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,208
I'm sorry, but I
have to be going now...

233
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
I hope you'll reconsider...

234
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,916
I really do.

235
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,208
I just totally blew him off,
and he still wants

236
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,166
me to reconsider
going out with him...?

237
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,875
There is something
not right about that guy.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,333
Although, I guess
he wouldn't really

239
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,750
know how to play
a girl, would he?

240
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,416
I guess that was all kind
of unexpected, wasn't it?

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,125
Why am I
smiling like an idiot...?

242
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,250
This qualifies as
the worst date ever!

243
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,958
So he let his
girlfriend get hit on by

244
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,375
someone way
better looking than him?

245
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,250
I can't tell if he's confident
or really pathetic.

246
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,625
He's a virgin...?

247
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,625
--Yamada!
--I can't believe it.

248
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,291
Where do you wanna go next?

249
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,375
I can totally smell hot guy!

250
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,958
Hey!
Hi Yamada...!

251
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
What's goin' on?

252
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,583
Misato!

253
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,916
Was there or was there
not a hottie right here...?

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,333
Kosuda, where'd you come from?

255
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,541
I've been here this whole time.

256
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,708
Why are you two hanging out?

257
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,541
Are you on a date?

258
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,250
No!

259
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,333
Not at all!

260
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,000
We just ran into
each other, that's all.

261
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:37,750
So...

262
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,583
I'll get going, now.

263
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,250
See ya later!

264
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,583
All that thinking about
sex for nothing.

265
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,458
Misato...
I'm going to kill you one day.

266
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,083
Maybe we should do it now.

267
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,166
There you are!

268
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,083
I was starting to get worried.

269
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,291
We still have plenty of time to

270
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,666
make it to
the concert, don't we?

271
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,083
Where were you, anyway?

272
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,208
I was having tea with Yamada.

273
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:10,250
I sorta confessed my love
to her, which was a first.

274
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,208
Oh, thank heavens...

275
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,416
It was just a bad dream.

276
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,333
You've been moaning
for the past three days.

277
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,375
Oh good, Kyoka,
you're finally awake...!

278
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,916
I'm not quite sure why,
but Yamada hasn't

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,375
responded to my
confession of love yet.

280
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,291
No!
Miss, please!

281
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,750
Is she okay?

282
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,833
Bonus!

283
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,500
It's time for Dirty Talk with
"Those High School Boys"!

284
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,000
How do you guys
feel about Miss Akai?

285
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,250
I think she's totally hot...

286
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,083
I mean she
teaches PE, but yeah...

287
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,333
Do you think
she's still a virgin?

288
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,666
I do.

289
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,166
No I'm not
comfortable discussing

290
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,500
things of this nature!

291
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,291
Dude, maybe it's
our turn to teach her!

292
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,041
Yeah, I could go for that.

293
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:44,750
Me too!

294
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,500
She's a TILF!

295
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,583
Totally.

296
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,416
Scene...!
That concludes Dirty Talk!

297
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,750
B Gata H Kei!

298
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,291
You are beyond rude!

299
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,500
Calm down, Judgie...

300
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,750
Don't sit there and
pretend that you didn't

301
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,208
think Hottie McHotterson
wasn't a virgin, either.

302
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,833
It doesn't matter, you can't
just tell someone you won't

303
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,166
go out with them unless they've
bumped uglies before...!

304
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,875
What's Kosuda
supposed to think, now?

305
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,625
That you're only after his
man hymen, which is true?!

306
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,916
Man hymen.

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,083
I don't understand...

308
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,291
Is she just after my
untapped resources?

309
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,541
Extraordinarily untapped.

310
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,958
There's no way...

311
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,333
But then again, what about
that first time I met her?

312
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,500
You're still a cherry
boy, am I right?

313
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,500
What does that mean?

314
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,583
Does she have a
weird fetish for virgins?!

315
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,791
All right...

316
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,250
I should clear up
this misunderstanding.

317
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,333
Kosuda...

318
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,708
I'm not just
into virgins; I mean,

319
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,750
yes you happen to
be one... but I...

320
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,666
Wait a minute, that's not
a misunderstanding.

321
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,375
That's why I picked him...!

322
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,333
I was looking for a virgin,
don't you remember?!

323
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,833
Well, yeah, at first that
might have been true,

324
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,166
but things are
kinda different now!

325
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,833
No they're not!
Shut up; you don't know!

326
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,416
I like cherry boys!

327
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,625
Then, Kanejo's brother should
work just fine for you, right?

328
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,250
You know, if you
really wanted to get laid...

329
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,625
you wouldn't be trying
to hunt down a cherry boy.

330
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,625
Seriously...
be honest with yourself.

331
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,875
What do you mean?

332
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,208
I mean, it doesn't matter
to you whether the

333
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,375
guy's penetrated
anything or not anymore...

334
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,083
You only care whether
the guy is Kosuda.

335
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,458
That was strange.

336
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,541
Let me explain...

337
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,000
See, when Yamada
has gone over the

338
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,666
limit to her mental
load capacity...

339
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,000
...her Yamada breaker,

340
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,750
located in the back
of her mind, gets thrown...

341
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,125
Restore!

342
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,541
No way, lady!
I like cherry boys!

343
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,333
OMG, she just went back
to her last save point!

344
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,708
On my way to love?

345
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,833
Don't hit on my Kosuda!

346
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,875
Look!
Kanejo's come back...!

347
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,916
Hey girl!

348
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,791
You've been gone
for a whole week...

349
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,791
Colds are the worst, yeah?

350
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,666
So...

351
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,666
Maybe she's still feeling sick?

352
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,041
Wow...
That's random.

353
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,833
I can't believe my brother
confessed his love to Yamadog.

354
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,541
On top of that,
it happened while she

355
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,708
was out on a date
with Komatsubara...

356
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,791
His name is Kosuda!

357
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,291
Please, you can't blame her...

358
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,625
The shock has given Miss a
few short--term memory issues.

359
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,416
She better get ready
because like I said from

360
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,083
the very beginning, I'm gonna
steal her boyfriend...!

361
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,291
And then...

362
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,041
I'll throw him away
like a piece of trash!

363
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,458
Welcome back, lady...

364
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,208
How are you feeling?

365
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,458
Wait a minute...

366
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,958
Miyano is a childhood
friend of Koitabashi...

367
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,541
Or Kosuda, whatever.

368
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,583
But I don't know...

369
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,708
He seems inappropriate to me.

370
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,208
Hey, Miyano!

371
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,125
So... what kind
of a guy is Kosuda?

372
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,208
What...?

373
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,541
Now even Kanejo
is interested in him?!

374
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,500
I thought I'd be able to
stay by his side forever...

375
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,041
Just being near him
would've made me happy.

376
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,875
But I wasn't paying attention...

377
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,416
And now he's beyond my reach.

378
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,291
Don't give up on me, girl...!

379
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
You can do it!

380
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,250
No, it's fine.

381
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,958
Yamada and Kanejo
are wonderful people,

382
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,000
and I'm sure they have Kosuda's
best interests at heart.

383
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,250
Kosuda...?

384
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,250
He's a really cool guy...
and super kind...

385
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,333
...he's a man's man, too.

386
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,416
I think you misunderstood...

387
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,333
I'm asking about Kosuda.

388
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,541
Absolutism in France
was established under

389
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,000
the Bourbon Dynasty
that started with Henry IV.

390
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,041
I wonder what she really wants.

391
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,583
I think I need to get
advice from someone...

392
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,333
But who do I know that would
actually take me seriously.

393
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,958
Miyano?

394
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,500
I brought some food for you...
I wasn't spying or anything.

395
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,000
Thanks, I think.

396
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,208
Hey, um...

397
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,541
Would you maybe help
me out with something?

398
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,125
Relationship advice?

399
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,500
Yeah, but if not...

400
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,541
...that's cool.

401
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,375
No, um, whatever
I can do to help...

402
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,583
When we were kids I talked to

403
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,375
you about that boy
stuff, remember.

404
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,583
I'm sorry...

405
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,958
I know we don't talk
as much as we should,

406
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,791
what with being friends
for such a long time.

407
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,958
Stabbed!

408
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,666
Yeah...
no big deal.

409
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,666
Oh...

410
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,875
...so you and Yamada have
gone out several times, then.

411
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

412
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,750
But... the two of
you don't get along

413
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,833
at school like at all.

414
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,916
Stabbed!

415
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,333
You think so, too...?

416
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,125
I'm afraid she's
just being mean to me.

417
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,541
No. I don't think Yamada
could be mean to anyone...

418
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,250
She's such a sweet person.

419
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,041
You think she's sweet?!

420
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,666
I know how much you
care about her, Kosuda.

421
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,208
Everyone does...

422
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,375
You told her how you felt in
front of the whole class...

423
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,208
And...

424
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,791
I thought it was real cute.

425
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,625
Thanks...

426
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,166
I'm glad I did it.

427
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,458
I'm sure eventually Yamada
will tell you how she feels...

428
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,250
How could she not?

429
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,875
Thanks, Miyano...

430
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,791
I'm starting to feel
better already.

431
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,041
You're an awesome girl,
you know that?

432
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,708
Is it cool if I ask your
advice again sometime?

433
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,708
What happened?!

434
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,875
Why are you
supporting the love life

435
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,500
of someone you should be lovin'?

436
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,583
It's okay.

437
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,125
You know,
they say the best couples

438
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,166
are the ones who
started off as friends!

439
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,791
Stop it!
Go away devil whispers!

440
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,666
The next day!

441
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,375
Kosuda, you belong to the
photography club, right...?

442
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,083
What kind of
pictures do you take?

443
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,833
Yeah, that's right!

444
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,166
I wonder what this is about.

445
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,125
Normally, she barely
says hi to me.

446
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,958
It doesn't even matter
that I don't know you...

447
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,416
if I just keep talking to you
and looking at you like this,

448
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,291
you won't be able
to contain yourself...

449
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,000
I can taste Yamada's
bitterness already.

450
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,250
How does she make
her face sparkle like that?!

451
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,000
What's skankosaurus doing now?

452
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,416
She better not
be hitting on Kosuda!

453
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
You thieving little harpy!

454
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,166
Oh...

455
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,333
Yeah I didn't realize there were

456
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,416
so many ways to
take pictures of scenery.

457
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,583
This crap is taking forever.

458
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,208
Why hasn't he
fallen for me yet...?

459
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,791
This is my
best stare, he should be

460
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,708
a puddle of love goo by now!

461
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,041
Looks like you and Yamada
are after the same thing.

462
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,250
Oh no!

463
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,916
What if Yamada used
her body on him already!

464
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,750
I can't compete
with a devil of the flesh!

465
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,583
Don't say that...!

466
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,666
It's not very ladylike!

467
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,958
Not very ladylike,
but very true.

468
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,125
Man...!

469
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,333
What the heck
are they talking about...

470
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:58,958
Fine...

471
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm all over this.

472
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,375
It's time for a Yamada Style
Secret Technique called...

473
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,750
Yamada knows how
to read lips, fool!

474
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,541
My brother enjoys
photography, too...

475
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,125
You should come over sometime...

476
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,875
We could talk about
pictures and hang.

477
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,583
You should come over sometime...

478
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,625
We could talk about...

479
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,041
We... could... take... some...

480
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,333
...hot... pictures... and...

481
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,666
...bang.

482
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,583
What the hell?!

483
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,375
You're not reading
her lips right!

484
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,375
Come on, there's no way she
would say anything like that.

485
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,791
She's not you, okay...?

486
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,416
It's all just your
wild imagination.

487
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,208
It is so not my
wild imagination...!

488
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,583
It was my lip reading technique,

489
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,041
and that's never
wrong, thank you!

490
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,583
Trust me you're only
saying that because

491
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,083
you don't know
deceptiskank's true colors!

492
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,958
You're right, Yamada.

493
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,541
She's finally lost her
will to argue back.

494
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,083
It was nice of Kanejo
to invite me over,

495
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,208
but I can't realistically go
to another girl's house

496
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,250
without saying anything
about it to Yamada.

497
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,833
Mister Kosuda!

498
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,750
Welcome, sir...

499
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,291
Please get in.

500
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,208
Let's go!

501
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,500
I promise I won't bite!

502
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,541
Please sir!

503
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,458
Get in!

504
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,791
Please sir!

505
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,750
How in the heck am I
supposed to say no to that.

506
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
Isn't that Kanejo's
annoying limo?

507
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,083
Isn't that Kosuda inside...?!

508
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,791
I can't believe it.
She kidnapped him.

509
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,208
Seriously?!

510
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,666
Welcome home, Miss Kanejo!

511
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,041
I'm sorry...

512
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,250
I didn't realize my
brother wasn't home.

513
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,958
Whoa!

514
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,833
She's wearing a dress...
and looks amazing and proper...

515
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,333
She's like the
perfect good girl.

516
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,250
So, it seems you and Yamada
have gotten pretty close...

517
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,583
That's great, but are you
interested in any other girls?

518
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,375
For example...

519
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,708
What about...

520
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,208
...me?

521
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,875
About you...?
What do you mean?

522
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,500
What's she doing?

523
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,291
I'm so confused.

524
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,208
What on Earth is going on?!

525
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,500
Wait...

526
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,041
I'm gonna be okay, right...?

527
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,000
He's not gonna attack me out of
the blue or anything, is he?

528
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,833
Yes!
I shall have you now!

529
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,041
No!

530
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,375
I can't go any
further with him than this!

531
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,041
You realize that attitude
is how Yamada will win?

532
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,666
Oh, right...

533
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,625
I'm not really sure what
I should do at this point.

534
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,541
You seduce him,
that's what, you ninny!

535
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,250
Seduce him?

536
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,416
I've never seduced anyone
before, so I don't know how...

537
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,250
Oh wait!
I could expose myself!

538
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,958
Here goes nothing...

539
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,458
Expose!

540
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,458
Kanejo...

541
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,000
What are you~

542
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,125
It's working, he's almost mine!

543
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,875
This is it!

544
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,291
It's a matter of time before
Kosuda becomes that love goo!

545
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,625
Afternoon, Miss...

546
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,291
I brought you some tea.

547
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,583
You've got it wrong,
Ms. Ichihara...

548
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,625
You don't understand...

549
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,500
I was trying to seduce him...!

550
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
Y'know what...

551
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,875
...he's extraordinarily
resistant to my feminine charms.

552
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,125
Can I ask you something?

553
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,583
Yes, Miss.

554
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,750
You wouldn't, by chance
know of any secret way I

555
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,500
could make him fall for
me instantly, would you?

556
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,250
Holy...

557
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,291
My brain won't stop hurting.

558
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,375
Kosuda...

559
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,583
Yamada!

560
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,833
The words that crossed Kosuda's

561
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,458
mind at that
particular moment...

562
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,041
They were neither,
"Why is she here?"

563
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,375
nor "It's not what
it looks like,

564
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,833
I swear to all things holy!"

565
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,791
Instead, Kosuda was
far more concerned

566
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,041
with the following words,
"She's going to kill me!"

567
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,250
I never dreamed Ms. Ichihara
would be so experienced

568
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,958
and know that many
ways to capture a man!

569
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,458
She's the epitome
of good service!

570
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,083
Using one of her techniques,
Kosuda will fall in no time!

571
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,708
I'm back!

572
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,916
I don't understand
why you went to

573
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,625
Kanejo's house
in the first place.

574
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,500
What's your deal?

575
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,625
I thought you liked me?!

576
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,416
I do; I'm sorry.

577
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,791
So...
what did she say?

578
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,208
She asked if I was
interested in any other girls...

579
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,125
...besides you, I mean.

580
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,083
I don't have time for
you to flake out on me, now!

581
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,375
I've worked really hard,
and I'm almost there!

582
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,125
You're almost there...?
Almost where?

583
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,333
Nowhere!

584
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,791
 Yeah...

585
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,041
Okay.

586
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,291
I'm almost ready
to admit I like you...

587
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,833
You got a problem with that?

588
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,458
Nope...
We're good.

589
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,875
To be continued!
