1
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,000
Eros Deity here...

2
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,458
Today's the 18th of December.

3
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,500
Go!

4
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,958
I can't believe it's
almost Christmas Eve!

5
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:51,416
That will be the day!

6
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,166
I'm gonna get Kosuda's heart!

7
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,500
I already know what
kind of lingerie I'll wear!

8
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,541
Ogre Brand will
provide the protection!

9
01:01:57,625 --> 01:02:00,666
And I've researched
several sexy positions!

10
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,708
It must be hard
for you to be that pretty and

11
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:05,666
perfect and yet still
be so painfully not a lady.

12
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,500
Chika...!

13
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,791
What do you think of this?!

14
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:08,916
I'm the present!

15
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,208
Merry Christmas!

16
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,541
Yet again.

17
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:14,208
Still not a lady.

18
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,958
Romantic Christmas Eve!

19
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,291
What does the
first kiss taste like?

20
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,166
Yamada!

21
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,166
Hey, I'm home!

22
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,333
I see that.

23
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,916
She brought a boy with her.

24
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,083
Hey.

25
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,666
He's super hot, too.

26
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,875
Well, hello there.

27
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,375
I'm so stupid!

28
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,625
I can't believe I hit on
my own sister's boyfriend!

29
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:38,625
What's with your sister?

30
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:39,666
Is she gonna be okay?

31
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:40,541
Don't worry about it.

32
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,416
That's kind of her thing.

33
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,208
So who's your
favorite character?

34
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,583
I like the girl the best.

35
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,041
I don't understand how
she got such a cute guy...?

36
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:50,750
Her last boy was cute too...

37
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:51,875
And the one before that...

38
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,458
And the one before that!

39
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:54,458
Noo.

40
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,208
She can't be more
popular than me!

41
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:59,041
She's way short,
and I'm so much prettier.

42
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:00,875
Don't forget about boobs.

43
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:03,166
Mine are huge compared to hers!

44
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:07,250
By the way, Chika, your
sister's like really pretty.

45
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:11,416
Did I upset you?

46
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,583
I'm fine!

47
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,958
I'm just proud of
my sister, that's all!

48
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,208
Don't worry!

49
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,875
Because she's nothing
compared to you!

50
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,666
Thank you.

51
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:23,458
Well, bye then.

52
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:25,541
Yeah, I'll see you later.

53
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,791
So, it turns out you're
pretty popular, huh...?

54
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,916
You ever gonna narrow
it down to one guy?

55
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,208
Yeah, eventually...

56
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,958
I'm not in any rush though.

57
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:37,666
After all when I think
about it, I'm still a child...

58
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,625
I've never known
true love, not really...

59
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:41,958
Don't get me wrong I adore

60
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,791
being lavished with all
the attention...

61
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,458
I love it when
boys say they like me

62
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:47,208
or that I'm pretty
or buy me name--

63
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,166
brand merchandise
for no reason...

64
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,458
All this and still a child, too.

65
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,708
Only three more days
left until Christmas Eve!

66
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:56,166
What am I gonna do...?
It's almost Christmas,

67
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,916
and I don't have
a boyfriend, yet!

68
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,916
I don't know...

69
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,500
Come watch DVDs
with me as usual?

70
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:01,750
No way...!

71
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,083
That's something only a
pathetic loser would do!

72
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,125
Yes, I know.

73
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,458
That's why I'm
asking you to do it.

74
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,541
They're so funny.

75
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:08,958
I'm jealous of them.

76
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,708
I mean, they get to have
such an easy Christmas Eve...

77
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,000
You and I will be busy.

78
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:13,166
What are you talking about?

79
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,708
Taking care of
unwanted hair and stuff.

80
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,916
The constitution says couples
have to have sex that night.

81
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,083
You're kidding, right?

82
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:20,041
But couples still
do do it, don't they?

83
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:21,791
Yes.

84
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,125
So...

85
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:25,166
I'm guessing you have
a date set up with Kosuda?

86
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,833
No, he hasn't asked me out yet.

87
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:27,875
What?

88
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,208
I can't help it.
I like the show.

89
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,375
A kid detective?

90
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,875
Really?

91
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,125
I want to ask her out
for Christmas Eve...

92
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,250
I think she might
even say yes...

93
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,750
Man, I don't know...

94
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,458
She could just be
waiting for me to ask her...

95
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,208
I'm gonna do it!

96
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:45,916
Yamada...?

97
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,083
Are you free Christmas Eve?

98
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,250
Wanna go out with me?

99
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,291
--No, go out with me!
--No, go with me!

100
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,833
Oh...
I can't ask her out now.

101
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,208
Okay...

102
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,666
I'm finally alone with her.

103
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:04,541
What's he waiting for?
Ask me out already?!

104
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,708
Hey!
Wait a minute...

105
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,250
Am I ready to ask her out?

106
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,208
I don't even know
what we do on a date.

107
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:13,000
On top of that,
it's Christmas Eve!

108
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,458
Am I supposed to
get her a present...?

109
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,375
What about dinner?

110
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,541
If I pay will that insult her?

111
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:21,000
Whoopsie! Someone's
not used to asking girls out!

112
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,708
Gah...
What is his freakin' deal...?

113
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:26,833
Fine, I'll make this as
easy for him as possible.

114
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:31,416
So, Christmas is just
a few more days away.

115
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,583
I bet the hotel district
is gonna register

116
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,583
on the Richter scale that night.

117
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,041
Oh yeah!

118
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,000
Right there!
Oh, God!

119
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,083
That's nice!

120
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,708
I think I freaked him out!

121
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,083
Yamada!

122
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,541
Are you Christmas Eve on free?

123
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,166
Please?!

124
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:05,750
Well, if you insist, I guess you
can spend time with me...

125
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:09,000
Just don't take me
to someplace lame, okay?

126
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,666
Okay.

127
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,291
Yay!

128
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,166
V-Card, I just wanted
to say goodbye.

129
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,041
It's been great knowing you!

130
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,458
I wonder where Kosuda
is planning on taking me...

131
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:25,541
I'm sure we'll start
with a romantic dinner...

132
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,083
...then head on over
to a nice hotel suite.

133
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,375
Man it's pricey...

134
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,500
I should've picked
up some part time work.

135
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:34,875
She really is sweet...

136
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,250
Just weird.

137
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:37,916
Hi--yah...!

138
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,666
Two more days to go!

139
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,625
Takeshita!

140
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,375
Um, hey...

141
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,791
So I'm going out with
Yamada on Christmas Eve...

142
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,208
...and I'm not exactly
sure what I should

143
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,791
do about getting her a present.

144
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:50,625
Easy. It's the
thought that counts!

145
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,208
That's what they say...

146
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,458
Could you give me some advice
on what she'd like, though...?

147
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,958
I mean, I...

148
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:58,333
I want her to like it, but I
don't even know where to go.

149
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,500
Oh, okay...

150
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,666
If you want to know the truth,

151
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,708
she just wants to
go to a hotel...

152
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,833
Seriously.

153
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,500
This is good...

154
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:10,583
I've got the present
taken care of.

155
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,416
Now where to?

156
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,208
Takashi...!

157
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,875
Hey, is that a present?!
Tell me who it's for.

158
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,166
Are you going on a date?

159
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,166
Is it with Yamada?

160
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,041
Stop.

161
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,375
Nice!
Well played, sir...

162
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,416
Ooh, let me plan
out the date for you...!

163
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,833
I'm awesome at
that kind of thing.

164
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:24,916
So you say...

165
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,500
Have you ever gone
on a date before?

166
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,916
First of all, you two need to go
see a wrestling match together.

167
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,041
Hey...!

168
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,000
I asked if you've
ever been on a date!

169
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:32,083
Then you'll have to go get

170
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,583
some barbeque to
build up your stamina.

171
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:34,458
Quit ignoring me!

172
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:35,458
I asked you a question!

173
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:36,833
And then tell her how you feel!

174
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,125
That'll make her ready for
some serious wrestling!

175
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,208
You're just trying to
torture me, aren't you?!

176
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,583
I'm kidding!

177
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,458
Hi--yah...!

178
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,583
Finally, the holy of
Holy Nights has arrived.

179
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,041
Gorgeous!

180
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,958
Okay, I'm ready!

181
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:54,916
Looks good.

182
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,541
Now get changed,
or you're gonna be late.

183
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,541
Here.
Put this on.

184
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,333
Now for accessories.

185
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,250
Jeez, Kazuki...

186
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,625
Your handwriting is awful.

187
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,916
Hey, stranger.
I'm here.

188
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:19,416
Hey.

189
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,666
Incredible...

190
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,291
Every guy out here
is checking her out!

191
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,583
I bet they're all wondering
why she's with me.

192
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,333
Soak it all in, Kosuda!

193
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,500
I bet you're thanking
your lucky stars for running

194
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,583
into me that day
at the bookstore!

195
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,666
Normally I'd freak
out and run off just

196
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,708
when things started
getting interesting!

197
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,375
But not tonight!

198
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,166
I'm not letting you get away!

199
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,375
Hey, come back here!

200
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:54,583
Let go of him!

201
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:56,875
This girl's ready
to go, big time!

202
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,125
I feel like such an idiot!

203
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:03,000
Whatever. This is
all Kosuda's fault anyway.

204
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,083
What is taking so long?!

205
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,458
I'm tired of waiting...

206
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:09,041
Luckily I have
a technique I've been

207
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:10,916
mastering for
years that should work...

208
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,875
No one can resist falling
for me after a direct hit!

209
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:17,500
Special trick...
Yamada eyes.

210
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,541
Crap, my fork fell.

211
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:28,666
Oopsie!

212
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,625
Watch where you
point that thing!

213
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,166
Come on...

214
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,875
He's really starting
to piss me off!

215
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:37,458
Yamada seems mad at me.

216
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,416
Thanks a lot, Kazuki, your
date plan completely failed...

217
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,333
What am I supposed to do now?

218
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,458
What...?
A kiss?

219
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:46,958
How am I supposed to do that?

220
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,458
She looks like she'll kill me
if I go anywhere near her!

221
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,750
If he doesn't get over here and

222
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,125
kiss me soon,
I'm gonna kill him.

223
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,666
Oh wait...
I almost forgot.

224
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,375
I, uh, Yamada?

225
01:09:58,458 --> 01:09:59,375
What do you want?

226
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,791
I wanted...
to give you this.

227
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,458
Wow...

228
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,208
Thank you...

229
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,958
Can I open it now?

230
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,791
Yeah.

231
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:15,041
Pierced earrings...

232
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,458
Yamada, wait!

233
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,416
Great.
She hated it.

234
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:31,250
He got me pierced
earrings as a gift.

235
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,916
In other words...

236
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,666
I'd like to pierce
your hole too!

237
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,125
That's gotta be it!

238
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,291
Good job, Kosuda!

239
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,625
I was starting
to lose faith in you!

240
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:42,250
All right!
Let's go!

241
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,791
Okay, but, where
are we going exactly?

242
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,458
Here we go!

243
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,166
Why are we here?

244
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:57,958
Hotels by the hour?

245
01:10:58,916 --> 01:10:59,541
We...

246
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,333
We shouldn't be here.

247
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,250
Unless that's what she wants...?

248
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,833
Yamada eyes...

249
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,750
Search mode!

250
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,208
I wish I could figure her out.

251
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,833
I have no idea
what she's thinking!

252
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:21,833
Believe me...

253
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:24,000
it's not all that complicated.

254
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,833
I just need to
find the right hotel.

255
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,791
Yes!
This place seems perfect!

256
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,916
That was so great.

257
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,750
How embarrassing!

258
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,958
They totally just had sex!

259
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,583
Eeahhh!

260
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,583
Oh...

261
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,083
We're out of the hotel district.

262
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,208
I think I can kiss her here!

263
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,750
This is the right mood...
isn't it?

264
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:16,916
It doesn't matter...!

265
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,958
I'm doing it...!

266
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,666
Here I go!

267
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,791
Sorry, we went too far.

268
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,250
Yamada!

269
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:30,375
Yamada...

270
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:31,291
I...

271
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,125
I think I...

272
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,583
I think I'm...

273
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,166
in...

274
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,375
Love...?

275
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:40,500
Am I...?

276
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,583
Am I in love with her?

277
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:43,958
I mean, she's pretty,

278
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:46,416
so I wasn't thinking
about it too much.

279
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,750
But all those things I don't get
about her make me wonder...

280
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,791
I feel like I want to kiss
her now more than ever.

281
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,666
Kosuda?

282
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:57,875
I don't know what to do!

283
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,166
He's finally making a move...
I'm so happy...!

284
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,166
Why am I scared though...?

285
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,583
And why do I want
to run again...?

286
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,625
No...
Not this time!

287
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,958
Here I go!

288
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,958
I plan on celebrating tomorrow!

289
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:16,916
Damn it!
I messed things up again!

290
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,416
We're totally kissing!

291
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,333
On top of that,
I think the momentum

292
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,750
forced my tongue in
his mouth, too!

293
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,000
I, kissed her...

294
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,208
Yamada...

295
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,250
I kissed Yamada.

296
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:56,041
I don't care about
all that stupid crap...!

297
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,041
I'll follow Yamada to
the ends of the Earth...!

298
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,333
I kissed Yamada!

299
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,250
Yes!

300
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,458
Oh good.
He's finally into it...

301
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:02,666
Way to go, Yamada!

302
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,416
Sex should be right
around the corner now!

303
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,125
Yamada...?

304
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
Yamada...?

305
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,375
Where did you go?

306
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:14,250
Hellooooo?!

307
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,291
Yamada!

308
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,958
Oh, what am I gonna do...?

309
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,375
This is getting way too intense

310
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,458
and I don't have a
clue what's going on at all...

311
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,666
I'm so confused; I don't
know what to do anymore!

312
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,666
Snap out of it!

313
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,916
Now!

314
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,958
You sound like a silly
girl who doesn't even

315
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,875
want to sleep
with a hundred guys!

316
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:30,166
This is bad!

317
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,500
What's happened to Yamada?

318
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:35,041
And what's going to happen
to her sexual future?

319
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:38,416
B Gata H Kei.

320
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,875
I thought kissing was
going to be so easy.

321
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,000
I don't know~

322
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:52,916
What am I gonna do...?

323
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,666
I don't think I can
handle any more of this.

324
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,875
You need to get it together!

325
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,041
You've come too far
to run away this time!

326
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,333
My chest...

327
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,791
It hurts...

328
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:02,833
Ow ...

329
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,458
I can't face Kosuda, now...

330
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,458
I can't.

331
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:06,875
Come on!

332
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,125
I can't go back empty handed!

333
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:12,416
Let's go to the make out park!

334
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,375
Screw this stupid date plan...

335
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,916
The only thing that matters
to me is being with Yamada.

336
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,333
I just...

337
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:22,833
...don't know how to make
that happen at the moment.

338
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,208
Yamada!
Please wait for me!

339
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,041
I'll go with you anywhere!

340
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,583
Except there...

341
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,250
I can't really...
do that...

342
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,541
Can I...

343
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,666
I'm sorry, I've gotta take this.

344
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,750
Who is it?
Yamada?

345
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,875
Yeah...

346
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:40,750
Hey, what's up?

347
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,500
Is everything okay...?

348
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:43,333
Really?

349
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:44,708
Look at you go!

350
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,666
Thanks, I'm feeling
pretty good about it so far...

351
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,166
I just, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do next.

352
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,541
Help!

353
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,125
Try to breathe and remember
not to force anything.

354
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:54,250
What's important is how you guys
feel about each other, okay...?

355
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:57,416
I'm so excited for you;
I bet Kosuda's happy too, huh?

356
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,000
Uhh, well yeah!

357
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:01,625
It's not every day he gets to
kiss a wicked hot girl like me.

358
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,625
I mean, I'm way better
than what he deserves.

359
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,541
Yeah, you'll be fine.

360
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,500
First kiss, huh...

361
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,916
Now that I'm thinking clearly,
it's not that big of a deal.

362
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,125
Everyone kisses eventually...

363
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:14,916
What's more,
I bet they're doing a lot

364
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,500
more exciting stuff
than kissing...!

365
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:17,833
You guys will be, right...?

366
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:19,083
Later on tonight
you'll totally get it

367
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,875
on like donkey kong, won't you~?

368
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,375
Everything okay?

369
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,708
That's right...!

370
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:26,833
I can't abandon my
lifelong dream of getting it

371
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,000
on with a hundred
different guys!

372
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,541
That would be silly!

373
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:31,500
I don't have time to pout in the
stall of a public bathroom!

374
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:32,916
Right...!

375
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,708
And don't forget to wash your
hands before you leave.

376
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,166
Come on, we're going!

377
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,250
Okay!
I think.

378
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,208
Where are we going?

379
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,625
A park?

380
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,875
It's so stuffy
I can literally see it...

381
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,125
It must be pretty hot in there.

382
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:02,750
Oh, yeah!

383
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,125
Where the heck are we?!

384
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,083
Hello everybody,
and thanks for joining us

385
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,708
in Tokyo's most popular
make--out park!

386
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,875
The rumors were all right...

387
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:26,375
They say it gets
so hot in this park

388
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:28,083
you don't even know
it's winter...

389
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,125
I did so awesome!

390
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,958
Yamada must have
brought us here by accident.

391
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,833
She must be so
embarrassed right now!

392
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:37,166
Oh, yeah.

393
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,000
Wow...
this place is so cool...!

394
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,583
I'll have to bring
Takeshita some time.

395
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:41,541
She'd love it here.

396
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:42,791
Yeah, no thanks!

397
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,458
This is it!

398
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,208
Is this what she wants...?

399
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,500
For real...?

400
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:49,833
It has to be...

401
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,625
...which is awesome,
because I'm dying over here.

402
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:56,958
Excuse me...

403
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,000
But this is backwards isn't it?

404
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:02,791
I've come so far...!

405
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:05,125
Now I'm gonna go for it
with everything I've got!

406
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:06,916
That is what I'm talkin' about!

407
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,250
Listen to your instinct,

408
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,166
also known as what your
body is telling you to do!

409
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,833
Don't hold back,
and let her rip!!!

410
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,125
I'm so hot...

411
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,250
My body...

412
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,333
it's starting to
feel really warm...

413
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,916
You're pathetic.

414
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,500
Geez, if I keep
waiting for Kosuda,

415
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,250
we'll be here until morning...

416
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,250
Whatever...

417
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,750
I can do it!

418
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,208
Uh...
Yamada?

419
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,208
Crap!
What do I do now...?

420
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:54,458
Damn it, why don't I ever think
before I do stuff like this...?

421
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:57,083
I need to calm down,
I'm freaking out like I

422
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,916
always do when
I'm afraid I'm not ready...

423
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,125
But I'm pretty
sure I'm ready now...

424
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:05,666
Whoa!

425
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,375
She's on my lap!

426
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,458
I'm on his lap!

427
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,500
I'm not even sure
how it happened...

428
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,041
But who cares?
This is perfect!

429
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:22,250
I wonder how Yamada's doing...

430
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:25,833
I'd like to think she ended
up just going home, but...

431
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,208
Time for me to feast!

432
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:33,208
She might be crazy,
but there's no way...

433
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:37,083
Presenting the 'no way' thing
she was talking about.

434
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,250
She's looking at me...

435
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:43,916
...and I think it's
like a good thing.

436
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,708
She's so gorgeous...

437
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:53,166
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world!

438
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,833
I wonder...
Would she get upset...

439
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,208
if I just touched
them a little bit?

440
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,166
What?

441
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,333
Is he trying to
touch my breasts?

442
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:13,458
Oh no!

443
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,958
What if he thinks
they're too small?!

444
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:17,583
What if he's into big melons...!
I need to snap out of it.

445
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:18,666
They're boobs.
And they're mine.

446
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,250
He's gonna love them!

447
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:24,458
What is taking you so long?!
Touch them already!

448
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,708
Wow, they're intense,
aren't they?

449
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,041
Hey, boobies...

450
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,083
What's up...?

451
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:31,458
Yamada says it's all good.

452
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,416
I should've worn a super
push--up double padded bra

453
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,875
and thrown some chicken cutlets
in there for good measure...!

454
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,750
That would have been a terrible
idea because if I end up

455
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:41,541
taking the bra off, he would
have found out the truth anyway!

456
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,416
Kay...? Does that
mean she likes this?

457
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,291
I hope he likes this.

458
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,166
Well...

459
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,250
They're definitely round shaped.

460
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,500
That's pretty obvious.

461
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,666
They're kind of hard, though.

462
01:20:58,208 --> 01:20:59,875
Honestly, I can't really
feel them all that well

463
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,500
through her bra
and clothes and stuff.

464
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:06,333
He's gotta be totally
infatuated with me by now!

465
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:08,458
How long is he gonna keep
holding them like that?

466
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:09,875
It's been forever!

467
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:12,458
Try...
moving them!

468
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:15,166
I mean what you were
doing was perfectly fine!

469
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,083
Yamada!

470
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,500
Kosuda...

471
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:23,958
I'm so confused...

472
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,208
I've known her all this time,

473
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:27,916
and I still can't figure
out what she's thinking.

474
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,458
I want to have sex!

475
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:32,916
I don't think there's anyone
easier to figure out than her.

476
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,833
I wanna go all
the way with her...

477
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,333
But is that what
you want, Yamada?

478
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,208
Whoa, they're
having like, for real sex...

479
01:21:57,291 --> 01:22:00,708
And it's really explicit...
I don't wanna see any more!

480
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,583
They need to put all of
that back where it belongs!

481
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,458
Um... what are
they doing out here?

482
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,166
No, I can't!

483
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,625
I can't have sex
in a place like this!

484
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:29,041
Ugh... why are
you such a prude...?

485
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:32,041
It's usually better
when people are watching.

486
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:34,041
Yes!
Go for it, dude!

487
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,000
Come on, man!

488
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,166
It could be our only chance...!

489
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,208
It's unacceptable...

490
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,375
No.

491
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:40,125
We can't let them
take pictures of Yamada!

492
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,000
Well, this blows.

493
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,458
They're not gonna have
sex this year at all!

494
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,500
♪ closing song ♪

495
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,375
Agh, I feel a breeze, and it's
making me totally nervous...!

496
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,583
I'm holding my skirt down,
but I still think my heart is

497
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:38,416
gonna thump out of my
chest, because today,

498
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,416
I'm not wearing--Oh crap!

499
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,583
Thanks a lot breeze!

500
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:42,958
Um...
Yamada?

501
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,291
Yamada is going to criticize
the world of politics?!

502
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:47,708
And, an unexpected
Valentine's adventure.

503
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,625
These two stories next time...!
