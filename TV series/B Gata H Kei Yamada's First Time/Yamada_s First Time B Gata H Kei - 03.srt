1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,083
Coming!

2
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,791
Hey!
What's up, Mayu?

3
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,333
I brought the bulletin for you.

4
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,166
Oh, cool, thanks.

5
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,625
Are Kosuda and Miyano
just childhood friends...?

6
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,083
I gotta know!

7
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,875
So, do you like
a guy or anything?

8
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,458
Actually, what I
really want to know

9
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,625
is how you
feel about my brother!

10
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,333
You wanna know
how I feel about~?

11
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,416
I don't know.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,791
I mean Kosuda's
nice and all, but still.

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,916
I wouldn't say I have
special feelings for him~

14
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,125
That's what I thought.

15
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,833
Okay...
Sounds good.

16
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,000
It's been so long.

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,583
Like...
ten years ago...

18
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,666
Run!

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,000
Dang it!
You'll pay for this!

20
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,291
Just you wait!

21
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,500
Thanks...
that was really nice of you.

22
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,416
He's so cool.

23
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,916
He's a prince...!
My very own prince!

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,083
Really...?
You found a prince?

25
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,500
I don't know who he is yet,

26
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,291
but he's way cute
and super cool.

27
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,833
I'm home!

28
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,750
Oh, hey sis, how was your day?

29
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,208
You're his sister!

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,458
Yeah...
How's it going?

31
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,708
For the last time...!

32
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,500
Will you please quit
walking around naked?!

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,666
How come?

34
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,041
I don't understand
what your problem is...

35
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,666
Ever since that day...

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,791
I've been too
afraid to fall in love.

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,291
Suddenly so close
in the darkroom!

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,916
Kinda dangerous
club activities?!

39
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,083
Okay...

40
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,625
The school
festival's coming up...

41
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,083
Any ideas on what
our class can contribute?

42
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,458
I dunno.
Something awesome?

43
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,791
Maybe we could sell food?

44
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,958
I wonder how Kosuda
really feels about Miyano...

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,291
Yo Miss Akai what if we
put together a little café?

46
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,916
A camera...? Why does
Kosuda have a camera?

47
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,625
It can't be!

48
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,083
Thank you for coming...

49
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,583
I can't wait to immortalize
your womanly body on film.

50
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,333
Oh...!
I can't wait either!

51
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,875
If we're gonna do a café we
should make it a maid café!

52
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,250
No...! No way!
I don't want that at all!

53
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,541
I'm with Yamada...

54
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,583
I don't want to
do a maid café either...

55
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,250
How about something
more appropriate?

56
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,375
I know! We should
do a butler café!

57
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,583
Right...

58
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,541
Does anyone besides
Misato have any ideas?

59
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,625
Later that day, after school...

60
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,125
Where's Kosuda going with
that stupid camera of his...?

61
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,250
Is he really gonna
take pictures of her!

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,041
I'm bouncy!

63
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,875
Yamada?.
What are you doing there?

64
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
Nothing!

65
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,000
I was just randomly passing by a
door and peeked in, that's all!

66
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,375
You were passing by a door
at the end of a hallway?

67
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,625
That's what I said...!

68
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,291
I should be asking what
you're doing here...!

69
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
And... Where's...
Miyano?

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,291
What...? Miyano?

71
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,583
I heard...

72
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,208
You two have been
friends since you were kids.

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,041
Yeah, that's true.

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,791
No way!
Is she jealous?

75
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,208
But...
Don't worry...!

76
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,875
We're just friends...
I mean...

77
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,375
Back when we were little kids,
she even asked me for advice

78
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,375
about some guy she thought was
her perfect prince or something.

79
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,750
Let me think about this...
that would mean she hasn't

80
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,125
liked him for like the past
ten years, which is good news...

81
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,500
Kosuda is free and clear!

82
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,500
So...

83
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
What are you doing
in here anyway?

84
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,333
What do you mean...?
This room is for my club.

85
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,541
It is?

86
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,833
Yeah, I belong to the
photography club.

87
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,208
I didn't know you belong
to the photography club!

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,958
I can't believe
she hasn't noticed.

89
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,958
Don't be offended.

90
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,083
She only notices
the naughty stuff.

91
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,916
See? I took this when
I was in middle school.

92
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,833
Uh,...
I have a question!

93
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,083
I need to go take pictures for
the school festival later!

94
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,458
Do you wanna come with me?

95
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,250
A trip to take pictures?!

96
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,291
A plateau...

97
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,875
A guesthouse...

98
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,583
And the grand finale,
a passionate night...

99
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,875
Oh yeah!
Get it girl!

100
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,250
The local nature park?

101
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,458
She must be bored...

102
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,541
I am just taking
pictures though...

103
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,708
But, you know what...

104
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll take 'em like I mean it!

105
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,833
If he's gonna take pictures,

106
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,541
he might as
well take some of me...

107
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,083
I don't even mind doing
a few in the nude!

108
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,916
Do you not like
taking pictures of people?

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Oh, not really...

110
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,958
They're okay I guess, I'd just
rather take pictures of nature.

111
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,583
It may not be like humans or
animals, but even scenery moves.

112
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,333
Crap!
I said what I meant...!

113
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,625
This is probably
pretty boring for you, huh?

114
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,541
No...
not at all.

115
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,041
Guys have it easy...
It's so not fair.

116
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,125
Huh?

117
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,583
Hey...
Good morning.

118
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,666
Yeah, morning.

119
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,000
After school...

120
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,916
I was gonna develop those
pictures from yesterday.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,416
I was wondering...
if you'd want to come with me.

122
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,458
Where is it?

123
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,000
The photography
club has a darkroom.

124
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,708
A darkroom?

125
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,208
Yes, I'll go with you!
I'll definitely go!

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,833
I didn't expect her
to be so interested,

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,333
but I'm glad she's coming.

128
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,833
The darkroom...!

129
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,666
In other words,
a room that is dark!

130
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,833
That's right...

131
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,041
And you know what
you do in a dark room?

132
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,208
Have sex, that's what...!

133
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,708
I may have failed in the past...

134
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,833
But not anymore...

135
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,500
In the dark I should
be able to calmly

136
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,041
pounce on him and
tear him apart!

137
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,208
It's on this time Kosuda...
Get ready!

138
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,125
Would you please
stop making plans to

139
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,583
have sex while we're
eating; I mean, seriously.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,250
Cool...

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,791
So is the photo club
not having a meeting today?

142
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,750
Nope.

143
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,708
All right!.
No interruptions!

144
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,125
If you have questions about
anything, feel free to ask me.

145
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,208
This is where the darkroom is.

146
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,500
Oh... Nice...

147
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,208
It's so dark...
and kinda tight.

148
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,833
I guess so, yeah.

149
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,125
We're all alone.

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,333
A little exciting,
don't you think?

151
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,833
What does she mean by that...?

152
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,333
Maybe it doesn't'
mean anything...

153
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,166
Damn it, this is confusing!
Why can't I figure chicks out!

154
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,666
Hey...
Don't feel so bad;

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,958
I can't ever figure out
what she's thinking either.

156
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,416
All right...
I'm calm...

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm collected...

158
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,291
Let's do this!

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,041
I gotta calm down...
I gotta get out of my head...

160
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,458
Yamada did not come here
just to satisfy my dirty mind!

161
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,750
Actually...
yes she did...

162
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,000
...trust me.

163
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,625
This is it...
Here I come...

164
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,458
What sort of fate awaits
our dear hero Kosuda?!

165
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,833
Oh...
oops.

166
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,666
My hand is shaking like crazy...

167
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,041
I am alone in the darkroom with

168
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,750
the prettiest girl in
school, though.

169
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,416
What are you scared of now...?

170
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,750
Do you have any idea how long it

171
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
took me to get ready
for this moment?!

172
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,916
No holding back...
I'm going all the way!

173
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,458
Why's this room open?

174
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,125
Someone's here!

175
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,958
Is anyone in there?

176
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah!.
Hey, it's Kosuda...!

177
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,833
Please don't open the door;
I'm developing some pictures.

178
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,416
Oh, cool...
How's it going?

179
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,291
Going well; how's
it going with you?

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,875
Good.
Just forgot something.

181
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,708
Try to keep quiet...
He'll leave in a second.

182
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,041
What's happening?

183
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,166
I feel like I'm
caught in an affair!

184
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm gonna turn on
the light really quick...

185
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,750
I can't see anything...
The light switch is...

186
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,958
How could I
screw this up again?!

187
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Please, can we just do it?
Just a little bit?

188
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh my God!

189
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,750
I thought this was gonna
be the most perfect plan...

190
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,041
...like ever...

191
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,916
Maybe it's not in
the cards for us.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,666
Maybe Kosuda and I are
fated to never have sex...

193
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,250
This is awful. What if
I never know his touch?

194
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,166
What is this?

195
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,666
This is...

196
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,583
...second base...
also known as B!

197
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,708
It's so warm and squishy.

198
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,333
See ya later, man.

199
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,875
Make sure you lock the
room when you leave, kay?

200
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,500
Yeah, okay.
Cool!

201
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,625
Well that was a close one...

202
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,250
Uh...
I should've told you...

203
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,000
Only club members
are supposed to be in here.

204
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,708
Where are you going?

205
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,541
It's almost like I can still
feel him touching me...

206
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,291
Yamada!

207
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,333
You don't have to walk...
I can take you home.

208
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,500
Fine... I suppose
that'd be okay.

209
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,791
I wonder what I
felt in the darkroom...

210
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,125
It seemed a lot like...
No, that's stupid.

211
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't believe he didn't notice
he was touching my boob...

212
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,541
This guy has
a talent for flushing

213
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,333
good luck down the toilet...

214
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,708
It's weird, though...

215
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,375
...because I still feel good
about the whole thing.

216
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,958
It kinda feels like
I'm flying in the sky.

217
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,416
B Gata H Kei.

218
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,875
My breasts have never
been this sensitive before...

219
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,666
My body will be cultivated
by the hands of a man.

220
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,958
Yamada's level
has now increased...

221
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,166
She is awarded with
sensitive boobies.

222
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,166
I'm climbing the
proverbial stairway to

223
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,083
adulthood and makin'
the beast with two backs!

224
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,875
Good grief...

225
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,583
Why does she always
have to be so loud?

226
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,208
This is weird...

227
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,208
The only thing I can think
about are Kosuda's hands.

228
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,666
Hey, Yamada, what's wrong...?

229
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,166
You sick?

230
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,416
I heard big boobs
aren't usually sensitive.

231
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,958
So...

232
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,458
...you won't understand
what I'm going through!

233
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,333
Yeah, I don't ever understand
what you're going through,

234
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,375
but best of luck with your
newest bout of insanity.

235
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,541
Passionate School Festival!

236
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,708
I, Yamada, will
be the school's queen!

237
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,125
We know what we're
doing for the festival...

238
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,833
The votes have
been counted, so it's official.

239
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,416
We're gonna put on
the haunted house, guys.

240
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,791
Aww... man.

241
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,291
That actually sounds like
it could be pretty fun.

242
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,166
Okay! We're gonna
decide on roles now.

243
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,916
Who wants to be a ghost?

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,750
Me! I do! I do! I do!

245
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,625
Thanks Yamada.

246
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,375
Anyone else!

247
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,208
I'll do it.

248
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,625
Yeah, why not?

249
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,791
I'll use the dark again and
go after Kosuda's face!

250
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,333
B is like second base,
and since A is kissing,

251
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,583
I'll be headed to
first base next.

252
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,458
Well, she might
have the order of

253
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,291
things mixed up, but,
we'll take what we can get.

254
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,166
We need someone
to take pictures, too.

255
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,291
Don't we have a member of
the photography club in here?

256
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,125
That's right...!

257
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
I'm in the photography club!

258
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,291
Oh, good...

259
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,166
We'll leave that to you then.

260
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,541
Kobayakawa...

261
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,458
Um...
I'm Kosuda.

262
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,875
He only got one character right.

263
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,000
We've been here for six months,
and he didn't know?

264
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,000
Whaddaya think?

265
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,833
I like it.

266
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:14,916
Yeah, it looks good.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,041
Here's the next one.

268
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,125
Hey, Kosuda!

269
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,583
Would you mind
taking a picture of us.

270
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,916
Okay!

271
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,916
Kosuda!
Take ours too!

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,125
Okay!

273
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,916
Kosuda!

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,875
Okay!

275
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,708
Kosuda!

276
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:29,666
Okay!

277
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,750
What's the deal?

278
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,375
Why isn't he trying to
take my picture?

279
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,416
Hey, Yamada...?

280
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,333
You wanna try
out the makeup now?

281
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,166
Yeah, sure.

282
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,625
Why am I not surprised...?

283
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,625
Your skin's taking
really well to the makeup.

284
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,666
Aww, thanks!

285
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,666
Say "cheese"!

286
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,166
Back off!

287
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,416
What's his problem?

288
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,291
He's just Kosuda!

289
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,083
I think all the
attention he's getting

290
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,500
is going straight
to his head...!

291
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,583
I don't want him to be a total
nobody, but I don't want

292
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,291
him being more
popular than me, either.

293
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,250
This one's rather
selfish, isn't she?

294
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
What's that...?
Did you take it the other day?

295
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,583
Yamada.

296
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,333
It looks like it developed okay.

297
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,625
Yeah.
I think so.

298
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,500
I don't remember it being
that peaceful and relaxing...

299
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,166
It's like we weren't even
looking at the same thing...

300
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,875
But he saw it as beautiful...
and captured it that way, too.

301
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,041
Uh...
so what do you think?

302
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,625
It seems tranquil...

303
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,958
I think it's totally the sort
of picture you'd take.

304
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,000
Is that a compliment...
or an insult?

305
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,875
Okay guys...!
You can do it!

306
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,666
Yeah!

307
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,250
Hurry up, Kosuda...

308
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,208
My lips are starting to
get impatient for you!

309
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,958
I can do it!

310
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,583
That's a very
self--motivated ghost.

311
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,208
I'm gonna get you...

312
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,833
Nice job, Yamada.

313
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,833
Oh, hey, you guys...

314
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:18,791
What are you doing here?

315
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,916
Looking for trouble...

316
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,583
We are in a haunted
house, aren't we?

317
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,625
True...!

318
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,583
Speaking of
looking for trouble...

319
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,083
I'm not sure how it works...

320
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,750
...but have you guys ever tried
using Konnyaku to get off?

321
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,416
Don't you think it's
wrong to take advantage

322
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,625
of the dark to steal a kiss?

323
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,875
No I don't, cause...

324
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,208
He's probably never even
kissed anyone before...

325
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,041
...which means... 

326
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,500
Once.

327
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,166
I.

328
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,208
Kiss.

329
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,208
Him, he'll be hooked
on me for sure!

330
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,208
How can you know that?

331
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,750
You haven't kissed
anyone either...

332
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,750
Where do you come
up with this stuff?

333
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,083
Don't worry, though...

334
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,250
I'll go find Kosuda for you.

335
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,833
Thank you!

336
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:53,041
I bet he's at the reception desk
in the photography club room!

337
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,708
It's really dark in here...

338
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,166
So dark we might be
able to move past kissing!

339
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,583
Yes!

340
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,958
From B to A, or second
to first, and then C or third,

341
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,208
and finally home,
or D, which is sex!!

342
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,166
This is all very confusing.

343
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,125
Kosuda...!

344
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,583
He's here!

345
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,708
Here I come!

346
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,291
It's me, stupid!

347
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,458
Holy, what the hell...?

348
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,041
Damn it why are
you here, Takeshita?

349
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,875
I don't want my very
first kiss to be with you!

350
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,458
Quit yelling!
I didn't do anything!

351
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,041
Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry.

352
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,166
I just didn't want to have to
start calling you my girlfriend.

353
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,416
That doesn't make sense.

354
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,541
Start talking, girlfriend.
Where's Kosuda at?

355
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,583
Don't call me that...

356
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,708
I couldn't find him
in the clubroom.

357
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,375
Oh no...

358
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,666
He was supposed to be there!

359
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,625
Where did he go...?

360
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,416
This sucks bad!

361
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,250
His timing almost
physically hurts me.

362
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,875
I can't believe Kosuda
didn't bother to come see me...!

363
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,625
Yamada...!

364
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,291
What?

365
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,166
There you are!

366
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,291
We've been looking for you.

367
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,416
How come?

368
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,958
Wanna enter the beauty pageant?

369
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,166
Pageant?

370
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,375
Yeah, and the winner
gets to have an entire

371
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,291
year of free drinks from
the school store...!

372
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,291
So if you win you don't
mind giving me half do you?

373
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,333
If I do win, it might
be a nice reminder

374
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,916
to Kosuda about how lucky he is.

375
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,500
You can count me in!
This'll be a piece of cake!

376
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,291
Yeah it will!

377
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,791
We believe in you, Yamada!

378
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,916
It doesn't hurt that guys are

379
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,416
only interested in
a girl's looks, too.

380
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,291
Ladies and Gentlemen, let's give
a big hand to our contestants!

381
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,666
These are your finalists
for the seventeenth annual

382
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,666
Miss Takizawa High contest!.

383
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,875
Give it up!

384
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,208
Let's start counting
the votes immediately!

385
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
She's a shoe--in.

386
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,458
No one else up there comes close
to being as pretty as Yamada.

387
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,000
No one else is as dirty either.

388
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,791
This is great!

389
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,625
I can feel all those
dirty looks coming

390
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,500
from the guys in the audience...

391
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,791
And I love it!

392
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,583
Look!

393
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,583
I'm getting more votes...!

394
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,916
I'm totally gonna win!

395
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,208
It looks like Yamada
might win in a landslide!

396
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:59,000
It doesn't matter who wins this
because you're number one to me.

397
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,958
The votes are
still being counted!

398
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,208
Yamada, Yamada, Suzuki,
Yamada, Yamada, Yamada...!

399
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,166
You're going to regret
leaving me all alone in

400
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,000
that haunted house now,
aren't you Kosuda?

401
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,916
Uh oh... it looks like Kanejo is
closing in on first place.

402
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,333
It's anyone's game now!

403
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,375
Who will be the beauty victor!

404
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,250
I'm still number one,
though, aren't I...?

405
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,833
Who the hell is this
stupid Kanejo chick?

406
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,625
Whoa...!
She's really pretty!

407
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,333
I didn't know we had a
girl like that in our school!

408
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,333
Kanejo, seems like
you're closing in;

409
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,958
tell us
about yourself?

410
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,833
I just transferred here
yesterday from the US...

411
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm Kyoka Kanejo...

412
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,708
Wow...

413
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,666
You're all so sweet;
it's nice to meet you.

414
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,375
Why didn't she
transfer tomorrow?!

415
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,208
So, she's back from overseas?

416
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,125
Cool.

417
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,750
Looks like she's
pretty rich too.

418
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,416
Yamada may not be
the "it" girl for much longer.

419
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,416
Yamada?

420
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,083
What are you worried about?

421
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,541
You're not like...

422
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,625
...that close to Yamada
or anything are you?

423
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,166
Can I tell him that
I think she likes me?

424
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,708
I mean come on dude...

425
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,333
You guys sit next to each other
but you barely even talk...

426
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,500
Plus look at her;
why would she be in to you?

427
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,958
Or maybe she doesn't
like me after all!

428
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,708
It's a dead heat between
Yamada and Kanejo!

429
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,250
Who will win the big title?

430
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,458
Who is the fairest of them all?!

431
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,375
The official results are in...!

432
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,666
The winner of
Miss Takizawa High is...

433
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,833
By a nose, the beautiful Yamada!

434
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,666
Did you see that, Kosuda...?

435
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,291
There's no denying
I'm amazing now!

436
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,541
And now she's won
a beauty contest...

437
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,625
He's right.

438
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,708
Why would she
waste her time with me.

439
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,833
A folk dance will be
held in the schoolyard.

440
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,500
All students, please make your

441
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,041
way to the schoolyard
immediately.

442
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:52,791
There she is!

443
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,208
Miss Takizawa High!

444
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,458
Will you please dance with me?

445
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,541
No, dance with me!

446
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,500
Where's Kosuda?!.

447
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,791
He should have been here first!!

448
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,750
What a jerk...!

449
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,791
He didn't come see me at the

450
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,458
haunted house or
the beauty contest!

451
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
A picture from the other day...

452
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,500
It's blurry, but at
least I got her in one.

453
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,166
Yamada...

454
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,625
I don't care if she's
too good or not...!

455
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,125
I'm gonna go ask
her to dance with me!

456
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:29,791
It's okay...

457
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,791
I don't really care.

458
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,541
Yamada...!

459
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,083
I'm coming!

460
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,875
I don't care.

461
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,666
Not one bit.

462
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,958
I don't care about
Kosuda anymore!

463
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,291
Yamada!

464
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,625
What are you here for...?
I'm kind of busy right now.

465
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,958
I wanted...

466
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,666
...to say congratulations
on winning the pageant.

467
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,083
Thanks...
Although I figured I'd win.

468
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,583
There's one more thing...

469
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,833
Will you dance with me?

470
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,958
Sure, but you'll have
to get in line first.

471
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,791
Oh...

472
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,583
That's gonna be a long wait.

473
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,083
It's not like I'm
happy he came...

474
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,166
Every guy in school is
in line to dance with me...

475
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,708
69 more people!

476
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,083
She was kinda rude,
but she waited for me...

477
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,958
48 more people.

478
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,666
10 more people.

479
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,000
One more person!

480
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,166
Finally!

481
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,041
The song ended.

482
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,250
You spent all that
time in line waiting...

483
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,625
We might as well dance.

484
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:02,583
♪ closing song ♪

485
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,750
In the next episode,
it's already Christmas!!

486
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,541
Once I get a gift
and eat some cake,

487
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,000
we'll be headed to the
hotel for my real present!

488
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,208
Oooh, fancy.

489
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,791
It looks like a castle...!

490
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,458
Gah, there're so many to choose
from, how will I ever decide?

491
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,666
Um...
Yamada?

492
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,916
Say tah--tah to your
cherry tonight, Kosuda!

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,333
I'm coming to get you...!

See you next time!
