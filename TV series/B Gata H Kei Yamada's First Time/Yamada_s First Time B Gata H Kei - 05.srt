1
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,041
You know what I just remembered?

2
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,458
Valentine's Day is soon.

3
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,666
Why...?

4
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,958
Now I have to give
chocolate to someone!

5
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,291
 It's sad what being so average
makes you worry about...

6
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,791
I'm glad I don't have to
stress out over that anymore.

7
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,583
My priorities have
changed since he kissed me.

8
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,500
Whose memory did
you steal this from...?

9
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,958
Because this is
what yours looked like!

10
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,541
I've French kissed!

11
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,500
Yamada Two Point 'Oh!'

12
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,250
Heave--ho!
Heave--ho!

13
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,583
Heave--ho! Heave--ho!

14
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,833
Hey, Yamada...

15
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,416
Would you like to go see
a movie with me later?

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know.
I'll have to think about it.

17
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,416
She said she'll think about it!

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,291
Yay!

19
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,125
See that...?

20
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,583
It's called strength...!

21
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,333
It's what happens when you
become an experienced woman!

22
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,750
What happens when you
become an experienced jerk?

23
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,041
Did you remember that
Valentine's Day is coming up...?

24
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,083
And did you happen to
get Kosuda anything...?

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,625
Chocolates or a card?

26
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,625
Huh?

27
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,250
Translation: No, I'm a jerk.

28
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,208
Why do I have to
give him a gift...?!

29
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,250
He's the boy in the story!
He's supposed to give me stuff!

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,666
Fine.

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,791
At least I'll be getting my
pipes cleaned soon and won't

32
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,250
have to deal with
this crap anymore...

33
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,625
...and then...

34
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,166
I'll become Yamada
Three Point 'Oh!'

35
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,083
Seriously...

36
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,541
No one else in
the world obsesses

37
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,500
over the nasty like she does.

38
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,833
A Valentine's Day filled
with sweat and tears!

39
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,333
From Yamada with... Love...?

40
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,500
Weird.

41
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,500
"Pick good ones?"
Great mom, that helps.

42
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,875
What does that even mean?

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
How do I know
which "ones" are good?

44
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,041
Look at the color.

45
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
You want a bright
blue one with white eyes.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,250
Thanks for the help random lady!

47
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,000
Did you learn that
in house wife school?

48
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,458
Go home and roll something
in your fancy kelp!

49
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh hi...
I didn't know that was you.

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,458
Thanks a lot Miyano...

51
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,458
I appreciate
your fish expertise.

52
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,875
Anytime!

53
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,666
I wonder if she knows that
Yamada kissed Kosuda.

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,791
I doubt she'd be this
nice to me if she did...

55
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,541
Maybe I should hang out
with her a little longer

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,541
and find some
way to bring it up.

57
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,708
So you really like
cooking, don't you?

58
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,208
Yeah...

59
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,500
You should've seen the huge
spread I made for New Years!

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,291
That's it...!

61
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,083
You're teaching me
how to cook tonight!

62
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,750
This is an easy soup with
sautéed burdock root,

63
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,041
ginger--stewed sardines, and
kidney beans in a sesame sauce.

64
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,250
Holy crap.

65
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,000
Will you stay and
have some with me?

66
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,291
Oh that's okay.

67
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,666
It's totally cool
if you want to.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,708
It's not as fun
cooking for just me...

69
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,041
Plus, I'd love
to have your opinion.

70
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,708
She's like, freakishly nice.

71
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,541
Omigah!
Emergency!

72
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,583
I just read that I should
be doing squats every

73
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,500
day so that my
legs won't get sore!

74
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,666
Do your legs get sore?!

75
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,416
Are you doing squats
and not telling me?!

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,041
Sorry, I'm busy.

77
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,083
Takeshita...
Can I ask you something...?

78
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,375
You have a boyfriend, right?

79
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,166
You don't have
to answer, of course...

80
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,500
...but what does it feel like?

81
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,291
Aww...
She's so sweet about it...

82
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,875
Unlike some people I know.

83
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,208
Fine then I'll shake
it out of you...!

84
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,333
Tell me what it's like!

85
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,916
We're supposed to
be friends, damn it!

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,166
The reason I'm asking is...
there's kinda someone I'm into.

87
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,708
"Someone" meaning Kosuda?

88
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,958
Ohmigosh how did you know...?!

89
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,250
Did Yamada tell
you or something?!

90
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,750
I don't remember...
you gonna tell him how you feel?

91
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,708
Oh no...
I can't do that ...

92
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,166
We've been friends
for so long that--

93
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,583
I can't tell Kosuda I like him.

94
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,708
He doesn't need a klutz who

95
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,125
can't cook a meal
without spilling it!

96
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,458
I never thought I'd see the day,

97
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,916
but you're actually starting
to make sense to me.

98
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,333
Besides that,
it doesn't really bother

99
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,875
me that he's not interested...

100
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,416
I just want him to be happy,
and if that's with someone else

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,958
then I wouldn't want to
take that away from him.

102
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,833
Does it suck that I think Kosuda
might be better off with Miyano?

103
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,416
Wanna hear something silly?

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,958
I make him Valentine's Day
chocolates every year...

105
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,375
But I'm always too afraid
to give them to him.

106
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,083
That's kinda tragic.

107
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,458
The practice ones for this year

108
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,625
are in there if you
want to see them.

109
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,833
No frikkin way!

110
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,500
What is this chocolate
amusement park I'm staring at?

111
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,791
It's called a cake and
Miyano made it for Kosuda.

112
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,041
Yeah, she cares about
him so she does things like

113
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,791
that all the time, and she
never complains about it.

114
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,291
Sorry girl...

115
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,125
but if you want this to work
you have got to step it up!

116
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,333
Is there a way to just
ditch Valentine's Day?

117
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,375
It won't be that bad.

118
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,083
I'm sure we'll all
get something.

119
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,583
I wonder if she'll remember...

120
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,250
Of course she will...
but what if she doesn't...?

121
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,375
What'll I do...?
I'll have to quit school!

122
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,458
What's with the drama?

123
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,833
Didn't he make
out with her already?

124
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,458
You know I'll even
take a pity gift.

125
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,833
It's better than nothing.

126
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,416
Works for me.

127
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,958
You say that like
you've got someone

128
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,000
on reserve to
give you pity gifts!

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,833
It's just my mom, dude.

130
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,583
That cake is gonna
be pretty tough to beat.

131
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,958
Get ready!

132
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,625
I'm about to throw down
with some serious chocolate!

133
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Really all you have
to do is melt it down

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,458
and let it get hard again...?

135
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,291
Guys are so freakin'
easy to figure out.

136
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,791
Yamada is great 'cause she
makes chocolate cake for me~!

137
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
Yay Yamada~!

138
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,833
He doesn't know that
the chocolate is just

139
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,916
the appetizer to
the yummy main dish...

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,666
...which is me.

141
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,833
Evacuate for gas leak...

142
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,416
Evacuate for gas leak ...

143
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,250
Are we about to die?

144
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,791
It's a good thing the main
dish is so amazing...

145
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,083
...because the
appetizer is screwed.

146
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,958
"Avoid burning chocolate by
heating in a double boiler,

147
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,500
between eighty--two and
eighty six degrees."What?

148
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,500
That's like four degrees apart!

149
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,500
This is stupid!

150
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,708
I shouldn't have to
risk my life to get laid!

151
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,125
Yeah, that'll help.

152
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,125
It's done!

153
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,041
That was easier than
I thought it was gonna be...

154
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,916
I'm just that awesome!

155
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,125
I do hope it works out for ya...

156
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,083
It shows you tried
if nothing else.

157
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,250
Please...

158
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,416
I don't know what
you meant by 'tried,'

159
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
but I don't try for any guy.

160
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,333
Sorry but the dark circles under

161
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,375
your eyes tell a
different story.

162
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,291
And so, Valentine's Day
reared its ugly head!

163
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,750
Nothing.

164
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,000
So, I um...
Made this.

165
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,000
Is that for me?

166
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,166
Still nothing.

167
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,208
Thought you might like this.

168
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,000
Wow, thank you so much!

169
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,041
Hope this isn't awkward.

170
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
No, I was hoping you would!

171
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,500
Good morning, everyone!

172
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,458
So glad you like it.

173
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,083
More than like it!

174
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,208
That's a box...!

175
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,541
Please be for me...!

176
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,041
No way, there's more...?!

177
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,458
Yamada...!

178
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,458
I made this for you!

179
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,666
Happy Valentine's Day!

180
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,250
I got you something too, lady!

181
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,541
Thanks so much you guys!

182
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,666
No fair!

183
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,333
Even the girls
are giving her gifts?!

184
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,291
That was the last bell.

185
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm officially a loser.

186
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,583
Are you free today?

187
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:04,875
What?

188
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,375
Cool.

189
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,458
Was she taking a survey...?

190
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,875
What was that all about?!

191
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,958
All right!

192
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,625
So tonight's the
night it's going down...

193
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,333
I'd rather give it to
him at his house

194
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,500
than with all these
people watching.

195
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,916
So that's it.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,458
She didn't do
anything for me today.

197
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,333
I can't freak out anymore.

198
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,708
I've got to give him
something this year.

199
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,666
I still want him to know how
I feel even if I can't say it.

200
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,583
I wonder which one
he'd like the most.

201
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,666
Wow, that's not
obsessive at all.

202
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,708
What if he's studying
or something?

203
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,541
I should do this later...

204
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,791
No! I can't keep
running away!

205
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,125
Here...!
I made these...!

206
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:49,916
For you...!

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,750
Please take 'em!

208
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,458
Rock; that's so sweet!

209
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,000
Kazuki!
What?

210
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,416
I didn't think about
what would happen

211
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,958
if someone else
answered the door!

212
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't have a plan--B!

213
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,708
Sorry to bother you!
These are for--

214
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,125
Right...!
I remember now.

215
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,083
For the apples...?

216
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
You didn't have to...!

217
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,916
My grandmother actually grows
them so we get them for free!

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,541
I'm sorry--I should've
told you when you

219
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,416
picked them up the other day.

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,083
This smells wonderful...!

221
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,416
I failed...

222
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,250
I messed up Valentine's Day.

223
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,416
What...?!

224
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,333
You didn't get anything?
Are you that lame?

225
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,750
I'm kinda surprised.

226
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,541
I got like four
things this year.

227
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,291
This is for you, sweetheart.

228
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,833
Don't give me that
pouty look, Takashi.

229
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,000
You're in high school now.

230
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,416
So I don't get chocolates?!

231
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,333
Dude, just go to the store.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,916
I guess it doesn't
make sense for me to be

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,333
bringing him Valentine's
Day presents this late.

234
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,625
In other words, you're wussing
out and staying a virgin?

235
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,041
But I can't leave damn it!

236
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,666
He'll never know what a
thoughtful, perfect person I am!

237
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,083
He has to think
I really care and

238
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,291
am not just out to
ride his disco stick!

239
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,333
Plus you want him to have them.

240
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,291
I'm too pretty to
be stressing about this!

241
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,833
All the way in!

242
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,625
It's stuck!
Come back!

243
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,916
I can't believe I just did that!

244
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,250
So there wasn't a card or
anything just creepy

245
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,750
random chocolates
in the mailbox?

246
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,833
Creepy is right.

247
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,833
Aw look!

248
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,500
Someone
remembered you after all!

249
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,791
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

250
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,541
Whatever. I'm sure
those were left for you.

251
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh, like it matters!

252
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,208
We got free chocolate!

253
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,666
That looks disgusting.

254
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,666
Sorry...!

255
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,833
That gross, huh...?

256
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,583
Man I bet someone
must hate your insides

257
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,541
if they left you that crap!

258
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,791
I wonder if she's right.

259
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,125
Finally...

260
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,666
I wonder if he figured out
that box was from me.

261
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,000
Hey, Yamada...

262
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,625
Did you come by my house
last night for any reason?

263
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,541
No!
Why would I do that?!

264
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,375
You got a point!

265
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,416
Like... really...

266
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Why'd you even ask that?

267
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
I know it seems weird,
but we got a box of chocolates

268
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,541
in the mail and don't
know who it's from.

269
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,833
Oh...
How thoughtful...

270
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,916
Well, did you try them?
Did they taste good?

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Um...

272
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,916
Why do you care
what they tasted like?

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,083
No way!
Was it you?

274
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,333
Why didn't you
want me to find out?!

275
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,583
Please...!

276
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you really think I'd
waste my time giving you

277
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,916
anything homemade
for Valentine's Day!

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,375
I don't think anyone mentioned
they were homemade.

279
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,541
I bet you didn't even
like them anyway.

280
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,583
No I liked them...

281
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,916
I mean, they did
taste a little funky...

282
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,708
...but I ate every single one.

283
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,916
It was obvious that
a lot of thought went

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,166
into them even
if they weren't for me.

285
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,416
I bet that wasn't it; you got
gifts from other people...

286
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,083
You probably liked those better.

287
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,250
Uh, no...
I didn't get anything.

288
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,791
Not even from Miyano?

289
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,666
Miyano...?

290
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,875
No, of course not...

291
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,458
I mean she brought
us a cake yesterday,

292
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,041
but that was
for the whole family...

293
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,625
She said it was a trade for
some apples we gave her.

294
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,500
No way...

295
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,458
Does he seriously believe that?

296
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,541
That sucks...
I feel sorry for her.

297
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,500
It's okay...

298
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,458
I've always got next year.

299
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,458
B Gata H Kei!

300
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,875
Yamada...

301
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,125
Yamada!

302
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,500
Yamada!

303
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:30,875
Hello?

304
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,333
Yamada!

305
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,000
Wake up!

306
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,791
What's going on?!
Who are you?!

307
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,833
Glad you asked...

308
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:41,958
It's about time...

309
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,291
I'm your Eros Deity

310
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,625
and I'm here to help you
on your sexual journey...

311
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,083
I've gotta say,
so far I am not impressed.

312
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,541
I'm totes being stalked
by a clone with a mustache?

313
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,500
And you're totes
the luckiest girl alive!

314
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,708
This new 'shy' thing you're
trying is giving me gas!

315
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,958
Don't make me hate my job okay!

316
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:56,875
What?!

317
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,000
Seriously...

318
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,125
Are you just trying
to drive me crazy?

319
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,375
Why are you having
so much trouble

320
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,041
getting that pansy
up in your pansy?

321
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,250
Hey...!

322
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,416
You don't know what
you're talking about!

323
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,625
We already kissed
each other with tongue!

324
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,583
A kiss is a kiss.

325
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,958
It doesn't count.

326
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,208
Listen...!

327
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,375
The reason you're
not getting laid

328
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,833
is cause you're denying
your sexual power!

329
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,708
No I'm not...!

330
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,041
You're talking crazy!

331
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,291
Check with your lady lumps
if you don't believe me.

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,541
Yeah... You're right...
It makes sense now!

333
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,333
I mean why are we doing
an episode all about

334
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,916
Valentine's Day and
giving gifts and crap...?

335
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,541
This is a story about me
getting it on and putting

336
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,541
out for one hundred guys--not
some stupid teen romance!

337
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,375
Good to have you back.

338
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,958
Now where were we?

339
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,666
You must unleash
the powers of naughtiness!

340
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,166
If he doesn't know what you're
after, he can't give it to you.

341
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
Kosuda...!

342
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,041
Hold on tight 'cause this
ride just got humpier!

343
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,833
Is she seriously just screaming
out the window at no one?

344
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,458
Work on your naughty power!

345
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,125
I've never felt a
sensation like this before...

346
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,375
Trying to be smooth and creative
is not working on Kosuda...

347
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,166
He's too slow for all that...

348
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,541
I've gotta enlist the
powers of naughtiness.

349
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,666
I have to just grab him by
the balls and tell him what I

350
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,166
want so that there are no
more misunderstandings...

351
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,833
...and I have to make
sure it happens quickly

352
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,333
so he doesn't freak
out and run away.

353
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,541
Maybe I should
hatch this plan inside.

354
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,000
That doesn't sound very good...

355
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,250
Catch a cold?

356
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,958
Maybe.

357
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,750
I tried something new
that I read in a magazine.

358
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,333
"Men find women sexier when
they don't wear any underwear...

359
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,416
Okay!"

360
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,208
So I figured,
"why stop at underwear?"

361
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,166
and I spent the entire
day completely naked!

362
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,208
I love you, Mr. Bear!

363
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,833
And then caught a cold.

364
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
You may have
read too much into it.

365
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,083
I know, right?

366
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,166
And ditching just the panties

367
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,208
would've been
so much easier, too!

368
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,416
No panties?!

369
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,916
That's genius!

370
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,500
Good~ bye~ panties~!

371
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
Coming on to him with
the vents open will

372
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,208
let him know
exactly what I'm after!

373
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,000
That's uh...

374
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,333
That's very inspiring.

375
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
So much better than
the time I showed

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,125
him my bra and
he totally didn't get it.

377
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,125
He'll finally know this
muffin is baked and ready!

378
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,541
I just have to
remember to pounce

379
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,291
when it's up and get it done!

380
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,083
Our time has come, Kosuda!

381
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,333
I guess I could've waited 'til I

382
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,958
got to school to
lose the skivvies.

383
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,750
It's kinda cold today.

384
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,541
What's up, Yamada?!

385
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,000
Hey, good morning!

386
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,291
Why does it feel like
they're all staring at me--

387
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,583
like they know or something...?!

388
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,541
So awkward!

389
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,125
Oh gross.

390
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,250
I hope the teacher can't tell...

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,916
Ugh, this chair feels sticky.

392
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,500
Stay down.

393
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,250
Please stay down!

394
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,500
I keep thinking my skirt
is going to fly up

395
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,833
and everyone here
will see my miracle!

396
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,375
Which I thought was our
long--term goal, so way to go!

397
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,208
It's just a small
piece of cloth.

398
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,333
Why does it feel like such
a big deal that it's gone...?

399
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,791
And what is with all the shaking

400
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,541
and sweating and
being nervous crap?

401
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
This is so not me...

402
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,708
Am I shy?

403
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,333
Am I going to have
to wear glasses now?

404
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,833
Omigosh!

405
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,708
What if it became a law that
women couldn't wear panties?

406
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,291
Then all the shy nerds would
become sexy vixens...!

407
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,166
We could do it where and
whenever we wanted,

408
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,791
which would stimulate
the population,

409
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,083
and then no one
would hate the government!

410
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,833
Hey do you guys know
how I could make a law?

411
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:51,708
What?

412
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,208
Uh...

413
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,208
I guess your first step would
be becoming a politician.

414
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,416
Wow is this what smart
people think about...?

415
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,750
Passing laws 'n stuff?

416
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,166
That's so awesome.

417
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,625
What is going on with her...?

418
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,500
She's acting weird again
and it's freaking me out.

419
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Ugh...

420
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,583
I really have to go...

421
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,291
But I don't want to get up and
walk in the middle of class.

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,500
What did I do to deserve
a bag whacking?

423
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,583
What'd I do to deserve
a crazy friend...?!

424
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,083
Did you forget to
stop by the modesty

425
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,208
store on your way
out of the womb?

426
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,541
Seriously!

427
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,000
I have modesty...
look I'm blushing.

428
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,666
Who comes to school
without any panties on?

429
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,750
You're wearing a skirt!

430
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,958
Don't you get it this is an

431
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,541
important step in
the process...?!

432
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,916
I don't know when
he's going to be around

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,708
or interested so I've
gotta be prepared!

434
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,583
He'll be interested when
you act like you give a crap

435
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,166
and stop treating him
like a frikkin sex toy!

436
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,416
You're ridiculous!

437
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,250
Guys want to see it!

438
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,375
They'd probably jump for joy

439
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,958
if my skirt flew up
in front of them!

440
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,333
Yeah, that's what you think.

441
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,666
Why not...?!

442
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you saying Cha Cha
looks weird or something?

443
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,125
Number one,
you named her Cha Cha...?

444
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,458
And second,
how were you planning

445
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,875
to let him know
you're free balling?

446
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:10,875
I don't know.

447
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,625
I was just gonna
show him, I guess.

448
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,125
Don't do that.

449
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,666
It'll turn him off...

450
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,125
Remember what happened when
you showed him your breasts...?

451
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,416
He's gonna think
you're a flasher.

452
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,208
No...?

453
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,833
Like the creepy old guys?

454
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,750
Those freaks get off on
seeing a bunch of people's

455
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,250
reactions and
have to search for

456
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,208
crowded parks and
malls and stuff.

457
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,458
My mission is simpler.

458
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,458
I just wanna screw.

459
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,833
Then go to a park and find some

460
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,583
old pervert,
get flashed and elope!

461
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,791
What would you do if this
started to get more extreme?

462
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,541
More extreme?

463
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,500
On your back...!

464
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,291
I'm sticking it in!

465
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,958
You're still gonna do it?!

466
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,166
Crap, what if she's right?

467
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,041
Would it really be
a turn off to him...?

468
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,666
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

469
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,208
Hey Kosuda!

470
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,208
Yeah?

471
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:56,958
Um...

472
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,250
Well...

473
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,625
I, uh...

474
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,916
Do...

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,333
Do you like it when
girls don't wear panties?!

476
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,791
Like it...?

477
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,666
You mean...

478
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
...like I like soda?

479
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,458
Why the hell is she asking me
such a random awkward question?!

480
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:33,791
Uh...

481
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,041
I...

482
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,833
...haven't really
thought about it I guess.

483
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,333
He just compared me to soda...

484
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,833
He must not be
that into it after all.

485
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,958
This sucks...

486
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,708
I guess guys are way more
complicated than I thought.

487
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,333
Now I have to try
to not show it to him.

488
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,875
Okay I think I'm
gonna go home now.

489
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,833
This is just stupid...

490
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,583
He seriously said
he didn't want to see

491
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,208
my muffin and
compared it to soda.

492
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,666
Whatever.
I'm glad he didn't see it...

493
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,666
I'll catch you guys later!

494
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,625
Yamada...!

495
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,250
Why did you ask me
that question earlier?!

496
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,000
It all makes sense now,
doesn't it, buddy?

497
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,833
I gotta walk the cat!

498
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,333
Why does he get to run away?!

499
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,708
That makes no sense~!

500
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,041
I'm the one who was standing
there with my gooch out!

501
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,916
I deserve the dramatic exit!

502
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,791
Acceptance has set in...

503
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,625
Yes, that really happened...

504
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,958
But how does someone forget
to put their underwear on?

505
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,583
Wait a minute...

506
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,000
Did she actually
want me to see?!

507
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,958
I'm gonna go for another jog!

508
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,625
Really?

509
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,375
You had like four
chocolates a week ago.

510
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,875
I don't know if she did
it on purpose or not...

511
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,625
...but it was beautiful!

512
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,958
I'm so happy I could die...!

513
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,750
Which is a good thing
because I'm pretty sure

514
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,125
Yamada's going to
kill me tomorrow!

515
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,958
Question one...

516
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,916
When was the last time
you didn't wear panties?

517
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,125
Well let me think.

518
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,333
It had to have been
in the third grade...

519
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,166
I used to like to go
swimming before class...

520
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,250
I wore my suit to the pool
and forgot to pack them

521
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,791
with my change of
clothes for the day.

522
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,041
Oh Miyano...

523
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,625
You're so cute

524
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:02,500
♪ closing song ♪

525
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,625
Guess who's started their
second year in high school!

526
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,416
I can feel the lustful eyes of
the first year boys all over me!

527
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,458
They want it bad!

528
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,833
Wait, who's this skank?!

529
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,000
A return student?

530
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,458
I feel like I've
seen her before.

531
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,666
Um...
Kanejou!

532
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,333
Don't you dare look
at any other girls!

533
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,541
That's what I want to say,
