1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,125
This has become
so freakin stupid.

2
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,333
I just wanted to get laid...

3
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,750
I didn't expect to feel
like this, or any way...

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,000
It wasn't about liking
someone or not liking someone...

5
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,750
What does that even mean?!

6
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,750
Why am I feeling things now...?

7
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,458
And on top of that...
Why does it suck?

8
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,041
Shouldn't love
make you happy...?

9
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,166
So why...
Why does this hurt?

10
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,375
Emo much?

11
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,541
I mean, get over it...

12
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,083
Everybody hurts sometimes.

13
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,458
Oh no!
In front of everyone...!

14
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,333
I never said I don't like you...

15
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,750
Autumn...

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,041
That's what I get for
telling her how I feel, I guess.

17
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,416
I know, right?

18
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,458
That's what I was saying--and
I wasn't even there!

19
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,500
Kosuda!

20
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,041
You ready to do this yet?

21
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,500
I think you're
the last one to vote.

22
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,250
For what?

23
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,125
For what?!

24
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,208
For hottest tail of course...

25
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,666
Only the guys
are voting, though...

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,250
It's a secret ballot...
so don't tell the girls.

27
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,541
Maybe you should
have whispered that.

28
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,458
Here, I'll make
it easier for you.

29
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,208
It's pretty much turned
into a race between

30
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,291
Yamada and Kanejo at this point.

31
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,333
That's hard!

32
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,375
I know, right...?!

33
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,750
Don't worry the
votes are anonymous.

34
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,000
Right now both of them
are tied for first place.

35
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,875
Which means, you get
to select the winner!

36
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,166
So much for it being
an anonymous vote, then.

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,291
Riddle me this...
Why are guys stupid?

38
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,541
Kanejo or Yamada...?

39
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,541
Well that's a no brainer.

40
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,000
Yamada, of course...

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,958
...but what if it weirds her
out that I picked her...?

42
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,458
I don't want her
to think I'm desperate.

43
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,166
That wouldn't help.

44
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,833
You better pick
me and then stick me!

45
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,875
What the...?!

46
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,041
Does she want me to pick her?!

47
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,458
It's just a vote, man...
C'mon!

48
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,500
Hurry up!
It's not rocket science!

49
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,708
I know it's just a vote...

50
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,583
...but I don't
want to upset anyone.

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,666
What if Kanejo starts hating me
because I voted for Yamada...?

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
Nah, she's really
not the type to

53
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,250
give a crap
about things like this.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,458
What the what?
How'd she do that?

55
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,875
Hey, Don't be a tampon...

56
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,125
Man up and cast
your vote already!

57
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,708
That was harsh...
But he's right.

58
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,875
I kinda have been acting like
a tampon this whole time.

59
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,375
I'm so over that!

60
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,541
He was getting stung like
a hundred times but...

61
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,083
What's going on?

62
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,958
Yo!
Guess what time it is?!

63
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,708
Time for you to stop stalling!

64
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,708
I... I pick...
Her...!

65
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,666
I mean...

66
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,416
I'm in love with...
Yamada~!

67
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,791
I think I'm gonna be sick.

68
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,166
Whoa.

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,750
Dude, we weren't asking you
to propose or anything.

70
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,916
It was just a
popularity contest.

71
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,166
I can't believe
he just did that!

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,083
Oh, what a freak.

73
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,375
Yamada!
You're so lucky!

74
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,125
What the hell
is wrong with you...?!

75
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,083
All you had to
do was vote for me...!

76
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
Damn it, Kosuda!

77
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,625
Ohmigod...
I can't breathe...

78
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,458
Oh gross what's happening?

79
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,333
Am I crying?

80
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,666
Ew...!

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,958
Why does it feel like my
heart's about to explode?

82
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,416
Screw that!

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,166
I don't give a crap if he
has feelings for me or not!

84
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,083
That's his problem!

85
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,583
Who does he think he is?

86
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,208
Does he expect me
to care or something?!

87
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,375
You're so annoying!

88
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,916
Oh man, you just got shot down!

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
That's gotta suck.

90
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,833
What just happened?

91
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,000
Shock!

92
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,000
Shock!

93
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:58,541
Shock!

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,875
Shock!

95
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,458
He didn't mean it, ya know...

96
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,791
It was just a stupid
popularity contest.

97
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,500
Yeah I know.

98
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,583
I wish that were true.

99
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,000
But I could see
on his face it's not.

100
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,166
Even with his face
scrunched up he looks adorable.

101
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:20,875
What an idiot!

102
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,291
Why'd he pick today...?!

103
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,583
And why'd he do it in
class in front of everybody?!

104
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,708
Did he seriously think
I'd be happy about that?!

105
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,250
'cause I'm totally not.

106
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,541
This is good...

107
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,000
You have his heart,
now go forth and get laid!

108
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,666
I did it!

109
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,916
I know she heard me that time.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,416
The whole class did.

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah but, just because
you told her doesn't

112
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,791
necessarily mean she has
to like you back, you know.

113
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,250
How long have you
been standing there?

114
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,458
And what do you mean...?

115
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,791
And whose freakin'
side are you on?

116
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,625
Oh Kanejo~!

117
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
Wasn't that funny?

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,333
You lost to Yamada
again--just like last year!

119
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,625
Damn it, Yamada...!

120
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,791
How dare you...!

121
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,416
I'm so over you
humiliating me like this!

122
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,500
Miss Kanejo, I made you some
tea and honey if you'd like.

123
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,416
Yes I would!

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,083
Thank you so much!

125
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,708
Stupid tramp...!

126
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,375
Ugh...!

127
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,750
You're gonna get it!

128
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,166
I'm sorry Miss...

129
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,958
I completely forgot to
ask if you'd like some sugar.

130
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,291
I'd love some!

131
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,500
Or maybe not.

132
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,416
We don't want you to
have trouble sleeping.

133
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,750
I gotta hand it to you, Kosuda--

134
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,375
that was pretty
smooth yesterday.

135
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,666
Chicks dig when you
confess your love in public.

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,416
You are so the man, man.

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
She'll never forget it.

138
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,791
Seriously?

139
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,083
You're not gonna
say anything to him?

140
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
This shy guy summons
up the courage

141
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,291
to confess his love to you...

142
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,166
...and you have nothing
to say about it?!

143
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,666
You're terrible!

144
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,958
You make him sound like a
helpless puppy or something.

145
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,291
I'm just saying
you could be a little

146
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,000
more considerate
of his feelings...

147
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,416
Think of how hard
that must've been for him!

148
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,750
I guess you're right.

149
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,083
That day on the train...

150
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,166
I guess that's what
he was trying to say.

151
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,791
It's not that I don't
care about his feelings,

152
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,833
but I'm only interested
in sex right now.

153
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,750
You know, I knew that
but hearing you verbalize

154
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,500
it makes me feel that
much sorrier for Kosuda.

155
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,208
Why don't you just
tell him that you like him?!

156
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,416
Oh and lie?

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
I can't do that even if
it will get me laid!

158
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,125
It's not a lie!

159
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,541
Just do the deed already!

160
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,416
Fine, don't.

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,625
But the least you could do is

162
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,000
apologize for being
such a jerk about it.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,083
Let's practice...!

164
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,208
Tell me what you're
gonna say to him!

165
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,541
Sorry you're such an idiot!

166
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,416
That's not gonna pass
as an apology...

167
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,083
...seriously.

168
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
I can't even find
a way to be alone

169
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,958
with him when
I want to apologize.

170
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,291
Field Day's coming up...

171
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,500
Now's your chance
to redeem yourselves.

172
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,041
I wanna see tears and blood!

173
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,958
It doesn't matter how you play
the game as long as you win!

174
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,291
I'm scared...

175
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,625
Is this P.E. or jail?

176
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
We need to figure
out who our planning

177
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,791
committee is
going to be, all right...

178
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,000
raise your paws if
you'd like to volunteer.

179
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,625
Oh, geez, calm down...

180
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,125
You know I'm just gonna
pick volunteers anyway.

181
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,958
You two.
Kosuda and Yamada...

182
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,291
Or should I call you Kosamada?

183
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,750
I get it!

184
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,791
'Cause they're like
a couple and stuff?

185
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,208
How did she even
find out about that?

186
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,500
It's kind of creepy.

187
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,041
Gosh that was awkward...

188
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,708
There's no way she's gonna
want to work with me now.

189
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,750
Awkward...!

190
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
Doesn't look
like we have a choice...

191
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,000
I guess I'll do it!

192
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,416
Don't do me any favors.

193
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm just trying
to embarrass you.

194
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,375
Any objections to doing the
same events we do every year?

195
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,500
Alright...

196
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,208
Any ideas on events
to add this year?

197
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,500
Co-ed three--legged--race!

198
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,875
Co-ed mud wrestling!

199
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,041
Co-ed Twister!

200
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,083
Wow...

201
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,541
She seems pretty
excited about that.

202
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,666
Anyone interested in
being the event recorder...?

203
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,458
This person will be in
charge of taking pictures.

204
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,666
Oh!
I can do that!

205
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,291
Great...

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,333
Use a good lens.

207
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,541
Go to the media room
and check out

208
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,625
photos from last
year for reference.

209
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,958
Okay I will...

210
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,333
Can you remind me where that is?

211
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,208
Oh please...

212
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,625
You know exactly where it is.

213
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,166
You've been there
at least one other time!

214
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,083
Oh...

215
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,833
I didn't know
what it was called.

216
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,791
Don't just stand there...

217
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,375
Do your research.

218
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,208
This could be promising.

219
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,958
It's such a small room.

220
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,708
And we're alone!

221
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,333
--Yamada!
--Kosuda!

222
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,500
Sorry.
You go ahead.

223
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,583
I insist.

224
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,291
Okay...

225
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,833
Here's what...

226
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,416
If you haven't noticed I've
been avoiding you for a while...

227
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,458
...and uh...

228
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,458
Why is this so hard?!

229
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,333
Great, let me guess--

230
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,750
it would be so much easier
if I'd just go the 'H' away?!

231
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,458
And I wanted to
say I'm sorry, okay?!

232
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,458
I did it, crap that was painful!

233
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,791
Am I hearing things?

234
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,083
Sorry, could you repeat that?

235
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:35,958
Don't push it!

236
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,750
Okay...

237
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,916
It's all good...

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
...and yeah, it didn't
even bother me...

239
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,125
I'm totally fine.

240
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,833
What do you mean
it didn't bother you?!

241
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,125
I'm lying!
It bothered me!

242
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,375
I've gone completely
emo over the whole thing!

243
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,500
Okay. So what were
you going to say?

244
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,833
Um...

245
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,875
It's about what happened
with the popularity poll.

246
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,041
That was...

247
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,000
That was how I feel!

248
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,791
And?!

249
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,750
And I...

250
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,041
I was wondering if you...

251
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,083
If you felt the same?

252
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,458
He cannot be serious.
Is he that stupid?!

253
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,791
Remember when I apologized?

254
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,250
That might have been
an answer--I dunno!

255
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,250
What's happening...?!
Is she upset?

256
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,250
Thinking of something to say?

257
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,916
If you don't like me,
just tell me okay?!

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
I'll leave you alone!

259
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,625
Are you seriously crying?!

260
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,750
Look, I never said...

261
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,583
...that I didn't like you.

262
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,583
So she doesn't dislike me?

263
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,875
That means something...

264
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,750
I'll accept even a slim
chance at this point!

265
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,750
You make my brain hurt!

266
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,833
You actually said that...?

267
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,583
Omigosh saying you don't dislike
him means that you do like him!

268
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,625
If I said I hated him,
he wouldn't have sex with me...!

269
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,166
That's all this is!

270
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,375
Why're you always trying to
make it into something more?!

271
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,833
Because I know you...
and I know you don't have

272
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,541
the balls to admit
it's what you really want.

273
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,416
That's what 'busted' looks like!

274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,708
It's okay to admit you
actually like him, ya know.

275
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,916
It's so exhausting
being right all the time.

276
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,666
Don't do it!
It gets better!

277
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,875
This isn't fair...

278
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,458
It shouldn't be so hard.

279
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,708
I thought if you're in love,
you're supposed to be happy

280
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,583
all the time and annoy
everyone around you?

281
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,375
So why does it hurt?

282
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,958
I just want it to be over.

283
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,666
Are we still here?

284
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,916
Things'll change if you
hold on for one more day.

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,666
She is confusing the
crap outta me right now.

286
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,458
B Gata H Kei!

287
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,958
Thank you sir!

288
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,375
Have a great day!

289
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,083
I hope you'll fly
with us again soon.

290
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,375
It was a pleasure
flying with the

291
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,750
most beautiful
women in the world.

292
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,625
Who is that?

293
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,708
Damn he's beautiful!

294
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,125
Is he someone famous?

295
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,708
Marry me!
Let's run away!

296
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,750
Princess, no!

297
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,250
I'm sorry,
I know that's sudden...

298
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
If marriage is out of the
question, perhaps coffee first?

299
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,583
If nothing else,
I'd love to know your name...

300
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,125
When I return home,
I'll tell everyone

301
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,625
that Japan was
my favorite stop...

302
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,750
Please, tell me your name!

303
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,791
Keiichi...

304
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,708
Kanejo

305
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,875
Are you all right?!

306
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,958
Keiichi Kanejo...

307
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,250
Keiichi Kanejo.

308
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,041
Put your hopes in Field Day!

309
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,166
Suit yourself...

310
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,291
Autumn.

311
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,791
Hold onto your poms poms...

312
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,541
It's field day

313
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:03,500
Cheese wiz!

314
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,791
What's going on?!

315
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,583
Second year,
Class H is competing

316
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,958
in the cheerleading competition.

317
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,750
Aren't we so sexy?!

318
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Hey...! Kanejo...
watch where you're going.

319
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,333
Say no more...

320
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,291
It's totally fine.

321
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,791
What the crap...?

322
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,333
That was weird.

323
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,500
Weird because she handled it
better than you would've, right?

324
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,000
Today not even
Yama--dumb can get to me...

325
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,791
I finally get to
see my brother again!

326
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,875
But...

327
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,958
I should make a
note to remind myself

328
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,416
to punish her
later for touching me.

329
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
So...

330
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,750
Wanna tell me
what you're looking for?

331
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,041
I just want to make
sure I don't run into Kosuda.

332
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,250
You're still playing that game?

333
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,250
No but...

334
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,291
I don't want
to deal with it now.

335
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,250
I need to focus.

336
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,541
Picture time!

337
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,791
That's a very
focused pose there.

338
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,166
Oh yeah...
go on ahead.

339
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,708
I'll be right here!

340
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,166
I guess she's
still avoiding me...

341
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,333
I knew it was
too good to be true.

342
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,958
I don't know what to do anymore.

343
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:03,666
Hey...

344
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,083
What's up Kosuda.

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,958
Matsuo...!

346
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,666
You're just the
guy I wanted to see!

347
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,958
Thanks, I guess.

348
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,041
And that's
where I am right now...

349
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry...

350
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,125
I hope I didn't bore you.

351
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,208
You didn't bore me at all.

352
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,666
I was worried about you two.

353
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,000
Should I have said all that...?

354
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,166
I mean, he doesn't even know

355
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,208
Yamada and I
told him everything...

356
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,708
I wonder if he thinks
I'm a dramatic mess.

357
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,708
I didn't mean to look bored.

358
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,041
It's just that I already heard
the whole story from Takeshita.

359
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,125
My guess is that
with everything happening

360
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,208
the way it did Yamada just
needs some time to process it.

361
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,666
So she's not mad?

362
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,500
No, if that were the case
you wouldn't see her at all.

363
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,291
I mean, she's still popping
up here and there, right...?

364
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,083
So relax...

365
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,166
You laid a lot on her.

366
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,875
Give her some
time to think about it.

367
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,833
You're so right!
Thank you so much!

368
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,041
You know...

369
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,125
...sometimes I worry
that I'm gonna wake up

370
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,708
and find out it
was all just a dream.

371
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,166
I think you worry too much.

372
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,916
Yamada~!

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,416
What--a--ya?!

374
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,583
You have realized you can't
avoid Kosuda forever, right?

375
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,041
At some point you're
gonna have to face him

376
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,291
and decide
what you want to do...

377
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,541
Either be with him
or leave him alone.

378
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,875
What I want is
for him to lay back

379
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,291
and let me take the lead.

380
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,875
Whatever.

381
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,041
What you want is to lay back and
let a hundred Kosudas take ...

382
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:10,916
Oh nevermind.

383
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,375
You are such a waste of skinny!

384
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,916
Have I mentioned
how pretty you are?

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,750
You look so hot in that uniform.

386
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,750
That's very sweet.

387
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,083
Fine, I'll say it.

388
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,583
We all want to know if you
have a boyfriend or not.

389
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,625
I don't want a boyfriend...!

390
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,625
The only commitment I'll
ever make is to my brother!

391
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,375
Not that I can
say that out loud...

392
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,500
Plus, there's her.

393
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,083
Look who doesn't
have a boyfriend!

394
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,375
Pretty Miss 'I went to school
in the U.S. but no one cares!'

395
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,041
Yes, I do.

396
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,000
My boyfriend's the hottest,
smartest guy in the world!

397
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,291
No way!

398
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,166
That sucks so hard...

399
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,791
I hate you!

400
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,666
I wonder why that bothers
you so much, Yamada?

401
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,083
Why are you sinking
so low because

402
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,250
I have a boyfriend, hmm,

403
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,708
could it be because
you don't have one?

404
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,500
I knew it...!

405
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,500
You're such a fake!

406
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,375
Screw you...!

407
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,916
You don't know me!

408
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I guess I don't...

409
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,958
Tell me then...
Do you have one or not?

410
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,791
I...

411
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,041
I uh...

412
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,666
Next up is second year
girl's Shoulder Wars!

413
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,916
What?!
Where's she going?!

414
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,791
Did she just make
a 'tsk' sound at her?

415
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,833
The next event will be

416
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,958
second year
girl's shoulder wars!

417
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,500
Good luck!

418
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,333
How'd she figure out I
don't have a boyfriend...?!

419
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,916
She must've been stalking me.

420
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
Well now she's gonna pay!

421
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't get used to that headband!

422
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,041
'Cause you won't be wearing
it by the end of the game!

423
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,125
Bring it, hotpants!

424
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,250
Seriously?!

425
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,208
You're both on the
same freaking team!

426
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,875
It's so about to be on!

427
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,208
Dammit!

428
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,000
Go over to where Kanejo is!

429
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,375
Um, we're the legs so
we decide where to go!

430
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,291
No, you guys are
supposed to be the horse...

431
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm the rider.

432
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:51,916
I'm in charge!

433
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,791
Did you call me a horse?!

434
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,291
Why'd you take
off your headband?!

435
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,208
What's going on?

436
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,625
Holy crap!

437
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,458
You really don't care
that you look like a freak...

438
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,500
That's the reason you
can't get a boyfriend isn't it?

439
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,916
How can someone like you...
be so damn pathetic?!

440
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,625
I never said I didn't have one!

441
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,083
But if I were you,
I would hope that I do...

442
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,375
...because if I don't then I'm
gonna have to steal yours!

443
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,166
I'll kill her before I let
her hit on my brother...

444
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,708
...skeezer!

445
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
No you didn't!

446
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,750
I don't know what came over me!

447
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,208
What were you thinking Yamada?

448
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,791
That hurt!

449
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,458
At this point I have to consider
that I may have been adopted.

450
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,333
Who's that?

451
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,333
He's so hot~!

452
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,125
The next event will be the

453
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,291
second year girl's
scavenger hunt race.

454
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,750
Kyoka?

455
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,000
Are you ready...?

456
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,500
I think you're up next.

457
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,916
I'm all over
this scavenger hunt!

458
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,250
I can find anything...!

459
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,416
Plus I'm sure there
are hot guys around here!

460
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,166
This is so not
the time for that.

461
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,875
One of these
envelopes has to have

462
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,500
"hottie" or "sexy guy"
written in it...

463
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,791
But which one...?

464
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,750
Misato Eyes...
activate!

465
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,500
There it is!

466
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,666
Tadaa~!

467
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,000
It's the wrong one!

468
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:06,666
What...?!

469
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,625
But... how?

470
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,875
Ohmigod!
There it is!

471
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,833
Here!
Switch me tickets!

472
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,375
What did you see
in the envelopes?

473
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,166
Hot guy!

474
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,125
I'm looking for you!

475
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,750
Come on out!

476
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,333
Where's my brother?
Why isn't he here yet?

477
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,791
Hi!
What's going on?

478
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,375
Kyoka?
Is that you?

479
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,958
Yes, darling brother...

480
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,125
How long are you going to keep
me waiting out here all alone?

481
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,250
I'm so sorry sweetie!

482
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,125
I'm kind of busy right now!

483
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,333
I found a hottie!

484
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,625
Yay!

485
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,250
--What are you doing?!
--Run, Hottie, run~!

486
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,458
He's so hot~!

487
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,250
I'm impressed.

488
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,750
But who is that guy?

489
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,291
Congratulations, you won...!

490
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,750
Can you tell me
what your name is, sir?

491
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,208
I'm Keiichi Kanejo...

492
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,375
My baby sister, Kyoka,
is second year, Class H...

493
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,000
It's good to see everyone today!

494
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,041
Can I keep you...?
You're so cute!

495
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
Hey little sis, how's it going?

496
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,333
You're looking well.

497
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,250
I am now that you're here.

498
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,500
It was you!

499
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
You're the one who
was fighting Kyoka

500
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,541
in the shoulder wars, right?

501
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,750
Where are you going?

502
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,083
I'm Keiichi...

503
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,166
Keiichi Kanejo.

504
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,166
Nice to meet you...

505
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,583
What's your name?

506
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,833
Yamada.

507
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,583
Such a beautiful name...
for a beautiful girl.

508
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,833
Oh no...

509
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,333
What's going on...?

510
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,000
That random hot guy just told
Yamada she was beautiful.

511
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,541
And look at the size
of his camera.

512
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,333
That's a high--end
single lens reflex digital!

513
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,500
There's no way I
can compete with that...

514
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,291
Mine is just a
used film camera...

515
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,125
There's only so much
you can do with it...

516
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,541
They're in totally
different leagues...!

517
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,833
Someone just kill me now!

518
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,666
It's such a treat to
see someone like you

519
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
after being away from
Japan for so long.

520
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,750
A token of our new friendship.

521
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,333
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

522
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:54,750
All right!

523
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,625
She showed him!

524
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,625
That rules!

525
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,583
Oh wow.

526
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,583
That was so cool!

527
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,666
Douche repellant!

528
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,375
Now they just want
to bang her more!

529
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,666
I'll kill you for this...!

530
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,500
No one humiliates
my brother like that!

531
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,458
It's okay, it's more fun
when there's a challenge.

532
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,166
So you know her?

533
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,083
What's she like...?

534
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,291
You two are friends aren't you?

535
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,000
No...!

536
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,541
He can't be into her!

537
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,083
This whole sneaking around and

538
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,708
running away thing
is really getting old.

539
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,291
But I don't know
what else to do.

540
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
This sucks so much!

541
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,250
Hi...
Yamada?

542
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,666
So uh...

543
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,125
I wanted to ask...

544
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,875
...about what happened with
Kanejo's brother earlier.

545
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,208
Did you blow him off
because you like me...?

546
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,875
Okay that sounds so pathetic...

547
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,666
I can't ask her that--who
would ever ask her that?

548
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,791
Why does he do that?!

549
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,708
If you have
something to ask, ask...!

550
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,958
Besides, if you don't,

551
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,833
I can't tell you I dissed
that guy for you.

552
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,208
Yamada... I know
Kanejo's brother is hot.

553
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,666
Finally!

554
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,541
They both are, actually...
and that's not the point...

555
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,500
...but it is rare that both
siblings are so hot.

556
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,541
So?!

557
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,791
And who the hell
are you talking to?!

558
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,458
I'm sorry!
Don't kill me!

559
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,208
You've never
told me I was hot.

560
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,833
You never tell me
how pretty or sexy I am...

561
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,375
But you can just throw
it around about Kane--slut?!

562
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,750
Crap, it's getting awkward...

563
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,000
I should say something.

564
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:10,875
Yamada...

565
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,000
I want you to know that you look

566
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,833
very cute in your
cheerleading outfit!

567
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,916
I don't want to talk
to you right now!

568
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,541
And 'Most Dramatic' goes to~

569
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,625
You suck...
I'm leaving.

570
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,666
Yamada wait!

571
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,625
So um...
It's been awhile...

572
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,375
...since we went out I mean...

573
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,625
Would you ever give
me another chance?

574
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,666
Sure. Whatever.
I don't care.

575
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,958
All right!

576
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,041
Alright, you better not
screw this up for us...!

577
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,916
I want this date
to end in a banging!

578
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Go forth, young virgin!

579
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,666
Spread 'em wide
and create a love-slide!

580
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,416
Oh man, I love
our class so much!

581
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,791
Not gonna lie,
this is where you want

582
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,500
to be for the
bangin' body buffet.

583
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,666
My eyes are so hungry.

584
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,041
What the heck?

585
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,166
Hey, Yamada!

586
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,083
There you are!

587
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,416
Way to keep us
all waiting... Jerk!

588
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,375
I'm sorry.

589
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,583
But guess what...?!

590
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,458
I'm here now and we're
gonna bring it down!

591
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,125
Yeah!

592
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,583
Yamada.

593
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,000
You better watch
yourself, Yamada.

594
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,083
I just wish...

595
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,750
I wish I knew more about you.

596
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,875
Ohmigod he's looking!

597
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,958
Hey, I brought you something!

598
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:02,166
♪ closing song ♪

599
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,208
Okay, something
weird is going on with

600
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,875
Kanejo and her brother,
but I can't figure it out.

601
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,208
Whatever, it's my
first date in like,

602
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,791
forever and I'm not gonna
let that creep stop me.

603
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,583
No way!

604
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,000
Kanejo's brother is what?!

605
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,166
No Kanejo!

606
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,166
Stop! Please!

607
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,916
Oh no you don't, Skank-Nasty!

608
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,583
Get your paws off of Kosuda...!

609
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,333
See ya next time!
