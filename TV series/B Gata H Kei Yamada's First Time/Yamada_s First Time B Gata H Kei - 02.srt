1
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,875
How could you do that?!

2
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,916
I just, I didn't, um.

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,166
They're referring
to episode one.

4
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,833
What is that thing...?!

5
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,916
And now we're caught up.
You're welcome.

6
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,250
You realize there's no
getting around that, right?

7
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,875
I was like, "thanks, stupid.

8
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,416
Thanks for the mouse." 

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,875
I don't know why she'd get me
there and then just leave...

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,000
Probably so she can laugh
about it with her friends.

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,708
Oh, great.

12
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,375
Takeshita...!

13
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,708
You have to make it better.

14
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,666
I mean, seriously.

15
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,250
Oh, yeah!

16
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,458
Let's go to a pool!

17
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,750
You wanna see me
in a swimsuit, right?!

18
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:23,541
Pool?

19
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,000
Yep...

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,333
I'm bringing my boyfriend
so it would be cool if there

21
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,708
was another guy to
even things out, ya know?

22
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,625
Come on...

23
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,583
Please...?

24
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,875
With cherries?

25
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,791
Uh... Well... I dunno.

26
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,791
Maybe.

27
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,250
I can't...

28
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,000
I gotta study.

29
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:37,833
So wait...

30
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,166
You're not going?

31
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,958
It doesn't take her
long to snap...

32
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,916
Gotta admit,
it keeps things lively.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,708
She's crying.

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,916
Y'know, I can just study later.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,041
You're coming, then...?

36
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,250
That's awesome...!

37
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,083
I'll text you later
where to meet us, okay?

38
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,750
It'll be fun.

39
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,208
Thank you so much!

40
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,583
You're the best...!
Except for the fact that

41
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,083
you never talk about
your boyfriend...

42
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,375
You guys do it, right?

43
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,416
I think I deserve
some details, lady.

44
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,375
Oh you do, do you?

45
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,125
Don't you understand how
important this is to me?

46
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:07,916
I need you...!

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,041
Did it hurt a lot...?

48
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,833
Lights on or off?

49
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,000
Was it fast or slow?

50
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,333
Did you guys take
a shower together...?

51
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,166
What happens if
it smells funny...?

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,291
And you wonder why I
haven't mentioned it before.

53
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,166
This has 'do me'
written all over it.

54
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,500
Hopefully it still
will when I try it on.

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,916
Interesting...

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,333
So if I tie it like that then...

57
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,541
Oh no...!

58
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,041
How did that happen?!

59
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,291
Whatev...

60
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,458
Not like I have anything
to really worry about.

61
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,416
I mean...
just look at this bod, hello.

62
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,208
Hey chicken cutlets,
how you doin?

63
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,458
So we're going swimming...

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,916
Awesome...

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,333
I wonder what kind
of swimsuit she wears.

66
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,708
Unless...

67
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,000
Unless she doesn't
wear one at all.

68
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,083
That's totally fine, too.

69
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,583
Just kidding.

70
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,083
Best workout in
the history of ever!

71
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,416
Don't you knock?!

72
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,000
'Scuse you...!
Where're your clothes?!

73
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,791
I didn't want to
get sweat on 'em.

74
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,166
This may come as a shock...

75
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,666
...but I don't really
want to see you naked.

76
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Ah, check her out...!

77
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,041
They can't help it.

78
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,750
They don't see hotness
like this every day.

79
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,625
Hey Kosuda...!

80
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,541
Feel free to drop to your
knees and worship me.

81
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,208
Warning...! Warning...!
Warning...!

82
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,291
Okay, you can get up.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,250
I was totally
kidding about all that.

84
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,625
I know...
I will.

85
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,375
Get control of yourself, kid.

86
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,750
Yamada!

87
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,458
What's up...?
F--cup.

88
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,458
I have a name...

89
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,625
Let's use it...
Okay?

90
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,125
Ouch!
That's my face!

91
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,750
I need you to lock it up today!

92
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,250
What?

93
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,583
My boyfriend's here and I
don't want him to freak out...

94
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,583
He doesn't need to know
I have slut--box friends.

95
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,041
What the crap?!

96
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,375
Hey there.

97
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,583
I'm Daisuke Matsuo...

98
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,625
Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,875
He's a senior...

100
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,750
You remember that little
bookstore by my house?

101
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,416
Turns out he works
there part time...!

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,583
This is Yamada.

103
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,125
Hello!

104
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:20,958
And this is--

105
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,750
Hi! Sorry...
I'm Kosuda.

106
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,916
Nice to meet you...

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,666
So Yamada good to
put a face to the name.

108
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,833
I've heard a lot about you.

109
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,083
Is that so?

110
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,125
Oh gross.

111
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,500
Is she flirting with him?

112
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,916
That could get awkward...

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,041
Seriously hope
I'm imagining things.

114
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,083
You're in the library club?

115
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,416
Uh... Yeah.

116
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,833
What kind of
books do you like...?

117
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,500
I prefer the classics myself.

118
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh me too...!

119
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,000
Way better than
that trendy crap.

120
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,166
I know right...?

121
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,916
Actually...

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,208
I know everyone says this,

123
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,416
but I really enjoy
Russian authors the most...

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,750
They just move me...

125
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,916
Dostoyevsky and
Tolstoy are great...

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,291
He's like the
smartest guy in the world!

127
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,958
What the crap?!
Is Kosuda flirting with him?!

128
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,250
I'm not buying that
proper school--boy act.

129
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,916
He and Takeshita get freak nasty

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and I want
to ask him about it!

131
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,125
I wanna ask him about
all the dirty little details

132
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,375
but I can't because Breasty
Betty says I'm not allowed to!

133
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,083
And I shouldn't
have to tell you that!

134
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
It's so cold!

135
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,666
I'm gonna work on my tan today;

136
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,333
You should too so we can match!

137
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,750
It's like so PDA up in here.

138
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,375
They're perfect together.

139
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,833
Must be nice...

140
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,791
Man, she's so hot...

141
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,166
...and way too good for me...

142
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,291
But she's being extra weird
today for some reason.

143
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,500
What am I supposed to
do if I can't talk about it?!

144
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,458
How 'bout swim?!

145
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Good idea!

146
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,333
Hey you...!

147
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,833
Wanna swim?

148
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,958
So much has already
happened between us.

149
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,458
It's hard to believe this is the
first time we've held hands.

150
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
I love that she's
having such a great time!

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,041
This is awesome...

152
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,875
I'm glad I came.

153
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,666
Lotta stairs...

154
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,375
What the...?!

155
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,791
Where are we?!

156
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,250
Oh my god!
So fun!

157
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,333
Can't we do
something else first?!

158
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,208
Heights...

159
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,541
I don't like heights.

160
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,041
Are you ready?!

161
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,291
Kosuda's making his move!

162
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,625
I scored~!

163
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,291
C'mon let's go...!

164
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,833
I wanna ride it all day long.

165
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,000
What?!

166
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,208
Yay! Again!

167
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,958
Takeshita!

168
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,541
Hey guys.

169
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,125
Are you gonna
be okay, Kosuda...?

170
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,041
You want us to take
you to lie down somewhere?

171
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,750
No...
Fine.

172
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,208
Next in line, please.

173
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,500
That's us, Daisuke

174
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,083
Right.

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,708
Help!

176
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,416
What...?!
No way!

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,458
Does he swing that way?

178
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,291
Why was he holding
him like that?

179
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,666
Keep him out of
your pervy voice overs!

180
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,000
What?

181
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,750
You were afraid on the slide...?

182
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,458
That's why you were grabbing me?

183
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,875
Well... Yeah...

184
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,208
I'm kind of a
wuss about heights.

185
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,416
He wasn't using it as
an excuse to fondle me?

186
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,916
He was just afraid to fall off?

187
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,000
That's lame.

188
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,666
Come on. Everyone has
something they're afraid of.

189
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,833
I know!

190
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,916
I thought it was a
baby this whole time!

191
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,500
That reminds me--isn't there
a fireworks display?

192
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,833
Oh yeah...!

193
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,083
There was an ad
on here that said they

194
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,250
start at seven thirty
in the amusement park.

195
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,750
We can rent
Yukatas too if we want.

196
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,583
Tada!

197
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
What do you think of the Yukata?

198
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,750
Jeepers...!

199
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,083
Yamada looks so hot in that!

200
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,583
You look so beautiful tonight.

201
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,750
Matsuo is so frikkin' smooth...

202
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,041
Wish I could be that way.

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,291
So um...

204
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,250
I gotta pee!

205
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,416
This is where
you go after her...!

206
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,541
You can't just stand there
if you expect to score points!

207
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,000
But...

208
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,916
Don't try to explain anything...

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,625
and don't try to make any
excuses for your behavior.

210
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,291
What do I say then?

211
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't say anything...

212
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,208
Just hold her...

213
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,833
That'll mean so much
more to her than words.

214
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,166
Look...!

215
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,000
Pretty!

216
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,958
Wow!

217
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,958
If he was so afraid of falling
off the stupid water slide...

218
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,708
Why didn't he just wear
a floaty or something?

219
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,875
He didn't have to
confuse me like that.

220
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,250
Yamada.

221
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,625
We're not...

222
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,333
We're not on a slide now.

223
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,500
"We're not on a slide now?!"

224
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
It's okay.

225
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,500
I forgive you.

226
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,458
And that was it!

227
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,500
So awesome...

228
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,208
You guys are
really cute together.

229
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
We are not together!

230
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,541
I'm just using him to lose
my V-card--you know this!

231
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,541
Put your guns away.

232
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,958
Anyway...

233
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
I'm making good progress
because it's gonna happen soon.

234
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,750
Sure it is.

235
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,625
So...

236
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,666
I'm buying them today.

237
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,791
Buying who?

238
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,416
I'm buying condoms.

239
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,041
What if he doesn't
want to have sex with you?!

240
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,041
There's so many...

241
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:15,916
How do you choose...?

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,833
Let's see...

243
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,125
Shut up!
These ones are scented?!

244
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,166
Ya know...
If he sees those in your purse

245
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,666
he's gonna think
you get laid a lot.

246
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,791
Good; that's the point!

247
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,708
You would say that.

248
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,083
And check it out...!

249
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,833
They've even got little pink
ones with polka--dots!

250
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,500
Great.
Can I go home?

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,541
Men's tips for a hot summer...

252
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,125
Keep a condom in
your wallet at all times...

253
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,750
That's not gonna help
you out much, now is it?

254
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,666
'Bout as much as it'll help you!

255
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,916
Oh man...

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,041
I wonder what that hot
piece of Yamada's up to.

257
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,250
Why?!

258
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,333
She's probably out with one of

259
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,208
the many popular
guys she's dating...

260
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,166
I bet he's getting all up in
those guts, too.

261
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,333
Yamada isn't like that!

262
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,666
I don't think.

263
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,875
But maybe...

264
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,625
Maybe I should carry
a condom just in case.

265
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,375
I can't do it!
I can't go in there!

266
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,041
It's too soon!

267
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,791
I'm just not ready!

268
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,750
Huh...?

269
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,291
What do they mean
'don't let air in?'

270
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,916
Safety buffet, anyone?

271
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
At least I'll
always be prepared.

272
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,666
Way to spend a bunch
of money for no reason. 

273
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,875
I wonder which
one Kosuda would use.

274
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:17,875
Not quite.

275
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,125
I'd say this is about right.

276
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,208
Yeah, you wish.

277
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,958
Not it.
Don't freak out.

278
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,541
Ahh!

279
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,250
I can't wait to find out!

280
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,708
I bet I know what
the next episode is about!

281
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,875
I'll say a little
prayer for you.

282
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,208
B Gata H Kei!

283
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,208
Good morning!

284
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,375
No it's not.
I have P.E first period!

285
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,125
Sucks for you!

286
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,375
What do you think?

287
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,375
What do I think about what?

288
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,208
We went on a date and he
invited me back to his room...

289
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,625
...so that means
it's okay, right?

290
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,291
I can tell him...

291
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,416
"Hey...

292
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,375
If you're hungry,
I brought utensils!"

293
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,916
What?

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,250
Tadaa!

295
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,291
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

296
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,541
I knew you'd be mad,
but you don't have to hit...

297
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,500
...that hurt.

298
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,333
Now that I think about it...

299
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,208
It's fine...

300
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,416
I don't know why I'm acting like

301
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
he's gonna hurt
you or something...

302
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,125
I'm sorry...

303
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,791
Matsuo and I were
just talking about

304
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,833
what a nice guy
Kosuda actually is...

305
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,125
In fact, he said...

306
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,208
You know, Kosuda's
actually a really nice guy.

307
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,208
Like that.

308
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,041
Did he ever say
anything about me?

309
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,333
It must be pretty rough being
friends with someone like her...

310
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,041
Be strong!

311
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,125
Nope.

312
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,500
Here comes the rival...!

313
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,791
Who's that F--cup girl?!

314
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,458
Kosuda!

315
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,416
Good morning!

316
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,166
A successful attack!

317
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,291
Um... Yes...
The morning is good!

318
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,000
Walk right into
my web, cherry boy...

319
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,625
Virgins are so cute.

320
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,375
And you would know.

321
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,625
Next we're going to go over
the Battle of Gaugamela

322
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,250
which took place in October,
three thirty one BC.

323
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,125
I just remembered we have
library committee duty today.

324
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,875
I'll get to be alone with him...

325
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,041
Well...

326
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,708
I guess I don't have
to rush anything...

327
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,291
His sister's like the only other
girl who talks to him anyway...

328
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,625
Wait.

329
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,375
Well?

330
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,833
Wait...
You'll see.

331
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,458
Who is that...?!

332
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,166
It's no one.

333
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,583
She's just lost and
needs directions, that's all--

334
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,125
...that's the only reason
she's even talking to him.

335
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,125
I baked a bunch
of cookies last night...

336
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,541
I can't possibly eat them all.

337
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,375
Oh, sweet...

338
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,625
Thanks!

339
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,791
I'm sorry...!

340
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,250
You must've grabbed a burnt one!

341
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,041
Way to go, four--eyes!

342
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,166
Yeah... I think
it was just that one...

343
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,291
These are awesome.

344
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,083
Oh good...

345
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,083
You can have some more.

346
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,291
She must be destroyed!

347
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
Here, take the rest of them.

348
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,500
I've got plenty.

349
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,375
You sure...?

350
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,458
Thanks...!

351
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,666
Want to walk with me?

352
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,041
Sure.

353
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,083
She's...

354
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
She's on library committee?

355
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,500
All right...!

356
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,708
What's going on?!

357
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,875
I just don't get it...

358
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,333
So you went and
ditched library committee?

359
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
Seriously...

360
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,416
I had no idea you were
such a wuss, Yamada.

361
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,583
Did you ever think that
maybe she's just his friend?

362
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,166
All they did was walk together.

363
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
She baked him cookies!

364
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,541
So! That doesn't necessarily
mean she's his girlfriend.

365
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,833
Look, he's not
the kind of guy that

366
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,916
girls just throw
themselves at, ya know?

367
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,666
It's kinda sad that there's
absolutely no way to argue that.

368
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,458
Don't...

369
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,333
Please don't make me!

370
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,083
You have to.

371
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,333
But why?

372
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,000
No one else can answer
your questions but him.

373
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,958
That girl?

374
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,833
Wow...
She's pretty cute.

375
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,791
Takeshita!

376
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,041
Shh!

377
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,208
How 'bout tonight...?
I'll go to your place.

378
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,041
Great.

379
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:38,791
His place...?

380
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,083
What?

381
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,333
That's dramatic.

382
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,000
Look, friends go to each
other's houses all the time.

383
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,416
I hate Kosuda!

384
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,833
Drunk on soda?

385
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,083
Here's what...

386
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,625
There's no way she
could be his girlfriend...

387
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,375
If she was, he would've told
you before we went swimming.

388
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,708
What should I do...?

389
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,666
Hire a hitman?

390
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,541
No.

391
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,625
What if I can't afford it...?

392
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,333
There's gotta be
another way to pay...!

393
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,375
With my body...?!

394
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,958
Omigosh!

395
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,125
Then that means my first time
is going to be with an assassin!

396
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,291
Would you just
shut up for a second...?!

397
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,791
You're not hiring anyone.

398
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay.

399
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,125
We're going to Kosuda's tonight.

400
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,416
What?!

401
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,791
You want to know
the truth, don't you?

402
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know if
I could handle that...

403
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,250
I mean...

404
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,333
I'm just...

405
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,833
I'm so fragile right now.

406
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,750
Shut up, let's go!

407
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,208
You sure about this?

408
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,875
Just dropping in uninvited...?

409
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,583
What if something happens...?

410
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,166
What if we get into a fight?

411
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,125
Fine, we won't go.

412
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,250
Just let her have Kosuda.

413
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,916
I'm gonna be right
here with you...!

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,833
Quit freaking out!

415
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,250
Wait a sec...

416
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,916
You're having fun
with this, aren't you?!

417
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,541
No I'm not!

418
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,500
So this is where he lives.

419
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,291
It suits him...

420
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,125
It's just an ordinary house.

421
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,958
Look...! There!

422
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,166
Omigosh she brought
a bag with her...!

423
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,916
Does that mean she's
gonna spend the night?!

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah...

425
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,916
She's gonna cuddle
up with scallions.

426
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,833
Meat! Meat!
I love meat!

427
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,000
Especially 'cause
it rhymes with 'eat!'

428
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,250
Coming!

429
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,291
Good evening.

430
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,583
Come on in!

431
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,000
Thanks for having us.

432
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,208
She brought her parents?

433
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,208
Mahiro, you have to slow down.

434
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:22,916
You're gonna choke.

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,833
No I won't!

436
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,791
This is the best meat ever!

437
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,416
They're having a cook--out?

438
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,833
Make sure you get some of
the veggies in there too, son!

439
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,916
Wow someone must
be starving out there...

440
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,416
What?! Yamada?

441
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,541
Shh! Shh!

442
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,625
Okay this is really random.

443
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,041
Why are you outside my house?

444
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,541
Well... Uhm...

445
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,833
Because of you...!

446
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,708
You told me Kosuda
didn't have a girlfriend...!

447
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,375
Who's that?!

448
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,458
You mean Miyano?

449
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,666
Oh that's rough...

450
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,125
I never guessed you'd
turn out to be a stalker!

451
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,125
What the crap...?!

452
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,750
I am not a stalker!

453
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,833
You kind of are.

454
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,875
Her family lives right there.

455
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,958
We've all been
close for awhile now...

456
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,416
Mayu and Takashi have gone
to the same school together...

457
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
...since childhood.

458
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,541
You mean...

459
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,541
...they grew up together?!

460
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,041
I'm the doctor
and you're sick, okay?

461
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,666
What the hell?

462
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,916
This just happens
from time to time.

463
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,958
Yeah...
I added more vegetables...

464
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,708
Try it and tell
me what you think.

465
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,541
Wow...!

466
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,625
I think you're a food angel!

467
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,666
It's awesome!

468
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,791
I'm glad...

469
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,250
I thought if you
liked my cooking

470
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,666
then maybe you'd want to...

471
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,916
...uh...

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,583
...maybe you'd like to uh...

473
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,708
I gotta go!

474
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:38,708
Seriously?

475
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,708
Talk about clumsy.

476
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,125
No one panic.
The grub is safe.

477
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,000
Thanks...

478
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,000
I appreciate it.

479
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,708
Nice catch, Mahiro!

480
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,416
You okay?

481
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
So yeah...

482
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,500
There's something
I've been meaning

483
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,916
to ask you about
for a while now.

484
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,416
You really like cooking,
don't you...?

485
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,458
I can tell.

486
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,958
Uh...

487
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,250
Yes.

488
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,875
You're gonna make a
great wife someday, then.

489
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,750
Wait a minute...

490
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,166
She's never even
told Kosuda how she feels.

491
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,000
It's been ten years.

492
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,041
There's nothing
going on between them...

493
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,208
It would be too weird,
they're like family.

494
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,750
Kosuda's not the only naive one.

495
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,916
Ten years, huh...?

496
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,708
Talk about devotion.

497
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,041
What...?!

498
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:20,916
Who cares how
long he's known her?!

499
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,916
That doesn't mean anything...!

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,291
Plus, I'm like so much cuter.

501
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,625
She's a nerd!

502
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,833
Boing, boing,
boing, boing, boing,

503
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,458
She's a very modest
hot nerd; and she cooks

504
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,250
and she's known
him for a decade...

505
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,916
Also, her boobs are like

506
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,458
ridiculously huge
and you're a B-cup

507
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,666
who acts like she's an H.

508
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,208
Shut up...!
I don't do that!

509
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,041
I don't think Kosuda
even knows she likes him...

510
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,208
I mean...

511
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,000
He's not exactly the
smartest guy I know.

512
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,791
It's not like he's
grossed out by her...

513
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,291
If she told him,
would they start dating?

514
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,166
Oh, this sucks so bad...

515
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,458
Do guys only date girls
because their boobs are big?

516
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,166
Seriously?!

517
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,500
Whatever...

518
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,958
If I can't do it with Kosuda,
I'll just find another guy.

519
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,708
Not like I really
cared about him.

520
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,458
He wishes.

521
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,958
I don't care if he likes her!

522
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,166
I never cared!

523
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,166
That's so not convincing.

524
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,416
I'm already totally over it!

525
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,958
The next day!

526
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,916
Ugh...
What am I gonna do?

527
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,875
You're still hung up on that?

528
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,041
This is getting old.

529
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm not a fan of
hanging out with a zombie.

530
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,416
Here.
I gotta go.

531
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,166
I'll see you in
class, all right?

532
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,541
Wait...!

533
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,916
If you need to use the
restroom, that one's closer.

534
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,750
That's it!

535
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,458
What's it?

536
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,041
I'm done waiting around!

537
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,791
I'm gonna go talk
to the nerd girl!

538
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,166
Huh?

539
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,250
Once she sees me she'll
know there's no competition!

540
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,666
You really thought
he'd pick you...?

541
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,875
Do you know who I am?

542
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,541
Thank you for reminding
me of my lowliness.

543
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,250
I'll never speak to him again!

544
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,666
And you're supposed
to be our heroine?!

545
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,208
I thought she was in this class.

546
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,000
There she is!

547
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,458
Thank you so much, Miyano...

548
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll get it back
to you this weekend.

549
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,125
No worries...

550
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
They're like little nerd clones.

551
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,083
Thanks.
Call me later, 'kay?

552
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,125
'Kay.

553
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,666
Looks like it's time
to make my move.

554
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,583
I'm so sorry!

555
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,583
Oh no!

556
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,416
That's not what
was supposed to happen!

557
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,750
Ow...
That hurt.

558
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,166
I am so sorry!

559
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,166
Are you okay?!

560
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,166
Do you need to
go see the nurse?!

561
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,250
You're talking to a poster.

562
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,541
I'm over here!

563
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,375
You dropped your glasses.
They're in my hand.

564
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh...!

565
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,541
Thank you that will help!

566
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,916
She is such a freaking klutz!

567
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,291
Oh hi, Yamada!

568
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,291
Hi...

569
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,541
How did you know
what my name was?

570
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Are you kidding?

571
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,791
You're so popular and beautiful,
how could I not know your name?

572
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,875
Oh, stop...!

573
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,750
Stop it some more!

574
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,625
No!

575
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,875
I will not let her throw me off!

576
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,416
I got this!

577
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,250
Well uh...
Thanks, Miyano...

578
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,875
That's very nice of you.

579
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,250
You just said my name!
How do you know me?

580
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,916
Because I know Kosuda.
And so do you.

581
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,291
Yeah, I saw you give
him your cookies...

582
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,583
Do you like him or something?

583
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,708
It wouldn't matter
if I did though.

584
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,291
He just likes the food I make.

585
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,750
Especially cookies...

586
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,833
He's not really
interested in me at all.

587
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,208
You sure...?

588
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,375
He wouldn't take them
from someone he didn't like!

589
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,041
You really think so?!

590
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,708
You're amazing...!

591
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,166
Thank you so much
for cheering me up.

592
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,125
You made my day!

593
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,125
What?

594
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,625
I can't believe
I never talked to

595
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,416
you just because you're pretty.
I thought you'd be mean...

596
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,583
...but you couldn't
be sweeter...

597
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,541
Oh stop. You don't
know what you're saying.

598
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,541
This may be too
much to ask but...

599
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,750
I don't really have any friends
I can talk to about boys...

600
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,916
Oh...

601
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,708
I see.

602
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,166
Well, you can talk to me!

603
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,666
Thank you so much!

604
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,333
You really are an amazing
person--and friend!

605
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,000
Did I really just see that...?

606
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,125
She's giving her love advice?

607
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,416
Don't believe everything you
read on the wooden signs.

608
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,958
To be continued!

609
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:02,291
♪ closing song ♪

610
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,500
The next episode
is all about art!

611
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,333
Artists are so sexy they make
me want to take my clothes off!

612
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,916
Just kidding...!

613
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,083
Kosuda's in the photography club
and gets to work in a darkroom.

614
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,750
Talk about a perfect, private
place to get your freak on!

615
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,083
Um...
Yamada!

616
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,916
There's also something
about a festival happening

617
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,125
and the queen of the
school--meaning me.

618
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,000
See you next time!
