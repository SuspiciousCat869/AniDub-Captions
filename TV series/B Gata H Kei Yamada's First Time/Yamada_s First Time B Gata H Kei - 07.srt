1
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,875
Next in line please!

2
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,958
Hello there...!

3
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,541
What can I get for ya?

4
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,500
I can't even call the progress
I'm making with Kosuda progress.

5
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,791
I'm too freaked too out
by this whole Kanejo thing.

6
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,833
It's throwing me off...

7
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,000
...and so...

8
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,375
I welcome you to the
first ever meeting of the

9
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,541
Take Down Kanejo
and Conquer Kosuda Club!

10
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,791
Yeah, that's not a
club I ever signed up for.

11
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,166
Wait...!

12
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,666
Help me, Takeshita!
You're my only hope and stuff!

13
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,708
Just tell me what you
would do in my sitch.

14
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,291
How would you fight her?

15
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,916
I wouldn't fight her.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,875
Well I would, so what should
I do to intimidate her?

17
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,041
I can play instruments!

18
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,250
I bet she can't!

19
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,916
I'm like a genius
at playing the recorder.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,375
I practice all the time.

21
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,125
Something tells me you're
not using it to learn music.

22
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,333
And P.S.

23
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,916
I don't think Kosuda's
into that right now.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,125
Into what?

25
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,958
Never mind.
Look, everyone has something

26
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,666
about them that
stands out, right?

27
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,000
So does Kanejo.

28
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,625
She's hot, smart and
doesn't rub it in your face.

29
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,583
Miyano's a sweetheart,
feminine, and a great cook...

30
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,916
It's okay for Kosuda
to notice that stuff.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,791
And~...

32
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,791
What about me?!

33
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,791
Oh right...

34
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,333
You, um...

35
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,791
Make it up!

36
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,541
Your strong points are all
hidden under

37
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,833
a big pile of awful,

38
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,958
but I know they're
there and you'll find them!

39
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,208
That was way harsh...

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,833
But I think I get it.

41
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,333
Listen up, losers!

42
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,750
Next week we're gonna
be starting swimming class.

43
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,958
Swimming?

44
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,041
Crap, I have to drop ten
pounds by next week!

45
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,916
Which is impossible.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,833
Except I don't want my
boobs to get any smaller.

47
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
I've got it!

48
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,041
Major duel in school swimsuits!

49
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,875
I'm not gonna lose against you!

50
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,958
Swim class means swimsuits.

51
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,666
Since we all have to wear
the same one it's gonna

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,333
be so obvious whose
bod rocks the most...

53
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,125
Wait, maybe that won't
be such a good thing.

54
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,125
That's so bleeping annoying!

55
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,625
Right!

56
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,000
I wasn't born with
a perfect face and

57
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,583
a body that won't
quit for nothing...!

58
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,541
I've gotta show these boys what
I was put on this planet to do!

59
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,583
The saddest part is
she actually believes that.

60
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,208
Legs, check...!

61
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,916
Armpits, check!

62
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,750
And what am I supposed
to do about all that?

63
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,958
I guess I could
just trim it a bit.

64
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,791
Argh!

65
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,833
No she di'n't!

66
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,375
I'm like so over
Kosuda for a while.

67
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,291
What happened...?

68
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,875
Is the world ending?

69
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,625
Dear god I love swim class...

70
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,875
I can't wait to see Yamada
in her swimsuit again.

71
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,166
Kosuda...!

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,333
What do you think...?

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,625
I picked it just for you!

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,333
Takashi!

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
This is hilariously tragic.

76
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,000
You're not gonna get a
six pack by next week.

77
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,625
Wow~ I don't
know how you do it,

78
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,291
but you look great in that!

79
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,625
Yeah~

80
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,916
I gotta change.
I'm running so late!

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,833
Alright, let's see
what sorry sacks

82
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,916
you've got hiding under there.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,208
Are you okay?

84
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,666
Yeah, I just fell
asleep for a sec!

85
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,833
Weird, huh?!

86
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,416
That is the fakest
laugh I've ever heard.

87
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,166
Yes, Just in time!

88
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,625
Let's see what
we're working with here.

89
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,291
They're not very big
but their shape is good

90
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,208
and she's got great legs too...

91
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,250
I hate her.

92
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,125
Sweet!

93
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,875
That's a great swimsuit, Kanejo!

94
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,375
It's a competition suit...

95
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,708
I don't have a school swimsuit.

96
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,000
They don't wear them in America.

97
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,250
Wow that's so cool!

98
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,875
Like you couldn't just buy one!

99
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,333
Whatever, just wait
until I'm looking

100
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,208
hot stretched out by the pool!

101
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,208
I'm finally gonna get to see
Kanejo in a swimsuit today!

102
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,666
She's hot,
but I'm more interested

103
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,291
in seeing what Yamada's got.

104
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,541
Gross...

105
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,083
I don't want these tools
drooling over Yamada.

106
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,625
There they are!

107
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,125
Oh man, look at Kanejo!

108
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
Absolutely perfect...!

109
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,416
You think those are Cs or Ds?

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,833
Takeshita is lookin' good
and stacked from the back!

111
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,500
And I don't think I've ever
seen Miyano without glasses!

112
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,375
She's actually pretty cute!

113
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
Yay!
It's pool time~!

114
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,125
Yeah...
and then there's that one.

115
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello~ Katase,
Kobayashi and Sakai!

116
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,625
Do you have any idea how
much I love swim class?

117
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,916
Yep...
Sure do!

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,458
It gets better...

119
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,083
'Cause now you get to stare at
the hottest bod all day ...!

120
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,708
Yamada's arrived and the
troll--girls can go home!

121
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,458
I know you're not including
me in that 'troll' statement.

122
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,625
Check me out!

123
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,791
I researched sexy
poolside poses online

124
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,708
for hours last night
just for the occasion!

125
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,500
Whoa!

126
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,291
Yamada!
What are you doing?!

127
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,041
You are not in a French window!

128
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,458
She's so...
so hot.

129
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,750
Boing.

130
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,291
Eat it up, Kosuda...

131
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,375
Eat... it... up.

132
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,708
What is wrong
with you, you jerk?!

133
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,125
Why aren't you looking at me?!

134
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Because that's not
what this is about!

135
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,125
What?!

136
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,125
No way!

137
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,875
You can't swim...?
I had no idea.

138
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,541
It's not that I can't...
I'm just not very good at it.

139
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,791
Hey Yamada!

140
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,291
Miss Akai told me that
you were number one in

141
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,583
the crawl stroke the first year
we were in class together.

142
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,583
Do you remember?

143
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,166
I do...!

144
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,375
Because unlike Takeshita, I'm
actually a very good swimmer...

145
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,666
Wait!

146
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,708
Omigod! Is it because
of my breast size?!

147
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,541
Of course not!

148
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,083
Don't be ridiculous!

149
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,083
Hot damn...!

150
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
That was so incredible!

151
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,458
What happened?

152
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,750
Kanejo's being awesome.

153
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,833
Oh please!

154
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,916
She's just doing
it to get attention!

155
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,833
Wow...
and she's fast.

156
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,666
Misato doesn't stand
a chance against her!

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,750
That was fantastic, Kanejo!

158
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,291
Thanks...

159
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,583
I had a lot of practice during
my middle school tournament

160
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,000
while I was in the U.S.

161
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah!

162
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,750
She's the coolest
girl in school!

163
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,333
I call foul!

164
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,666
And I call 'shut up.'
This is a swimming class not

165
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,125
a competition for horny
male attention, geez.

166
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,208
All right...

167
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,875
I'll be clocking
your speed this time.

168
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875
'Kay I'm ready.

169
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,583
No way.

170
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,000
Yamada's racing Kanejo?

171
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,250
Man, that girl's brave.

172
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,541
I hope their swimsuits fall off!

173
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,625
Yamada...

174
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,666
Bring it!

175
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,791
Let me know when
the parade is over.

176
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,250
Okay girls, ready?

177
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,500
This could get ugly.

178
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,250
She's good, but can
she beat someone

179
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,833
who competed in a
U.S. tournament?

180
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,500
Get set!

181
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,166
Look!
A U.F.O.!

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,833
No way! Where?!

183
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,666
Later!

184
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,416
Snooze, ya lose, beyotch!

185
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,625
Seriously...?!

186
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,250
Weren't you the one
calling fouls earlier?!

187
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,750
Oh that was smooth...

188
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,583
I guess you are
more than just pretty...

189
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,500
I may actually enjoy this race.

190
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,958
Yamada's pretty fast isn't she?

191
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,291
Yeah, but look,
Kanejo's catching up!

192
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,541
She's gonna win!

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,375
So who won?

194
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,666
I don't know.

195
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,708
The winner is...

196
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,583
Kanejo!

197
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,708
That was a good race...

198
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,958
Exactly what
I expected from you.

199
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,250
Just so you know...

200
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,000
It'll be a long time before you
ever stand a chance against me.

201
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,083
Congratulations, Kanejo!

202
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,708
You're amazing!

203
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,916
Oh thanks...

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,208
...but Yamada was just
going easy on me!

205
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,250
She's so sweet.

206
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,000
Everything okay?
You need help?

207
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,916
I hate her!

208
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,291
She's...
got it...

209
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,458
...coming...
just...

210
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,333
...wait.

211
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,708
I'll be better at school work,

212
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,416
social life, and at playing
the freakin' recorder!

213
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,750
But she still has that
extra something I don't...

214
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,583
She's so annoyingly charming...

215
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,958
And feminine...!

216
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,166
That's it! I need to become
so feminine and charming

217
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,750
that I can
take over countries!

218
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,250
Okay calm down.

219
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,583
Why don't we start with the
people in your class first?

220
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,125
Like the boys who
sit next to you?

221
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,000
I know!
I'll get Chika to coach me!

222
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,625
Which means I'll have
to ask her for something,

223
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,875
which makes me want
to hurl, but this is war!

224
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,708
Chika...!

225
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,916
I'm gonna ask you for help!

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,666
Make me charming
so I can beat Kanejo!

227
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you
making that face for?!

228
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,541
Uh, because it's lame to
pick fights with people?

229
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,250
Omigod!
Stop yelling at me...!

230
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
She started it!

231
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,708
It's the next day now.

232
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,625
Your first assignment
is to meet Kane-ho

233
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,541
so you can figure out the
best way to take her down!

234
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,583
Why do you hate me?

235
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,583
Look it's Chika!

236
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,958
Hey Chika!

237
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,583
Look, Yamada's
sister Chika is here!

238
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,500
She's very pretty.

239
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,583
Is that her baby sister?

240
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,291
Yep!

241
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,791
She's awesome!

242
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,791
Oh that girl...

243
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,958
She's usually walking with the

244
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,916
hot guys whenever
I've seen her...

245
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,291
She must be popular.

246
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,291
Whoa...

247
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,541
She's beautiful.

248
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,166
And I can tell she's
not a fake, too.

249
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,291
She's actually that cool...

250
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,500
How did she end up
competing with my sister...?

251
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,125
I feel so sorry for her.

252
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,000
If she's anyone worth knowing
she's got to have a boyfriend...

253
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,541
Ew...

254
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,833
Why is she just standing there
like some possessed zombie?

255
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,500
I can't get a good
read on her at all...

256
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,500
It's kind of impressive, though.

257
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,041
That's it read her, Chika!

258
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,541
Take good mental
notes so you can

259
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
tell me how to crush
this skankatron!

260
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,916
Nice to meet you.

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,708
Nice to meet you, too.

262
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,333
No way...

263
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,583
All right, listen up.

264
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,416
I don't want you lazy
jerks slacking off

265
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,916
just because it's
summer break...

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,833
That goes double
for you, Misato!

267
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,875
What~?!

268
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not a slacker, am I?

269
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,083
That's it.

270
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,458
That's how I'm
gonna make this work.

271
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,875
I'll become more sexually
attractive and charming

272
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,083
if I just do it with Kosuda.

273
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,125
I don't know why you
ever stop focusing on that.

274
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,416
It never works out for you.

275
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
And it's summer!

276
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,333
Everyone wants to hang out more
and it's okay to wear less...

277
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,916
Kosuda might
even be hot at night

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,666
and leave the windows open.

279
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,875
You're not even joking are you?!

280
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,875
Last summer I let Takeshita
plan everything we did ...

281
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,208
Not this year.

282
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,708
This year I am a man and
I will ask her out myself!

283
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,916
Yamada!

284
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,958
Hey Kosuda.

285
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,166
Hey...

286
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,541
I wanna talk to you
about summer break...

287
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,291
I want to take you out sometime!

288
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,916
Flutter!

289
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,791
Did I really just 'flutter'?!

290
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,625
Next in line please!

291
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,708
Hello there...!

292
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,583
What can I get for ya?!

293
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,541
This sucks.

294
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,875
Our schedules
don't match at all...

295
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,250
I should've known you'd
pull something like this!

296
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,833
You're never going to
get laid at this rate!

297
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,500
B Gata H Kei!

298
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,166
I'm bored.

299
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,291
This sucks.

300
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,458
I can't believe I
don't have any plans

301
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,625
at all with Kosuda this summer.

302
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,833
I can't go anywhere
without guys staring at me.

303
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,416
What if one of
them bags me first?

304
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,541
A special glimpse into
Kosuda's summer break.

305
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,291
I can't believe I'm spending
the summer running errands!

306
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,666
If we look like slobs, no one
will ever want to visit us!

307
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,000
It's important to get to
know your ancestors!

308
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,041
Yamada, is that you?

309
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, hi Kazuki, how
are you doing today?

310
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,333
Well this is a strange
coincidence, isn't it?

311
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,291
Or is it?

312
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,375
I'm sorry...

313
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,875
He's not coming home today...

314
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
He already left
for our family trip...

315
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,375
I'm on my way out
there to meet them now.

316
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,791
So it's not just me...

317
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,166
He's out of town.

318
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,125
Have you ever heard of
Makinohara Camping Grounds?

319
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,500
We go every year...

320
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,833
We stay in one of the
bungalows there and fish,

321
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,875
have barbeques, make
s'mores and stuff like that.

322
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,791
It's pretty fun.

323
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,625
So cute that he still goes on
family trips during the summer.

324
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,250
It's like he's nine again!

325
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,083
We usually go out there with
our neighbors Miyano's family.

326
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,333
Say what?!

327
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,875
This is so not cute anymore!

328
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,000
Memories of a summer day...

329
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,166
Yamada returns to the wild!

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,958
This sucks...

331
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,208
He never told me
any of that crap!

332
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,166
Why would he leave out the
fact that Miyano was going?!

333
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,583
He didn't tell me because
he feels guilty...!

334
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,666
What are you hiding, Kosuda?!

335
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,125
That's good,
just a little bit higher...

336
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,208
Lift...!

337
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,375
I can't believe
I'm being told what

338
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,541
to do by a freaking
twelve year old...!

339
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,125
I'm taking this to my grave.

340
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,333
Mahiro... Stop!

341
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,000
I wonder what they're
doing right now.

342
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,125
I made it just the
way you like it!

343
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,833
All right!

344
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,458
I'm wearing a swimsuit now.

345
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,041
And I like it!

346
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,333
If you're ready...

347
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,291
I brought
you--know--what with me.

348
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,833
Winning!

349
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,791
No way I'm letting him bang her!

350
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,541
Death finds all traitors.

351
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,250
Make sure you get
yours before you kill him.

352
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,500
Great job!

353
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
Now that you're done with that,
go get us some water, okay?

354
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,083
Why are you such
a slave driver?!

355
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
I guess it was kinda
stupid to start walking

356
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,000
there when it was only a
thirty-minute car trip...

357
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,166
Ew it's hot.

358
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,916
It's time to put this gift
of a hot package

359
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
to work and hitchhike
all the way there!

360
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,000
You're too beautiful,
I can't help myself!

361
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,250
Hitchhiking is the best idea
I've ever had in my life!

362
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
Where're the cars...?

363
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,958
This sucks.

364
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,250
What am I doing...?

365
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,416
This is dumb...

366
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,791
What am I supposed
to say when I get there?

367
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,250
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do...!

368
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
I'll make him drop to
his knees and apologize!

369
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,541
Hello, young lady...

370
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,041
You look like you
could use a ride.

371
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,125
What the crap...?!

372
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,958
Who are these people?!

373
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,625
Omigod are those guns...?!

374
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,875
Are they criminals?!
Am I gonna die?!

375
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,541
I don't wanna!

376
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,791
Why can't I ever say no...?

377
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,375
Help!
I'm too pretty for this!

378
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,166
So what's the story, Kazuki?

379
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,833
Is there a husband
in your future?

380
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
Yeah, of course
there is eventually.

381
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,208
She's marrying me...!

382
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,541
Tell them!

383
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,208
I know I'm not very big now,
but I'm a good man!

384
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,541
Aren't you cute!

385
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,500
Look, I'll give you my number...

386
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,083
Okay this is kinda fun...

387
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,833
...but is it worth not having a
date with Yamada this summer?

388
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,083
I've decided I don't want
to come back here next year!

389
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,125
Okay how about this...

390
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,916
If only I could say it out loud.

391
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,833
Then I guess we'll just have to

392
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,333
have Takashi marry Mayu,
won't we?

393
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,791
I think that's
a great idea, dear.

394
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,625
I don't want to depress them.

395
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,375
Keep your head down low!

396
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,458
Right!

397
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,666
What is going on?!

398
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,041
Is this really what's
happening right now?

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,791
Listen up!

400
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,500
Take down whoever's in your way!

401
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,791
Annihilate the enemy!

402
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,666
Aye aye, sir!

403
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,750
Take that, and that,
and that, and that, and that!

404
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,291
And that and that and
that and that and that!

405
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,250
I call!

406
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,875
Four of a kind!

407
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:13,833
Crap...

408
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,916
You beat me again.

409
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,541
How do you do
that every single time?

410
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,500
Would anyone like
some watermelon?

411
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,541
Yes!

412
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,958
Excellent work Miss Yamada...

413
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,791
I don't think there's
anything left for

414
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,750
me to teach you out here today.

415
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,916
Thanks Captain.

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,750
You're welcome and
you can keep the gun.

417
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,208
Don't forget...

418
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,583
If you want something
bad enough, take it.

419
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,916
Yes sir...!

420
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,583
I appreciate all
you've done for me!

421
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,208
Power is justice...!

422
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,458
Just you wait, Kosuda!

423
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,583
Are you taking
pictures of the stars?

424
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,416
Yeah.

425
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,791
I don't know why I asked that.

426
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,875
Something told me
I'd find you here.

427
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,166
It's just like old
times when I used to go

428
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,500
to your house to
use the telescope...

429
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,916
I've always been
in love with the stars.

430
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,416
I'd give my life to be one of

431
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
those beautiful
lights in the sky.

432
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,333
Why?

433
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,458
Just hang in there!
It gets better, I promise!

434
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,708
According to this
I'm almost there.

435
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,750
You're almost there, Yamada.

436
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,083
You'll get to see Kosuda soon.

437
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,375
Wait a minute,
do I miss him or something?

438
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,875
No! Of course not,
I'm totally fine!

439
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,125
I know I came out here to tell
him how much he sucks...

440
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,625
...but now I don't care anymore.

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,791
Forest porn!

442
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,458
The pages are too wet
from all the rain to turn.

443
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,958
Thata girl.
Blame the rain.

444
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,875
Make it easier
for the kids at home.

445
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,833
There it is!

446
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,375
Kosuda...
I'm almost there!

447
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
Kosuda!

448
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,583
What was that?!

449
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
I don't know...
A bear?

450
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,250
Caw-caw-cacadoodle-doo!

451
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,125
Interesting, was that a chicken?

452
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,208
I don't think so.

453
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,458
Dammit.

454
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,208
Hold on! Why am
I the one who's hiding?!

455
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,833
They're the ones
who should be worried!

456
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,375
What's with all the hugging
and close-talking?!

457
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,333
I'm, sorry!

458
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,791
I didn't mean to!

459
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,500
Um...

460
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,541
I'm gonna go back.

461
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,208
Yeah... Cool.

462
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,125
Is that an air gun?!

463
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,500
And it makes
noise and lights up...

464
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,333
Very impressive!

465
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
And now I'm gonna show you what

466
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,416
actually happened
during this scene.

467
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,875
You stupid player~!

468
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,041
Just shut up and sit down!

469
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,541
Okay!

470
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,291
Why were you standing
so close to her earlier?!

471
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,416
Wait...

472
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,291
Yamada...?

473
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,791
Why are you here--

474
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,250
That is what the guiltiest
face in the world looks like!

475
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,083
What are you hiding?!

476
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,333
It's just a surprised face!

477
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,208
I didn't expect you!

478
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,583
Why didn't you want
me to know you went

479
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,291
camping with Miyano
and her family?!

480
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,125
What?

481
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't 'what' me!

482
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,583
Kazuki told me everything!

483
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,333
And don't try to pretend like
it's some fuzzy innocent vacay!

484
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,708
You're not kids!

485
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,916
You're in high school
sleeping together in tents!

486
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,416
Well say something, damn it!

487
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,791
Okay.

488
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,875
I'm sorry, but I still want to
know what you're doing here.

489
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
How did you find it?

490
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,416
Oh... right...

491
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,916
I actually heard
there were a lot of

492
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,458
wild boars out here and I like,

493
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,083
really wanted to
make a stew tonight.

494
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,125
And you were gonna shoot
them with an air gun?

495
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,375
You know, it's okay if
you just came to see me!

496
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,750
What are you trying to say...?!

497
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,375
Do you know how to
cook stew or something?!

498
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,541
No.

499
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,750
Oh then, maybe you
came here to see Miyano?

500
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,500
Yeah! I just wanted
her to cook for me...

501
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,041
I don't even know what stew is.

502
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,041
Oh...

503
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,458
You should come
to the bungalow...

504
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,750
Couple of really nice families
who'd love to see you?

505
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,750
No, forget it.

506
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,583
I gotta roll.

507
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,500
No, don't leave...!

508
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,708
Is there something wrong?!

509
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,208
Can't we talk about it...!

510
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,750
Please?

511
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,416
I saw you standing there earlier
looking at Miyano's breasts.

512
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
I think that
means you're busted.

513
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,416
Bummer.

514
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,666
And you took your camera out so

515
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,500
you could take pictures of
them, didn't you?

516
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,041
What...?
Of course not.

517
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,250
I was taking
pictures of the stars!

518
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,500
Stars?

519
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,875
I see...

520
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,208
Yeah I guess that sounds more
like something he would do.

521
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,583
Not that I don't think
stars are very pretty...

522
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,416
But wouldn't you rather
take pictures of the

523
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,750
celestial being
standing in front of you?

524
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,375
Are you saying you don't
want to take my picture?!

525
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,333
I am a star!

526
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,666
I didn't say anything!

527
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,375
Unfortunately this
camera is already set up

528
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,291
to take pictures of the sky.

529
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,791
So we'll have to
use the digital one...

530
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,041
This'll be my first time,

531
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,083
I've never taken a
picture of you before.

532
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:57,958
Oh...

533
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,375
Well I hope it's good for you.

534
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,833
Wow...

535
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,666
She looks beautiful...!

536
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,875
I can't screw these up!

537
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,083
Maybe I should try it now...

538
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,666
I could say it's just
for the picture.

539
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,791
Kosuda, look!

540
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,833
Oh man, the battery
ran out on this thing.

541
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,500
Come on, let's go back.

542
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,166
It's getting kinda chilly.

543
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,875
'Kay...

544
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,416
You don't want to take pictures
of the stars anymore?

545
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,041
No, I was taking them so
I could show them to you...

546
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,041
...but you're here, so...

547
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,208
That's so sweet.

548
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,958
Look!

549
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,208
♪ closing song ♪

550
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,291
Finally!

551
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,833
The school field trip is here!

552
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,125
The best part is I'll be staying
in the same room as Kosuda!

553
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,250
They can look at temples.

554
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,916
I'm more interested
in the bath house

555
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,041
or the storage close--where
ever we can be alone!

556
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,291
Uhm...
Yamada!

557
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,166
I Lo...

558
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,166
Omigod!
Just spit it out!

559
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,166
What are you saying?!

560
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,041
And what is "Lo"?

561
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,458
He keeps stopping after 'Lo'!

562
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,041
Oh well, guess
we'll find out next time!
