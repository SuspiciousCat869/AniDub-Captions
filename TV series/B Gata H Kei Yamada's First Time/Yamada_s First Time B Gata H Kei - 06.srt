1
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,041
What's up, viewers?

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,666
Spring has sprung, and that
means it's a new school year!

3
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,500
Wow, she's like beyond pretty.

4
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,333
Hey guys...

5
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,250
Check her out.

6
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,500
Is she a model or something?

7
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,458
She's way too hot
to be a freshman.

8
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,666
I wonder if she's a sophomore.

9
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,166
Take it all in, freshmen.

10
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,541
Take it all in...

11
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,416
The girls want to be me
and the guys want to do me.

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,666
A hundred friends with benefits!
This is your year!

13
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,958
So says Lady Still a Virgin.

14
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,958
She gets an A for
effort but an F in ing.

15
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,083
So I've decided to do
an instant smackdown on

16
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,625
Kosuda and move to
the next guy like now.

17
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,250
Oh...! Wait...!

18
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,541
By instant, I didn't
mean prematurely instant.

19
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,583
Like you'd know?!

20
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,041
And who are you
talking to, anyway?!

21
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,041
You're right...

22
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,666
I bet Kosuda
will go super quick.

23
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,083
But...
Who's to say...?

24
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,625
Oh hey, it's Chika.

25
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,375
I didn't know she
was going to our school.

26
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,125
I hope she's not shocked when
she sees how popular I am.

27
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,583
She's gonna be devastated.

28
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,833
Oh my gah, you're so pretty...

29
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,083
Do you wanna go out with me?

30
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,583
Don't go out with him,
go out with me!

31
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,708
Or you could
just be my girlfriend!

32
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,375
See...?

33
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,541
Way devastated.

34
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,541
Yeah, I can see that.

35
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,333
I wonder how
she'll ever survive.

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,583
Kanejo is coming!

37
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,083
I can't stand that sparkle!

38
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,625
Dude, she's in our class?

39
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,833
Awesome.

40
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,250
We're in the same
class with her again.

41
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,916
Hey, Yamada!

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,708
Hey...
So how's it going?

43
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,500
I have no idea what
that meant, as usual.

44
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,958
Where are we sitting...?

45
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,250
Back here?

46
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,416
The very front row?

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,166
I can't see from that
far back anymore

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
for no reason in particular.

49
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,791
Whose camera is that...

50
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,208
Of course!
It's Kosuda's.

51
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,333
She's so stupid.

52
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,750
Why won't she just admit it?

53
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,625
Hey Yamada!

54
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,875
Hey Takeshita!

55
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,625
We're in the same
class this year!

56
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,875
Isn't that great?

57
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,916
That's so cool!

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah...

59
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,208
It's the best
news I've heard all day.

60
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,416
Right...?

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
I can't believe Kosuda
is this class too...

62
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,833
And this year I swear, I~

63
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,791
What?

64
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh! Nothing!
Just being silly!

65
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,125
She was not being silly...

66
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,791
She doesn't do silly.

67
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,125
What if she's planning to
burst Kosuda's cherry?

68
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,458
That's not exactly
how it works, but...

69
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,083
I'm still gonna
go with I doubt it.

70
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,583
We're still in the
same class together!

71
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,041
This year will totes rock!

72
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,458
What's up girls...?
How's it going?

73
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,291
It's going great because
I know this year is my

74
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,708
year to get a tall, dark
and handsome boyfriend!

75
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,458
Right...
totally gonna happen.

76
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,916
Well, they do say sophomore
year is like the best year!

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,583
All the freshmen girls will
be so freakin' scared of us!

78
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,625
No way...

79
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,416
She's sitting
next to me again...!

80
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,458
This year, I'm gonna get closer
to her no matter what!

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,625
Well, we may be in a new class,

82
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,041
but at least my status
as queen remains secure.

83
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,583
Tell me you did
not just seriously

84
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,791
refer to yourself as royalty.

85
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,458
I love her.
Who is she?

86
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,291
I don't know but
she's literally sparkling.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,125
Good morning...
How is everyone doing?

88
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,791
Uh oh, so...

89
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,666
...looks like there's a problem
in court, your queenship.

90
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,541
No...!
Off with her head!

91
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,625
Being in the same
class with you is an honor!

92
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,958
What's your name, anyway?

93
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,625
I'm Kyoka Kanejo...

94
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,833
So nice to meet you!

95
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:58,916
Hi!

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,625
Wait, I remember her now...

97
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,583
She's the one who almost
beat you in that stupid

98
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,250
school beauty pageant
thing last year.

99
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,500
Exactly, we're talking
about a loser, okay?

100
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
That girl is so
not a threat to me.

101
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,875
You've come back here
from America, right?

102
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,916
Yeah. You transferred the day
before the school festival.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
During the pageant, I couldn't
see your face that well.

104
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,458
If I'd known you then, Kanejo,
I would have voted for you.

105
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,083
Same here!

106
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,500
And here!

107
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,166
Why aren't teenagers allowed
to buy shotguns online?!

108
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,208
C'mon!

109
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,333
I bet that's
because it's illegal.

110
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,791
Kosuda...

111
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,291
...why are you looking at
her instead of me?

112
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,208
You can buy an Atlantis Tantric
Buddhism kit for cursing--

113
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,708
Seriously?

114
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,875
Okay everybody.

115
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,583
Time to take your seats.

116
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,291
Welcome to my classroom.

117
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,625
My name is Akai and
I'm your homeroom teacher.

118
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,208
Let's have a
great year, all right?

119
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,625
Okay!

120
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:57,916
Holy jeez...

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,833
School just started.

122
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,583
What's she doing now?

123
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,916
Who does he think he is?

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,041
Why don't you tell
him you don't want

125
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,666
him looking at any
girl other than you?

126
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,250
I'd die before I'd say that...!

127
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,541
And I shouldn't have to; looking
shouldn't even be an option!

128
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,750
Someone doesn't
like sharing her throne.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,458
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

130
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,375
blah.

131
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,500
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

132
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,791
Blah, blah--blah,
blah--blah--blah---blah, blah.

133
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,791
Excellent, Miss Kanejo...

134
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,833
Your lovely pronunciations put
native speakers to shame!

135
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:27,750
Thank you, sir.

136
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,041
She's amazing...

137
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,041
Kanejo is the best!

138
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,333
That was beautiful...

139
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,166
Just what we'd
expect from Kanejo!

140
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,625
No one is as talented
as you, Kanejo!

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,083
She's pretty popular, huh?

142
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
Well, they say Americans
have no morals...

143
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,541
So, you know, she probably
has sex like all the time.

144
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,208
I'm so jealous of her!

145
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,708
I resent your dirty prejudices.

146
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,541
What the hell is that?

147
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,333
Well, I cooked it so it's gonna
taste good, no matter what...

148
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,791
Tastegasm starts now!

149
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,791
OMG, Kanejo...

150
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,833
That looks so good!

151
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,958
Like, wow!

152
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,083
They're totally shining!

153
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,458
Can I try some?

154
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,833
Really?

155
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,000
Kanejo made all this?

156
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,375
Let me try.

157
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,583
Yep...

158
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,875
It is delicious.

159
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,500
If you don't mind,
I'd like to have a bite too?

160
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,583
Wow...
That's delicious!

161
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,041
Yes...!

162
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,583
It's like I wandered into a
mythical forest where even

163
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,625
the deepest of fried foods still
taste refreshingly like the

164
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,750
forest and the sun combined
in heavenly wonder!

165
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,791
Kanejo, please...

166
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,750
Will you share
your recipe with me?

167
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,250
Even Miyano
is falling for that skank!

168
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,750
I thought you were a member
of my faction, you traitor face!

169
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,291
Seriously?

170
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,541
The following day at school!

171
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,125
Good morning, Yamada...

172
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,750
How are you?

173
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
Way to act like you're
in middle school...

174
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,166
Why does she even matter
to you in the first place?

175
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,750
Isn't it obvious...?

176
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,750
I can't let that hooker get off
thinking she's better than me!

177
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,916
Someone's acting
like she's in love.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,125
What...?
In Love...?

179
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,458
No way!

180
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,666
Not with a jerky jerk like
him who thinks he can

181
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,875
just change his mind
whenever he wants to?

182
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,916
Today we vote for
our new class rep.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,333
Who's up for the job, kids?

184
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,833
What about any recommendations?

185
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,833
Why's he keep looking at her?!

186
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,291
I think we should choose Kanejo!

187
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,291
Yeah, good idea!

188
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,583
She'd be perfect for it!

189
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,750
You guys are sweet...!

190
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,291
I would be honored.

191
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,791
Since you're all insisting...

192
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,375
I guess I have
no other choice...

193
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,791
I'd simply love to.

194
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,625
So, basically all
the super pretty girls,

195
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,166
are kind of the
same person, right?

196
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,000
Good...
We have our new class rep.

197
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,791
But only if you
all are really sure.

198
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,208
We are!

199
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,708
What the crap?

200
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,250
I turn away for two seconds
and she's the new class rep?

201
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,458
Why is she standing
like that, too?

202
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
I mean, who stands at an
angle and puts her weight

203
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
ever so slightly on
her right foot while tilting

204
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,541
her stupid head and
making that cheesy face?

205
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,666
Does she think she's
a model or something?!

206
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,708
I can't let her have this!

207
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,458
I gotta get attention
back pronto!

208
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,625
Okay, moving on.

209
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,125
Let's decide who'll
be class secretary.

210
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,458
I'll do it! Me!
I will! I will! Me!

211
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:12,875
Up next!

212
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,708
School disciplinary member.

213
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,416
Damn it!

214
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,333
No one can see my face this way!

215
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,750
Here, Kanejo, let me help you.

216
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,166
No, no, I can do it!

217
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,166
Oh no...

218
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,458
I wouldn't want
to bother anyone.

219
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,041
You're not a bother.

220
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,083
Well played...
Seriously.

221
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:31,625
What?

222
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,708
Are you okay?

223
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,166
I can pick them up for you.

224
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,833
You are all such gentlemen.

225
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,208
No!

226
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,333
What the hell?!

227
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,875
I hate her!

228
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,166
Maybe you should stop
trying to sabotage her.

229
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,791
But Takeshita...!

230
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,458
I want to be popular and
pretty, not just pretty!

231
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,958
Do you seriously expect
me to sympathize?

232
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,750
Anyway why don't you try
a more positive approach?

233
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,125
A positive approach?

234
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,708
Oh yeah...!

235
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,583
I could become a famous actress
or model to win their love back!

236
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,083
You could...

237
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,458
I could be like a pinup girl
or something sexy like that!

238
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458
You've gotta be kidding me.

239
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,791
Stop right there, Kosuda...!

240
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,750
What the hell is in your hand?

241
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,875
Is that who I think it is?!

242
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,958
--Sonofabitch!
--Look, it's Kanejo!

243
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,291
I buy this camera
magazine every month.

244
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,750
I knew I'd seen
her somewhere before,

245
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,500
but I couldn't quite
put my finger on it...

246
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,208
This issue is from last year.

247
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,666
When I saw her, I figured
I'd take it to school with me.

248
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,583
Oh, man...!

249
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,458
It's not fair!

250
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,916
How cool!

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,041
I've never met anyone who's
been in a magazine before!

252
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:30,958
Me either!

253
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:31,958
Love her!

254
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,500
You must be an
actress or a model

255
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,791
or something like that, right?

256
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,708
No, no!

257
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,708
I'm so embarrassed!

258
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,250
My brother took this picture.

259
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,541
So whose magazine is this?

260
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,875
Uhh, it's mine.

261
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,166
Koishikawa!

262
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,916
Don't tell me you're
a photographer!

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,416
I'm in the photography club...

264
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
...so I guess I am.

265
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,125
Why is he acting
like such a weirdo...?!

266
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,500
You can tell her what
your actual name is, idiot!

267
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,791
The magazine holds a
contest every month and the

268
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,833
winner gets to have their
picture featured on the cover.

269
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Winning that cover shot
is a pretty big deal.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,083
Oh...?

271
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,041
You must have
a talented brother.

272
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,625
Well, he has a ton of hobbies...

273
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,041
For whatever reason,
he wins every contest he enters.

274
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,416
Oh, that's different then.

275
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,541
It's not like she's a
famous actress or anything.

276
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,750
It was just a contest.

277
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,208
He could have taken
a picture of a stupid,

278
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,625
really fat tree and still won.

279
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,416
You're thinking out loud again.

280
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,958
Selection of the subject
is evaluated as well.

281
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Yamada!
Behind you!

282
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,208
Look behind you!

283
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,125
So, Kosuda was only
looking at Kanejo

284
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,958
because he remembered her from
some random magazine cover...?

285
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,166
I'm glad that you were wrong,

286
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,416
and he didn't have
a change of heart.

287
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,875
Well, duh--why would he?

288
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,166
Think about it...

289
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,333
My charms are like
freaking hypnotic, okay...?

290
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, I am a potential
friend with benefits, hello!

291
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,541
True!

292
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,541
I think it's finally time to
allow him to have sex with me...

293
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,833
Loyal servitude should
always be rewarded

294
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,375
with a giving spirit,
don't you think?

295
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,833
I think you really piss
me off sometimes.

296
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,583
Friends with
bennies for the win!

297
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,041
Wonderful you're home.

298
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,083
Welcome back, Miss.

299
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,208
Yes, thank you, Ms. Ichihara.

300
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
You must be exhausted, my dear.

301
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,833
Shall I bring you
something to drink.

302
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,875
Tea, perhaps?

303
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:04,875
Yes, please.

304
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,666
Green Earl Grey
sounds delightful.

305
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,833
Whatever I can do, Miss.

306
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,916
I can't believe
what a graceful and

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,458
humble young
lady Kanejo has become.

308
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,666
She is a darling girl and most
certainly defines 'well--bred.'

309
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,708
There's no doubt; I'm
the prettiest girl in school...

310
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,000
If anybody should be
pageant queen, it's me.

311
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
Stupid Yamada...

312
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,041
I was horrified when I lost
that beauty contest to you.

313
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,208
Horrified!

314
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,500
I've never been so
humiliated in my life!

315
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,041
How can I forgive
such disrespect?

316
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,458
I can't, so I'll take
everything away from you!

317
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,916
Your popularity.

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,375
Your friends.

319
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,375
I can't wait to see
you cry your eyes out

320
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,583
after your life
has been shattered!

321
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,833
Miss Kanejo I have your
Green Earl Grey Tea.

322
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,750
Oh, thank you, Ms. Ichihara.

323
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,041
B Gata H Kei!

324
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,458
Hey, that's my line!

325
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,958
Good morning!

326
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,708
Morning!

327
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,750
Hey guys, what's up?

328
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,958
Look, the gorgeous Kanejo girl.

329
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,666
She always looks
so perfect and pretty.

330
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,458
It's weird because I
really want her to like me

331
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,833
but I also kinda want
her to die a little.

332
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,416
Excuse me!

333
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
We... just wanted
to say hi, that's all.

334
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,291
Oh, well hello!

335
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,083
Hi!

336
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,750
Her smile is perfect, too!

337
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,791
She's totally got to have
like a way hot boyfriend!

338
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,541
He must be awesome!

339
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,875
Behind that rosy smile is...

340
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,833
Kanejo's dark secret.

341
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,958
I don't care what it takes,

342
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,166
I am going to be
first in everything...!

343
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,833
That's what being a member of
the Kanejo family is all about!

344
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,666
I have to do something
about that gross Yamada...

345
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,375
She needs to suck it up
and admit I should

346
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,125
have been the winner
of that pageant...

347
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,291
...not her.

348
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,166
More importantly,
I have to destroy her

349
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,208
before he comes back.

350
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,333
I've worked too
hard to just allow a

351
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,041
B--Cup--at--Best
Freak--of--Nature

352
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
ruin everything for me.

353
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666
But what can I do...?

354
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
Of course...

355
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,750
It's so obvious;
I can steal her boyfriend!

356
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,791
That poseur has to have a man,

357
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,083
and I bet he's really
good looking too!

358
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,083
Yeah, no, not really.

359
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,291
By stealing Yamada's
boyfriend and ripping him

360
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,125
from her desperate
and disgusting arms,

361
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,666
she'll learn how much more
powerful I am than her!

362
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,458
I am the real queen, so kneel
in fear you little amateur!

363
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,500
Stalking is just not
my style, so spying is

364
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,458
simply not an option
at this juncture...

365
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,333
Oh no!

366
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,583
I suppose there's nothing wrong

367
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,250
with asking her
directly, is there...?

368
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,541
Plus, watching her crumble in

369
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,458
person is too
delectable to pass up.

370
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,375
Oh, Yamada...

371
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,541
Enjoy your boyfriend while you
can for he's about to be mine!

372
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,458
Miss, dinner is ready.

373
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,708
I do hope you're hungry.

374
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,666
Oh, yes, I am.

375
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,541
Thank you so much!

376
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,583
I wonder if Yamada is
doing anything after school.

377
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,333
I should ask her out...

378
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,750
I can totally ask her out.

379
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,000
We are kind of dating...

380
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,625
You can do this!

381
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,500
Yamada...!

382
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,500
--Yamada!
--Will you go~

383
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,583
What the?
What do you want?!

384
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,750
Excuse me...

385
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,708
I think we should get
better acquainted.

386
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,375
Doesn't that sound like fun?

387
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,041
Uh...
excuse me?

388
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
Why don't you come on over
to my place after school?

389
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,250
We can have tea
and bond and stuff.

390
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,416
Tea?

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,166
Is she planning to
poison me or something?

392
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
I can't die at
that hooker's house!

393
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,791
Not while I have a
really nice collection

394
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,958
of smutty books hiding
under my bed.

395
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,458
Come on, you're not scared
of anything are you?

396
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,333
What?!

397
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,541
No!
I'll totally come over!

398
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,500
Oh that's wonderful!

399
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,125
'Scuse...
me.

400
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,625
Jeez, your house is in BFE.

401
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,250
Are we, like,
ever gonna get there?

402
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,583
Technically we are there;

403
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,000
we've been on the grounds
for a little while now.

404
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,416
Who has a house
that obnoxiously huge?!

405
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,583
Hello, ladies...

406
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,666
Welcome home!

407
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,375
And welcome to
the Kanejo residence.

408
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,958
She is like, way super rich.

409
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,416
Well...
isn't that crude.

410
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,875
And awesome!

411
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,916
She hightailed
it to the corner fast.

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,125
I bet she was intimidated
by my family's obvious

413
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,250
wealth and went to
hide where she felt safe.

414
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,708
It's your own fault; you
entered the enemy's lair.

415
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,333
And get used to hiding
in the background,

416
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,541
'cause that's
where you're staying!

417
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,041
This room is crazy huge!

418
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,208
And it's just for you;
that doesn't make any sense!

419
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,041
No, don't be ridiculous.

420
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,958
This is just the
living room area...

421
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,458
My bedroom and personal
study are separate...

422
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,333
You're so adorable for
thinking that though.

423
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,125
Your panties are made of silk!

424
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:08,958
You got money!

425
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,833
Don't be intimidated.

426
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,625
It's a lot to take in.

427
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,166
Ooh, what's in the there?

428
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,500
Get your hands off my box.

429
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,041
Uhh, why?

430
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:18,958
There you are ladies.

431
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,208
Enjoy your tea.

432
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,208
What are you waiting for?

433
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
Go ahead and drink...

434
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,958
It's not like it's
poisoned or anything.

435
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,166
I wonder what's in
that stupid box of hers...

436
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,875
She did not want me
looking in there at all.

437
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,583
I get it...

438
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791
Oh, she dirty.

439
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,750
What is she thinking about?

440
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,458
By the way, Yamada...

441
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,333
I...

442
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,750
Well, to be perfectly honest,

443
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,250
I would love to
be friends with you,

444
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,666
but for some strange reason you

445
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,625
keep objecting to
every single thing I say.

446
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,458
What?!

447
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,125
What are you talking about?

448
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:52,916
I do not!

449
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,250
You just did it.

450
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,583
It's quite revealing,
you know...

451
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,000
You must be
very worried about me.

452
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,208
And, don't get me wrong,
I completely understand...

453
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,208
Look at you.

454
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,375
You're so pretty
and used to being

455
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,125
the most popular
girl at school...

456
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,833
Well, until I showed up...

457
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,416
But...

458
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,250
Our school only has room for one
pageant queen, isn't that right?

459
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,625
I knew you'd draw
your claws eventually...

460
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,291
By the way they're not as
scary as you think they are.

461
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,250
Nice try, though.

462
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,416
Competition makes me hotter,

463
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,041
so I say we find out who
is the ultimate queen!

464
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,166
Are you in or out?

465
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
I suppose this path
must be our fate.

466
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,541
Now we can find out which
one gets to be on top!

467
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,125
Yeah, we will!
Let's get it on, girlie!

468
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,791
Which one gets to be on top...?

469
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,583
Is she talking about what I
think she's talking about?

470
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,750
I don't think I can
do this, Yamada.

471
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,791
There's nothing at all
to be frightened of...

472
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,416
Now just lie back and relax.

473
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,708
Ew!
I can't do other girls!

474
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,916
Not that there's anything
wrong with that, but no.

475
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,583
Are you okay?

476
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,708
Yep!

477
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,916
So, how are we gonna
solve this thing?

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,208
Another beauty pageant?

479
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,666
No, but I have a question...

480
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,083
Who's your boyfriend?

481
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,666
My whofriend?

482
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,125
I was hoping I'd get to
come here with Yamada.

483
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,083
Naps...!
Hey...!

484
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:07,875
What did I miss?

485
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,708
Anything good?

486
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,500
Boyfriend?

487
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,875
I don't have a boyfriend!

488
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,791
Then what do you call Kosuda?

489
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,041
Um, well what's it to ya?

490
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,166
I might as well
tell you the truth.

491
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,250
In one month...

492
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,791
Mark my words,
I am going to make your

493
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,958
boyfriend leave you
and fall in love with me!

494
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,333
That's how I'm gonna win...

495
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,166
Now be a dear
and tell me about him...

496
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm guessing he
goes to our school.

497
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,208
No way I'm telling her
I don't have boyfriend!

498
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,291
Hey...!

499
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,000
Again, what do
you think Kosuda is?!

500
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,541
You can find that
answer yourself...

501
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,541
It's basic info even a pretty
princess can figure out.

502
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,750
Fine. I don't need
your help anyway.

503
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,416
I can't believe
I just got out of that.

504
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,916
I hope everything is going well.

505
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
Would you like more tea, ladies?

506
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,500
Oh, yes...!

507
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,125
That sounds perfect,
Ms. Ichihara!

508
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Jeez.
Bi--polar much?

509
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,666
Damn it!

510
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,166
I wanna take her down...!

511
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,458
Richie Bitch needs
a reality check, but,

512
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,708
she can't find out that I
don't have a boyfriend, either.

513
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,625
Kosuda!

514
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,583
What about Kosuda?!

515
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,416
Oh no!
I ruined my lens!

516
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,041
Yamada.

517
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,208
Prepare to lose your title.

518
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,625
It shall soon be mine, and then
he will return home to me...!

519
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,916
I wonder...

520
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,500
How much longer will
we be forced to be apart?

521
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,916
Even I have no control
over this painful distance...

522
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,666
Why does Harvard have
to be so far away?

523
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't take this loneliness.

524
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,333
Our separation has
broken my heart...

525
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,541
...and there's only one cure.

526
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,916
Fingerprint verified.

527
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,875
Verifying voiceprint.

528
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,791
I love you.

529
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,791
Palm and
fingerprints validated...

530
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,208
Retina scan verified...

531
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,166
Welcome, Miss Kyoka.

532
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,291
My love...!
My love...!

533
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,791
My love!!!

534
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,000
You love him too much...

535
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,166
Please, Miss,
this isn't healthy behavior.

536
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
Tell me what you
think of my idea...

537
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,541
I'm thinking about
setting up cameras in a

538
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,416
hundred different places
all around his school.

539
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,708
I think that's a crime!

540
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,166
My dear...

541
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,625
You're going to have to give
up on this foolishness...

542
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,166
Your love for him is not right.

543
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,541
No!
Don't say that!

544
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,791
Of all people,

545
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,458
you should understand
how I feel the most...

546
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,750
How dare you...?!

547
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,625
I've loved him ever
since I was a little girl.

548
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,208
Please Miss, I'm only telling
you this because I care.

549
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,500
But you're not making any sense!

550
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,916
I love him!

551
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,791
It's an improper love, Miss!

552
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,250
No.
Please...

553
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,958
That's not true!

554
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,666
What is wrong with being madly
in love with my own brother?!

555
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,541
So, so many things.

556
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,375
blah--blah--blah, Keiichi.

557
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,166
Blah blah...

558
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,166
blah--blah--blah, blah.

559
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,250
Blah, blah, blah...

560
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,208
It's from Kyoka.

561
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,208
Hey, big brother...

562
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,291
It's been so long.

563
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,666
How are you doing?

564
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,166
This is the 101st
message today...

565
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,791
She's gotta be bored!

566
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,291
I know my feelings will
be reciprocated one day...!

567
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,125
I'm never gonna give
up on my big brother!

568
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,500
Never!

569
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,000
If my first time isn't with you,

570
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,000
it won't be with anyone at all!!

571
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:35,666
Dear Lord...

572
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,833
I beg you...

573
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,833
Please, please...
keep that girl a virgin.

574
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,666
Oh, just you wait, Yamada!

575
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,541
I'll be the one to win
my brother's love,

576
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,083
and I if I have to
destroy you and become

577
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,250
the school queen to
make it happen, so be it!

578
