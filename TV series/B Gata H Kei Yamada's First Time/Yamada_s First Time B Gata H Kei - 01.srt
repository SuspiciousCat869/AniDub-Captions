1
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,916
Hey check out that girl.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,708
Wow...!
She's like beyond pretty!

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,958
Is she a model or something?

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,000
I think she's a freshman.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,125
She's gorgeous.

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,750
Who is she?

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,416
Who's this pretty young girl...?

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,666
Introducing the lovely Yamada.

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,458
Yes, that's her last name.
Her first name's a secret.

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,041
This is a girl of
transcendent beauty.

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,958
So it goes without saying
that she's pretty hot naked!

12
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,750
All yucky hair removed; check.

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,666
Skin glowing; check.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,541
Awesome!
Another day of perfection.

15
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,875
Except...

16
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,791
...for the one spot.

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,000
Why do you look like that?!.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,250
It's so weird...!

19
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,083
Does everyone else's
look so strange?!

20
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,458
Fifteen years old and a virgin!

21
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,750
She just started high school.

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,041
Guess what she wants
to do more than anything!

23
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,916
Ever since I was little, I've
had one goal for high school...

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,250
It's practically
a life--long dream!

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,458
I'm gonna have sex
with one hundred guys!

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,583
Hey, sis...

27
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,625
Shouldn't you first-I dunno-find
a boyfriend?

28
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,666
Chika...!

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,333
Have you ever
heard of knocking?!

30
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:25,375
♪ opening song ♪

31
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,333
Boy meets girl...

32
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,375
Let me have your "first time"!

33
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm here, Takeshita...!

34
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,583
Sorry I'm late!

35
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,375
Finally!

36
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,166
What's the deal?

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,458
You were the one who wanted
to go shopping today, not me.

38
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,083
Yeah, I know; I said I'm sorry.

39
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:07,875
So...

40
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,916
...what are you gonna buy?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,958
A dictionary.

42
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,375
Why...?

43
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,416
Can't you just use the
one you had in middle school?

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,041
Uh, no; not any more.

45
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,958
I might've
accidentally highlighted

46
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,333
all the dirty words in red.

47
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,583
You're like a
seven--year--old boy!

48
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,916
Seriously!

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hey there, has anyone
ever told you you're hot?

50
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,916
What are you doing?
Wanna hang out with us?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,333
This stuff always happens
when I'm out with Yamada...

52
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,750
So...?
What do you wanna do?

53
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,000
A virgin...?

54
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,166
Wow, awkward...

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,416
You must not be
as popular as I thought...

56
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,000
Wow...

57
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,583
What's that about?

58
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,958
No...!
But thanks anyway!

59
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,666
Remember how I'm always telling
you that you're too picky...?

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,916
This is what I'm talking about

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,583
and also why you
can't find a boyfriend.

62
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,208
Do I, or do I not have the right
to choose a good looking guy?

63
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,791
It's just, the
good--looking ones are

64
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,666
all so used to having sex...

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,708
Finding a card
carrying virgin cherry boy

66
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,958
who's also a hottie is
practically impossible.

67
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,916
You are messed up!

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,625
I mean, seriously!

69
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,916
Look... that guy's
shopping for a dictionary!

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,916
I bet he highlighted
the dirty words, too!

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,333
I seriously doubt that, Yamada.

72
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
Talk about a plain Jane...

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,291
He's average at best

74
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,375
and isn't masculine,
like, at all...

75
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,541
Gosh, it's hard for me to

76
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,000
find a guy to have
my first time with...

77
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,875
I can't imagine how
rough it must be for him.

78
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,833
Ow...

79
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,041
Oh wait...

80
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,041
That didn't hurt.

81
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,541
Ow, that hurt.

82
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,375
Plane Jane saved me.

83
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,041
No, I think he
was just unfortunate

84
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,958
and in the path of your fall.

85
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,541
Oh.
I'm sorry!

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,791
Weird, what's
he freaking out about?

87
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,333
Wait; I kinda get it.

88
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,208
He's probably never
been this close to pretty.

89
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,833
He doesn't intimidate
me since he obviously

90
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,333
is not used to having sex,
and he's a total gentleman...

91
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,375
In terms of
being my first, he's...

92
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,583
Starting safe?

93
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,166
Just a safe beer, yes.

94
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,625
He's a total safe bet...!

95
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,291
I bet he plays it safe, too...!

96
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,041
This could be my cherry picker!

97
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,458
I'm Yamada sorry
about falling on you.

98
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,458
I've gotta ask him!.

99
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,416
I can't not ask him!!

100
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,166
Um...
I have a question...

101
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,208
Yeah?

102
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,125
I was wondering...

103
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,833
You're still a
cherry boy, am I right?

104
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,333
You could at least
ask his name first!

105
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,666
Jackpot!

106
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,125
Wait!

107
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,750
Apparently, the answer is yes.

108
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,541
You just said you wanted a hot
guy, and now you're into him...?

109
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, I do not get your
taste in men, like, at all.

110
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,500
I wonder who that was...

111
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,375
Well, on the plus side,
you got a good look at his face.

112
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,916
Right, about that...

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,041
I don't remember it.

114
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
Seriously.

115
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,208
All I gotta do is get
through the first time...

116
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,375
After that, I'll be
totally good to go...

117
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:11,041
I just need to find the
right guy to break the seal.

118
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,125
Don't tell me what
you're thinking, kay...?

119
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,458
I already know it's about
that bookstore dude.

120
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,708
You're psychic;
I just wonder where he is...

121
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,791
He could be like my destiny.

122
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,500
Hey, Yamada...!

123
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,666
He's right over there...!

124
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,666
Look...!

125
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,625
He's sitting right
next to you...!

126
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,500
Come on!.
Look!

127
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,208
Yo, Yamada!

128
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,708
Who's Yamada?

129
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,875
Hey so uh...

130
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,500
Would it be okay if
I take your picture?

131
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,291
My picture?

132
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,833
Oh, Yamada!

133
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,750
No...!

134
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,416
No way!

135
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,708
That's the girl I met at
the bookstore yesterday...

136
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,666
She's in my class?

137
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,416
Hey...!

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,625
What are you, deaf?!.

139
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,916
I just said I didn't
want my picture taken...

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,125
Gah!

141
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,000
Yamada...!

142
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,833
He was giving it back to you!

143
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,708
Oh...
That's my phone.

144
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,875
Oops...

145
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,166
I thought you were
being a stalkery perv...

146
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,583
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,458
I remember you...!

148
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,125
From the bookstore yesterday!

149
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,333
Yeah.

150
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,000
You're the cherry boy!

151
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,416
You know what, I do have a name!

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,041
It's Takashi Kosuda, okay?!

153
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,791
Kosuda...
huh...?

154
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,291
Ahh...

155
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,250
Kosuda...

156
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,708
So that's Plain Jane's name...

157
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,750
Who'd have thunk he end
up sitting right next to me.

158
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,250
This is totally fate...

159
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,666
Rejoice, Kosuda...!

160
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,000
You have been chosen to
be the very first of a hundred

161
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,083
lucky men who will get the
chance to have sex with me!

162
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,000
Uh--huh! Uh--huh!
Uh--huh! Uh--huh! Uh--huh!

163
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,708
First, I need to find a way
to get closer to him...

164
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,125
I've got it!

165
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,958
I forgot my math book...

166
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:48,875
Can we share?

167
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,458
Of course!

168
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
I'm so good!

169
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,166
So...

170
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,375
Listen up...

171
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,916
You should let me borrow
your math book, now!

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,791
What is wrong with this girl?

173
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,125
Okay...

174
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,583
What...?!

175
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,458
Oh, no!

176
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
You're not too bright, are you?

177
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,250
This subtle crap
is so not my style!

178
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,291
I have to put myself out there!

179
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,458
First...

180
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,541
I gotta find a way
to be alone with him!

181
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,583
What are you doing?

182
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,916
Maybe in his room...

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,875
...or in his car...

184
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,291
...or on a ferris wheel...?!

185
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,083
But those are all
relationshipie things,

186
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,333
I need a different tactic.

187
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,500
Abduction!

188
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:27,541
Oh...

189
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,125
Yamada it's you...?

190
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,791
Okay, I'm completely
alone with him...

191
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,500
Now what do I do?

192
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh, crap!.
I didn't plan that far ahead...!

193
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,541
Come on, stupid;
think of something!

194
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,041
Uh oh!

195
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,041
How are you supposed
to seduce somebody...?

196
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,958
Just...
take off my clothes?

197
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,458
I've never had
a boyfriend before--

198
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,833
I don't know what to do!!

199
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,791
Just...
take off my clothes!

200
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,666
Take 'em off... Take 'em off...
Take 'em off!

201
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,583
Or maybe, not...

202
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,500
Way to make yourself
look like a total creeper!

203
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,375
What was I thinking?
I'm so freaking stupid!!!

204
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,083
I'm jealous of you, Kosuda...

205
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,000
You get to sit
right next to that girl.

206
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,875
So come on bro
tell us what she's like...

207
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,291
I bet she's stuck up.

208
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,291
No, actually...

209
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,083
She's more...

210
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,333
...um...

211
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's see; here's
my experience with her...

212
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,458
One. She teased me
by calling me a cherry boy...

213
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,833
Two. She accused me
of being a stalker and a perv...

214
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,958
Three.
She stole my math book...

215
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,125
Four.
She flashed her breasts at me.

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,166
If there was no number four,
I'd call her obnoxious...

217
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,333
Maybe I'll just
tell'em she's weird.

218
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,708
Tanimoto will be assigned to the
school disciplinary committee.

219
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,083
Next we need two library
committee members...

220
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,250
Anyone care to volunteer
for this swanky job?

221
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,875
And not a single one of
you has raised your hand...

222
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,166
Color me shocked...

223
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
Fine...

224
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,541
I'll pick the volunteers
myself, then.

225
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,958
Yamada and Kosuda!

226
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
This is perfect!

227
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,916
Stupid books.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,875
Are you okay...?

229
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,291
Here, let me help.

230
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,250
Uh...
Did I hurt you?

231
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,000
No...

232
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm good.

233
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,208
Thank you, Kosuda...

234
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,541
I wonder why I can't
say that out loud...

235
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,083
I mean...

236
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,541
He does have a way of being
there right when I need him...

237
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,750
I didn't really like the
library at first because it

238
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,125
smells like dirty socks
worn by a wet dog...

239
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,083
But, it does have
great hiding spots!

240
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,458
No, wait...
We can't do it in here!

241
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,125
You know you want to, Yamada...

242
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Kosuda...

243
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,666
Can I ask you a favor?

244
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,875
Oh yeah, sure...

245
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,000
What do you need?

246
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,000
It's just...

247
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,833
...my tummy hurts...

248
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,291
Will you please rub it?

249
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,708
Um...

250
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,125
Have you tried taking anything?

251
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,791
Yeah, I did earlier...

252
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,291
...but it's not working.

253
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,625
It hurts bad...

254
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,708
...will you please touch it?

255
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:11,916
Oh...

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,666
...why did you stop?

257
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,958
My chest feels kinda tight...

258
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,916
No, I can't run
away again today!

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,625
I gotta focus!

260
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,958
That feels so good...

261
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,041
Will you rub higher?

262
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:25,958
Higher?

263
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,083
Higher!!!

264
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,625
Higher!

265
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,458
No, that's way too high.

266
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,166
This is an invitation, right...?

267
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,666
But what if she's
really hurting...?

268
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,375
If so, and I do it, will that
make me a bad person?

269
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,375
Come on; quit teasing me...!

270
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,375
That's right...

271
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,125
You're almost there...

272
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,166
Will you grab them already?!

273
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,041
I'll be right back
with the nurse!

274
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,291
Damn it...

275
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,750
We were so close.

276
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,750
You'll never get
laid at this rate!

277
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,208
I'm Yamada's Eros Deity, so
I get to say things like that.

278
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,250
I am a god of sexual desire...

279
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,958
Basically, my job is
to make sure Yamada

280
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
gets her dirty dirty
freak freak on...

281
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,416
I hope we get your support.

282
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,416
So great to meet you.

283
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,750
The transcendent beauty
Yamada's path to nailing one

284
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,791
hundred high school boys is
not going to be an easy one!

285
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,416
B Gata H Kei!

286
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,875
If you haven't taken your
bra off yet, now's the time!

287
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,791
Hello all...!

288
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,125
Today is physical checkups!

289
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,166
Everyone's favorite!

290
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay...
Next is Yamada!

291
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,166
Height... One hundred
sixty--four centimeters.

292
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
Weight...
Forty--three kilograms.

293
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,125
Sitting--Height...
Eighty--seven centimeters.

294
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,625
Holy crap...
She's perfect!

295
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,291
Your legs are so long.

296
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,250
Are they?

297
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,333
Next up!
Takeshita!

298
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,083
You've got the biggest
boobs on Earth...

299
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,625
Those are like an F--cup, right?

300
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,041
Will you stop looking
at me like that?

301
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,750
You're freaking me out!

302
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,416
Turns out I haven't
changed at all since last year.

303
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,833
I don't get what Yamada
is thinking at all...

304
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,625
I mean...

305
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,125
it kind of seems
like she's in to me.

306
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,833
Okay, maybe not...

307
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,958
She doesn't even
want to look my way!

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,791
I hope you checked out
my measurements, stud!

309
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,000
You can't resist perfection!

310
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,166
Big gambit after school!

311
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,250
Why don't we start with a kiss?

312
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,708
Oh man...

313
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,583
Midterms are coming up.

314
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,041
Will someone just kill me now?

315
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,125
Quit stressing out.

316
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,791
We'll just study
together like normal.

317
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,500
So, are you gonna ask Kosuda to
be you study buddy this year?

318
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,708
Why would I do that?.

319
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,083
I already know like everything.

320
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,125
That's not true.

321
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,416
You're not so
good at the math...

322
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,583
Besides, it could seriously

323
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,750
bring the two of you
closer together.

324
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,375
Good idea...

325
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,625
But where?.

326
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,666
I mean... it's not like
we're close enough to

327
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,333
visit each other's houses yet.

328
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,875
What's wrong with
using the classroom?

329
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,708
Are you kidding me?

330
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh, Kosuda!

331
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,333
Yamada!

332
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,166
I could never do that!
It's too public.

333
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,291
Anyone could just walk
in on us at any time!

334
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,791
I was talking about homework...

335
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,916
Not doing him on a desk.

336
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,791
Later that day...

337
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,541
Kosuda...!

338
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,583
I've decided you
should teach me math!

339
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,583
Really?.

340
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,541
Yelling is what
you went for here?

341
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,208
So then is that what
I'm supposed to do with

342
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,916
number four on
page thirty-seven?

343
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,125
No...

344
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,375
This is the formula
you would need to use

345
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,416
to figure out the perimeter.

346
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,166
Right.
The other one's area.

347
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,250
I'm impressed!

348
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,208
He's like really smart!

349
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,583
Oh good...

350
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,125
I think I might
actually be helping her.

351
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,625
So then...

352
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,416
Hold on.

353
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,083
What about~

354
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,208
Sorry...!

355
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,333
I'm so sorry!

356
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,666
I can't believe it!

357
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,291
We totally just almost like
on the mouth kissed!

358
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,833
Wait...
I feel an idea coming on...

359
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,041
I've been completely focused
on sex this whole time,

360
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,625
but couples normally
mug out first, right?

361
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,125
I can't shoot for home when we

362
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,500
haven't even been
to first base yet!

363
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,708
I can start off by kissing him!

364
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,583
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step,

365
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,666
and banging a hundred dudes
starts with the first kiss!

366
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,708
Where did you
have your first kiss?

367
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,833
The number one answer
is in his room or my room...

368
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,416
Oh yeah!

369
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,583
Yamada...

370
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,416
Kosuda...

371
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,333
Congratulations on
bringing a boy home

372
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,958
for the first time like ever.

373
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,416
My place is no good...

374
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,333
It'll definitely have
to be at Kosuda's...

375
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,875
So how do I get there?.

376
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,083
Huh...

377
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes...!

378
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,416
That's it!

379
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,666
A few days later!

380
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,916
Okay, now that I know
which umbrella is his...

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,458
I.

382
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,041
Am.

383
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,750
Silent.

384
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,375
Like.

385
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,458
Ninja.

386
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,666
Yoink.

387
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,083
I'll hide it!

388
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,791
Umbrella thief!

389
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,041
Later, after school
had ended for the day...

390
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:14,833
Hey wait...

391
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
Where did my umbrella go?

392
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm awesome!

393
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,833
You idiot!

394
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
Did you forget your umbrella?

395
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,166
I guess I have
no other choice then...

396
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,875
I'll share my umbrella with you.

397
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,291
Let's go!

398
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:30,875
Um...

399
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,083
I can hold it if you want.

400
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,625
Oh, okay.

401
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,625
So I wanted to say thanks.

402
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,291
I got a good score
on my Math midterm,

403
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,916
and I couldn't
have done it without you.

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,458
Yeah, ok, cool,
wow, you're welcome.

405
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,625
Man...

406
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,416
She is so frickin' cute.

407
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,583
What the hell?

408
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,791
That's my head, genius!

409
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,166
Wait a minute...

410
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,541
I hope his house
is kinda far away...

411
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,250
Sorry for making you walk
me home in the rain like this.

412
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,500
Oh, no problem!

413
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,791
Sorry for stealing
your umbrella.

414
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,541
After he invites me inside, I
just need to get into his room!

415
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,500
Kosuda...

416
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,958
Yamada...

417
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,875
Kiss!

418
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,250
What's the deal?
Invite me in already!

419
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,833
I wonder if I should
invite her in already.

420
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,250
Takashi...

421
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,791
I didn't know you were home yet.

422
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,375
Hey sis, I guess you're skipping
your college classes again?

423
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,541
His sister?!

424
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,958
She's way pretty.

425
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,750
So this means he's used to
being around pretty women?

426
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,875
You brought a girl home...?..

427
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,208
I'm so proud of my
precious baby brother!

428
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,541
Get off me you whacko!

429
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,708
He's used to girls bodies!

430
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,125
My name's Kazuki...

431
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,791
I'm a sophomore in college.

432
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,625
Oh, man...

433
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,666
Talk about surprised...

434
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,000
I was not expecting Takashi to

435
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,500
bring a girl home
with him today...

436
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,416
You're cute; why're
you hanging out with him?

437
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,333
Come on.

438
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,166
Cut it out!

439
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,958
Ahem...

440
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,791
I, uh...

441
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,041
Kosuda, where's your room?.

442
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,000
I'd like to see it.

443
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,000
Let me straighten it up first!

444
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,958
I'll be right back!

445
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,916
Don't forget to put away
all your dirty magazines!

446
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,416
I'm sorry...

447
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,583
I just like to give
him a hard time.

448
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,541
It's okay.

449
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,833
I think it's natural though...

450
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,000
Having dirty magazines...

451
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,416
I mean.

452
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,666
Yamada...

453
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,333
You are hopeless...

454
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,541
I'm glad you're here...

455
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,291
My brother has always
been pretty shy

456
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,041
and even though I
tried to protect him...

457
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,916
...he was picked
on all the time...

458
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,416
But...

459
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,583
Apparently he's managed to
come out of all of that okay.

460
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,458
I mean...

461
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,375
Takashi's a genuinely good guy

462
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,333
and he deserves to
be with a great girl...

463
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,375
You know...
someone cool who's into him.

464
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,083
Sorry, sister my
motives aren't that pure.

465
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,125
You're right; he has never been

466
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,708
anything but a
gentleman to me...

467
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,083
I do know that much about him.

468
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,375
Well, yay!

469
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,041
Hey, Mom...

470
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,291
Can we just have
dinner near the station?

471
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,500
Takashi's not hungry right now.

472
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,166
We won't be back home
for about two hours...

473
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,375
...okay?

474
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,875
You crazy kids have fun!

475
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,958
Thanks for waiting...!

476
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,833
Kazuki?

477
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:31,875
Where did she go?

478
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,416
We're gonna be
alone for two hours!

479
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,208
Awesome!

480
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,541
Those sex hotels rent
by the hour, don't they?

481
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,708
That means we should
have more than enough time.

482
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,833
I was just planning
on a kiss, but now...

483
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,208
Make my little brother
a man, won't you?

484
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,458
Who would've figured his
sister would approve of this.

485
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,500
I never said that!

486
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,125
Uh, I'm thirsty,
how about you...?

487
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,916
I'll be back in a second
with something to drink.

488
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:12,708
That'll get him...

489
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,500
No guy can refuse this position.

490
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Barley tea or iced coffee...?

491
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,291
That's all I've got,
so which one?

492
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,875
Oh, man...

493
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,041
This is so stressful; what am
I supposed to do next...?

494
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:23,916
Wait...!

495
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,958
I'll call Takeshita and ask her!

496
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
Takeshita!
Hey!

497
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,000
What do you want?

498
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm at the cash
register right now.

499
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,583
Oh? Really?
Where at?

500
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,500
The drugstore.

501
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,250
Drugstore?

502
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,083
What did you buy?

503
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:38,916
Nothing yet.

504
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
I gotta go!

505
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,291
What's her deal?.

506
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,291
She acts like she was buying
something embarrassing...

507
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,250
Ha ha...

508
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,375
How scandalous...!

509
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,375
Was it this or
that or this or that

510
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,625
or this or that or
this or that or

511
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,416
this or that or this
or that or this or...?

512
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,541
Skin cream for heat rash.

513
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,166
Oh no...

514
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
Speaking of the drug store...

515
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,208
I'm so stupid!

516
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,458
How could I forget those?!

517
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,166
Do not enter!

518
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,750
Mommy!

519
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,291
Okay, I'm back.

520
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,666
You okay...?

521
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,750
Yamada?

522
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,666
Yamada!

523
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,041
Get yourself together!

524
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,375
I'll just go back to Plan A...

525
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,750
Get a kiss!

526
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,416
Now, focus and lighten the mood.

527
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,750
Can I see your photo album?
Pretty please?

528
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,833
Here you go.

529
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,916
Perfect.

530
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,208
I'll be able to
compliment him this way

531
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,791
and make him
feel more confident.

532
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,083
Oh how sweet; you were
the cutest baby like ever!

533
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,791
How fun...

534
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,500
You're kind of like...
one of those babushka dolls!

535
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,250
I wonder if that's supposed
to be a compliment...

536
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,750
Okay, this isn't working out...

537
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,291
Desperate times call
for desperate measures!

538
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,375
Yamada...

539
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm going for it!

540
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,208
Here we go...!

541
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,041
I'm ready!

542
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,916
What is that thing?!

543
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,708
I'm leaving!

544
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,666
No!

545
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,708
Kill me...

546
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,666
Kill me... Kill me...

547
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,333
Kill me...

548
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,541
That was awful!

549
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,500
I was too shocked
to do anything but run!

550
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,375
See...?

551
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,375
This path is a hard one.

552
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:02,416
♪ closing song ♪

553
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,916
Yamada here!

554
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,208
So, I saw something crazy today,
but I'm fully recovered now!

555
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,625
The next episode takes
place in the height of summer!

556
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,333
I'm gonna captivate Kosuda
by wearing a teenie bikini!

557
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,625
Um...
Yamada?

558
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,333
An F--Cup girl with
glasses will show up, too,

559
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,625
but she's no threat to me.

560
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,291
In the next episode,
I'll push on towards

561
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,375
my goal of doing
one hundred guys!

562
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,291
See you next time!
