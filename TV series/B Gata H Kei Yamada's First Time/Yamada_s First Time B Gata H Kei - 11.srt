1
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,208
Looks like the
Christmas party is going

2
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,875
to be quite
a success this year...

3
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,083
What do you think brother?

4
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,500
Sure.
Oh by the way...?

5
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,708
Yeah?

6
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,083
Make sure you don't
forget to invite Yamada.

7
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,416
That reminds me...

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,541
Ichihara said you had
Kosuda over the other day,

9
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,166
you should invite him, too...

10
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,208
This could be your chance!

11
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,916
But if not...
at least you have a new friend?!

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,708
Yeah...
that's a great idea.

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,958
How does he not know...?

14
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,000
I would think it's
painfully obvious by now.

15
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,375
Poor thing.

16
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,791
Oh, I'll invite both of those
disgusting love maggots.

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,458
Then Keiichi can watch them
paw at each other all night.

18
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,291
Hopefully that'll be enough
to make him realize

19
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,833
he has absolutely no
chance with that twat!

20
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,625
Year 2 Class H's Christmas Eve.

21
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,541
Take me to bed.

22
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,583
What's up guys?!

23
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,125
No way?!

24
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:39,916
Seriously?

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,958
Omigod thank you so much!

26
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,625
Here ya go.

27
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,916
Great!

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,708
Score!

29
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,333
I get to go!

30
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,375
Hey what's that?

31
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,875
It's called an
invitation and it's to

32
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,458
Kanejo's uber
fabulous Christmas party!

33
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,458
Oh great...

34
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,750
Joy to the world.

35
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,541
Can you imagine all
the hot, single rich guys

36
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,375
that are gonna be
there--including her brother?

37
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,916
Awesome.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,958
And their house has so many
private rooms we can sneak into!

39
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,041
Wait...!
What do you mean?!

40
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
Rich hotties I can climb, duh...

41
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,250
I'm not sharing with anyone!

42
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,416
Okay...
how does it work exactly?

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Yamada!

44
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,458
I just can't...
Just relax and trust me.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,750
Sold...!

46
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,708
Tell me everything!

47
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,916
Like how does it work?!

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,416
Look for the butler
and give him the sign!

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Got it...!

50
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,041
Wow, you know a
lot about this stuff!

51
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,708
I knew reading all
those trashy sex

52
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,625
mags would come
in handy one day!

53
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,791
Here's the deal...

54
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,166
...the party will
be on Christmas eve...

55
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,666
Make sure you tell
everyone you know!

56
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,916
We want it to be fabulous!

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
'Kay!

58
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,750
What if no one tells
Yamada because they know

59
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,500
she and I aren't
exactly bed buddies?

60
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,916
How do I make sure she comes...?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,708
I could always
take her there by force.

62
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,166
Or maybe kidnap Kosuda
and hold him for ransom.

63
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,791
Invite me to your stupid party!

64
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,916
Okay!

65
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,958
Did she just come over here and

66
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,708
demand that I invite
her to my party...?

67
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,541
What a freak.

68
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,458
Kosuda, darling...

69
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,208
You are coming, right?

70
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,125
Coming where?!
What?

71
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,750
It's going to be so much fun...

72
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,375
and if you don't
go I'll kill you.

73
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,125
Kill...?

74
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,250
As in 'death'?
Um...

75
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,125
Just say yes!

76
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,083
No frickin' way!

77
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,708
She wants to go?!

78
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,500
This means my first
time getting laid will be

79
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,208
on Christmas Eve
in a rich skank's house!

80
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,291
Oh holy night!

81
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,583
Oh hell yeah!

82
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,875
Miss Kanejo...

83
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,708
Someone told me
you'll be serving alcohol ?

84
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,916
Of course.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,416
But it's for my parents
and their friends...

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,333
I certainly don't support under
age drinking in my house.

87
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,083
Will there be students
from other schools?

88
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,916
Yes, and lots of them
are bringing their wealthy

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,291
parents who are presidents of
their own companies and stuff.

90
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
I guess I'll have to
be a chaperone then.

91
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,416
I mean, I do have
a responsibility here.

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,625
Right.

93
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,875
Wow... Your sacrifice
is truly inspiring.

94
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,416
She hates her.

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,208
Why would she want to
be anywhere with Kanejo?

96
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,666
I guess because
she likes her brother

97
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,083
and doesn't want to admit it.

98
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,041
Oh, I like totally forgot
she even had a brother...!

99
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,750
I just really wanted to be
around friends for the holidays!

100
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,625
OMG I don't think
he's cute at all!

101
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,125
I didn't even notice his
six-pack abs and porn star hair!

102
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,291
I knew you were depressed but
I didn't know you were a schizo.

103
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,416
What?! No!

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,625
I was just trying
to cheer myself up!

105
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,583
Sometimes doing girl
voices makes me laugh!

106
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,041
Now it's Christmas.

107
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,250
Time sure flies.

108
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:04,958
That means...

109
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,625
...holiday...

110
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
...banging!

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,791
Hello ...!

112
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,291
Merry Christmas!

113
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,583
Welcome to the annual fabulous
Kanejo Christmas party...!

114
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,916
So she lives there?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,041
It's just like a castle!

116
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,916
I think it is a castle!

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,125
That is wicked sweet.

118
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,458
You've gotta be kidding...

119
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
That electric bill must be
a beating every year.

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,458
Oh no question.

121
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,041
I bet they could
pay my entire salary

122
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,916
with what it costs to
light those things.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,583
Why are there like eight
different buildings here?

124
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,791
There's just one annex...
And that's our doghouse.

125
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,000
My dog needs a
house we're moving in!

126
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,458
You're so lying.

127
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,708
That's what
rich people look like...

128
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,250
They're beautiful...

129
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,916
...look how they hold their
glasses with only four fingers!

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,333
How are we supposed
to talk to them?

131
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,416
They'll probably beat us
up for not having cufflinks.

132
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,166
Hi there...!

133
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,500
I'm Kobayashi!

134
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,833
She's talking to them!

135
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,416
She's armed and ready!

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,708
She's the man!

137
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,833
I love Tokyo in June.

138
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,000
How 'bout you?

139
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,000
That's great.

140
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,041
If you'll excuse me...

141
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,458
My math teacher just walked in.

142
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,333
I don't want to be rude.

143
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,958
You understand?

144
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,750
Shoot me.

145
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,125
Kobayashi needs
a hug like bad...

146
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,041
I guess rich people
don't want to talk to us.

147
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,541
Nope that's not it Look!

148
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,958
They're totally talking
to Yamada!

149
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,916
Guess why.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,083
You look lovely tonight...

151
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,916
Can I get you a glass of wine?

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So you can get me drunk and
drag me off to some closet?

153
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,166
Please.

154
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,875
I don't have time for this.

155
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,083
I gotta go Get My Freak On!

156
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,666
Having a good time...?

157
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
It's really a shame that someone
like you is here alone tonight.

158
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,458
Oh no...
It's totally cool.

159
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,500
What!

160
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,416
Why does she get
to talk to them...?!

161
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,541
--Hey~!
--It's her rack.

162
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,500
She has a boyfriend,
stupid head!

163
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,791
--Bad idea.
--Talk to me!

164
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,916
I'm single and gorgeous,

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
not to mention a
freak in the sheets...

166
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,833
...well, I would be
if given a chance!

167
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:49,708
Miyano...

168
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,458
Whatcha staring at?

169
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,875
I can't get over how hot
Kosuda looks tonight...

170
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,250
...wow.

171
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,958
There are like, five hundred
hot, rich guys floating

172
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,166
around here and she's still
lusting after Boris McBoring?

173
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,125
Hey, what's that look for?

174
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,541
Man... she looks
so beautiful tonight.

175
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,708
I'm so getting
laid on Christmas!

176
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,083
A butler!
Hell yeah...!

177
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,916
Just give him the secret
wink then it's time to bone!

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,041
Is she hitting on
that guy in front of me?

179
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,333
I think it's about time
to make things a little

180
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,250
more romantic in
here for those two.

181
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Keiichi should be coming
out any second now.

182
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,250
What's going on?

183
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,958
Is there a storm or something?

184
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Is that Santa?

185
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,833
Dude!
No way!

186
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,416
Merry~!
Christmas~...!

187
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,291
And welcome...!

188
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,166
Good to see you!

189
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,833
That's totally Keiichi!

190
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,625
My darling, wonderful slice
of man meat I've missed you!

191
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
That was an amazing entrance.

192
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,458
There she is.

193
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,875
Please no.

194
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,625
Beautiful Yamada,
I must say no holida--

195
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,583
Darling...!

196
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,916
I've missed your sexy eyebrows!

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,083
Get him, Misato!

198
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,791
I forgot to put on
a bra this evening.

199
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,000
Because you don't need one?

200
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:10,958
Yamada, wait!

201
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:11,833
Kanejo!

202
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,208
Take us to the secret room...!

203
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,666
Yeah I know everything!

204
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,916
The room?

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,791
No way...

206
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,166
She has to be lying...

207
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,375
No one knows about my

208
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,833
secret vaulted sexy
brother tribute room!

209
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,125
Found you!

210
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,125
What's this room?

211
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,000
There is no room.

212
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,000
He doesn't know about the

213
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,833
private sex room
at his own party?

214
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,875
You should check it out.

215
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,125
It'll blow at least your mind!

216
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,583
Me specifically?

217
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Why?

218
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,125
Don't listen to her!
She's drunk!

219
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,458
Shouldn't you be
doing it right now?

220
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,083
Right...

221
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:38,958
Let's go!

222
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,250
Okay.

223
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,833
Where are you going?!

224
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,875
Why did I send them away?!

225
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,250
Now Keiichi won't get to
see how disgustingly in love

226
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,375
with each other they are...

227
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,666
This was so not the plan.

228
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,000
This looks like a library.

229
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,041
Yeah it does...

230
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,083
Are you looking for something?

231
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,166
Uh...
Somewhere we could be alone.

232
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,291
I like that idea.

233
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,750
I was looking
for the same thing.

234
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,916
I've wanted to do
this for a long time.

235
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,166
Wait!

236
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,458
No don't!

237
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,541
I'm sorry...!

238
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't want to do it
in there it looks like school!

239
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,041
There's gotta be a better room

240
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,666
to do it somewhere
in this house.

241
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,083
I just believe that
children are our future...

242
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,791
Teach them well and
let them lead the way;

243
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,500
show them the
beauty they possess.

244
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,666
Not only gorgeous but
a sense of family too.

245
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,875
Huh...?

246
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,125
The only family she
has is a cat and a DVR.

247
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,500
What do you think of
those two over there?

248
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,583
Too uptight.
They'll never put out.

249
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,041
I like the short squatty one.

250
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,125
I can't tell if this
is hilarious or sad.

251
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,416
Don't you just love opera?

252
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,125
I do.

253
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,375
Uh...
yeah.

254
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,208
Oh man, he's gonna
try to talk art...?

255
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,541
She's so going down...

256
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,708
What's this?

257
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,666
Someone like you
is usually never alone...

258
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,875
...but I can see
pain in your eyes.

259
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Wow he's good.

260
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,333
Well played, Therapist Boy.

261
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't find Yamada...

262
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,458
She probably went
home with someone.

263
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,291
Yamada's a sneaky little
troll but there's no way

264
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,875
she'd be able to find out
about the tribute room.

265
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,750
All right.

266
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,625
Where'd they go?

267
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,333
I need every camera activated.

268
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,208
I'm sure having a
portrait of me in every

269
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,291
room just looks like
I'm the favorite child...

270
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,625
...and that's true...

271
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,125
...but they'll never suspect
that my eyes are on

272
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,041
them no matter
where they run off to...

273
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,250
...especially in my
Keiichi Tribute room.

274
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,875
I don't even want to think
about what goes on in there.

275
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,083
Where are they?

276
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,833
Uh, I'm lost I need help!

277
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,166
Whoa?!

278
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,666
Holy moly!

279
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,083
I thought beds with curtains
were only in picture books!

280
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,500
Curtains...

281
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,041
I bet those are so you can
shut out the other couples

282
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,375
that come in while
you're getting it on...

283
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,750
...that means we found it!

284
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,875
This is the special
sexy time room!

285
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
Um...

286
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,291
I'm thinking this might
be somebody's bedroom.

287
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,541
No it's not...

288
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,416
I mean look how
frickin huge this thing is...!

289
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,541
It's a party room!

290
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,375
You think so?

291
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,291
Of course not.

292
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,458
But who cares!

293
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,625
I'm all about some
sweet sweet sexy time!

294
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,833
You're not gonna
need that entire box.

295
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Alright...!

296
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,458
It's time for
some "Christmas Sex"!

297
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,041
Hi...
What's going on?

298
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:20,833
Everything...

299
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,166
Now close your eyes.

300
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,375
Everything?!

301
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,375
Like everything--everything?!

302
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,708
Meaning every thing...?!

303
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,250
Holy crap!

304
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,083
Ohmigod ohmigod he's on the
bed and I'm on him on the bed!

305
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,583
Don't freak out!
Don't freak out!

306
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,000
Calm the eff down
and just get naked!

307
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,250
Okay maybe not.

308
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,500
I read somewhere
that it's better

309
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,958
to take our clothes off slowly.

310
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,458
I can't move!

311
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,750
He's not moving...

312
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,375
I can do anything
I want to him right now!

313
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,208
I still can't find them ...

314
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,833
They must be wandering
around outside or something...

315
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,500
The only other place
I haven't checked is my

316
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,791
room but that
would be impossible.

317
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,958
What the hell are they doing on
my bed and why--that's gross?!!

318
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,208
Clothes off.

319
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,916
That's the first step...
But where do I start?

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,875
What makes the most sense?!

321
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,250
Wait...!
Yamada!

322
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,000
Aw yeah...!

323
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,250
We have lift off!

324
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,500
Right after this short break.

325
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,166
That's my line!

326
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,250
B GATA H KEI!

327
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,833
The day has arrived people...!

328
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,458
She's finally gonna
feed the trouser snake...!

329
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,583
The finish line is within reach!

330
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,375
Go Yamada!

331
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,000
Kanejo is watching?!

332
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,583
A live broadcast
that pushes the limits!

333
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,125
I can't believe they're
actually touching my bed

334
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,416
with their filthy parts
and skin cells!

335
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,416
This is not okay!

336
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,958
I've got to get
them out of there!

337
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,750
My zipper is down.

338
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,458
Yamada undid my zipper.

339
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,208
That means it's out.

340
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,916
He's out...!

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,208
If she's already gone this far,
I can't leave her hanging.

342
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,000
We're gonna do this.

343
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,083
I've never seen
that look on his face.

344
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,041
Kinda scary...
but sexy too.

345
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,041
Ohmigod it's happening.

346
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,041
Okay just calm down,
we can do this.

347
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,458
We're just kissing.

348
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,000
I've kissed with tongue
before so I'm totes pro at this.

349
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,416
It feels different though.

350
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
Holy crap I'm nervous.

351
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,291
Why am I freaking out?!

352
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,541
This isn't too weird is it...?

353
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,916
What the crap am I doing?

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,291
I don't want to
watch her get laid in

355
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,916
my room by the
most boring guy ever.

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,291
And yet you're
still sitting there.

357
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,000
Whatever you're doing
with your tongue is weird...

358
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,541
You should nibble
my lip a little bit...

359
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,250
...and grab my hair
like in the movies.

360
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,166
Don't you research
this stuff online?

361
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,833
I'm sure there's
an app for that.

362
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,083
No I didn't!

363
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,500
I totally just moaned!

364
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,541
I'm so embarrassed and
so frikkin turned on!

365
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,541
Gotcha!

366
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,833
Zoom damn it!

367
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,875
Zoom in!

368
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,166
Whoa I think that
painting just moved.

369
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,125
And what's with the eyes?

370
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,541
Something's weird.

371
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,416
Mother grabber!

372
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,750
It's okay...

373
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,958
I can at least show
that first part to Keiichi.

374
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,833
He'll get the point!

375
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,916
Crap, I can't do that.

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,166
If I do I'll have to tell him

377
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,708
I've installed
cameras everywhere.

378
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,250
I can't handle this.

379
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,125
This makes my hair hurt!

380
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,583
I'm totally calm now...

381
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,875
They're making this very
difficult and leave me no choice

382
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
but to bring Keiichi
to my room and

383
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,958
show him exactly
what's going on there...

384
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,666
I'm so glad.

385
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,166
I can't find a zipper.

386
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,583
How do I get her clothes off.

387
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,625
This awkward what do I do?

388
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,083
Where are you...?

389
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,958
You're missing everything.

390
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,791
I'm running out of time.

391
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,166
I need to make sure we
get there before it's done.

392
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,500
Knowing them it's not
going to last very long.

393
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,208
I guess if I don't find him
soon I'll have to go by myself!

394
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,083
Somehow I don't think
that will bother you much.

395
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,125
I know.

396
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
But I'm afraid
to watch by myself.

397
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,041
I don't know how I'll react.

398
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,000
I'd much rather have
my brother there with me.

399
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,625
Why are Yamada and
Kosuda randomly MIA?

400
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,458
I can't find them anywhere.

401
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,208
Now that I think about it,
Miyano hasn't

402
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,916
come back from
the bathroom either.

403
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,875
There's no cameras!

404
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,208
I mean, hey Takeshita.

405
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,458
Kanejo, what's up?

406
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,083
Do you think you could
come with me for a sec?

407
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:13,916
Huh?

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,666
I think so.

409
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,125
Wait, why?

410
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,083
Where are we going and why
does your face look all red?

411
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,083
Ohmigod, just come with me.

412
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,416
Tell me where we're going first!

413
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,583
At least this way,
they can't accuse me of lying.

414
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,250
Hi hi hi hi hi sexy boy!

415
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,125
I think we should get married!

416
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,416
What do you think?!

417
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,666
Sure.

418
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,958
Don't you think I should
meet your parents soon?

419
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,166
Sure.

420
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,750
Let's register and get
a license this week!

421
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,666
Sure.

422
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,541
Yay~!

423
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,791
I'm marrying a sexy sexy sexy

424
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,208
hot hot hot rich
rich rich rich rich rich

425
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,916
I just wish I knew whether
or not she was still here.

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,083
If she left who unwraps that
gorgeous Christmas gift?

427
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,875
She didn't leave and
she's giving her gift to

428
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,833
some other dude
on your sister's bed.

429
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,125
Holy crap it's off...!

430
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,875
Now for the bra.

431
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,125
Oh great...
how does this work...

432
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:55,875
...maybe like...

433
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,666
...no...

434
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,250
...there we go!

435
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,250
Turn around.

436
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,541
I want him to see my perfect

437
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,125
flawless bod and
be utterly turned on.

438
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,375
I believe in you!

439
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
Her breasts are right there.

440
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,541
And they're real!

441
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,041
They're real!

442
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:12,458
Totes real!

443
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,083
You got 'em!

444
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,458
I got 'em!

445
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,541
Hurry...!
Hurry...!

446
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,416
I'm still wearing
heels over here!

447
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,666
We've gotta hurry or we
won't be able to see it live!

448
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,708
See what?

449
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,416
Boobs!

450
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,583
I'm touching boobs!

451
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,458
Real ones!

452
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,666
Not just my own shoulders when I

453
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,041
pretend I'm grabbing
real ones...!

454
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,666
They feel a little different
from when I first

455
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,333
grabbed them through
her clothes at the park...

456
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,666
...and what are those
things poking my palms?

457
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,791
I changed my mind!

458
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,666
I'm just not ready.

459
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,625
Almost there...
come on...

460
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,041
Who are you talking to?

461
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,125
Should I call
someone about this?

462
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
They're not as big
as I thought they'd be...

463
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,000
...but they're so soft...

464
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,708
...like my baby blanket...!

465
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,916
I can't take it!

466
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,375
Lose the crying.

467
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,625
He's touching me!

468
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,916
Why can't I control that?

469
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He must think I'm crazy
or in pain or something.

470
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,375
I have to hold back.

471
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,541
But I can't for some reason...

472
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,333
I just...
I just can't.

473
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,958
I know you're in here!

474
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,708
Um...
Come out now...!

475
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,916
If not...
I'll, open the curtains...

476
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,875
...and I'll drag you out!

477
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not even kidding...!

478
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,166
Watch!

479
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,375
I'll give you till
the count of three...

480
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,291
...and one~!

481
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,000
There's no one in here.

482
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,416
There's not?

483
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,375
Are you sure?

484
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
Check it out for yourself.

485
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh man that was a close one!

486
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,250
Was that Kanejo?!

487
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,750
What the heck was
she doing in here?!

488
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,083
This is the sex room!

489
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,833
Was she trying to get
all lezzie and watch...?!

490
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,333
And P.S...

491
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,333
Is that thing supposed to
shrink up in times of stress?

492
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,833
It's like a turtle.

493
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,875
Okay, awkward.

494
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:47,958
What room is this?

495
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,250
This is my bedroom.

496
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,666
And why did you bring me here?

497
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,416
We almost did
it on Kanejo's bed?!

498
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Oh gross I wonder what kind
of things she's done in there?!

499
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,416
We were about to
have sex in her room.

500
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,416
On her bed.

501
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,458
Is that what Yamada wanted?!

502
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,875
Holy frogs, that hurts...

503
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,083
It's like someone put a giant
binder clip down there!

504
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,375
I guess we could finish here.

505
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,833
But it's so dark he might
go in the wrong way.

506
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
Hey, maybe that would
make me more advanced!

507
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,250
Like skipping a level?!

508
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,500
They're ruining everything.

509
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,250
I just wanted to film
it and watch it live.

510
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,625
That's not too much to ask!

511
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,916
Where are they?!

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,916
What is she doing?!

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,333
She's so weird...

514
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,208
I guess not as
weird as that one...

515
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,958
I'm sure I can
guess where she is.

516
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,083
I want sex!

517
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,291
The walk--in closet...

518
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,083
It's the perfect place to hide.

519
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,083
Especially in a panic.

520
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,416
This is perfect.

521
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,041
I mean, it's all going to
lead to this eventually.

522
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,375
I should just
kill them now while

523
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,750
they're both trapped
in the same place...

524
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,375
Once she's gone,
Keiichi won't be

525
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,833
tempted to cheat on me anymore.

526
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,166
It's show time!

527
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
What's wrong with you?

528
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,250
I am actually not feeling well,
thank you for asking...

529
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,541
I should probably stay
and lie down for awhile...

530
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,791
Please just go back to
the party and enjoy yourself.

531
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,833
Don't worry about me.

532
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,833
Yeah...

533
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,291
Uh, okay...

534
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,208
So this has nothing to do
with trying to find Yamada?

535
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,000
No, of course not.

536
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,083
No!
She found us!

537
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,125
We're gonna die in here!

538
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,875
Meow~

539
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,208
What an idiot!

540
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,583
It's a cat.

541
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,500
Weird...

542
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,375
Well, go on back to the party.

543
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,416
I'll see you in a bit.

544
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,791
It came from inside the closet!

545
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,333
I know it's strange...

546
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,000
...but we've always kept the
cats in closets at our house.

547
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,375
But that wasn't a cat!

548
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,833
Didn't you hear it meow, silly?

549
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,208
Uh, that was Yamada!

550
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,166
Get out of here!

551
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Finally...

552
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,500
There's no one
here to interrupt us.

553
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
There are so many options now.

554
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,791
I can chop them up
and feed them to the dog...

555
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,208
Or maybe the fish in the ocean
might enjoy a nice snack.

556
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,791
Someone's entering the
Temple of Brotherly Love!

557
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:56,833
Hey Kanejo!

558
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,416
Uh...

559
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,916
Hi Miyano, what were you doing
in that room all by yourself?

560
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,416
I'm so sorry.

561
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,041
This house is so big and I
have no sense of direction...

562
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,041
I just wandered around
until I ended up here.

563
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,708
How is it possible to just
'end up' in that room?!

564
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,708
When you're a klutz that
kind of stuff just happens.

565
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Oh my gosh she had to have
seen everything in there!

566
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,333
Kanejo wake up...

567
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,291
Speak to us!

568
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,333
Emergency...!

569
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,916
Someone help~!

570
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,708
I don't know
what just happened...

571
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,708
...but I'm pretty sure
Miyano saved our lives.

572
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,541
Let's run while we can!

573
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,833
Not again...!

574
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,833
They were so close!

575
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,500
Someone hold me!

576
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,708
I have to say this
comes as a shock.

577
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,208
Yeah, I know.

578
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,208
I never knew my own sister
would feel this way about me.

579
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,125
I'm so sorry...

580
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,375
I just...

581
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,000
I love you too...
sweet sister.

582
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,125
My dear brother...
you've made me so happy.

583
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,458
Kanejo...? Are you awake...?!
Can you hear me?

584
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,458
Why are you here?!

585
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,916
Oh thank goodness...

586
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,458
You passed out so quickly
I didn't know what happened.

587
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,625
By the way...

588
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,333
...that room I got
locked in was amazing.

589
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,208
Where'd you get all those
photos and figures of Keiichi?

590
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,750
I want one just like it!

591
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,500
But I'd want to fill it with
pictures and statues of Kosuda!

592
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,708
Looks like you've found yourself
an unexpected ally, huh?

593
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm getting
all feverish again...

594
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,750
...and like my heart is about
to pound out of my chest.

595
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,458
Wait a minute, could I
be getting more turned on

596
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,333
because I have to
wait to have sex again?

597
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,750
Maybe this is going
to help me have the

598
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,083
most exciting
first experience ever!

599
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,791
How 'bout...
...no.

600
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,375
Maybe I was trying to rush this
whole sex thing too much.

601
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,625
Being friends is cool.

602
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,625
Maybe waiting's not so bad.

603
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,333
Let's go!

604
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,000
We have ten minutes
to finish what we started!

605
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,708
Ow.

606
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,916
Stop trying to pressure me!

607
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,041
I wanna wait...

608
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,375
'Kay?

609
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,708
She's right...

610
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,791
I've been so
wrapped up in it all I

611
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,208
didn't know she
was feeling pressured.

612
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,041
So um...

613
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,833
...how 'bout tomorrow?

614
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,208
It'll be Christmas!

615
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,166
Doing it the next
day counts as waiting?

616
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,333
You freaking bet it does!

617
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,166
Sure...

618
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,208
I'll see you tomorrow then.

619
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,333
As weird as this is,
I'm happy for her.

620
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,750
It's a message from Daisuke...!

621
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:25,916
Peace!

622
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,625
That girl is always so
obnoxiously happy.

623
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,125
Well...

624
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,208
...guess we'll try
again tomorrow, Yamada...

625
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,208
Don't screw it up.

626
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,000
Same to you, Kosuda.

627
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,666
In case you're wondering...

628
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,083
Nothing much
changes for these guys.

629
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,791
At least it didn't get worse!

630
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,125
Not for all of us.

631
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,791
I can't believe you did this!

632
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,958
I totally did!

633
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,083
He was too busy
being dreamy to sign our

634
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,958
marriage license
so I signed it for him!

635
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,625
You can't just
forge someone else's

636
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,208
signature on
documents like this!

637
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,875
It's a serious offense...!

638
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,958
You could go to jail!

639
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,250
The end.

640
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:02,166
♪ closing song ♪

641
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,625
Kosuda, it's been a year and
nine months since I met you.

642
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,583
Time flies when
you're having so much fun.

643
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,375
I feel like we only
met a few months ago.

644
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,458
Yeah, I wanted to tell you...

645
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,708
We don't have
time to get all mushy!

646
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,291
There's only one
episode left and there

647
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,958
are three segments
instead of two!

648
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,541
We're so getting
overtime for this!

649
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,833
Anyway, that means
it's time to say goodbye!

650
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,000
See you next time!

651
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,458
For the last time.
