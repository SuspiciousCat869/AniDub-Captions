It's about time
for her to wake up.

Today's career counseling day.

00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,833
Good morning, honey.

00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,000
Rise and shine.

00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,416
[MIZUKI]
Great.

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Yuko's in a good mood again.

She gets a gold star.

Hi, Lion! How are you?

21
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,333
Hello?

22
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,916
I've really missed you!
You good?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,208
[YUKO]
What was that?

24
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,750
Sorry, I can't hear you.

How are you?

Oh. I'm doing well. And you?

27
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,875
[LION]
I'm great!

28
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,416
I'll be back at
the dorms tomorrow.

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,208
Yeah? What a nice surprise.

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,708
Be careful on your way here.

31
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,625

Miss Morigaya.

00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,791
[YUKO]
Coming.

38
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,583
Excuse me. [door closes]

00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,125
[AOI]
Yuko? Hey. Yuko, you with us?

40
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,125
We're so sorry
for making you wait.

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,583
It's fine. Shall we
head into town now?

42
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,500
We can't go yet.
President's not here.

43
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,750
[YUKO]
Goodness, where could she be?

44
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,583
[AOI] It's kinda weird for
Mizuki to be late like this.

45
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,583
I wonder if she's okay.

46
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,000
[MIZUKI]
Sorry I'm late, honey.

[ASHLEY]
How did everyone's day go?

49
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,666
We all finished our career
counseling, right?

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,916
[AOI]
Yeah.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,583
[ASHLEY] Anything happen
in your meeting, Aoi?

52
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,958
[AOI] I'll be working in
the same office as before.

53
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,291
How 'bout you, Yuko?

54
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,750
I don't know.

55
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,541
There are so many options.

56
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,708
[AOI]
You're not gonna join ALCA?

57
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,583
It's a bit hard to explain,

58
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,625
but I formed my covenant
during the latter half

59
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,958
of my time at Pirari Academy.

60
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,333
Not just that.
The real problem is...

61
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,541
I'm a little afraid of fighting.

62
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,208
I can't help it.

63
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:58,166
I know it sounds silly,
but it's how I feel.

64
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,250
You're not still
undecided, are you?

65
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,000
You only have six months left.

66
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,666
You're an excellent student.

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,958
I'm sure if you went on
to join ALCA as a Logicalist,

68
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,541
you'd rise through
the ranks quickly.

69
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,791
Several offices have already
expressed interest in you.

70
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,083
I know, but still.

71
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,791
Is there another career choice
that you'd like to pursue?

72
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,416
ALCA is not your only option.

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,375
Many other students
continue their education

74
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,875
at regular universities.

75
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,416
Come now.

76
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,416
Those are students who haven't
even formed a covenant yet.

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,375
Miss Morigaya has some
of the best grades

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,875
in the S-Class.

79
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,875
She can't throw
away her potential,

80
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,750
even if the world is at peace.

81
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,416
You see, the thing is...

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,666
Nothing. Nevermind.

83
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,500
Please, feel free
to share your thoughts.

84
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,916
After all, it is your future
we're talking about here.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,416
This school will be happy
with whatever decision

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,541
you choose to make
as long as you're happy.

87
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,458
Do whatever feels right to you.

88
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,208
Graduation is just
around the corner,

89
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,000
so this is the ideal time
for you to be thinking

90
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,458
about your plans.

91
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,625
And I'll always be here if
you need to talk about them.

92
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,000
Thanks. I appreciate that.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,916
[ASHLEY]
Everything'll be okay, Yuko.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Remember, you still
have half a year left.

95
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,791
Plenty of time
for you to decide.

96
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,291
[YUKO]
Well, enough about me.

97
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Thanks for listening.

98
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,041
So what are your plans, Mizuki?

99
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,416
[gasps] This is very unusual.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,291
You don't normally show
that much interest

101
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,541
in my life.

102
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,166
It's okay if you don't
want to share with us.

103
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,833
If you want to know that badly,

104
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,916
I'll do you a solid
and let you in on it.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,083
I've nothing to hide.

106
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,041
And since my plans are so grand

107
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,708
you're bound to
find out eventually.

108
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,125
So what are you up to?

109
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,083
An ALCA revolution.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,541
Let's make sure the school
festival is really fun.

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,458
Oh, yeah!

112
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,458
It will be!

113
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,375
Don't act like you
didn't hear me!

114
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,458
And just what exactly is this
grand revolution of yours?

115
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,208
Since the world
is so peaceful now,

116
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,083
I'm afraid that danger
may lurk in the shadows.

117
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,291
Huh?

118
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,958
In the past, we all
faced a mutual threat.

119
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,000
Invasions from outside forces.

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,625
That's why the world
came together,

121
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,000
but what now?

122
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,291
Just the smallest
misunderstanding

123
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,416
could lead to all of humanity
fighting amongst ourselves.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,125
That's what really scares me.

125
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,791
And if that comes to pass,

126
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,541
then Logicalists
with strong powers

127
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,666
will certainly be
dragged into the fighting.

128
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,583
But I have a solution!

129
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,041
ALCA should put its
efforts into functioning

130
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,875
as a system that exists
to maintain balance

131
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,166
across our world.

132
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,833
And that's my
vision of the future.

133
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,000
Well that certainly
is a grand plan.

134
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,708
I've always said
that the only dreams

135
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,166
worth chasing are the ones
that're hard to catch.

136
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,541
The president is actually
being serious for once.

137
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,791
[ASHLEY] I hope she
comes back to us soon.

138
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,125
Oh, give me a break!

139
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,958
I'm serious all
the time, you guys!

140
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,416
[GIRLS laugh]

141
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,833
[MIZUKI]
Why are you laughing?

142
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,625
[YUKO]
My dreams for the future.

143
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,208
Until recently,

144
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,541
I thought my only
choice was to join ALCA.

145
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,333
[YUKO]
When I was a little girl,

146
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,375
I wanted to be a pastry chef.

147
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,208
After that, I wanted
to be a florist.

148
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,500
And even a famous pop
star at one point.

149
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:29,000
Back in those days,
I had so many dreams.

150
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,833
Hey. Where's Yuko?

151
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,750
[AOI]
Yuko! What's the matter?

152
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,083
[knocking]

153
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,958
[YUKO]
Coming.

154
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,500
Goodness.

155
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,416
[MIZUKI] Hey. Let's take a
trip back to our childhood.

156
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,041
How many years has it been?

157
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,875
Since we last lit fireworks?

158
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,166
We were just little
kids the last time.

159
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,875
So maybe twelve
or thirteen years.

160
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,583
Nuh-uh! That can't be right.

161
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,166
I thought we lit some
before entering this school?

162
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,833
Were you with us?

163
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,333
[MIZUKI coughs]
Well, in any case...

164
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,791
You and I sure do have
a lot of history together.

165
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,250
[YUKO] Yeah, the two of us
have been in the same class

166
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,666
since kindergarten.

167
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,208
[MIZUKI]
So many years.

168
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,833
I remember when you
formed your covenant.

169
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,208
I was so envious.

170
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,375
[YUKO]
No. My power isn't special.

171
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,375
It's definitely not
suited for battle.

172
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,583
Aw, don't say that.

173
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,750
You have an amazing power.

174
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,500
You should be proud.

175
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,083
Now I was another story.

176
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,750
Forming a covenant
took me forever.

177
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,500
The whole ordeal
was so frustrating.

178
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,708
But looking back,
I know it's what made me

179
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,958
who I am today, and I'm
very thankful for that.

180
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,000
You're such an amazing person.

181
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,708
You truly think so?

182
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,208
Yes, because you've
already got your life goals

183
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,083
in sight and know
exactly how you're going

184
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,458
to achieve them.

185
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,416
But I'm nowhere near that level.

186
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I still haven't found a
dream for myself quite yet.

187
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,791
[sighs]

188
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,625
I wonder what I'm supposed
to do with my life.

189
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,916
[MIZUKI]
But that's easy.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,916
What do you want to do?

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,208
[YUKO]
Huh?

192
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,291
It's no fun if you
think of your future

193
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,875
as some sort of duty,

194
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,375
like you only have
one path to follow.

195
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,791
You're better off thinking
about what you want,

196
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,458
and what you want to do.

197
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,583
There's no greater
motivation than simply

198
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,666
doing what you like, is there?

199
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,791
[YUKO]
What I like?

200
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,333
[MIZUKI]
Uh, hey, Yuko.

201
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,458
I know that this
stuff's important,

202
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,791
but how 'bout a little
change of pace?

203
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,125
[YUKO]
A Bon Dance contest?

204
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:08,083
I wanna ask if you'll make
my dreams come true.

205
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,541
Can I take you? Just us.
On a yukata date--

206
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,958
[LION]
There you are, Yuko!

207
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,416
Goodness gracious.

208
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,458
I wasn't expecting you.

209
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,666
I know!

210
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,791
But I couldn't wait
another day to see you!

211
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,250
[YUKO]
Welcome home.

212
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,708
What perfect timing.

213
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,750
It turns out there's going
to be a Bon Dance

214
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,583
competition tomorrow.

215
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,208
--Let's invite everyone.
--[LION] Yay!

216
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,166
[MIZUKI]
Yuko, don't go!

217
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,416
[YAYOI] If you don't finish
your homework,

218
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,000
then you'll never even get
to start your Bon Dance!

219
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,291
[GROUP]
Yeah.

220
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,875
[YAYOI] Gosh! Try to
put some spirit into it.

221
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,458
[GROUP]
Yeah.

222
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,125
[MAHIRO] And we still have to
prepare for the school festival.

223
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,625
[LION]
Ya!

224
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,791
[YAYOI] You can do that after
you finish your homework.

225
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,708
Is there a reason why Lion
doesn't have to be over here?

226
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,375
That's because I've already
finished my homework.

227
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,083
And it was really tough.

228
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,791
You're not going anywhere!

229
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,125
[YUKO]
Goodness gracious.

230
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,083
You sure are working hard.

231
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,833
How 'bout you ladies take
a little break for a snack.

232
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,875
Here.

233
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,041
[YAYOI]
Thanks, Yuko.

234
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,791
I appreciate your concern.

235
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
I'll hold on to the food
and make sure

236
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,875
everyone's taken care of.

237
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,625
You can have one rice ball after
you finish that drill book.

238
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,000
[MAHIRO]
I can't wait that long!

239
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,458
I'll starve to death!

240
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,250
[YAYOI] So, what kind
of fillings did you put

241
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,583
in these rice balls?

242
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,750
[YUKO]
Oh, let me think, uh...

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,416
Hey, look, it's Nina!

244
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,083
What are you doing with that?

245
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,500
[LION]
Oh, this? It's the Bon Dance.

246
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,958
My daddy taught me how to do it.

247
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,041
[NINA]
Uh...

248
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,625
[LION]
Is something wrong?

249
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,083
I'm pretty sure that's
not the Bon Dance.

250
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,333
[LION]
Huh?!

251
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,000
[STRAFANSKY] Your daddy
knows what he's doing!

252
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,000
[MAHIRO]
I'm done.

253
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,750
[LION]
Here. You did a great job!

254
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,875
We can tell you
worked really hard.

255
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,916
[MAHIRO]
I'm gonna take a break now.

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,125
You've earned one.

257
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,250
[YAYOI] We'll be done
over here soon too.

258
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,666
[YUKO]
Well, what do you think, Lion?

259
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,416
Should we go ahead
and get changed?

260
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,458
Yeah!

261
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,916
[YAYOI] Oh, my, those flower
patterns are quite lovely.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,625
They are.

263
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,291
Yeah. They're really cute.

264
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,458
Your bunny rabbits are adorable!

265
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,875
Hey. So who do you girls
think is gonna win

266
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,291
this thing anyway?

267
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,416
Win what?

268
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
The Bon Dance contest, duh.

269
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,000
It has a long history,
and every year

270
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,166
the big winner is
awarded a nice prize.

271
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,125
[KARIN] Not to brag or
anything, but our mistress

272
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,250
was the 92nd winner
of the competition.

273
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,291
[LION]
Really? That's amazing, Yayoi!

274
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,416
Then could you please
teach Lion the dance?

275
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,125
[LION] What? I already
know the Bon dance!

276
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,166
We don't have time,

277
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,541
but I will show her
before next year's.

278
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,750
That's so sweet of
you to help her out.

Hold on.

What's wrong?

I just don't want you...
to get lost.

Okay!

C'mon, Nina! Let's go!

there's no need to run.

Something wrong?

Do you need me to eat
that snack for you?

Please don't.

take it home and keep it.

such an unfortunate ending.

These feathers were left
all over the crime scene.

And my guess is that the
black bird who just flew by us

has something
to do with the crime.

that Japanese women

I wanted to.

457
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,000
I couldn't go to the beach,
or the hot springs,

458
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,208
or the mountains,
or see any fireworks.

the same thing last year?

[RINO]
But what really gets me down

461
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,458
is that most people
think teachers

462
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,250
get the same kind
of fun summer break

all the students do.

464
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,750
Our schedules are so
packed that "summer break"

465
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,250
is actually busier
than the school year,

466
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,000
what with the training courses
and curriculum writing.

467
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,750
[KAGURA]
That's true.

468
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,458
[RINO] I even got a cute
new bathing suit this year.

Let's go swimming next weekend.

That's amazing!

472
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,875
My first trip to the
beach this year! Ah!

473
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,916
[KAGURA] Well, you're kind of
easy to please, aren't you?
