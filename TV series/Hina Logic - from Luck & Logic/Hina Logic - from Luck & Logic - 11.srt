00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,583
[YUKO] Are you really
going to be okay by yourself?

00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,791
[NINA]
I'll be fine.

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,250
If anything does happen,

00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,333
please be sure to contact
the teacher staying on duty.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,250
And of course, you can
always call or text me too.

6
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,541
I can be back here in no time.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,333
I know.
And I appreciate your concern.

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,666
I left some broth for a
New Year's soba in the fridge.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,000
Make sure to heat it up
later tonight.

10
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,291
There's also some New Year's
food in the cupboard.

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,125
Now, the mochi may
be a little hard,

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,833
so you'll really
need to chew it.

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,166
Oh, and--

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,083
Yuko, we need to get going
or we'll miss the train.

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,416
Goodness gracious.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,125
I'll see you
after the break, Nina.

17
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,791
We'll catch you
on the flip side, Nina.

18
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,666
Bye, bye.

19

Have a happy New Year.

[KARIN] Wow, we won't
see you till next year.

It's so quiet now.

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,208
Kinda eerie really.

27
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:19,875
Almost like I'm the only person
left in the whole wide world.

[exhales]

29
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,625
[NINA] Now I can finally
binge watch every episode

30
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,041
of that show I've
been wanting to see

31
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,958
without any interruptions.

32
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,541
I might even put on a comedy
for once, or maybe a mystery.

33
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,416
Then I'll use the rest
of my time to research

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,458
whether or not I can
use the superstring theory

35
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:42,000
to analyze the
universe's inflation.

36
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,958
Freedom really does
equal true happiness.

37
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,416
I'm so glad you
finally came back!

I thought you were going
back home for the break.

Yeah, I was.

45

But when I heard you'd be
staying at the dorm all alone...

[gasps]

47
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,083
[LION] ...I decided to spend
New Year's Eve with you.

00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,541
Fun, right?

00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,958
[NINA]
Yeah...

00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,875
Do you want one of my
yummy mandarins?

No, thank you.

Okay, but you're missing out.

They're really good.

I'm sure they are.

00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,875
What are you up to?

56
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,208
It's a kotatsu!

57
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,333
[BELLE squeaks]

58
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,125
It keeps your feet
all warm and toasty!

That's not what I meant.

00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,750
I wanna know why all of this
stuff is in my room.

61

'Cause it's a tradition, silly.

62
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,375
In Japan, you celebrate
the new year

63
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,708
by snuggling up
under the kotatsu,

64
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,041
eating mandarins,

65

slurping up some soba,

66

watching the
Year-End Song Festival,

67
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,458
eating dried sweet potato,
mochi, rice crackers.

68
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
Sounds like
nothing but eating.

00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,166
And don't worry.

and get under the kotatsu.

These things are so amazing.

74
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,750
Karen told me that
once you curl up under one,

75
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,000
you won't ever be able to leave!

76

Hey, Nina.

179
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,333
Do you know why everyone
eats soba on New Year's Eve?

180
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,666
I actually don't.

181
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,500
I didn't either until
Yayoi told me the reason.

182
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,000
Apparently soba is
a lot easier to cut through

183
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,250
than other noodles.

184
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,500
So it symbolizes how you
can "cut off" hardships

You didn't have to.
But thanks a lot.

Should I eat it now or
do you want me to wait?

I'll take a bite.

It's delicious.

Yay!

330
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,458
I did it!

I'm glad your hard work
paid off, Lion.

Yup. And it was
all made possible

amazing fix-it robot.

That thing of yours
caused nothing but trouble.

your chocolate to, Yayoi?

Those two have always been
so faithful and supportive.

Is something the matter, Nina?

[BELLE squeaks]

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,708
This display of affection is
completely out of character.

358
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,416
I wonder what could've
happened to her?

359
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,583
Probably Amol or Cupid's arrow.

They're the two
most likely suspects.

What's the arrow of Cupid?

Running Theories with Mahiro!

Please allow me to explain!

365
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,416
People shot with one of
Cupid's special arrows

366
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,041
are said to fall madly in love
with the first person or thing

367
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,375
they see after they're hit.

Yes, I knew that.

But, we would've seen Nina
get struck by Cupid's arrow.

370
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,333
True, which means
today's a special case.

371
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,166
Although she was never
directly hit by the love god,

372
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,041
she did take a bite
of a chocolate cupcake

373
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,125
that was chock-full
of Cupid's love power.

374
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,291
Making her fall in love

with the cutie who
baked the special treat.

--[YAYOI] So Cupid is real?

--[LION pleading]
--I thought he was just a myth.

378
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,041
I suppose I was
wrong about that.

379
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,583
The enchantment only
lasts a few hours though.

380
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,750
So I think she should be back
to normal later this evening.

381
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,250
That may be true, but it
doesn't change the fact that

382
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,041
these chocolate treats
are dangerous.

383
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,750
I had planned on giving these
to Karin and Karen as gifts,

384
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,000
but I think it would be better
to dispose of them.

That's a shame.

Your friends will never get to
enjoy the wonderful chocolate

387
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,500
you worked so hard to make them
for Valentine's Day.

It really is too bad, but I
don't have any other choice.

Why would you do that when
you know it's dangerous?

00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,291
[KAREN] Yeah, you're the
one who was going on about

484
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,666
how pretty her hair is.

485
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,125
Then you forced her
into that position

486
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,625
so you could play with it.

487
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,375
If you're doing some kind of
amnesia bit, I don't buy it.

488
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,625
Huh. She really does
have pretty hair.

489
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,416
The "obsession" effect
of Cupid's arrow

490
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,958
should have worn off by now.

491
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,000
So will you please stop?

492
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,791
[LION giggles]

493
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
[NINA sighs]

494
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,875
I feel like I just woke up from
a really long and strange dream.

495
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,500
[sighs] I'm so exhausted.

496
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,333
Here.

497
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,708
Happy Valentine's Day, Lion.

498
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,000
--[NINA gasps]
--[LION] Thank you!

499
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,916
I love you too, Nina!

500
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,750
[LION giggles]

501
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,875
[sighs]

502
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,166
It looks like you've got
a large haul again this year.

503
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,875
[KAGURA] Yeah. Chocolate's
gonna be my staple for a while.

504
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,208
Hard to be that popular, huh?

505
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,833
Just out of curiosity,

506
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,500
have you ever been serious
about giving anyone chocolates?

507
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,500
Tell the truth.

508
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,833
That sounds like
a big pain to me.

509
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,458
How about you?

510
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,208
As a matter of fact, I have.

511
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,666
And I do it
every single year, too.

512
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,916
Yeah?

513
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,416
Here you go.

514
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,541
Happy Valentine's.

515
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,833
[KAGURA] I bet you're looking
for triple in return, right?

516
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,208
[RINO] I am looking forward
to this year's White Day.

517
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,916
Here's to us.

518
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:48,541
[KAGURA, RINO giggle]

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,916
