[RINO]
Welcome back to class.

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,458
Okay, now that your second
semester has officially begun,

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,666
it's time to present
your summer research projects.

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,291
Yayoi, you're up first.

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,000
I was fortunate enough to be
tutored by a family friend

6
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,625
who's a cultural expert.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,416
By using traditional
Japanese crafting techniques,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,166
I created a Disfia Foreigner
in the wooden mosaic style.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,250
[RINO]
Wow.

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,500
Amazing!

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,250
That looks like a
professional piece of art.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,875
Is there some kind of problem?

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,750
It's fine.
Next is Karin and Karen.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,041
Come on down you two.

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,458
I heard you worked
on a project together.

16
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,583
So this is, um...

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,750
What am I looking at?

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,541
Please give us a minute.

19
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,291
It's supposed to be
a Tritomy-like

21

I'm drinking as fast as I can.

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,000
I apologize.

23
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,458
Clearly I was negligent
in supervising them.

24
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,000
How 'bout we move on?

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,125
Lion's up.

26

What did you bring?

27
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,791
Is this a bear carving?

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,333
That's right!

29
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,458
Daddy showed me how to carve
the wood myself with a knife.

30
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,000
[KAGURA] You managed to
make this with just a knife?

31
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,625
That's quite an amazing feat.

[BELLE screeches]

33
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,625
[YAYOI] Isn't that salmon
in its mouth a little too big?

34
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,375
It's actually a tuna.

35
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,500
[OTHERS]
A tuna?

36
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,708
Why a tuna?

37
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,625
Because it's my favorite fish!

38
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,250
Oh--I see.

39
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,291
All right. It's your
turn to present, Nina.

40
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,500
Uh, so... what's all this?

41
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,291
[NINA] I measured the pulses
of a Cepheid variable star,

42
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,958
and observed the distance
between astronomical objects

43
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,125
outside our galaxy, while noting
the expansion of our universe.

44
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,166

This can't be good.

50
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,208
[RINO] Against my
better judgment, I'll ask.

51
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,541
What's this?

52
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,666
All right! It's my latest model
of a Powered Suit

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,583
that allows a normal human
to safely enter a Paradox Zone!

54
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,125
With my perfected suits,
non-Logicalists will be able to

55
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,916
move freely into
these dangerous areas,

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,291
in order to save injured people

57
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,500
or do whatever else
they'd like to in that space!

58
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,958
And hopefully someday,
we humans will be able to

59
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,166
use these suits to
visit other worlds!

60
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,375
It's cardboard.

61

Since this is the prototype,

62
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,666
I kinda had to use
what I could get my hands on.

63

let's see it in action.

There's new info
about the school festival.

69
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,291
And your class still needs
to nominate a project leader.

70
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,125
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
we needed a leader.

71
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,500
Yes, you all need to pick
a student representative

72
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,208
to be in charge
of your class project.

73

And I'm sure you wouldn't mind

if we left all the details
to you, Yayoi.

Indeed.

Now the principal has
asked to meet with us,

so we'll need to talk to you
about this sometime later.

Using our co-existence with
Foreigners as the theme,

we'd like for each class,

we here at student council

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,833
I'll be conducting
extracurricular lessons with her

162
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:46,500
this semester on how to resolve
her unstable Trance situation.

163
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,750
The fluctuating light that
scatters across will surely...

164
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,041
...appear as fleeting
as ever before.

165
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,500
You understand, right?

166
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,083
Because you should.

167
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,583
You must remember to always
keep a vigilant eye on her.

168
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,875
[KAGURA]
I will.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,833
[YAYOI]
Okay!

170
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,500
Does anyone else have an idea?

171
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,041
[MAHIRO]
Me!

172
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,500
Wouldn't it be really cool
for our class to sing a song?

173
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,833
[OTHERS]
A song?

174
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,000
I couldn't stop thinking
about it during our break.

175
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,833
Remember that song Lion
sang to us under the stars?

176
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,041
She told us it's from Monolium.

177
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,458
[LION] Really?
You wanna sing that song?

178
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,791
It could teach us something
special about Foreigner culture.

179
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,208
And it fits perfectly
with the festival's theme!

180
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,625
Don't you girls agree?

181
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,083
[LION gasps]

182
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,583
Certainly.

183
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,333
And I believe that it's a
wonderful and very unique idea.

184
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,750
But unless I'm mistaken here,

185
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,916
we only have the one
short Foreigner song

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,708
that Lion's mother taught her.

187
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,375
Do you know any others?

188
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,333
Can we really convey anything
with just one song?

189
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,041
Yeah, you've got a point.

190
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, now perhaps we take the
feelings put into Lion's song,

191
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,750
and come up with another way
to communicate that message

192
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,125
to the festival goers.

193
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,583
We can turn the song
into part of a story!

194
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,791
I'm not quite sure I understand.

195
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,875
Just how do you
plan on doing that?

196
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,750
We'll put on a performance!

197
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,166
A musical play!

198
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,958

This sounds like it'll be fun!

What will the story be about?

Uh-uhh.

203

[MAHIRO]
Lion, sing the song

204
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,416
so everyone else can hear
what we're talking about.

205

Hm?

206

got a karaoke mode too.

That means good fortune.

Maybe. But I don't forgive you
for that invasion of privacy.

Uh, well, anyway,

submitted their
festival paperwork yet

214

is Miss Kagura's
first-year class S.

You know what kind
of students they are.

I'm sure they're all just
exploding with--

We might be waiting
a while longer.

Of course.

219
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:14,125
[RINO] Hm? A musical
using a Foreigner song.

220
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,500
Wow, that's such an
original idea.

221
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,416
Okay. So who's going to be
writing the script?

222
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,875
Since I came up with it,
I'll be the writer.

223
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,625
What kind of story will it be?

224
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,708
[MAHIRO] I haven't really
worked that out yet.

the project leader is Mahiro?

Huh? Well, that's
clearly a mistake.

I'm the project leader now.

237

That's way too much
responsibility.

238

So, why didn't you want to be
the one in charge anyway?

239
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,625

taking on the leadership role,

as I usually do.

perfect person for the job.

I felt that the person
leading our class project

246
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,083
should be the one who's always
been the most passionate

about Foreigners
and their culture.

[LION groans]

333
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,083
[KAGURA] I'd hoped pairing you
with such a childish partner

334
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,125
would allow you
to retain control.

335
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,750
It seems I was mistaken.

336
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,208
Because your propensity to
empathize with the Foreigners

337
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,541
is too strong.

What am I supposed to do?

341
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,666
You need to train
both your heart and body.

342
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,708
Let me think.

343
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,541
From now on you'll be
meeting with me regularly

344
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,541
for some intensive
one-on-one combat training.

345
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,791
But what kind of lessons
should I take to train my heart?

346
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
That's a good question.

What was that?

352
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,500
[KAGURA] It seems as though
you're sensitive

353
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
to other people's
feelings as well.

354
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,166
Did that frighten you?

355
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,541
Well, uh... just a little bit.

356
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,208
[KAGURA]
Now look in the mirror.

357
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,666
Even with
a small threat like that,

358
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,666
your emotions start to run wild.

359
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,000
Disrupting your
Trance's balance.

360
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,791
Our training sessions
will not be limited

361
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,541
to just your combat skills.

362
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,250
We'll also focus
on your emotions.

Understand?

[LION]
Miss Kagura.

365
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,916
[LION] Can you tell me what it
means to be a strong Logicalist?

366
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
And how do you know
if you're good enough?

367
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,791
[KAGURA] There is a reason
you're asking me, right?

368
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,791
Um, well...

369
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,833
I know this girl
who's really strong,

370
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,458
but she has to
make herself even stronger!

371
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,916
Or more like,

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,791
she has to prove to people
that she's gotten stronger.

373
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Does that make any sense?

Yeah...

a solution for her,

but I couldn't
think of any good ones...

I wanna help her.

379
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,666
There's gotta be something
I can do to cheer her on.

380
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,458
The best thing for you to do
is stay by her side.

Anyone would feel stupid

I didn't wanna bother Mahiro

00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,250
while she was busy trying to
write our class musical.

Well, this won't do at all.

But you didn't need to
go out of your way like that.

Once Mahiro starts
working on a new assignment,

412
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,833
she's oblivious to
everything else around her.

Mahiro decides to take on,

you can rest assured she's
putting all her energy into it.

417
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,666
Of course, she's failed
more times than not.

00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,458
But then, she wouldn't
be Mahiro otherwise.

I always forget that
you've been friends with her
