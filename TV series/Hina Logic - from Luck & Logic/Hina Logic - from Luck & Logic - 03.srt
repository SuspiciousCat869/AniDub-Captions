We need to turn
this plane around now.

If we go any further,
we'll be violating the law.

Should we head back home now?

you contacting us
before visiting the school.

I did contact you,

and I believe you were
the one who refused me.

Mr. Yelistratova,
what I refused

was your request to live
in the dorm room

alongside your daughter,

105

you couldn't visit her.

Of course not,
he's obviously human.

118
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,916
And he's not a hybrid.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,833
Because humans can't
reproduce with the Foreigners.

120

Aww. I was hoping he'd turn
out to be a new type

So what's Liones?

132
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,083
That's the name of
the great little country

133
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,541
where my beautiful
Liones hails from.

134
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
So you named her
after the country

135
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,750
she'll rule over one day?

136
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,208
That's kinda creepy,
don't you think?

137
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,916
[STRAFANSKY]
It's named after her, actually.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,333
No one wants a father
who's too clingy.

139
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,833
Try giving her a
little space for once.

140
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,208
Your father would cry
if he heard you say that.

141
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,041
You are his precious baby.

142

Do you understand
what they're saying?

00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:29,583
Sorry. Punkin. I'm so sorry!

144

Teens can be so
cruel to their fathers.

145
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,458
This unexpected visit
was especially dramatic,

146
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,583
to say the least.

147
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,000
It sure was!

00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,125
We even had to fire off
anti-aircraft weaponry at him.

149
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,791
It felt good having a Stinger
back in my hand, though.

While I don't condone
the unconventional actions

I can definitely understand
how you feel, sir.

So we'll make an
exception this one time

and let you sit in
on Lion's lectures.

[RINO] I know a lot of students
think that learning math

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,458
is a waste of time
for a Logicalist.

160
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,416
But these skills are
essential for planning

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,625
an effective battle strategy.

she will cause a
catastrophe one day.

327
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,166
[STRAFANSKY]
She would never!

328
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,666
Please, you need to trust us.

329
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,041
For your daughter's sake.

[STRAFANSKY]
Lion.

331
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,958
Yeah.

332
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
This is a pretty deep crevasse
that we've fallen into here.

333
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
Nina, is there something
wrong with you?

334
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,666
You have a really high fever.

335
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm scared we're all
gonna get sick in this cold.

336
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,000
If we're going to survive,
we have to do some--

[stomach growling]

338
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,041
I know now's not the
time, but I'm really hungry.

339
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,458
How can you think
about food at a--

[stomach growling]

341

[MAHIRO chuckles]

342
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,666
[STRAFANSKY]
Lion!

343
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,541
The roses!

344
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,583
There's no way
Daddy won't see these.

345
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,291
Now that's using
your brains, girl!

346
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,625
Nina can't wait much longer.

347
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,666
We need to get her
to the infirmary.

348
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,041
[growling]

349
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,875
Yes, we're all hungry,
but first--

--It's the bear!
--[LION] No!

351
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,416
And she looks angry!

352
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,791
We don't have anywhere to run!

353
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,916
You don't wanna eat us!

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,375
We're all nothing
but skin and bones!

355
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,041
Daddy!

00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,166
[STRAFANSKY yells]

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,208
You're safe, baby.

358
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,416
I'm here.

359
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Watch out!

00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,083
[bear growls]

361
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,333
For Lion!

362
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,625
Oh, I see.

363
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,333
You're like me, aren't you?

364
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,375
Daddy!

365
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,291
[laughing]

366
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,458
Nina.

367
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,750
Where am I?

368
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,500
In your dorm room.

369
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,708
Just relax.

370
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,000
Everyone made it back
safe and sound.

371

[KARIN]
Mistress!

372
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,500
We were so worried!

373
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,666
Please promise you won't
ever go off like that

374
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,583
without us again, okay?

375
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,625
Cross my heart.

376
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,333
It will never happen again.

377
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,000
I kinda can't
believe we survived.

378
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,333
This is all my fault.

380
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,000
I shouldn't have come here.

381
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,083
Uh-uh.

382
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,000
You're not the one responsible.

383
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,916
Me being embarrassed
about you is what caused

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
this whole stupid mess.

385
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,375
I finally realized that you're
just worried about me, Daddy.

386
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,041
Yes!

387
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,708
You are such an angel!

00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,875
You understanding how
I feel makes me so happy.

390
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,250
[LION]
But listen.

391
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,791
You don't need to worry
about me anymore.

392
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,625
I've already made
so many new friends.

393
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,916
And that means no one is
alone because we're all here

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,458
for one another!

395
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,541
Right.

My baby's growing up.

00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,458
I'm so proud of you!

398
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,208
I guess that means
you're gonna be fine

399
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,041
without your daddy
watching over you.

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,833
That home-cooked food.
I've still got it on me.

Yeah!

00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,625
[STRAFANSKY]
All right!

406
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,083
Then let's go back
to your dorm and eat!

407
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,250
I've no doubt your room
here is beautifully decorated.

Thanks a lot, Daddy.

Bye, now.

Why are you acting so
cold to me again, sweetie?

411
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,125
Well, our dorm is--

You're a man.

Sorry, but girls only.

[LION]
There's plenty for all of us!

Let's pig out!

416
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,625
I would be overjoyed to
sample some of the delicacies

417
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,916
from your homeland.

Dasvidaniya!

421
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,416
[STRAFANSKY] I need a drink
after the day I've had!

422
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,583
What am I supposed
to do about Lion?

423

Please! Someone tell me!

424
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,416
When fathers act
needy like this,

425
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,083
their daughters start to grow
resentful towards them.

426
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,708
I'd be happy to
teach you some things.

Tell me.

428

Are you familiar with the
phrase "give and take"?

429
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,875
Of course I'm familiar.

430
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,666
What is it you desire?

431
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,458
[KOZUE] Perhaps a chance to
mingle with some single guys?

432
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,166
[STRAFANSKY]
I see what you're getting at.

433
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,750
You want me to host a social
event, like a mixer?

434
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,833
[RINO]
Mixer?

435
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,750
Do you really understand
what she wants?

436
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,916
[STRAFANSKY]
Leave it to me.

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,750
I know many celebrities
across the world.

438
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,541
[KOZUE]
Celebrities? That's amazing!

439
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,125
When's a good time for you?

440
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,250
[RINO] I'm available at the
beginning of next month!

441
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,708
[KOZUE]
Let's get everything set up!

442
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,250
What kind of hot
bachelors do you know?

443
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,541
[STRAFANSKY]
Let's see.

444
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,583
The Wolf of Siberia.
The Lightning of Kremlin.

445
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:37,333
Oh! And the Giant of Tiefu is
recently divorced and single!

446
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,166
[RINO] Those aren't
really celebrities--

447
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,375
they're soldiers, right?

448
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,625
[KOZUE]
I'm all for it!

449
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,000
Aren't strong guys
the absolute best?

450
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,208
[RINO]
I totally agree!

451
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,750
[STRAFANSKY]
Then let's toast to our mixer!

452
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,750
Give me another glass of
that sweet potato liquor!

453
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:50,875
[KAGURA]
You're fine with that?
