to drink your tea

too difficult for us

to get that place clean in time.

130

And our room wouldn't work.

131
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,458
It's a wee bit cramped
so people wouldn't

be able to relax
and enjoy themselves.

I think booking an
elegant hotel suite

is going to be our best option.

just using Yuko's room?

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,125
[YUKO]
Vesta, will you lend me a hand?

320
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,458
[VESTA]
Why, of course.

321
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,583
Let's have some
fun together, Yuko.

322
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,291
[YUKO] This room's been
bothering me for weeks.

323
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,875
So let's make it
shine like new!

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,666
[YUKO] Cleaning really
does heal the soul.

325
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,083
How are you still eating?

326
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,750
[GIRL crying]

327
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,958
[LION]
What's the matter?

328
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,416
Aww, there there, it's okay.
Don't cry.

329
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,583
Is she lost?

330
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,791
Hello, little girl,
where's your mother?

331
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,250
Do you need help?

332
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,166
It's so cute.

333
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,625
Really, that thing?

334
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,375
[GIRL] There's a certain
type of flower I want.

335
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,583
But it's not blooming
anywhere yet.

336
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,541
What type of flower?

337
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,916
Well, it's pure white
and really big!

338
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,583
It's a very beautiful flower.

339
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,291
About this size around.

340
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
And it smells super
nice and sweet.

341
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,833
Uh...

342
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,291
[YAYOI] Sorry, but those aren't
the most helpful clues.

343
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,875
I might know what it is.

344
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,333
Dahlia?
It's not quite in season.

345
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,000
So, unfortunately we don't
have any in stock yet.

346
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,875
At least we know
what it's called now.

347
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,416
Are you sure you don't want
a different kind of flower?

348
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,333
But it's a present for a
really close friend of mine.

349
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,958
All right, let's go
visit some more shops!

350
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,875
Hmm...

351
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,750
Afraid not, but dahlias
sure are popular today.

352
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,625
Another person asked me earlier.

353
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,875
I'm sorry, girls.
But we don't have any.

354
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,666
[FLORIST 4C]
Oh!

355
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,041
I do have some seed
packets, though.

356
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
That works for me!

357
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,083
And just what exactly
are you going to do

358
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,250
with seeds?

359
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,291
[LION chuckles]

360
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,583
[LION]
Gate Access! Monolium!

361
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,125
Let's give it a try, Rosa!

362
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,500
[ROSA]
I understand.

363
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,916
Leave it to me.

364
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,708
Thank you so much, miss!

365
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,250
[YAYOI]
You made her happy.

366
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,083
[LION]
Yeah.

367
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,375
[NINA]
Nice job.

368
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,791
[YAYOI] Presents for
loved ones are important.

369
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,041
[YAYOI]
Wait!

370
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,666
We don't have the time
to be standing around!

371
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,041
That store will be closing
any minute now!

372
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,250
Throwing a birthday party
without having a present

373
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,000
to give is even more
wretched than eating

374
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,291
a shortcake without a
strawberry on top.

375
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,541
We failed our sweet Yuko.

376
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,750
[LION]
I'm so sorry.

377
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,250
This is all my fault.

378
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,916
[YAYOI] You don't need to
apologize for anything, Lion.

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,291
None of this would've
ever happened

380
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,208
if I'd only remembered
when Yuko's birthday was.

381
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,750
Then I could have spent
more time on party prep.

382
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,916
[NINA]
But you already have a present.

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,958
It's a very wonderful
and special gift.

384
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:51,000
[YUKO humming]

385
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,125
[giggles]

386
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,583
[sighs]

387
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,500
[YUKO]
What's this?

388
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,041
Are these my pajamas?

389
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,958
Goodness gracious, how sweet.

390
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,333
This should be fun.

391
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,458
[MIZUKI] Did you find
the invitation I left?

392
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes. I'm really looking
forward to it. [chuckles]

393
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,583
I'm sure you'll never forget
the night I have planned.

394
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,041
Surprise, Yuko!

395
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,000
We hope you're ready for the
best birthday pajama party ever!

396
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,500
My goodness.
This is so sweet.

397
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,083
How did you have time
to put this together?

398
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,958
These are a gift from all of us.
I hope you like them.

399
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,250
Aren't they lovely?

400
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,791
In flower language,
white dahlias mean

401
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,375
thank you so much.

402
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,625
There you have it.

403
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,833
This is the first time
anyone's ever thrown me

404
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,708
such a wonderful birthday party.

405
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,625
Thank you all for this.

406
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,208
I'll never forget such
an amazing gift.

407
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,333
Oh, Yuko!

408
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,333
Goodness gracious.

409
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,750
[YAYOI crying]

410
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,041
Oh...

411
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,375
By the way, here's a
birthday present from me.

412
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,458
[YUKO]
Thanks, Mahiro.

413
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,125
It's a perfect, unhackable
password I created for you.

414
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,875
Now keep it secret.

415
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,791
I'm not entirely
sure that I'll be able

416
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,916
to remember it!

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,750
[GIRLS laugh]

418
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,750
[KOZUE]
Every single day, she runs off

419
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,416
and leaves me to do the
heavy lifting by myself.

420
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,541
Really, she is such
a little swindler.

421
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,583
Yuko must still be getting
ready for her special night.

422
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
[giggles]

423
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,583
She's just so shy.

424
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,958
[RINO] And today was
supposed to be my day off!

425
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,083
Well, guess I'm stuck having
drinks with you again.

426
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,333
I was actually going to
say that exact same thing

427
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,583
about you.

428
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,000
I heard Lion and her friends

429
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,333
were throwing a surprise
birthday party for Yuko tonight.

430
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:18,583
Apparently they were planning
on having a pajama party.

431
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,125
[RINO]
Whatever, doesn't matter.

432
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,208
Now I'm so old that nothing
good ever happens

433
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,208
when I have a birthday anymore.

434
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,416
At my age, I'd probably
run out of breath

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,125
before I could blow
out all the candles

436
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,916
they'd have to put on the cake.

437
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,125
The girls are having
a pajama party!

438
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,125
It's like they're just rubbing
their youth in my face!

439
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,666
[PRINCIPAL]
Rino, after hearing that,

440
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,958
you really deserve this.

441
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,833
It's a yellow rose.

442
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,458
[PRINCIPAL] In flower
language it means jealousy.

443
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,583
[RINO] Well, they say
dumplings over flowers!

444
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,791
So load me up with
as many as ya got!
