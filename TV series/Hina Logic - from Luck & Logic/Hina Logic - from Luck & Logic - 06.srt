[KARIN] I thought this would be

Impressive.

[YAYOI]
Oh, yes, indeed.

You tend to get sleepy
when you're hot, right?

Oh, yes, indeed.

11
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,708
So tell me.
Did you like lunch today?

Oh, yes, indeed.

13
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,250
And you're good with doing
my summer homework for me?

14
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,833
You can do it yourself.

Aww.

[LINYA]
Sorry about all of this.

17

You came all the way out here

just when our air
conditioner broke down.

Oh! Please don't concern
yourself about that.

Everything's been perfect.

[LINYA] Yayoi, you are so polite
and have the best manners.

00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,916
I hope Lion picks
some of that up.

Where'd she go this time?

That girl better not
have run away to avoid

25

doing her homework again.

00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,250
[KARIN]
She didn't.

27
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,041
She went on a walk with Mahiro.

28
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,625
Is that right, Mistress?

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,958
Yes. Mahiro said something about
finishing off her free research.

30
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,958
I'm so glad she's studying.

31
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,000
But I wonder what part of the
country they're exploring.

[KARIN]
I don't know.

33
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,125
There's the beach.
Or the mountain.

00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,666
They're in the forest.

[LINYA]
When my Lion was a little girl,

38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,708
she was so sensitive
and a bit of a crybaby.

39
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,333
I couldn't help but spoil her

40
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,750
and she never wanted
to leave my side.

41
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,333
Really?

42
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,416
But after so many adventures in
the wilderness with her father,

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,250
she turned into quite
a wild little monkey.

44
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,333
For the most part,

45
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,125
I did my best to
homeschool her myself.

46
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,750
But the only things
at which she excelled

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,083
were camping and fishing.

48
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,875
I really hope she's not been
much of a bother to you all.

49
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,833
I assure you that she's not.

50
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,625
Rather, I would say that...

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,750
Her father's the one
who's been a real handful.

Yes, you're right.

I know he was.

55
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,541
That's why I made sure to
give him a proper punishment

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,791
when he returned.

57

That kind of fiasco
won't happen again.

Belle, can you sense
anything around here?

Well, they're not gonna let
us find them that easily.

Plus the Foreigner was witnessed
a pretty long time ago.

So there's a big probability
that it's already moved on.

turn out to be Belle's father

[MAHIRO] We don't have
any idea if Foreigners

ALCA hasn't shown much

anything about Belle?

202
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,750
Mm-hmm. I asked my mommy.

203
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,625
And she told me Belle
was her Covenanter

204

back when she was a Logicalist.

She said she'll tell me more
when I'm a little older.

Belle's like a cute furry

Isn't that right?

217
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,250
If you could somehow convince
Belle to Trance with you,

218
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,208
then you'd be able to see
what she really looks like.

[MAHIRO] She's in an
adaptive body right now.

221

to adapt to our planet's Logic.

On top of the castle
would be pretty good.

333

But stargazing is
best suited for an area

[MAHIRO] I always thought
it was really strange

that all these Foreigners
could come to Septpia,

370

but nobody had a clue
about how they normally

lived their lives back

I couldn't figure it out.

So as soon as I formed
my own covenant,

I asked my Foreigner

Those guys, am I right?

479
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,375
Always such a handful.
[laughs]

480
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,416
Yeah.

481
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,166
[STRAFANSKY]
I can explain this.

482
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,041
I heard from Lion's
teachers that some of them

483
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,458
were tired of being single.

484
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,583
So I organized a
little mixer for them.

485
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:34,666
I promise I was nothing
more than logistical support!

486
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,333
Please don't look
at me like that!

487
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,791
You've been the only
one I've thought about

488
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,083
since the day we met!

489
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,833
You're the most beautiful
and strongest woman

490
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,166
I've ever known.

491
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,000
I swear that I'll never have
eyes for anyone else

492
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,708
as long as I live!

493
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,000
[LINYA] It's not like I'm
really jealous or anything.

494
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,083
[STRAFANSKY]
That's good.
