[RINO] Everyone, the repairs
at the training grounds

have been completed.

You'll be able to use them again
starting tomorrow morning.

00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,875
Does that mean we can finally
take our practical exam?

While I'd like to give you
a gold star for your dedication,

I'm afraid not.

After all, the closing

[gasps]

That's disappointing.

Nah, we're better off
without that test anyway.

Now, Mahiro!

Pardon me, Miss Kagura.

[KAGURA] I have news regarding
the New Year's incident.

17
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,125
Since the entire class was
involved, I'll say it here.

[KAGURA] And Nina, please come
to the staff room after class.

[KAGURA]
For you.

00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,541
From Bureau Chief Veronica.

35
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,833
She wants to interview you
after the graduation ceremony.

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,583
Seems ALCA believes the
actions you took to save Lion

37
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,833
were quite admirable.

38

[NINA]
But that was--

00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,291
I assume you'll be going
back to your post at ALCA--

[RINO]
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,583
I shouldn't have
jumped to conclusions.

43
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,875
This is an important matter,
so take time to think it over.

[YAYOI] I declare a
state of emergency!

lower your voice just a little.

[YAYOI]
I can't!

47

Not when our Nina's
about to return to ALCA!

48
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,500
Well, actually,

49
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,250
it's more accurate to say that
she might be rejoining ALCA.

50
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,833
Nina was an active member.

51
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,958
You guys need to fill me in
on what's happening.

52
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,125
Well judging from her
conversation with the teachers

53
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,375
that we happened to overhear,

54
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,208
ALCA was quite impressed
with Nina rescuing Lion.

55
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,375
Obviously I don't know the story
on why she came to our school,

56
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,333
but shouldn't this be considered
as good news for her?

57
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,583
Indeed.

58
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,291
You're absolutely right.

59
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,583
Nina's reinstatement should be
looked at as a good thing.

60
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,833
But, it's just--

61
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,958
This is all just
so sudden, you know?

62
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,291
No denying that.

63
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,291
And if Nina goes
along with their plan,

64
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,375
she might not stay with us
'til graduation.

65
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,458
What? I don't wanna hear that,
you're making me sad.

66

It's very sad.

Great, now we have to
worry about her too.

81
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,041
Well, she is the one who
loves Nina the most, after all.

82
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,791
I wonder if Nina
has any intention of

83
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,625
staying enrolled at the academy.

84
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,583
I don't have any idea.

85
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,416
Of course, if she really does
want to return to work at ALCA,

86
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,583
then the issue is
out of our hands.

87
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,416
But, what if we could
somehow make Nina feel as if

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,583
she'd be better off staying here
and continuing her studies?

For what it's worth,

90

I'd be much happier if she
decided to stay at Pirari.

Here she is again!

169
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,583
And here's another one!

170
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,666

It's a Nina hallway!

Do you have any
good ideas, Mahiro?

175
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,208
It'd be a lie to say I don't.

Yeah.

187
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,166
Mahiro and Yayoi sure are
taking their time though.

188
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,916
I guess they are.

189
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,250
[YUKO]
I wonder what's holding them up.

190
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,166
[YAYOI] Gosh, why do you
always, always, always

191
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,166

strange devices?

192

[MAHIRO laughs]

193
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,375
Don't think you can simply
laugh this disaster off.

194
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
I can tell you're
not into our plans.

195
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,000
So you figured me out.

196
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,083
Why don't you care?

197
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,583
If going back to ALCA leads
to Nina fulfilling her dreams,

198
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,583
I think we should let her go.

199
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,458
Well of course we all
agree with you on that point.

200
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,791
That's why we're
carrying out these schemes

201
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,916
in such a roundabout way.

202
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,708
If I knew staying here
was the right thing,

203
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,291
I'd do everything
in my power to stop her.

204
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,583
And on top of that, I still
haven't had a chance

205
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,541
to beat Nina yet.

206
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,125
My plan had been
to settle things with her

207
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,375
during the winter
practical exams.

208
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,333
Well, in that case!

209
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,083
[knocking]

210
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,250
[NINA]
Come in.

211
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,583
Hey, Nina.

212
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,625
You wanna look at these
together? You should.

213
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,166
There's lots of
awesome shots of you!

214
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,583
[NINA]
Oh, so those pictures are yours?

215
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,500
Nope. I found them
in the hallway.

216
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,333
I wonder who they belong to.

217
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,291
I tried my best to find out,
but nobody knew whose they were.

218
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,333
Do you think it's
wrong of me to keep them?

219
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,875
If you can't find
the rightful owner,

220
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,041
then it's perfectly fine
for you to hold on to them.

221
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,750
Then that's what I'll do.

222
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,583
[LION] Wasn't the
Pirari Festival so much fun?

223
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,166
[NINA]
Yeah.

224
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,083
[LION] I should have nominated
you for the Miss Pirari Contest.

225
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,583
You didn't need to do that.

226
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,208
But you could've won.

227
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,333
That's not true 

228
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,916
Oh, c'mon.

I would've gotten picked.

[NINA] Remember how pretty
the cherry blossoms were?

232
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,958
You love cherry blossoms.

233
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
I do.

234
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,041
I thought the ones we saw that
day ware particularly beautiful.

235
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,833
Do you know the school has a
path lined with trees like that?

236
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,916
I love when they're
all in full bloom.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,708
It's kinda magical.

238
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,666
That does sound nice.

239
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,208
Guess you haven't gotten
the chance to see them?

240
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,791
No.

241
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
I was really surprised to find
you passed out on the walkway

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,541
on your first day of school.

Believe me, I was
super surprised too.

found you staring at me.

Good morning to you as well.

Wow. Isn't this a rare sight?

You never get out
of bed on your own.

251
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,625
I needed time to get pumped up
and prepped for later today.

Our great mistress is one thing!

But it's a terrible shame
getting beat by Mahiro!

254
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,958
So, you finally made it.

255
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,250
We're in the
preliminary rounds now.

256

Are you guys
serious about this?

Of course, we are.

And whoever wins
this next battle

to a championship match.

roll over and let you beat me.

Ready to go, Yuko?

322
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,416
Yup.

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
Excuse me, but are you two...

[YUKO giggles]

I was recently assigned
to the same ALCA office

326
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,625
as my dear friend, Mizuki.

00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
What a handful, huh?

Now take care, everyone.

[MIZUKI]
Wait a second.

330
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,208
I'm a handful?

331
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,708
Does that mean
you don't like me?

332
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,333
I just realized that I
haven't seen Lion today.

[STUDENTS chattering]

[LION]
Hey, Nina.

342
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,458
Why did you do this
to the cherry blossoms?

343
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,333
[LION]
Don't they make you happy?

344
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,416
You said these trees
were beautiful in bloom.

345
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,333
So, I wanted you
to see them again.

346
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,958
And that's because...
we'll be parting ways soon?

347
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,708
Yeah.

348
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,458
[NINA]
Because I'm going back to ALCA?

349

Yeah.

350
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,125
You know that's what
I've been working towards

351
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,875
this whole school year.

352
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,041
I wanted to go back.

353
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
I'm so sorry.

Mm-mm!

No, I'm fine. Remember?

356

And besides, I'm gonna
catch up to you in no time!

359
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,375
Well, maybe "no time"
is impossible.

360
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,083
So like, five years?

361
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,791
I guess it's actually gonna
take me a pretty long time.

362
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,875
But I'll get there eventually!

...how could I possibly leave?

This is where all my precious

[KAGURA] So we'll be in charge
of those kids again next year.

Agreed.

Septpia can be quite fun,

[BELLE squeaks]

[PRINCIPAL] Everything
in this world is in flux,

Yes, that's right.

Like a beautiful song coming
together, full of life.

390

It's the first time I've
ever seen cherry blossoms

at a graduation.

What's going to happen
during the entrance ceremony?

I imagine more pretty
flowers will be here.

a serious question?

what kind of Logicalist
do you want to be?

I've always wanted to be
one just like you, Nina.

And what exactly
do you mean by that?

anything different?

I'd like to continue down
the same path, for sure.

you changed your mind
about leaving us.

I told you girls yesterday
