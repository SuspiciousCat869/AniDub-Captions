2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,083
You ladies ready for class?

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,583
Mahiro.

4
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,416
Wake up this instant
or you're going to be late.

5
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,375
[MAHIRO snores]

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,916
Karin, Karen.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,958
On it.

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,083
No prob!

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,333
Look at this room!

10
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,666
It's a disgusting mess.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,250
[LION]
Good morning, Yayoi!

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,333
[YAYOI]
Lion!

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,041
Were you sleeping
up in the loft?

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,291
[LION]
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,166
But your bed's down here,
next to Mahir--

16
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,791
What a mess. You should put
this stuff away immediately.

17
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,000
No way!

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,458
We're having fun using
it as a big toy box!

19
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,541
Keeping your room nice and tidy
is part of the dorm rules.

20
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,291
I know it's not easy, but you
mustn't baby her like that.

21
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,583
[KARIN] Mistress, I think you do
quite a lot of babying yourself.

22
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,500
It's only for today,
and that's because

23
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,583
she absolutely cannot
be late to class.

24
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,125
An all-night cram
session is tough

25
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,416
even for a night owl like me.

26
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,875
[LION]
Cram session?

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,041
Yeah, we have to
take midterms today.

28
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,125
Really? What are those?

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,625
[LION]
They're tests? No!

30
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,666
[LION groans]

31
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,750
Hey, Lion, are you still alive?

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,000
[LION groans]

33
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,500
Well, There's nothing
you can do about it now,

34
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,833
so stop worrying.

35
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,458
Everything will be fine
as long as you don't fail.

36
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,666
And what's a fail?

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,458
A score below sixty percent.

38
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,666
[KARIN]
I don't think that helped.

39
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Well it's my fault
for not telling her

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,791
about the tests sooner.

41
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,791
It was out of your
hands, Mistress.

42
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,916
Don't forget she was out
like a light last night

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,166
after the hot bath.

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,125
And it's not like she really
could've done anything

45
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,708
with only one night to study.

46
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,000
She could've crammed with me.

47
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,875
You shouldn't get into the
habit of pulling all-nighters.

48
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,083
A good student needs to
study a little every day.

49
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,000
[stomach growls]

50
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,041
Lion, what are
you doing for lunch?

51
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,333
[LION]
I'm gonna buy food!

52
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,791
[LION] I barely knew any
of the stuff on that test.

53
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,708
But I tried hard to put
some kinda answer down.

54
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,750
[YUKO]
Pardon me.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,083
[LION]
Hi, Yuko.

56
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,041
What's wrong? You sad?

57
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,750
Now, dear.
Why are you so gloomy?

58
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,083
[LION]
Is it obvious?

59
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,291
It is, and I'm happy to
listen if you'd like to talk.

60
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,500
[LION]
Yuko!

61
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,000
Goodness gracious.

62
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,125
[MIZUKI] So you're worried
about how you scored

63
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,125
on the midterms then?

64
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,791
First years are so innocent.

65
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,625
But whatever the case may be...

66
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,958
All of Yuko's pillowy parts
belong to me and me alone.

67
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,416
You got that, girly?

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,083
Mizuki.

69
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,208
But she's cuddling you.

70
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,458
Lion, please don't
believe a single word

71
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,166
of that nonsense, okay?

72
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,833
[YUKO]
Say ah!

73
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,041
Ah!

74
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,916
Yummy!

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,041
[YUKO] Aww. You look so
much cuter when you smile.

76
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,750
[LION laughs]

77
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,875
--[MIZUKI] Oink! Oink! Oink!
--[LION] Oh! Oh! Ow!

78
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,916
Oink for me, little piggie!

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,166
Oink! Oink!

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,791
That's right. Good girl.

81
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,833
I like the obedient ones.

82
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,541
Leave her alone.

83
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,625
Whatevs.

84
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,000
I know you're just joking,

85
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,916
but a student council president
shouldn't be teasing

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,666
a first year.

87
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,250
You're the president?

88
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,416
Sure am.

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,041
Which makes me the
most important student

90
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,208
at this school.

91
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,708
Bow down to me.

92
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,458
[LION]
Ah...

93
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,583
Seriously?

94
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,666
[MIZUKI]
So we all hold positions.

95
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,833
I'm the student
council president.

96
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,500
Yuko's vice president,

97
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,500
Aoi's the treasurer, and
that's Ashley, the secretary.

98
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,041
--[AOI] A pleasure.
--[ASHLEY] Pleased to meet you.

99
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,583
[MIZUKI] Both of them
are transfer students.

100
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,083
What's that mean?

101
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,708
You really don't know?

102
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,416
They're both Logicalists
on active duty.

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Since we're at peace,
they came here.

104
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,750
[AOI chuckles]

105
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,750
I personally see
my time at this school

106
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,208
as a great opportunity
to retrain myself.

107
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,583
The library here
makes me so happy.

108
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,625
It's amazing how many
books and documents

109
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
from other worlds they have.

110
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,375
[MIZUKI]
Yes.

111
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,208
We're all grateful
for this world peace.

112
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,791
It's the reason
we finally have time

113
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,791
to relax over
some afternoon tea.

114
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,833
Huh? Is something wrong?

115
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,375
[LION]
Nina's one.

116
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,291
[YUKO]
Right.

117
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,833
She's a transfer
student as well.

118
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,000
I was thinking, it'd be so nice

119
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:40,250
if Nina liked it here too,
but she doesn't.

120
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,583
[YUKO]
I agree.

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,750
[RINO] Today, we're
doing a mock battle.

122
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,125
Lion, I just want you
watching for the time being.

123
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,166
Okay!

124
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,916
[YAYOI]
Qipao!

125
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,916
Shall we begin?

126
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,916
[QIPAO]
What will I do with you?

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,333
Now try your best.

128
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,833
Oh, wow!

129
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,083
How was that?

130
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,125
Did you enjoy watching
me Trance with Qipao?

131
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,416
[LION]
That was awesome!

132
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,000
[YAYOI]
But of course it was!

133
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,750
[NINA]
Amol. Lend me your strength!

134
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,166
[AMOL] Sure.
As long as I can be with you.

135
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,458
Mock battle, begin!

136
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,000
[YAYOI yells]

137
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,875
Look out!

138
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,500
She's not hurt?

139
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,541
Yes, of course.

140
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,041
There's no way
anyone can get hurt

141
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,458
fighting in this environment.

142
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,333
[RINO] Whoever removes their
opponent's shields first wins.

143
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,875
I'm curious.

144
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,291
Do you know why we carry
out these mock battles?

145
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,291
[LION]
To help us get stronger?

146
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,708
[RINO] It's so you
understand your own powers.

147
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,416
With these abilities,

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,250
you could easily hurt
people or destroy things

149
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,625
if you don't understand
how to control yourself.

150
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,958
Despite that,
the majority of countries

151
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,625
still allow Logicalists
and Foreigners

152
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,875
to move about freely
without any restrictions

153
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,291
on their Trances.

154
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,125
And why do you think
that's the case?

155
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,875
Is it because they're
all respectable and good?

156
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,125
[RINO]
You're close.

157
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,291
But the answer is
because Logicalists fought

158
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,791
against the bad Foreigners
and preserved peace

159
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,958
for everyone.

160
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,166
Many of your seniors
and good Foreigners

161
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,083
have worked hard to build
a relationship of trust.

162
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,125
Lion, I hope you'll
help protect that bond.

163
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,166
[LION]
I will!

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,416
[YAYOI yells]

165
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,375
[LION] Miss Fujisaki,
are you going to Trance today?

166
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,458
[RINO] There isn't a
reason why I should.

167
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,916
Aw, I really wanted to see that.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,375
[KAGURA]
Cut it out.

169
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,833
Try not to push your
teachers around too much.

170
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,708
[LION]
I wasn't trying to!

171
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,041
It's a fact that Logicalists'
powers gradually

172
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,416
start fading away
once they turn twenty.

173
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,208
And the statistics suggest that
it becomes nearly impossible

174
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,291
for someone to Trance
once they hit thirty.

175
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,541
So she would--

176
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,125
[BELLE squeaks]

177
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,416
[RINO]
What was that, Mahiro?

178
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,208
I can still Trance quite easily,
thank you very much.

179
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,875
[KAGURA]
Calm down, Fujisaki.

180
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,208
[RINO whimpers]

181
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,583
Lion, let's go.

182
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,958
We're ready for you.

183
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,666
Time to start your covenant.

184
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,083
[KAGURA]
All right, can you hear me?

185
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,875
--Uh-huh.
--[KAGURA] Take out your card.

186
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,625
Foreigner Cards connect
our world to others.

187
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,416
They open up a gate so
we can call Foreigners

188
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,875
over to Septpia.

189
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,833
And that gives us access
to Trance with each other.

190
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,583
Now we're going to
register the Foreigner

191
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,000
you're connected
with to that card.

192
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,666
Her name is Rosa.

193
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,583
Who's Rosa?

194
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,708
Yours is a rather
unique situation.

195
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,291
Apparently, you made
a covenant with her

196
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,208
when you were around
two years old.

197
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,458
[KAGURA]
This is our database.

198
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,541
We research Foreigners'
abilities and dispositions here.

199
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,541
And one can apply
for a covenant.

200
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,291
But once a covenant's made,
you can't apply for another.

201
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:39,375
If one's Logic doesn't
fit, it's refused.

202
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,625
[KAGURA] Normally, finding
a covenantor is difficult,

203
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,333
and it's the biggest
barrier for most Logicalists.

204
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,375
Rosa's not registered, is she?

205
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,708
Lion, look at your card.

206
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,875
Try calling her.

207
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,958
Um, Rosa?

208
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,041
You have to be more forceful.

209
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,875
Call from the heart.

210
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,416
You must truly wish for
your covenanter to answer.

211
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,583
Hey, Rosa.

212
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,833
Rosa!

213
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:22,541
[LION crying]

214
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,208
[LION] So you were that
woman on the beach?

215
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,333
Your cries echoed far,
and they still do.

216
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:36,000
I hear them in my heart.

217
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,208
Rosa, will you please let
me borrow your strength?

218
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,583
Pretty please!

219
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,000
I want nothing more
than to stay with Nina,

220
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,000
and with all the new friends
I've made at school.

221
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,166
[ROSA]
Did you really make friends?

222
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,458
Yeah!

223
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,083
Good. Be careful, my darling.

Gate Access! Monolium!

Thank you so much, Rosa!

227

[ROSA] Lion, whatever
your heart desires.

228
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,791
I did it!

229
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,541
The covenant with
Rosa's all wrapped up!

230
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,583
I see.

231
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,375
Nice.

232
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,291
Well, I suppose you'll need
to practice for a while now.

233
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,541
[LION]
I do!

Now that I'm done grading
your mathematics midterm,

00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,458
I'll be passing out the results.

I suppose that's fine.

Pirari Academy.

With your age in mind,

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,083
your actual enrollment
will begin this spring.

I don't understand.

I've already mastered all
the fundamental subjects.

252

[VERONICA]
Indeed.

253
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,375
I'm well aware that you have
the academic capabilities

254
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,958
of a university graduate,
and have even secured

contracts with
multiple Foreigners.

[NINA]
Then why?

What's the point of sending
me to a Logicalist

training camp when I
already know everything?

259
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,041
Because there's something
that you do not know.

00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,291
What's that?

261

Tell me.

understand you're still young.

[NINA] I'd appreciate
a more logical answer.

Are you just trying to
insinuate that I'm too weak?

In a certain way, yes.

However, I'm still
not convinced.

proven my strength to you,

Haven't the petals

Not all of 'em.

00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,750
my family being
praised by a princess.

323
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,958
Hey, Karin and Karen,

324
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,000
do you wanna see the
cherry blossoms with us?

325
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,666
We won't be able to join you.

326
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,250
Duty requires us to accompany
our mistress home.

327
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,958
Sorry, but you'll have to
enjoy the flowers without us.

328
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,708
Oh, that's okay.

329
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,375
The three of us can go together.

330
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,750
Sounds like a plan!

331
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,875
[NINA]
I never agreed to go with them.

332
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,666
Is this how I prove
my strength to Veronica?

333
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, my, it's Nina.

334
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,375
Good evening.

335
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,125
Do you mind if
I hop in there too?

336
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,791
Please do.

337
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,458
[YUKO sighs]

338
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,333
I heard you're going with Lion

339
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,291
to see the cherry
blossoms Saturday.

340
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,458
Maybe.

341
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,333
You should go and
have some fun for once.

342
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,541
I'll be sure to make a
delicious lunch just for you.

343
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,750
[YUKO chuckles]

344
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,208
That is so sweet.

345
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
You didn't have to do that!

346
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,000
[YUKO]
It's nothing.

347
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,416
I'm happy the weather looks
so good for your hike.

348
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Yeah!

349
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,666
Be safe and don't
go off the trail.

350
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,833
Sure!

351
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,541
We'll be back soon.

352
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,083
Nina, let loose
and have some fun.

353
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,875
I won't be gone that long.

354
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,041
So is there really a
shrine all the way up here?

355
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, it's a small little
place that doesn't get

356
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,583
a whole lot of visitors.

357
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,875
The patron god of the area has
a shrine closer to Pirari Town.

358
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,166
Look at this reaction!

359
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Watch out!
Something's close.

360
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,250
[BELLE squeaks]

361
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,583
Come on, guys.

362
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,041
It's not like my gadgets
really blow up that often.

363
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,208
[BELLE squeaks]

364
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,750
Belle thinks your
stuff is dangerous too!

365
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,916
[NINA]
With her track record,

366
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
she's due for an
explosion today.

367
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,791
[beeping]

368
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,375
It's headed right for us!

369
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,750
And the Paradox Level
is pretty freakin' high!

370
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,125
What? Really?

371
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,916
--I hope it's friendly.
--[MAHIRO] Oh, no.

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,041
[MAHIRO yells]

373
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,375
[LION]
I knew it.

374
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,458
These are safe to eat.

375
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:40,500
[LION humming]

376
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,916
She dances well.

377
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,125
She does.

378
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,416
[NINA]
So fluffy.

379
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,416
[LION]
Ah...

380
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,416
[NINA]
Beautiful.

381
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,916
This is so much fun!

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,625
[MAHIRO]
And the flowers are pretty,

383
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,916
but this lunch is beautiful!

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,125
What is that?

385
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,000
I asked Yuko to roll
up my favorite foods

386
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,375
into one rice ball.

387
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,625
Everything she makes is good,

388
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,708
but she really outdid
herself this time.

389
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,833
You wanna try a bite
of this yumminess?

390
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,666
No.

391
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,375
She made a lunch for me too.

392
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,916
[NINA]
So cute.

393
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,833
[NINA]
Uh, I can't move.

394
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,125
What a wasted Saturday.

395
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,958
I had planned on studying
and working on

396
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,458
my battle tactics.

397
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,875
She's kind of like a dog.

398
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,208
I guess doing this kind
of thing every so often

399
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,541
isn't too bad.

400
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,458
[KAGURA]
This year should be fun.

401
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,208
All my students are interesting.

402
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,541
[RINO] Ugh. She's always
either sleeping or drinking

403
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,625
on her time off,
but today she tells me

404
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,958
she's got other plans!

405
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,875
[KOZUE] It can get pretty lonely
when your drinking partner

406
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,916
bails on you.

407
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,083
[RINO]
Tell me about it!

408
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,666
And she didn't cancel
on me until after

409
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,416
I'd already bought her a drink.

410
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,333
[KOZUE] So what's her excuse
for not coming today?

411
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,750
[RINO]
She's out on a date.

412
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,041
[whines] I'm just gonna
drink it all myself!

413
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,500
[KOZUE] Do you know what
kind of guy she's out with?

414
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,375
[RINO]
A smart and sexy dreamboat,

415
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,875
and he's so sweet to her.

416
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,625
They get along so well
that there's no room

417
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,958
for me anymore!

418
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,875
[KOZUE] Is he rich?
How tall is he?

419
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,291
[RINO]
Well, he's taller than her.

420
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,916
And I don't know what
he does for a living,

421
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,291
but it seems like
he might be loaded.

422
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,583
[KOZUE]
He sounds like a catch!

423
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,875
I'd really like to meet him.

424
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,791
If possible,
we should set up a mixer!
