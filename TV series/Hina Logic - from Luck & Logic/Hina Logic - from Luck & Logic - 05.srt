Hello, Class S.

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,125
I hope you lovely maidens
are having a good morning.

Your favorite student

00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,166
Are you surprised?

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,500
Since exams are
so incredibly boring,

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,625
I wanted to get
you fired up for--

7
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,750
Final exams are given in
both the summer and winter.

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,916
Class S students are
also required to take

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,083
a practical exam that tests
their Logicalist aptitude.

10
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,416
And these results will
impact your career options

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,750
in the future.

12
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,916
So it's really important
that you listen carefully

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,416
and prepare for this test.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,083
Now, then,
here's your principal.

00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,458
This year, for our very
first Class S practical exam,

19
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,083
we have invited several
active-duty Logicalists

20
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,416
to be special guest examiners.

Watch closely during this test
and learn from their teamwork.

25
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,875
You will need to use
your collective skills

26
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,666
as Logicalists to pass.

27

[MIZUKI]
Vice Principal!

29
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,250
You're forgetting an extremely
important bit of information!

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,708
What? What'd I forget?

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,875
Everyone should remember to
wear their school swimsuit

32
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,166
under their gym uniform.
I repeat--

33

[YAYOI]
Question!

34
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,375
Just let me say this
before you ask questions.

35
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,333
Everything you heard in
that announcement is true.

to wear our swimsuits?

[LION]
Miss Fujisaki!

How are we supposed to prepare
if the exam is a secret?

40
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,833
[RINO] You personally
should look at Japanese,

41
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,375
mathematics, sociology, science.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,750
[RINO chuckles]
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,291
You meant for the practical.

44
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,041
The only way for you to
become a strong Logicalist

45
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,208
is to study everything.

46
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,541
Everything?

47
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,916
Yes. If you only focus
on your physical strength,

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you'll find yourself
off-balance.

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,333
You need to train your
heart and mind as well.

50
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,916
Oh. Okay.

51
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,375
[YAYOI] I made sure to spend
every moment of my spare time

52
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,291
studying for the written exam.

53
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,583
But I can't prepare myself
for the practical test

54
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,208
if I don't know what to expect.

55
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,250
[KARIN]
So, let's fix that.

56
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,750
Hey, Nina!

57
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,333
Do you know much
about the Logicalists

58
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,291
who'll be examining us?

59
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,750
I do.
They're very capable people.

60
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,458
Of course they are.

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,625
Do you think we have a
chance of beating them?

62
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,416
They said it's going to use
all of our collective skills.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,041
So I don't think it's gonna
be just a mock battle.

64
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,375
Well then.

65
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,166
I guess the best thing for
me to do is train more

66
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,625
so I can up my
grasp on the basics.

67

Don't worry, mistress,
you'll be just fine.

No matter what the subject
or which opponent

you have to take on, you
always rise to the occasion.

...having mock battles and
Trancing after school hours.

102

 And so have you, right?

103
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,250
Well, I just want to train
as much as possible.

104
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,500
[NINA]
Me too.

105
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,583
We take our written exam today,

106
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,208
so I had only planned on
working up a light sweat

107
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,375
this morning.

108
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,625
We may have just tied this race,

109
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,791
but I'll beat you
next time for sure.

110
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,291
You really must hate losing.

111
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,166
I won't deny that,

112
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,125
but I'm certain that I have
yet to reach my full potential.

113
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,416
And I still intend to place
first in the practical exam.

114
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,000
I may have been an active
duty Logicalist before this,

115
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,333
but my natural aptitude

116
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,041
is about the same as all
the other Class S students.

117
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,541
Maybe so, but you're still
hoping to come in first,

118
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,500
aren't you?

119
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,750
Of course.

120
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,291
But when it comes
to the practical exam,

121
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,541
there are several tough
opponents to beat.

122
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,708
Like Lion?

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,458
[NINA]
Certainly. And there's you.

124
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,416
[RINO] So everyone from
class is here, right?

125
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,166
We're not missing
anybody, are we?

We're here!

127
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,958
Okay. It's time for me
to explain the practical.

128
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,541
The exam rules are
pretty straightforward

129
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,958
since it's an obstacle course.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,833
You must hit three checkpoints.

131
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,750
The academy entrance bridge,

132
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,791
the tall, sheer cliff,
and the passageway.

133
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,583
Once you get past
these obstacles,

134
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,000
you'll reach the goal
at the principal's office.

135
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,416
More importantly...

136
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,791
Protect these survivors.

141
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,125
If your friend becomes injured,

142
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,500
or you're incapacitated,
you will be disqualified.

143

You're not allowed to hurt
your fellow classmates,

but other than that,
you're free to use

your powers
however you like.

146
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,416
Finally, you're only
allowed to Trance twice

147
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,833
during the exam.

148
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,625
Also, each Trance may only
last up to three minutes.

149
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,375
It would be very foolish
to Trance early on

150
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166

what trouble may lie

[STUDENT 5A]
And she's...

[STUDENT 5B]
Do we fight her?

Don't ask me.

Yay!

Okay then.

known no one would fight me.

Look at Karin.

She's already climbed
so high up.

This is a big problem.

Thank you, Lion.

I'm happy that my vines
got to you in time.

You really would've
hurt yourself falling

from this high up.

We're in a race--
why did you save me?

212

Heh. I saw you
were in danger,

213
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,875
so I just moved
without thinking.

What are you doing?

I must forfeit this

How come?

217
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,291
Because it's against the
exam rules to borrow strength

218
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,250
from another.

219

What do you mean?

221
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,541
Isn't the goal of
this whole test

222
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,250
to take our stuffed
animal friends safely

Your mission is
to safely deliver

these innocent bystanders
to the finish line.

Yes, you're right.

My judgment was clouded by a
profound misunderstanding.

It's fine.

any of the rules.

have been knocked out.

Next, we have Nina.

00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,250
And with Rosa's abilities,

324
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,250
I bet you're good
at supporting too.

325
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,291
Yeah.

326
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,125
Plus that plan
of yours was smart.

327
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,583
That's so nice,
but Yayoi's the one

328
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,833
who came up with the
winning plan, not me.

329
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,250
Yayoi's an awesome person.

330
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,541
She's super smart
and so reliable.

331
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,333
On top of that, she wakes
me up every morning.

332
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,416
Class representative, and, um...

333
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,333
Oh! And she wears
cute panda panties!

334
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,500
[YAYOI] That last point has
nothing to do with anything!

335
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,291
[GIRLS laughing]

336
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,916
But yeah, the only reason
I came in first place

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,625
was because of
Yayoi's big brain.

338
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,750
Come now, Lion.

339
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,250
I appreciate the compliments,

340
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,000
but you really need
to start recognizing

341
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,041
your own strengths.

342
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,458
--[LION] Huh?
--Look.

343
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,291
You should know that
I see you as a rival

344
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,208
that I will one day defeat.

345
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,416
You have a problem with that?

346
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,250
I'd rather just be friends.

347
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,041
I consider you a
friend and a rival.

348
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,416
That makes me happy!

349
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,291
[GIRLS laughing]

350
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,375
[LION]
A school festival?

351
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,000
[MAHIRO] Apparently, we open the
school up to the general public

352
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,583
so they can expand
their understanding

353
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,625
of both Logicalists
and Foreigners.

354
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,916
Oh.

355
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,416
[KAGURA]
Lion.

356
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,166
What now?

357
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,083
Keep holding the
mirror close to you.

358
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,500
Now close your eyes.

359
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,166
Can you describe how
it feels when you Trance

360
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,875
with Rosa?

361
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,833
[LION]
Like I'm calling out to her.

362
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,291
[KAGURA]
Okay. Imagine that feeling.

363
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,625
[KAGURA]
That's what I thought.

364
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,833
Open your eyes.

365
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,958
Oh, no.
Why's it all green now?

366
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,625
[KAGURA] This mirror's
purpose is to reveal

367
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:08,208
the inner heart
balance of the user.

368
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,750
Let me explain then.

369
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,000
A Trance is a state of
being where a Logicalist

370
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,625
and Foreigner each
share half their Logic.

371
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,208
Allowing them to become one.

372
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,666
In your case,

373
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,458
you empathize strongly with
the Foreigner's feelings,

374
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:26,083
giving away too much of
your Logic to that partner.

375
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,916
The green shows Monolium.

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,416
Which means...

377
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,708
You're reflecting how much
you entrust yourself to Rosa.

378
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,041
Is this bad?

379
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,541
Lion.

380
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,791
I wanted you to know that
you're in a dangerous position.

381
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,416
If you can't learn
to retain your own will,

382
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,833
it's very possible that
you could damage

383
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,041
both yourself and
your surroundings.

384
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,000
Nina!

385
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,166
[NINA]
Oh, Lion.

386
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,875
What brings you here?

387
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,291
Um, well...

388
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,583
Let's see.

389
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,708
Just stuff.

390
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,416
Are you heading back to
the dormitory now too?

391
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,333
I am! Let's walk together.

392
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,625
[LION]
I wonder what's for dinner.

393
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,000
I hope it's tuna.

394
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,208
That'd be nice.

395
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,291
[KOZUE]
Why do I even bother?

396
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,250
I knew that's how it'd go.

397
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,625
I was positive the group
date wouldn't turn out well.

398
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,250
And guess what?
I was right, as usual.

399
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,458
[RINO]
Yeah, it went south really fast.

400
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,000
[KAGURA] Are you talking
about that mixer?

401
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,291
[RINO]
It was a disaster!

402
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,916
They were all so fit,
but very weak.

403
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
--[KAGURA] What?
--[KOZUE] Exactly.

404
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,875
Honestly, I can't stand a guy
who's weaker than me.

405
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,500
[KAGURA]
What do you expect?

406
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,416
A normal human could never
be stronger than us, right?

407
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,291
[KOZUE] That's why I
prefer a smart gentleman!

408
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,250
Now's the era of hot guys.

409
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:45,708
But I want a really tall
one who makes lots of money!

410
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,166
You've sure got some high hopes.

411
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,333
[RINO]
But me,

412
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,041
I just wish I could find
someone like you.
