[CHLOE]
Good morning, everyone!

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,625
Chloe Maxwell here!

3
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,958
[YUKARI]
Thanks for tuning in!

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,583
I'm Yukari Nanahoshi.

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,833
And we here at the
PR department of ALCA

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,125
are bringing you the
latest Foreigner news!

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,166
[CHLOE]
Hey, Yukari.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,500
The weather's so
great this morning.

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,333
Doesn't it make you wanna
get out there and run?

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,375
[YUKARI laughs]
I know what you mean!

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,500
I wanna do laundry just so
I can dry my clothes outside.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,166
So if you have anything
that needs cleaning,

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,791
please bring it by my room.

14
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,875
[CHLOE]
Awesome!

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,625
Now it's time to
get down to business.

16
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,833
Let's kick this program off with
all the recent Foreigner news.

17
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,500
You've got that
covered, don't ya?

18
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,000
[YUKARI]
Right.

19
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,583
Today, there have been zero
Logicalist events reported.

20
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,083
Furthermore,
there's been no news

21
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,083
regarding Foreigner appearances
anywhere in Septpia.

22
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,625
[CHLOE]
Nothing interesting, huh?

23
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,291
[YUKARI] I'd say this peace
and quiet's been a great thing!

24
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,666
[CHLOE]
Oh, you're right.

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,750
I've been having fun in
my spare time, and besides,

26
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,416
there's all kinds of jobs you
can do with Logicalist powers

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,333
that don't involve
fighting Foreigners.

28
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,708
[CHLOE] And since there haven't
been any emergency missions

29
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,375
to deal with,
we've all had lots of time

30
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,875
to go out and play
with our friends!

31
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,958
[YUKARI] Now that's
what I call good news!

32
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,916
[CHLOE]
Yeah, but still...

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Okay, young lady!
You better wake up,

34
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,250
'cause we're
almost at your stop!

35
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,125
[STUDENTS]
Good morning, Yayoi.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,666
[YAYOI]
It is a good morning, isn't it?

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,541
[KARIN]
Mistress. I have news for you.

38
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,916
So what's going on, Karin?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,916
[KARIN] Are you aware
there's a new student

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,250
transferring into
our class this week?

41
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,791
Yes.

42
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,208
I've also heard that she's a
princess from a certain country.

43
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm really looking
forward to meeting her.

44
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,916
[KARIN] My sources say that
she'll be arriving shortly.

45
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,583
It's nice to see you're
so well-informed.

46
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,458
I consider it my duty
to research things

47
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,541
you may be interested
in, Mistress.

48
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,833
My sister makes me so proud!

49
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,250
A real princess.

50
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,166
I'm sure she's the perfect
example of someone

51
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,916
filled with grace and dignity.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,125
As a member of the
respected Tachibana household

53
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,541
and our class representative,

54
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,833
I'd better do my best
to greet her properly.

55
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,708
[MAHIRO]
It's here! It's here! It's here!

56
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,166
Check out this high
paradox level!

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,250
With readings like this, a
Foreigner's gotta be close by!

00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,291
[machine beeping]

59
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,541
It's over this way!

60
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,291
Huh? Get back here right
now or you're gonna be late

61
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,250
for class!

62
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,791
After her, Karin, Karen!

63
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,541
[KARIN] But Mistress, you
don't have time to chase her!

64
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,208
[YAYOI] I just can't stand by
and let a classmate be tardy!

65
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,833
[KAREN]
I'm right behind you!

66
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,333
[KARIN] My goodness.
You're just so soft-hearted.

67
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,416
Wait up!

It's... a girl?

Wow! It's Nina!

00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,750
It's so nice to meet you--

[NINA]
Was that enough food?

00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,375
Yup! Thank you!
It was super delicious!

00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,000
Can you tell me your name now?

You must be Liones Yelistratova.

Whoa! Amazing!
How did you know?

86
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,166
Because my teacher
told me you were coming.

She wanted me to escort
you to the staff room

to school, but you're...

So fluffy.

Thank you so much!

because my teacher told me to.

[RINO]
Welcome to Pirari Academy.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,583
This unique school provides
training for Logicalists

100
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,000
and is managed by the
Special Police Bureau ALCA.

101
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,583
[LION]
Okay, I got it!

102
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,833
My name is Rino Fujisaki.

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,666
I'm the assistant homeroom
teacher for your class.

How're you?

00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,875
I'm super excited
to finally be here.

106

It's a dream come true!

107
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,083
You get a gold star for
such an energetic answer!

108
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,791
Enthusiasm is a great
trait for a Logicalist.

109
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,208
I hope you focus it towards
using your power properly.

110

What's this?

111
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,833
[RINO]
It's called a Foreigner Card.

112
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,250
ALCA implemented this
new training system

113

last year after Tritomy
gave us the technology.

Oh, I get it now.

I'm positive she doesn't get it.

Don't worry, I'll explain
everything about it

Great, then we should head out.

If you have any questions,
please ask Miss Fujisaki.

Do you need something,

[KAGURA] Can you show her
around school after class?

Yes, it would be my pleasure.

Please allow me
to introduce myself

as the class representative,

to have you here. Welcome.

[STUDENTS laughing]

148
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,458
She seems like quite
an airhead, doesn't she?

149
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,666
Or maybe a princess
for the masses?

You mustn't say such
rude things about royalty.

151
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,041
Though I have to admit
she doesn't quite match

152
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,625
the image of the dignified
princess that I'd imagined.

But she's such
a little cutie pie!

have a lot in common.

Do you really think I'm cute?
That's sweet!

157
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,541
I'm pretty sure that's
not what she was implying

158
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,750
with that comment.

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,083
Looks like we have a little
bit of time before lunch.

160
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,875
And since we have
a new student today,

161
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,708
how about we all do
a quick simple review?

162
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
Yayoi, tell us what
a Logicalist is.

163
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,583
Yes. That's an easy one.

164
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,458
Logicalists are people
who make a covenant

165
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,541
with Foreigners
from other worlds.

166
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,166
And by entering a Trance
with one of those Foreigners,

167
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,708
they gain a number
of different powers.

168
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,541
[KAGURA]
Right.

169
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,791
What's their purpose?

170
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,333
To protect Septpia
from any evil Foreigners

171
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,958
that come here wishing
to do harm to this world.

172
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,083
Yep! Yep!

173
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,833
If I'd asked that
a year ago, yes.

174
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,000
But now that we've cleaned up
the Archdemon invasion,

175
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,000
everything's become
much more peaceful.

176
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,000
For the time being,
our world faces no threats

177
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,416
that compel us to fight anymore.

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,583
So, in that sense, you trainees
are nothing but a bother to us.

179
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,375
How are we a "bother?"

180
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,583
Well, you've all got six
years until graduation.

181

Use that time to think about it.

'Kay! I'll start right now!

183

[STUDENTS scream]

188

Huh?

189
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,833
This is your first
time going to school?

190
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,166
Yeah, it is!

191
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,916
My country is really small
and I was the only child

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,333
at the castle,
so there wasn't a school

193
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,541
for me to go to.

194
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,000
That's why I was so
nervous talking in front

195
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,416
of the entire class.

196
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,875
Well then.

197
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,333
How'd you study?

198
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,291
My mom took it upon herself
to teach me lots of stuff,

199
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,375
but I don't think studying
is really my thing.

200
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,708
Is something the matter, Belle?

201
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,416
So you call this creature Belle?

202
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,250
Do you know what
world she came from?

203
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,708
Perhaps it was Monolium
or Tetra-Heaven?

204
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,791
I haven't ever seen a Foreigner
with fur that shade of blue.

205
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,666
Mahiro, please leave her alone!

206
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,333
That poor thing
clearly doesn't like it.

207
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,541
[MAHIRO] Even though Belle isn't
able to speak our language,

208
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,500
it seems as though she can
understand what we're saying.

209
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,083
To be honest, I don't know
very much about her either.

210
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,625
But she's been a
member of our family

211
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,416
ever since I was a little baby.

212
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,583
Wait.

213
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
So you haven't made
a covenant with her?

214
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,125
There's no way Lion
should be in Class S

215
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,833
if she hasn't done that yet.

216
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,708
What are you talking about?

217
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,625
The only students
allowed to enter our class

218
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,250
are the ones who have
already made a covenant

219
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,291
with a Foreigner.

220
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,166
But what happens
if I don't have one?

221
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,166
More than likely the teachers
will send you to another class.

222
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,291
Oh, no!

223
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
But I was so happy
that they had put me

224
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,708
in the same class as Nina.

225
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,916
It's all good.

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,583
I'm sure everything'll
work out just fine.

227
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,958
You really think so?

228
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,416
It's irresponsible to get
her hopes up like that.

229
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,166
We need to talk with our
teachers about this first.

230
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,541
Oh.

231
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,916
[MAHIRO] Well, do you at
least have a Foreigner Card?

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I do have one!
This thing, right?

233
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,541
[KAREN] Yeah, but I've never
seen a completely blank one.

234
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,416
So everybody else's card
looks different from mine?

235
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,125
Yes, but it's
only your first day

236
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,041
and it just shows that you
haven't formed a covenant

237
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,083
with a Foreigner yet.

238

There's no need
to worry about it--

work itself out.

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,375
[RINO]
You guys!

320
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,625
I never thought she'd
be capable of trancing

321
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,750
with a blank Foreigner card.

322
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
She was behaving quite
dangerously as well.

323
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,583
I need to file a complaint
with the head office.

324
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,791
I know this new system
has only been in effect

325
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,583
for a short time,
but as long as we're using it,

326
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,958
I'll do my best to see
this doesn't happen again.

327
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,916
[PRINCIPAL]
Kozue, you're so devoted.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,083
It's my responsibility as an
educator to prevent accidents.

329
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,708
[PRINCIPAL] I believe the
commotion was limited.

330
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,000
Correct?

331
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,416
Those children are
bound by a deep bond

332
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,333
that few can understand.

333
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,750
There's no need for
greater action.

334
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,875
[LION]
I'm so happy!

335
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,166
I get to sleep in the
same dorm as you!

336
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,250
[laughs]

337
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,458
Uh, is everything okay, Nina?

338
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,791
It's pretty obvious you
already knew who I was

339
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,208
before you arrived at school.

340
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,750
Yeah, I saw you on TV.

341
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,583
But I never thought I'd
actually get to meet you

342
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,125
in real life.
It's like a dream come true!

343
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,500
Is that so?

344
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,833
The truth is

345
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,000
I've always kinda looked
up to you as a role model.

346
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,333
[LION] The thing I
want most in this world

347
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,916
is to be just like you
and have the strength

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,375
to fight off evil
while protecting people.

349
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,708
I also thought if
I ever got the chance

350
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,875
to be friends with someone,
it'd be with someone like you.

351
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,416
I've really always
felt that way, Nina!

352
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,166
Here's the thing.

354
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,000
I seriously don't plan
on staying at this school

355
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,583
for very much longer.

356
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,666
Why not?

357
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,041
My superiors ordered
me to come here,

358
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,583
but I want to return to ALCA
as soon as possible.

359
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,708
As you know,
I'm already a Logicalist.

360
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,416
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

361
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,541
You see...

362
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,208
Even if we were
to become friends--

363
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,583
[LION]
Everything will work out!

364
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,833
That's right!

365
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,916
You'll go back!

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,916
I believe in you, Nina!

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,666
I have to admit though
that the thought of us

368
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,041
parting ways so soon

369
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,833
makes me really sad
and depressed.

370
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,208
But hey!

371
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,708
It won't be too long before
I'm a real Logicalist

372
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,875
just like you!

373
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,333
Huh? What's wrong?

374
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,791
[NINA]
It's nothing.

375
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,916
C'mon, Liones. Let's go home.

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,958
[LION]
Okay.

377
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,583
[BELLE squeaks]

378
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,250
Nina. One more thing.

379
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,333
What is it?

380
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,083
[chuckles]

381
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,625
It's silly.

382
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,583
If you don't mind,

383
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,875
could you call me Lion?

384
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,041
Would that be okay?

385
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,375
Okay. Easy enough.

386
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,666
Lion it is.

387
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,500
I love you so much, Nina!

388
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,708
[LION screams]

389
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,916
[YUKO] Goodness gracious,
look at you two.

390
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,208
You're soaking wet.

391
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,291
[LION yelps]

392
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,333
Yes, an unforeseen
accident occurred.

393
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,708
Well, that's a shame.

394
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,416
Are you the new that student
I've been hearing about?

395
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,708
Yep, I'm Lion!

396
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,750
This is Belle!

397
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,708
[BELLE squeaks]

398
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,000
It's nice to meet you.

399
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,958
Welcome home, Lion and Belle.

400
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,541
This is my new home!
Thanks, uh...

401
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
Her name's Yuko.

402
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,333
She's in grade six,

403
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,291
and she happens to be
our resident advisor here

404
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,666
at Shirakaba Dorms.

405
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,708
Feel free to come get me
if you need anything, 'kay?

406
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,750
I'll make sure to
do just that, thanks!

407
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,958
Now first things first.

408
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,041
Let's get you over
to the baths ASAP!

409
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,375
It's kinda weird, but
Yuko reminds me of my mom.

410
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,375
Well, she likes things
to be clean and tidy

411
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,791
so you'd better
always keep yourself

412
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,458
and your room nice and neat.

413
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,041
Oh, I'll do my best.

414
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,916
[MAHIRO]
Are you two already in the bath?

415
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,583
Since it's a special occasion,
we should all bathe outside.

416
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,916
Outside?

417
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,125
[LION] I can't believe
you have a bath outside!

418
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,958
[MAHIRO]
Is that a rare thing?

419
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,750
[LION]
This is my first time.

420
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,750
[BELLE sighs]

421
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,250
[LION sighs]

422
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,916
Feels like heaven.

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,083
I take it you like it, then?

424
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,625
Oh, yeah!

425
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,958
I couldn't take a bath at all

426
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,625
when I was stowed
away on that ship.

427
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,750
It was miserable.

428
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,583
You stowed away?

429
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,708
[LION]
Yeah.

430
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,708
My dad was just so
against me leaving.

431
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,333
So I snuck onboard and hid
in the luggage compartment.

432
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,750
[KARIN]
What'd you do after you got off?

433
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,375
[LION] I hitchhiked the
rest of the way here.

434
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,583
[KAREN]
Oh. That sounds really fun!

435
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,375
Yeah!
It was super exciting!

436
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,875
I bet so!

437
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,833
It doesn't matter
if you had fun!

438
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,958
Your parents must be
worried sick about you now!

439
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,625
My mom knows about it.

440
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,375
When I heard a princess
was coming to school,

441
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,375
I never imagined
she'd be so wild.

442
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,708
[LION laughs]

443
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,416
That wasn't a compliment!

444
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,541
However, I'll say that
I find it quite admirable

445
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,291
you'd want to be
a Logicalist so badly

446
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,250
that you'd run away from home
in order to achieve your goal.

447
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,833
And now that I've
finally made it here,

448
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,416
nothing's gonna stop
me from studying

449
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,458
really, really hard

450
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,375
and becoming an
amazing Logicalist!

451
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,250
Well I don't plan
on slacking off either!

452
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,166
I'm going to study
so hard that I'll graduate

453
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,000
at the top of my class and
become a master Logicalist.

454
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,750
I'll become the
next chief of ALCA.

455
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,583
And I'll be right by her side!

456
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,875
Me, too!

457
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,375
That's awesome!

458
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,875
What about you, Mahiro?

459
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,291
[MAHIRO]
Whatever's fine.

460
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,625
[YAYOI] She has the talent
to be a great Logicalist,

461
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,625
but she seriously lacks
the desire to do so.

462
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,041
[MAHIRO] I'll be happy as long
as they let me do research

463
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,250
on Foreigners.

464
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,583
[KARIN]
All right.

465
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,666
I think that's a fine
dream for someone to have.

466
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,916
Let me know if you
find out anything out

467
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,291
about my Belle, okay?

468
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,083
[MAHIRO] So are you saying
that I have free range

469
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,541
to do whatever I want with her?

470
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,666
[BELLE squeaks]

471
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,250
[LION]
Hey, Nina!

472
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,083
I-I'm sorry!

473
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,208
[YAYOI] Nina actually has real
experience on the battlefield.

474
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,333
That's one way she's
different from all of us.

475
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,500
But I'm sure somebody
already filled you in on that.

476
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,208
Yeah. Someone did!

477
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,291
All right!

478
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,625
Let's go out there and
make our dreams come true!

479
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,333
[LION]
Wh-What's this?

480
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,416
There are two Ninas,
and now three.

481
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,583
Wow.

482
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,500
Why are there so many Ninas?

483
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,666
[NINA]
She stayed in too long.

484
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,041
[MAHIRO]
Yup, sure did.

485
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,708
[YAYOI]
Get her out of the water!

486
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,291
[KARIN]
Hey, are you okay, Lion?

487
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,041
[KAREN]
She's a boiled octopus!

488
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,416
[RINO] Kagura!
Will you please listen to me?

489
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,166
I heard that once
you're over 24

490
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,583
your skin just can't
repel water anymore!

491
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,791
I'm 24--
what should I do?

492
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,958
Because I tested this
theory out during my last bath.

493
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,500
And my body sucked
up all the water!

494
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,416
My skin's starting to
take a turn for the worse!

495
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,791
Man, I'd give anything
to be a teenager again

496
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,791
with that beautiful, clear skin!

497
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,375
But now look at me!

498
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,083
[KAGURA] Fujisaki.
I'm already 25.

499
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:00,916
[BELLE chuckles]
