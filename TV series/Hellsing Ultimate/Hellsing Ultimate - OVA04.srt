1
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:23,666
The despicable, smug little
smirk he wore on his face.

2
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:31,916
That dreadful laugh, his cheeks
puffing up for every cackle.

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,958
He looked nothing like any
Nazi SS officer I'd ever seen.

4
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,791
But at the time,
back in 1941, you,

5
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,458
as a member of the Vatican's
European General Directorate,

6
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:05,083
collaborated with this
man and his organization.

7
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,916
He was accountable
to no one but the Furher.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,708
You must understand, we were
forced into collaborating.

9
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,416
Yes, of course you were.

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,125
And so they set
their plans into motion.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,958
Their methods and desires

12
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,416
are ingrained in my
memory, my Master.

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,250
Well done, Alucard.

14
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,958
Her Majesty herself has called

15
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,750
for a gathering of
the round table.

16
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,291
Really? The Queen?

17
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,333
Return at once to
make your report.

18
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,708
Do not keep her waiting.

19
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,708
I'm on my way.

20
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,625
Integra... Did you enjoy
the thrill of declaring war?

21
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,625
Did you feel your blood rush? 

22
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,083
The warmth of hell's fires as
you ordered the slaughter?

23
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,708
Don't speak to me, you monster!

24
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,416
Now return immediately! Damn it!

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,458
What the hell is this, Major?

26
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,583
There's simply no way
I can tell you that, Colonel.

27
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,833
My orders are top secret, issued
personally by the late Führer.

28
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,541
Don't you dare take
that attitude with me!!

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,083
Why won't you turn us
into vampires? Why? Why!!!

30
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,250
Answer me you miserable swine!

31
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,250
That's enough back
talk from you, Colonel.

32
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,916
One more childish outburst and
I'll blow your fucking head off.

33
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,291
Major? What is this?

34
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,875
What task could be so great,

35
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,916
that it would require an
army of 1000 vampires?

36
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,500
The pudgy creature
spoke with a mad authority.

37
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,833
He was a man ready to command
the legions of Hell itself.

38
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,875
I intend to imbibe upon
the infinite pleasure of war.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,250
And so I shall
bring forth another.

40
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,166
And another war,
and again, and again.

41
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,208
This man's plans.

42
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,208
They called for the
creation of many vampires...

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:43,166
The Führers secret
"Last Battalion". How simple.

44
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,083
But you did more then
help fund the operation,

45
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,083
and you were more
than a mere pawn.

46
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:52,541
The title more suited to you
my friend, is collaborator.

47
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,083
You were forced to
cooperate? Ridiculous.

48
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,333
You asked him to turn you
into a vampire, didn't you?

49
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,208
It wasn't just me!

50
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,166
All of us! All of us
were forced to helped him!

51
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,500
They tricked me!

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:13,166
Help me, Maxwell!
Please, I'm begging you.

53
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:20,458
No. No way. It won't work.
It's impossible.

54
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,500
But getting home will
take an extra week by boat.

55
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,708
Private jet is out
of the question.

56
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,458
And we can't leave his
big box here, can we?

57
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,250
Within this "box" is
my own true kingdom.

58
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,000
It is where I was born,
and where I will die.

59
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,083
I've had enough! Anderson!

60
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,208
The Vatican has a small private
jet 13 kilometers north of here.

61
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,208
There's your release paper. 

62
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,458
Our people are expecting you.

63
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,875
So take it and get
the hell out of here

64
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,500
before I decide to
decapitate you again.

65
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,958
Amen.

66
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,458
We have returned
to you, my Master.

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,416
Well executed, my servant.

68
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,541
The Queen awaits you.
Remove your glasses.

69
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,166
It's been a very
long time, Vampire.

70
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,416
Come closer, let me look at you.

71
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,291
All these years, and you
haven't aged a day, Alucard.

72
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:02,666
Unfortunately, time's march
has not been as kind to me.

73
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,041
Can you believe how quickly
I became an old woman?

74
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,125
I still see the same
spirited young woman

75
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,083
I met 50 years ago,
your majesty.

76
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,750
In fact, to my eyes,
time has made you

77
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,208
even more beautiful,
your highness.

78
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,416
Proceed with
your report, Vampire.

79
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,625
Fifty-five years ago,
a deranged Nazi Major,

80
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,125
attempted to breed
a vampire army.

81
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,666
Walter and I laid
waste to their operation.

82
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,583
However, it seems they
simply refuse to die.

83
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,541
They've returned,
replenished their numbers,

84
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,541
and are ready to complete
their original mission.

85
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,000
That's what Millennium
truly is. The "Last Battalion".

86
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,416
I guess Mr. Tubalcain's filthy
blood must have given us away.

87
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,583
The Major sure blew that one.

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,333
Woah there.

89
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,833
I'm just the messenger.
I'm not here to fight anyone.

90
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,291
Explain this.

91
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,041
My deepest apologies ma'am.

92
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,500
I don't know how he
got past secrurity.

93
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,791
They are useless against me.
I'm everywhere, and nowhere.

94
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,458
He's only a child.
What is Millennium?

95
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,291
What are they after?

96
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,500
Stop it.

97
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,166
Guten tag.

98
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,458
Guten tag.

99
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,500
To the gathered representatives

100
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,291
of the Vatican
and Great Britain.

101
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,250
My commanding officer,
the glorious Major,

102
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,375
has a message for all of you.
Please attend carefully.

103
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,291
Uh... Oh...

104
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,416
What's going on?
There's no picture.

105
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,083
Major, stop this!
For god's sake please don't.

106
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,375
Warrant Officer Schrödinger,
the screen is not working!

107
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,833
Oh, hold on...
right there. That's good.

108
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,750
Help! Please help!
Please someone, you must-

109
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,000
Major, Looks like you've
really got your hands full.

110
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,833
No...Things are going well.

111
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,375
It feels as if a great weight
has finally been lifted

112
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,500
from my shoulders.
I'm feeling great, in fact.

113
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
Hello, Major.

114
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,250
Alucard, I'm so happy
to see you again.

115
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,583
It's really been far too long.

116
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,541
What is it that you want?

117
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,791
Oh, finally face to face

118
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,541
with the Fraulein herself,
Sir Integra Hellsing.

119
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,958
It's a pleasure to meet you.

120
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,833
What's the purpose of this?

121
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,333
What are you trying to
accomplish? Answer me!

122
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,750
The purpose?

123
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:24,250
What a silly question,
my beautiful Fräulein.

124
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,583
"Purpose"... how quaint.

125
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,833
To put it in the simplest
terms possible, Fräulein,

126
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:39,333
our purpose is a
total absence of purpose.

127
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,958
You should be aware, Fräulein,

128
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,666
that there are some
people in this world,

129
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,125
certain irredeemable louts,
for whom the means

130
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,625
does not require an end. 

131
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,000
I speak of course, of myself.

132
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,375
Be sure to eat every bite.
If he turns into a ghoul,

133
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,541
I will not be happy. No no...

134
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,541
Oh, wow! I didn't
think you're decision

135
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,000
would be that harsh, Major.

136
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,083
You've insane. All of you.

137
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,291
Did I just hear someone
from the Iscariot organization

138
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,958
questioning my sanity?

139
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,666
Then let me ask you,
if your God would allow

140
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,791
my madness to
flourish across the globe...

141
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,583
Then wouldn't it seem to
you that any God like that

142
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,000
would be just as mad as I?

143
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,416
We are the finest
of the Third Reich.

144
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,791
Do you have any idea how
many people we've killed?

145
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,541
I'm insane? What foolishness.

146
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,625
You didn't have any
objections fifty years ago.

147
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,958
But never mind that.

148
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:08,583
Try to stop me then, you
self-proclaimed "normal" people.

149
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:13,041
But unfortunately,
Iscariot is not my true enemy.

150
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:17,958
My true enemy is Britain,
the Hellsing's...

151
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,750
Well, really it's
that man laughing

152
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,625
in the corner back there.

153
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,791
A declaration of war.

154
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,666
Exellent. I can't wait
to destroy you again!

155
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,541
No matter what you do,
we will never give up.

156
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,958
We will reverse
this ridiculous situation

157
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,041
as many times as we have to.

158
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,333
Alucard, Seras, kill him.

159
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,333
Fine, Shoot the messenger
if this is what you've come to.

160
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
Auf wiedersehen mein Fräulein.

161
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,541
I look forward to meeting
you across the battlefield.

162
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,333
Alucard, Sir Hellsing...

163
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,166
Destroy them.
You have your orders.

164
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,708
At last Major, we have our
audience's undivided attention.

165
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,666
Doctor, Captain,
once I start my dance

166
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,708
I dance to the bitter end.

167
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,583
Enjoy it to the
fullest, Major...

168
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
You're so slow!

169
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,208
In the time it took you to
walk down one little hallway,

170
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,958
I went all the way to London,
got my head blown off,

171
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,625
and made it back. 

172
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,333
Perhaps you should
start thinking about

173
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,250
going on a diet, mein Major.

174
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,666
Oh I could never do that.

175
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,416
Show some respect warrant
Officer Schrödinger.

176
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,833
It's all right, Doctor.

177
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,958
My Warrant Officer has
succeeded in his mission.

178
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,541
Prepare for launch!
Engaging flaps!

179
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,791
Deus Ex Machina,
Commence launch!

180
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,875
This is a message

181
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,833
from the Commander of the
Last Battalion to all ships.

182
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,958
We are headed for
the heart of England,

183
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,125
to once again dominate
the skies of London.

184
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,458
Send up the beacon!

185
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,125
Our signal fire of defiance,

186
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,458
announcing our grand return
to this mortal world.

187
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,750

199
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,625
And so I have
acquired a pretty ship.

200
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor.

201
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,708
My bullet punishes
all without distinction.

202
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,500
Welcome aboard the Eagle Ma'am.

203
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,875
Everything is in order.

204
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,583
This ship and it's crew
are at Mellinium's disposal.

205
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,791
How does it feel,
My newly minted Captain?

206
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,041
To become a vampire, lead
a mutiny, murder your crew,

207
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,458
and commit high
treason all in one night?

208
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,333
I see.

209
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,416
How about condemning
your shipmates to hell,

210
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,250
doomed to walk the earth
as ghoulish rotting corpses?

211
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,416
What was that like?

212
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,666
Well...

213
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,250
Excellent work!

214
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,875
This is really amazing!

215
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,625
Millennium is happy to have to
go-getters like you on our team!

216
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,708
We couldn't have
done it without you!

217
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,000
and of course the Major!
He's so proud!

218
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,208
You definitely deserve
everything that's coming to you!

219
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,208
Well, I guess the only
thing left for you to do,

220
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,833
you dirty limey, is die.

221
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,958
The bitch set us up!

222
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,041
No... I only heard one shot.

223
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,708
That's impossible...
It can't be!

224
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,791
I'm the Huntress,
Rip Van Winkle.

225
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,791
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor,

226
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,666
my bullet punishes
all without distinction.

227
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:32,875
Whore!!

228
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Silly creature.

229
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,916
First Lieutenant.

230
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, you're up.

231
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,125
I ran out of paint
before I could finish,

232
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,458
so I had to improvise.

233
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,666
It was a bit drab up here,

234
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,875
so I though I should properly
christen our new ship.

235
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,125
Much more homey don't you think?

236
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,875
The German Third Reich's
Atlantic Naval Fleet

237
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,375
Flagship Adler...

238
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,000
is now commencing operations!

239
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,208
We keep killing them, and
they just keep coming back.

240
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,458
You have to at least give them
credit for their persistence.

241
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,125
Let them return as
many times as they please,

242
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,958
we'll just keep killing them.
It's that simple.

243
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,666
At least it's not just
the two of us anymore.

244
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,958
Nice to have a
new piece on the board.

245
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,041
Actually, I've been
meaning to ask you.

246
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,541
Yes?

247
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,833
Why did you turn
Seras into a vampire?

248
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,708
It just seems so
out of character.

249
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,916
You understand my concerns.

250
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,833
It wasn't my decision,
it was her's.

251
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,375
Have you met her family yet?

252
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,750
No. She's orphaned.

253
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,041
Of course she is.

254
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,125
Beneath that girlish
exterior lies a fascinating

255
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,458
and complicated creature.

256
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,708
Abandoned to a town of death.

257
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:35,083
Her coworkers transformed into
hungry, mocking visages of evil.

258
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,583
A sadistic vampire
hunting her down

259
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,416
with the intention
to rape and kill her.

260
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,000
It was as close to hell
as any mortal could imagine.

261
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,708
And what does she do?
What fate did she choose?

262
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,708
Giving up is what kills people.

263
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,375
Those who refuse to give up
are entitled their time

264
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,666
to trample upon the weak.

265
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,541
So now you're just waiting

266
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,625
for her to drink blood,
is that right?

267
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:07,125
Give it time. She'll drink.
Eventually, she'll drink.

268
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,041
Why do you refuse
to drink blood?

269
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:46,166
You're not human anymore.
It's time to accept it, Seras.

270
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,791
But, I... 

271
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,375
But, Sir Integra!

272
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,291
I cut my finger.

273
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:14,500
I don't want it to get
infected. Kiss it for me.

274
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,125
I just...

275
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,208
Do it. That's an order.

276
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,916
Good, Just be careful
not to bite Seras.

277
00:24:56,916 --> 00:25:01,291
There, a few drops
of pure virgin blood.

278
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,125
Do you feel any better?

279
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,541
Ohh...Yes... thank you.

280
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,833
Now gear up and
be ready for deployment.

281
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,041
We've lost contact with
the aircraft carrier "Eagle".

282
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,875
We're assuming it's Millennium.

283
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,958
Sir! Yes.

284
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,041
Yes sir. We're
bleeding information

285
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,875
to them like stuck pig.

286
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,625
The vampires have
had their agents try

287
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,333
to ambush me 4 times
since I got here.

288
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,500
They have informants
all across the world.

289
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:35,708
South America,
Great Britain, the Vatican.

290
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,291
They probably even
have an informant

291
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,208
it the round table conference.

292
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,750
Just stay alert Anderson,

293
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,125
and do not underestimate the
resourcefulness of this scum.

294
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,625
So now, the question
we have to ask ourselves

295
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,250
is: What is Mellenium's
next move going to be?

296
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,500
They have their
sights set on England.

297
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,750
Imagine that. It's
all turned out just

298
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,583
as you thought
it would, Maxwell.

299
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,625
You must be pleased.

300
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,125
Quite pleased.

301
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,458
And yet, there's something
distasteful about the situation

302
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,166
Then maybe you should
have shown a little backbone.

303
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,666
The pudgy little
maggot dared to call

304
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,125
our lord in heaven a madman!

305
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,708
He's not the least bit
interested in us.

306
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:23,291
He's focusing all his attention
on Hellsing and Alucard.

307
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,458
With that in mind
I thought actions

308
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,125
would speak louder then words.

309
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:34,333
Ah. I see. You're going to
prepare a surprise attack.

310
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:37,583
Exactly. When the
dust has settled,

311
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,375
we will be the ones
standing in the ring

312
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,958
with our fists raised high.

313
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,500
His Holiness, the Pope issued

314
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,041
the mobilization
order some time ago.

315
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,333
He's transferred control
over the Knights of Malta,

316
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,916
the Knights of St. Steven,

317
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,541
the Military Order of
Calatrava la Nueva,

318
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,541
the Knights of the
Sagely Brethren,

319
00:26:56,625 --> 00:27:00,166
and the Swiss Company
executive office to me.

320
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,541
The Vatican's Administration
of Holy Relics

321
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:06,291
3rd Division, Mathew,
has also gone into action.

322
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,666
Specialized anti-vampire
tactical armaments

323
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,333
are being prepared as we speak.

324
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,083
This almost feels
like a Crusade.

325
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,833
Yes. Exactly like a Crusade.

326
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,625
Only this time
we do not face Allah.

327
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:28,375
This time we hunt a war god.
This time, We! Face! Mars!

328
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:32,791
Destroy castle after castle.
Pillage town after town.

329
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:36,250
We will use their mangled
corpses and build monuments

330
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,041
to the price of such insolence. 

331
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,875
You are the instrument
of divine will, Anderson.

332
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:45,166
Return to headquarters by
whatever means you see fit.

333
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,458
Yes sir.

334
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,000
In the name of the
Father and the Holy Spirit.

335
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,083
Amen!

336
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,500
Mars!

337
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,250
Mars!

338
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,208
Mars... 

339
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,125
All right you bastards.

340
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:23,083
It's time you had a
taste of divine punishment.

341
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:43,000
Just thirty-six hours
and fifteen minutes.

342
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:47,750
Oh, I can't wait!
I just can't wait!

343
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,791
We lost communication

344
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,083
with the Aircraft Carrier
"Eagle" 18 hours ago.

345
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,708
She's currently anchored
approximately 300 kilometers off

346
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,000
the coast of Polinton Bay.

347
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,208
We've confirmed
she's flying their colors.

348
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,666
Millennium.

349
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,458
That's why I called you.

350
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:05,916
The situation has moved

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,958
far outside the
Royal Navy's jurisdiction.

352
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,125
What's the status?

353
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,166
Go on.

354
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,333
Sir.

355
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,333
As the General said,
we've lost contact.

356
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,500
The Eagle has ignored
all emergency hails.

357
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,458
However, Satellite
photos have revaeled

358
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,958
not only the Nazi emblem,
but the presence

359
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:27,291
of a lone individual on
deck, holding a parasol.

360
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,208
Two SAS platoons are
currently approaching

361
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,583
the Eagle via helicopter, in
order to asses out the situation

362
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,625
and hopefully bring
this to a resolution.

363
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,833
General...

364
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,333
Yes sir?

365
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,958
Those men are defenseless
against what's out there.

366
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:43,041
Cancel the operation and order
them to return immediately.

367
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,625
Both helicopters
have been shot down!

368
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,041
Did the Eagle open fire on them?

369
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:52,250
No sir. Someone fired
at them from the deck.

370
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,375
They reported a
single musket shot.

371
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,750
That's ridiculous!

372
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,666
I'm getting confirmation...

373
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,708
What will you do, Sir Integra?

374
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:10,000
We're under direct orders
from her Royal Highness.

375
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,791
We've determined this incident
to be the work of vampires

376
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,041
and will be assuming
operational jurisdiction.

377
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,083
What? 

378
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:23,000
There you are Sir Penwood.
Anything to add?

379
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:29,750
No Ma'am.
Good hunting, Sir Integra.

380
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,458
I'm handing over
control of this operation

381
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,583
to the Hellsing Organization.

382
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Good.

383
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:53,666
Good.

384
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,291
They aren't
launching any attacks

385
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,541
but they do open fire
when we approach.

386
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,958
It's textbook, Ma'am.
They're trying to lure us in.

387
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,083
That ship is literally
a floating fortress.

388
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't suppose we could
just ignore the damn thing...

389
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:10,041
How do we deal with
a ship full of ghouls?

390
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:15,333
Moving vampires across large
bodies of water is problematic.

391
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,458
The situation hiders their
movements and ours as well.

392
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,416
So what do we do
with our vampires?

393
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,958
We could try sending them
on our own battleship.

394
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,791
Would that work?

395
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,625
No. Between the
preparation and the voyage,

396
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,958
it would take far too long
and we can't count

397
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,500
on them to stay put.

398
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,458
Perhaps a faster vessel?

399
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,875
Walter,

400
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,625
they have high caliber
anti-aircraft and Gatling guns.

401
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:47,208
A speed boat would be
lost in a hail of bullets.

402
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:49,000
What about dropping
them in from above?

403
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:53,333
No. The eagle is well stocked
with anti-aircraft ordinance,

404
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,375
we couldn't get a
plane anywhere near.

405
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,666
Perhaps an airplane
with a lot of decoy chaff.

406
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,833
No. They still won't fool
those damn magic bullets.

407
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:16,000
What you're saying is, against
their stockpiles of missiles

408
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,791
and magic bullets, your
only hope is to find a way

409
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:24,416
to get me onto the flight deck
of that ship. Isn't that right?

410
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,458
It may not be possible.

411
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,583
Wait... It's brilliant.

412
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,500
I know an aircraft that
can get you on board.

413
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,958
However, I think there may
be only one in existence.

00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:06,500
It's him... Please no... God!

425
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,791
There's something
coming, on radar.

426
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,000
It's not possible...
it's speed is Mach 2.8.

427
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,750
Altitude, 85,000!

428
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,083
That high? What is it?

429
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:19,041
SR71. it's just a
reconnaissance craft.

430
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,500
It's him!

431
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,708
Report! First Lieutenant,
what do you see out there?

432
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:29,666
It's him! It's the Madness.

433
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,833
I hear him... He's come for me!

434
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,791
He charges his prey upon
a steed of black iron,

435
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,458
the stench of death
left standing in his wake.

436
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,000
Sitr, he's diving!

437
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,458
My god... He's going to ram us.

438
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,333
Engines to full!
Evasive maneuvers!

439
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,750
Get us out of the way!

440
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,458
Fire the guns!

441
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,166
I hear a voice calling me...

442
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,625
I hear a voice, he says
he's coming for me...

443
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:08,416
Cromwell restrictions,
3, 2, 1, released.

444
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,708
Soon, the light
of day will be lost.

445
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,333
Fate has brought you to this.

446
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,916
Goodbye. How sad
the hunters spirit,

447
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,833
for my heart will
not cease to tremble.

448
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,291
First Lieutenant Rip Van Winkle,

449
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,875
do you know how
Der Freischütz ends?

450
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:48,375
Kaspar, having trifled with
the Black Huntsman, Zamiel,

451
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:52,000
is whisked away
to hell for his sins.

452
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:56,000
His corpse is then thrown
into the bottom of a ravine,

453
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,750
to be eaten by wolves. 

454
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,083
Prepare yourself,
First Lieutenant.

455
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,833
For now Zamiel
comes to collect you.

456
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:20,166
Those who dare
impersonate the dead

457
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,083
are judged to join their ranks!

458
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,625
Kill it!

459
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,291
We have to hold
out a while longer!

460
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,041
It still isn't time yet!

461
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,583
It's a monster! 

462
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,041
Shoot! Shoot till you're empty!

463
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,000
Die Granate!
Throw the grenades!

464
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,625
Oh my God!

465
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,875
What in the hell are you?

466
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,291
Prepare yourself,
First Lieutenant.

467
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:41,125
What will you do in
the presence of Zamiel?

468
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,958
What will you do...

469
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,750
...Rip Van Winkle?

470
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:14,166
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor,
my bullet punishes all...

471
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,208
without distinction.

472
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,416
Again!

473
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,000
Again! Again!

474
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,291
Again! Again!

475
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,791
Now die and go to hell!

476
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,000
Guess what I just caught.

477
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:22,000
I just caught you.
Rip, Van, Winkle...

478
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:11,875
Well done, First Lieutenant.
The operation was a success.

479
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,958
No matter how many
stones you cast upon

480
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:17,625
the water's surface,
no matter how many times

481
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,583
you stomp your boots
upon the creeping shadows,

482
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:23,625
they will never
submit to your will.

483
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,125
That is the river of death.

484
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,958
Life and death, when viewed
with the proper perspective,

485
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,291
are really just one big hoax.

486
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,666
Immortal, invincible,
undefeated, and almighty.

487
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,791
It's ludicrous.

488
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,500
But we can cast light
upon the shadow.

489
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:47,833
We can and will
find the tide changing.

490
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:51,750
Through your sacrifice we will
bring Alucard to submission.

491
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,166
Wait.

492
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,666
Let's not be too hasty
with our options, Doctor.

493
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,958
She fulfilled her mission.
Absolutely perfectly.

494
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,625
She deserves
to have a hunter's death.

495
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,625
How generous Major.

496
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:20,875
Achtung. Auf Wiedersehen.

497
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:27,166
I'll see you in Valhalla,
First Lieutenant.

498
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,875
Auf Wiedersehen.

499
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,291
Auf Wiedersehen.

500
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,541
Auf Wiedersehen.

501
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,708
Auf Wiedersehen, Frau Winkle.

502
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,083
Sieg Heil.

503
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,625
Are you having fun, Alucard?

504
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:30,166
War should be fun, after all.

505
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,625
So sing the
battle hymn, Alucard.

506
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,500
And watch as my works unfold.

507
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:37,583
I can see it.

508
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:41,208
I can see it even
through thick spectacles...

509
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:47,208
The city's lights...
Its Hawksmoore steeples...

510
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:51,875
Hear my battle hymn, Alucard.

511
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:55,708
And watch the collapse
of the British Empire.

512
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:04,541
My friends, It has often
been said that I like war.

513
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
My friends... I like war.

514
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:14,041
No. My friends... I love war.

515
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,166
I love holocausts.

516
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,750
I love Blitzkreigs.

517
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,666
I love defensive lines.

518
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,916
I love sieges, charges.

519
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,625
I love mop-up
operations and retreats.

520
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,750
Wars across prairies,
in streets, in trenches,

521
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:32,208
on grasslands, in frozen
tundra, through deserts,

522
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,666
on the sea, in the air...

523
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,541
I love every act of war that
can occur upon this earth.

524
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,125
I love blasting the
enemy to smithereens

525
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,250
with artillery salvos

526
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,750
that thunder across
the lines of battle.

527
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,958
My heart leaps with
joy whenever a soldier

528
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:51,125
is tossed high into the
air and cut to pieces

529
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,416
by well placed sniper rounds!

530
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,208
and there is nothing
like a tank operator

531
00:48:56,291 --> 00:49:00,541
using a Tiegel Acht-acht
to destroy enemy tanks.

532
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,416
And the feeling that comes
when a soldier runs screaming

533
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,750
from his blazing tank,
only to be mowed down

534
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:11,166
by heavy machine gun fire,
is such an exquisite feeling.

535
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,708
Like when ranks of infantry
brandish their bayonets

536
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,500
rushing into the enemy lines.

537
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,708
It moves me deep
within my heart to watch,

538
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,791
a fresh recruit stabbing over
and over into the bloated chest

539
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,708
of a long dead enemy.

540
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:30,458
The sight of deserters
being strung up

541
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:34,000
from a street lamp is
an irresistible pleasure.

542
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,875
And there is nothing more
arousing, then the sounds

543
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:40,208
made by prisoners of
war dropping like flies,

544
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,500
screaming in agony
as they're mowed down

545
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,958
by ear-piercing Schmeissers.

546
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:49,000
When a band of pitiful
resistance fighters make

547
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:51,875
their final stand with
nothing but small arms

548
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,500
only to have their city
smashed to atoms block by block

549
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:59,416
by 4.8 ton bombshells,
I am in ecstasy.

550
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,583
I love it when
my forces are ravaged

551
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,416
by a Russian armored division.

552
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,916
It's so sad to see
towns and villages

553
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,291
that were supposed to
be defended at all costs

554
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,041
being laid to waste, their women

555
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,416
and children
being raped and killed.

556
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,000
I love to be
squashed under the heel

557
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:21,000
of the British and
American War Machine.

558
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:24,750
Oh the humiliation as my men
crawl around like vermin,

559
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:28,291
ducking the Jagdbomers
flying overhead.

560
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:37,375
Gentlemen,
all I ask for is war...

561
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:41,375
War so grand as to
make Hell itself tremble.

562
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:45,375
Gentlemen... I ask you
as fellow brothers in arms

563
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,416
what is that you really want?

564
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,958
Do you wish for
further war as I do?

565
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:54,458
Do you wish for a
merciless fucking war?

566
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:59,500
A war whose fury is built with
iron and lightning and fire?

567
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,916
Do you ask for war to
sweep in like a tempest,

568
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,833
leaving not even ravens
to scavenge from the earth?

569
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:19,583
Krieg! Krieg! Krieg! Krieg!
Krieg! Krieg! Krieg! Krieg!

570
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:20,625
Very well.

571
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,208
Then krieg is
what you shall have.

572
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:26,875
We are a clenched fist,
ready to strike down all

573
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,791
who oppose us with our might.

574
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,791
But, after enduring over
half a century wallowing

575
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:38,166
in the darkness, for us,
a simple, ordinary war

576
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,291
will no longer be sufficient.

577
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,666
We need a massive war!

578
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,250
A war beyond any other that
man's history has ever known!

579
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:50,583
We are but a single battalion...

580
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,708
The remnants of a
defeated army numbering

581
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,458
less than a thousand strong.

582
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,791
However, I believe that
each of you old warriors

583
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:02,375
is equal to a thousand of
their sickly soft children.

584
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:05,250
We represent a force
that could easily defeat

585
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,750
an army of one million
and one men.

586
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,041
It is time for them to awake,

587
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,500
the ones who sent us
screaming into oblivion

588
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,833
and who now lie sleeping.

589
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:17,333
Let's drag them out
of bed by the hair,

590
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:20,000
and remind them of what we are!

591
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:23,916
We will remind them of what
it feels like to live in fear.

592
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,583
We will remind them of
the sound our jack boots

593
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,958
make against their throats!

594
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,500
We will remind them
that there are more things

595
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:57,750
between heaven and hell then are
dreamt of in their philosophy.

596
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:01,500
Ja Europe! We see
the light of Europe!

597
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:07,500
Our Kampfgruppe of
one thousand vampires

598
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,416
is going to burn this
world down to ash.

599
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:17,166
Yes my friends. Soon
Europe's charred remains

600
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,458
will illuminate the night sky!

601
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:28,750
I have brought you all back
just as I promised I would!

602
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,583
Back to our
favorite battlefield!

603
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,541
Back to our beloved war!

604
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,750
Major!

605
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:36,875
Sturmbannfuhrer!

606
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,583
Battalion Commander!

607
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:39,458
Major!

608
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,791
Sturmbannfuhrer!

609
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,458
Battalion Commander!

610
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,458
Major!

611
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,083
Sturmbannfuhrer!

612
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:49,500
At last, the sea lion
has crossed the ocean

613
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,958
and is heading up the hill!

614
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,583
Attention all soldiers of
the Millennium Battalion,

615
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,666
this is a message
from your commander.

616
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,125
Friends...

617
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:10,333
...let's bring them hell.
