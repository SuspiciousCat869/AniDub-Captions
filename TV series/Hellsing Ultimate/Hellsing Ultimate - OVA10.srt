1
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,291
[ARUCARD] Sounds like
they're really going at it.

2
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,333
Tearing through Nazis...

3
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,041
Master and servant.

4
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,875
[ARUCARD] Look at what your
beloved Major has wrought.

5
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,791
Tell me, Walter...

6
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,208
Any last requests?!

7
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,208
The carnage is reaching
its crescendo...

8
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,166
It's time for Hellsing
to take center stage!

9
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,416
[SS SOLDIER E]
What took you so long?

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,583
Strike me down,
Frauline...

11
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,791
You do me a kindness!

12
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,166
[INTEGRA] They all
die with a smile.

13
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,333
They smile because death

14
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,666
is what they
came here to obtain.

15
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,041
[SERAS] If they wanted
it so damn badly...

16
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,916
they should've
staked themselves

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Or jumped into
a fire!

18
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,041
Or maybe not
become vampires at all!

19
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,458
[intercom]

20
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,250
[MAJOR] You make it sound
so simple, little girl...

21
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,625
Would that it were...

22
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,833
But you see...

23
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,041
mere death means
absolutely nothing to us...

24
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,666
I blush to admit it,

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,375
but we've painted ourselves
into a bit of a corner.

26
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,666
For all of our
successes this night,

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,833
we are relics
of a bygone age.

28
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,833
"Never again," they cried,

29
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,583
pushing us out of mind,

30
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,833
denying us our legacy.

31
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,583
But none of
us are eager to die...

32
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,583
None of us want our
existence to simply stop...

33
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,666
like a watch no one will
bother to wind up...

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,125
That would be pointless!

35
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,041
If we are to die,
it must be a battle

36
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,750
that shakes the very
timbers of Valhalla!

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,750
And nothing less...

38
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,000
[MAJOR] That is what
brought us here...

39
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,500
The scent of
a worthy fight!

40
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,375
[Seras gasps]

41
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,166
[MAJOR] We are
starving, you see.

42
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,625
But nothing fills us...

43
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,541
Nothing sates
this appetite...

44
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,708
The good people of
London were just a snack!

45
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,875
The world is a big place...

46
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,916
And a man might murder his

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,541
neighbor for a
multitude of reasons.

48
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,583
Mein Gott, the potential!

49
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,583
There is
pleasure in a rout,

50
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,000
but a true warrior
must find a worthy foe,

51
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,000
even if it takes
him half a century.

52
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:35,916
[MAJOR] For us to die,

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,500
there must be
sturm und drang

54
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,333
like the world has
never dared imagine!

55
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,708
[MAJOR] Otherwise...

56
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,666
we are like the crew of
Wagner's Flying Dutchman...

57
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,291
drifting forever...

58
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,458
That is what
you mean to us...

59
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,416
Our last chance
to come ashore!

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,916
[MAJOR] I tip my hat
to you, Hellsing!

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,333
Thou Royal Order of
Protestant Knights!

62
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,375
You are wundebar, truly...

63
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,583
You bring us
something precious...

64
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,541
Victory, or death...

65
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,708
Which one, 
I do not know...

66
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,125
but it will be sublime!

67
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,583
Master Integra...

68
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,333
you need to
go on ahead.

69
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,500
Seras!

70
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,416
[SERAS]
Find him...

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
and skewer
that little toad!

72
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,333
Every word...

73
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,916
out of his mouth
is like poison...

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,166
If I have to keep
hearing it I'll go mad!

75
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,791
 All right...

76
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,375
But don't you die.

77
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,416
That I would
never forgive.

78
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,833
[INTEGRA] Such a good dog...

79
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,458
[INTEGRA]
Now play dead.

80
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,916
[growling]

81
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,125
[ARUCARD] 
This game you play

82
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,458
is high-stakes, Walter...

83
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,000
And you're all in.

84
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,208
You don't
have a single

85
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,375
face card to
your name, do you?

86
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,666
You know how fiercesome

87
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,000
my master can be...

88
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,416
And the girl is nothing
to scoff at either...

89
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,000
[ARUCARD]
And as for me...

90
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm going to tear you apart.

91
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,791
It's going to be messy...

92
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,916
And if you think I'll give
you a fighting chance,

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,666
think again!

94
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,500
You're just a traitor...!

95
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,708
And traitors...

96
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,750
die ignominious deaths...

97
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
Always!

98
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,416
[ARUCARD] All through
my life, and my undeath,

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,041
I've always held turncoats
in the highest contempt.

100
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,083
Don't tell me you're
so naïve as to think...

101
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,083
that after
all you've done

102
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,541
you still
deserve a fair fight.

103
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,125
I'll make your death
a quick one...

104
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,000
Besides... I'm famished.

105
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,791
[Arucard laughs]

106
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,000
[ARUCARD]
You know...

107
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,791
this much blood might
even be too much for me!

108
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,458
[DOC] It seems
everything is proceeding

109
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,500
exactly as planned, Major.

110
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,583
[MAJOR] All variables
are falling dutifully

111
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,833
into place, Doctor...

112
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
He is rebuilding
his castle

113
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,041
brick by bloody brick.

114
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,083
Sieg gehort jetzt mir.

115
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,791
[MAJOR] He wears
the guise of a man,

116
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,875
but I never thought
of him as one...

117
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,208
Or even as a vampire,
for that matter...

118
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,750
[MAJOR] He is king
and castle both...

119
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,166
His dominion:
the River Styx.

120
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,458
The untold dead he's
drowned in it: his subjects.

121
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,375
"What cost, victory?"...

122
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,541
"What ploy will
leave him in the dust?"

123
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,833
These questions run
through my mind

124
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,375
every waking moment...

125
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,041
Thoughts of him even
invade my dreams,

126
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,416
leaveing me crying
out for bloodshed.

127
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,333
And now, at long last,

128
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,958
our war has dawned!

129
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,041
[MAJOR] I bring all
that I am to this fight,

130
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,791
body and soul...
But is it enough?

131
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,666
How do our
arsenals compare?

132
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,541
[MAJOR] He can
change form...

133
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,125
summon familiars...

134
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,583
bend men to his will...

135
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,458
and the taste
of human blood

136
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,583
brings him life anew...

137
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,875
And these powers,
he can call upon

138
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,541
as quickly as a man
might blink!

139
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,125
[MAJOR] But I take
the stage with nothing.

140
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,333
Why, you ask...?

141
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,250
Because I am
a human being.

142
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,500
To be a vampire...

143
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,458
To taste life eternal

144
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,458
and wage war throughout
the centuries.

145
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,333
What a perfect existence!

146
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,166
[MAJOR] But that is
a bridge too far...

147
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,833
I cannot embrace undeath!

148
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,083
[RUSSIAN SOLDIER A]
Not so high and mighty now,

149
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,958
are you?

150
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,416
[RUSSIAN SOLDIER B] And now
join your troops in hell.

151
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,333
[MAJOR] Vampirism
is brilliant...

152
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,500
One can quaff another's soul
like a vintage Eiswein

153
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,958
and steal everything
that defines them!

154
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,916
[MAJOR] Begone!

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,458
[MAJOR] Mein Herz, 
meina Seele, mein Leben!

156
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,625
They belong to me!

157
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,250
Sharing one's life with
another and they with you,

158
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,166
losing the borders
of one's self

159
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,958
in a great sanguine sea...

160
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:53,666
[MAJOR] To gain by losing,
what a delicious irony.

161
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,583
It is the bliss of
acquiencence.

162
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,750
It is the bliss
of surrender!

163
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,291
[MAJOR] And so I say
to hell with you...!

164
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,916
What's mine
is mine alone!

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,583
Every hair...
every drop of blood...

166
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:19,083
I am me!

167
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,291
[MAJOR] You are
ruin made flesh.

168
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,375
Made beautiful.

169
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,958
You are loved.

170
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,083
And so, I despise you.

171
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,541
[MAJOR] That is why
you are my foe,

172
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,708
mein dazzling Count...

173
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,541
You are that most
precious thing,

174
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,166
a worthy opponent.

175
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,916
An archenemy, A king
upon which to wage war!

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,833
[MAJOR] What you call
victories are nothing more

177
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,250
than the opening salvos

178
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,291
of a battle 50 years
in the making!

179
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,625
Meow.

180
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,000
[snap]

181
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,208
[MAJOR] Our decades
of preparation...

182
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,541
They were all
for this moment.

183
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,458
[MAJOR] The Last Battalion,
the Ninth Crusade,

184
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,250
Father Anderson,
The faithful Captain,

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,500
and duplisitous Walter.

186
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,625
All of them were steps
leading to the pyre

187
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,666
upon which Arucard will burn!

188
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,250
[MAJOR] He has
no choice but to release

189
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,541
his finale restriction,
and set loose his true form...

190
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,625
At last, he'll stand alone

191
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,333
atop the battlements!

192
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,250
Would it be Anderson
who dispatches him,

193
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
or Walter who carries the day?

194
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:39,250
I think he'll
destroy them both.

195
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,958
[MAJOR] He is less than a man,
but also much more...

196
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:49,166
A century ago, his reign of
terror paralyzed London...

197
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,500
Five hundred years ago,
he held back the Ottoman Empire.

198
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,666
[MAJOR] If that great river
of blood meets his lips,

199
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,291
the game is lost...

200
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,291
He'll knock aside
the chessboard

201
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,416
like a pentulant child...

202
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Life and death,
he's cheated

203
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,708
them both for centuries!

204
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,958
[MAJOR] How does
one go about slaying

205
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,166
such a force of nature?

206
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,666
Do you cut through
wave after wave

207
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,666
of thralls on the battlefield
and take his head

208
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,625
like one of the Teutonic
Knights of old...?

209
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,625
[MAJOR] Nein!

210
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,125
[MAJOR]
He'll simply summon

211
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,083
more of his stolen blood...

212
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,791
But that could
work in my favor...

213
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,083
Because, my enemy's
greatest strength

214
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,708
is also his
Achilles heel...

215
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,125
Tyrants have always

216
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,583
been especially
susceptible to poison.

217
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,750
[growling]

218
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
[SERAS] I can't.

219
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,708
He's too strong.

220
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,958
[SERAS] I'm sorry.

221
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,250
Master...

222
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,000
[PIP] Laying
down on the job?

223
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,458
That isn't like you.

224
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,250
[PIP] On your feet!

225
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,250
If you don't get up,

226
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,791
I'll have to call
you "ma chere,"

227
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,833
and I know how
much you hate that.

228
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,583
[PIP] You've gotten
rusty, n'est pas?

229
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,666
It doesn't take
two eyes to see that.

230
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,291
[PIP] Anyway...

231
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,083
now that you've
shook off the dust...

232
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,208
let's give him
the what-for...!

233
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,833
Together, we'll
kick his mongrel ass

234
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,708
all the way back to Berlin!

235
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,208
[PIP] Don't get fancy!

236
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,708
Lay into him...!

237
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,541
Make it hurt!

238
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,333
[SERAS] Gotchya!

239
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,791
[PIP] You think?!

240
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,416
[PIP] Would you
believe this guy...?

241
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,666
A wolfman with a flare
for the theatrical...

242
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,166
What's the world
coming to, ma chere...?

243
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,958
[SERAS]
Bloody werewolves...

244
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,625
[SERAS] What this...?

245
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,875
[SERAS] It's a gold tooth...

246
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,208
Oh god...

247
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,458
Is all this...?!

248
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,958
[PIP] Disgusting, non..?

249
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,291
It's plunder from when
they ransacked Europe

250
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,875
half a century ago.

251
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,083
[PIP] These bastards shook
out whole countries

252
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,333
like piggy banks, taking
anything of value,

253
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,875
no matter how small...

254
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,250
Everything from gold
ingots and wads of cash,

255
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
down to pocketwatches
and gold teeth.

256
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,875
[PIP] The fearsome
Schutzstaffel.

257
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,500
They think they're
Nietzche's wet-dream,

258
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,125
but they're just vultures,
picking at the dead.

259
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,125
[PIP] They're a
bunch of misfits

260
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,125
who think war is
a costume ball...

261
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,958
The Invisible Army?

262
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,833
The Knights of Steel?

263
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,708
Hah! What a
pack of losers!

264
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,875
[SERAS] Silver...!

265
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,708
[SERAS] But...

266
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,875
couldn't this...?!

267
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,916
[PIP] What a good doggy,

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,416
giving you the tools
to put him down.

269
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,625
[SERAS] He lead me
here on purpose...

270
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,166
[PIP] So be it.

271
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,458
Le chien d'attaque
wants to die...

272
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,708
Let's oblige him,
ma chere!

273
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
[SERAS] I hardly think
you're in a position

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,250
to be calling
someone an "attack dog".

275
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,458
[PIP] Touché.

276
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,791
[SERAS] Oh and...

277
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:38,208
I'd really prefer if you
didn't smoke inside of me.

278
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,791
[PIP] He's coming!

279
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,958
Don't run!
Take the hit!

280
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,416
[SERAS] Right!

281
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,125
[PIP] Now...!
Allez, ma chere...!

282
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,000
Take him out!

283
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,166
[PIP] When he hit's you,
you hit him right back!

284
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,041
[SERAS] You... Dog!

285
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,375
[SERAS] My turn!

286
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:24,833
[SERAS] He's not phased!

287
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
[PIP] Doesn't matter!

288
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,583
[SERAS] Let's do this!

289
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,375
[PIP] Right!

290
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,416
Give him hell!

291
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,750
[SERAS] Now let's
see you run from me!

292
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
[PIP] You took
these in the camps...

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,125
And finally, your sins

294
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,416
from fifty years ago
have all come home ...

295
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,291
to bite you!

296
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,666
[PIP] That's what happens
when you mess with ma chere.

297
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,958
She takes your heart!

298
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,041
Adieu chien d'attaque!

299
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
[SERAS] He looked
like a child,

300
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,375
who'd just woken up
from a pleasant dream...

301
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,583
[SERAS] These men...

302
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,083
they've been trapped

303
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,333
in the same dream
since World War II...

304
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,291
But tonight,
Mr. Bernadotte,

305
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,958
I wake them up...

306
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,208
[SERAS] All of them!

307
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,333
[PIP] Yes...

308
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes, you will.

309
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,416
Now end this charade...

310
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,416
Grind those antiques
down into dust.

311
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,750
Go...!

312
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,250
En avant!

313
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,000
[INTEGRA] Show yourself!

314
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,208
[MAJOR] Ah... willkommen!

315
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,541
Frauline, I'm so glad

316
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,583
we finally get to meet
each other in the flesh!

317
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,166
[MAJOR] I don't
think that gun

318
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,083
is going to
be very helpful.

319
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,750
Sorry...

320
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,666
I should have warned
you about the glass.

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,166
[MAJOR] I feared
you might not

322
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,166
make it here in time
for the main event...

323
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,125
What a tragedy
that would have been!

324
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,166
[MAJOR] You see,
this extravaganza

325
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,666
is one-night-only.

326
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,166
Luckily, I've got
the best seat

327
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,583
in the house,

328
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,625
and a winsome
Hellsing on my arm!

329
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,250
[INTEGRA] You coward!

330
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,791
[MAJOR] You are
in for such a treat!

331
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,666
Enjoy!

332
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,208
[MAJOR] You know,
you only see

333
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:50,583
this sort of thing
once a century.

334
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,041
[MAJOR] In fact, the last
time this happened

335
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,916
was back in 1898.

336
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,583
It's been a while, ja?

337
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,916
[MAJOR] But this time,
the tragic hero Arucard...

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,916
will utterly cease to
exist when the curtain falls!

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,791
He'll what?!

340
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,291
[Arucard laughing]

341
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,208
[ARUCARD] This is more
than I could ever drink!

342
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,875
[ARUCARD] Well...

343
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,875
dear Walter...

344
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,708
care to dance?

345
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,833
Oh yes...

346
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,750
I'll see it
through to the end...

347
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,750
I just need time!

348
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,583
[WALLY] This isn't over...!

349
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,833
Major...!

350
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,458
I beg you...!

351
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,625
Give me more time!

352
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,333
[MAJOR] Nein...

353
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,083
[MAJOR] It's already done...

354
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,833
It's too late.

355
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:25,541
[DOC] It is too late...
for everything.

356
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,416
[ARUCARD] Take your
best shot... little boy!

357
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,583
[MAJOR] I fear that
ship has sailed.

358
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,375
You cannot win now,

359
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,625
no matter
what you do.

360
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,041
[MAJOR] Ja, not
to belabor the point,

361
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,000
but this was a
one-time deal.

362
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,041
I gave you the proverbial
keys to the kingdom,

363
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,375
the blank check,

364
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,500
the golden ticket into
the chocolate factory...

365
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:02,041
Your second chance to defeat
Arucard, man to man...

366
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,541
And you botched it, Walter.

367
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,500
[MAJOR] 1,000 Nazi vampires
of The Last Battalion...

368
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,958
[MAJOR]
3,000 zealots,

369
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,916
fighting in the
Vatican's 9th Crusade...

370
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,958
[MAJOR] The Iscariot
Organization...

371
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,125
[MAJOR] Our
heirsute Captain...

372
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,875
[MAJOR] The Papist Anderson...

373
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:28,625
[MAJOR] And the sum total
of your own life, Walter.

374
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,791
[MAJOR] They were sacrificed,
all of them,

375
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,708
to allow for
this moment...

376
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,916
This once in a
lifetime opportunity...

377
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
your one chance
to kill Arucard,

378
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,041
And still, you
couldn't best him.

379
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,583
[MAJOR] How many lives

380
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,375
are still sloshing
around in his gullet?

381
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,833
[MAJOR] One million...?

382
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,875
Two million, perhaps...?

383
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,833
Victory is now
lost to you, Walter...

384
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:59,416
Your sole reason for living
has just gone up in smoke.

385
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,375
[ARUCARD] You've been
deluding yourself, traitor...

386
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,708
Use your head...

387
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,375
You couldn't win if you
tried a thousand times.

388
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,625
[ARUCARD]
In the end,

389
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,208
Anderson wasn't strong
enough to beat me...

390
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,833
And if he couldn't do it

391
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,250
you haven't
a chance in hell...

392
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,041
You could face
me every day

393
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,375
for a thousand
years, Walter...

394
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,958
and I'd tear you
apart each time.

395
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,375
[MAJOR] The king
has no moves left...

396
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,291
Checkmate.

397
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,958
[MAJOR] I've won.

398
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,125
[MAJOR] You are
bested, Arucard...!

399
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,541
Accept your defeat!

400
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,000
[ARUCARD] Hardly...

401
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,041
I've never been stronger...

402
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,833
Me, defeated?

403
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,541
[ARUCARD] Defeated...?

404
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,833
You presume much
in saying that...

405
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,458
My strength is at its peak,
Professor Hellsing...

406
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:11,458
I am unstoppable!

407
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,250
I can never lose!

408
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,541
Not ever...

409
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,208
[ARUCARD] Wait...

410
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,875
This sunrise...

411
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,333
I've seen this...

412
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,833
Is this the past...

413
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,875
or is this
happening now...

414
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,791
I don't know...

415
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,583
[ARUCARD] I remember...

416
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,583
[ARUCARD] I've seen this dawn...

417
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,916
[ARUCARD] That morning...

418
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,625
the sky looked
just like this...

419
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,208
[ARUCARD]
Every time I die...

420
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,875
this is the vision...

421
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,875
that greets my eyes...

422
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:22,250
[ARUCARD] And
every time, I think...

423
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,541
How lovely, that sunlight,

424
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:29,000
which I forsook so
many centuries ago...

425
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,291
[MAJOR] "Life is
but a walking shadow

426
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,375
a poor player that struts

427
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,958
and frets his hour
upon the stage

428
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:56,208
and then is
heard no more."

429
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,666
[INTEGRA] What's this?!

430
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,916
What have you done...?!

431
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,583
[INTEGRA] Answer me!

432
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:15,083
[MAJOR] It's more
a question of "where".

433
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,583
[MAJOR] He absorbed
the essence

434
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:20,500
of Warrant Officer
Schrodinger...

435
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,583
But, as you can see,

436
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,583
this meal isn't
quite agreeing with him

437
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,541
is it, mein frauline?

438
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,666
[MAJOR] By drinking
Schrodinger's blood,

439
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,333
Arucard has become
the paradoxical cat.

440
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:37,208
He is now shackled
by infinite possibility,

441
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,625
a Cheshire chasing
its unknowable tail

442
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,541
across the endless vista...

443
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,041
As long as he is self-aware,

444
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:49,625
he is everywhere
and nowhere.

445
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,041
[MAJOR] But that conundrum
is now multiplied

446
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,625
by the millions of lives

447
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:58,250
and consciousnesses
within Arucard.

448
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:04,000
To wit, he no longer capable
of recognizng himself.

449
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,041
[MAJOR] What's it
all mean, you ask?

450
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,041
Arucard is kaput...

451
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,041
Gone...

452
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,166
Not alive, dead,
or even undead.

453
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,541
[MAJOR] He has
become abstraction...

454
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,458
He is...

455
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,708
An imaginary number.

456
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,708
[INTEGRA] Arucard!

457
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,333
[INTEGRA] Don't
close your eyes!

458
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,708
[INTEGRA] Heed my voice!

459
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,708
[INTEGRA] Arucard!

460
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,666
[INTEGRA] I'm giving you...

461
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,916
an order...!

462
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,333
Don't leave me!

463
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,958
[ARUCARD] I fear...

464
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,666
I must disobey you...

465
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,083
Farewell, Integra...

466
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,583
[INTEGRA] Arucaaaaard!

467
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,666
[MAJOR] Everything I had,
I gave for this moment.

468
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,833
[MAJOR] And...

469
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:12,416
in this moment,
I took everything he had.

470
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,708
[MAJOR] How long have
I waited for this day...

471
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:23,958
The thought of it pulled me
forward, decade after decade...

472
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:28,583
[MAJOR] I admit, after all
the defeats I have known...

473
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:32,333
victory's taste
is strange to me.

474
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,500
[INTEGRA] Bastard...

475
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,083
I'll end you...

476
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,541
[MAJOR] This victory...

477
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,875
It has hints of blood...

478
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,541
And of iron...

479
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,291
I love it.

480
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,416
[MAJOR] Which one
of you will kill me?

481
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,458
Or maybe I put a bullet
into your pretty little heads.

482
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:47,000
[laughing]

483
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,500
[WALLY] The great
Arucard is dead...!

484
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,000
He's dead...

485
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,458
and I still stand.

486
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,750
[crying]

487
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,500
[WALLY] Dammit all to hell...

488
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:11,125
[WALLY] I wanted Arucard bested,
that was the bloody point...

489
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,833
And that's what I got...

490
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:16,416
Why does it feel--?

491
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,958
[HEINKEL] You
butchered Yumie...

492
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,916
Blowing your head off isn't
just the Lord's work...!

493
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,916
 It's a pleasure!

494
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,625
[WALLY] So you
would shoot me...

495
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,375
slumped on a wall...

496
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,625
A traitor's death
is exactly what I deserve...

497
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,333
Fire when ready...

498
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,625
I shall not dodge it.

499
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,875
[HEINKEL] Walter C. Dolnez...

500
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,791
The Angel of Death...

501
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:10,333
I kill you in
the name of God!

502
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,916
[WALLY] What's
wrong, sniper...?

503
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,750
Scared?

504
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,458
[HEINKEL] Damn you!

505
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,333
[HEINKEL] I'm not scared!

506
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,666
[HEINKEL] Just die...!

507
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,666
[HEINKEL] Don't worry...

508
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,166
We're not done...!

509
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,625
I've got more...!

510
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,625
[WALLY] You can shoot at
me until your clip runs dry...

511
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,625
[WALLY] But...

512
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,916
No one dies without
the Major's permission.

513
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:08,875
[HEINKEL] Wait...

514
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,750
Where are you going...?!

515
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,750
Come back...

516
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,833
Come back...!

517
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,083
[HEINKEL] I'll kill you...

518
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,541
I'll kill you...!

519
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:21,416
Kill you!

520
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,291
[WALLY] I have...

521
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,833
to reach him...

522
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,041
[MAJOR]
Well, it's nice

523
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:57,666
to finally meet
you in person, child.

524
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,500
[MAJOR] You joined us at
the absolute perfect moment...

525
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,875
I am at something of
a crossroads, it seems.

526
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,791
[MAJOR] Arucard has been
my archenemy for many decades...

527
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:16,083
But now, the position of
archenemy has fallen vacant.

528
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:22,666
[MAJOR] Seeing as how you're
his closest compatriots...

529
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,708
I think the title of archenemy
should fall upon your shoulders!

530
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,541
[MAJOR] Don't
be shy, ladies...

531
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,625
Your nemesis is here...!

532
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,083
Right in front of you!

533
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:42,166
[MAJOR] Don't squander
this moment!

534
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,083
Wreak delicious
revenge upon me...!

535
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,958
Or am I too much for you?

536
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,583
[INTEGRA] Do it, Seras...

537
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,541
Shoot him.

538
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:58,791
Now!

539
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,750
Fire!

540
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,875
[INTEGRA] Fire
upon this madman...!

541
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,125
Erase his villainy
from the Earth!

542
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,416
[MAJOR] Verdammt...

543
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,458
you built too strong
a shield, Doctor.

544
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,833
[MAJOR] Look at
that Harkonnen...!

545
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:45,333
88 millimeters...!YES!

546
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:25,875
[INTEGRA] Burn in hell...

547
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,833
you swine.

548
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,041
[MAJOR] I will...

549
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,166
but not just yet...

550
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,625
Sorry to disappoint you...

551
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,875
Hellsing...

552
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,583
[INTEGRA] Impossible...!

553
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,583
I saw the shell hit you...

554
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,666
You're dead...!

555
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,291
[MAJOR] That's where
you're wrong...

556
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,250
I have never been more alive.

557
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,750
[SERAS] He's a machine!

558
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,291
[MAJOR]
Good Gracious,

559
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,833
didn't your mother
ever teach you...

560
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,458
that it's rude to stare...?

561
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,500
[MAJOR]
Machinery aside...

562
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:11,875
I am just as human now as
I ever was, Frauline.

563
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,583
Look at
you, Major...

564
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,708
A clockwork
monstrosity.

565
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,875
[MAJOR] Deny it all you want...

566
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:22,166
My humanity is
not in question.

567
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,333
I still have
that one trait

568
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,958
that puts us
in ascendance,

569
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,750
even above the angels...

570
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,333
It is my will that drives me.

571
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,458
The Vampires
you were so happy

572
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,541
to keep in your employ...

573
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,458
without the
lifeblood of others

574
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,583
to keep them going,

575
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:41,083
they would
shamble to a halt...

576
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,208
If it's a monster you want,

577
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:46,083
look no further
than Arucard...

578
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:50,333
and this little one,
playing at immortality...

579
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,208
[MAJOR] Don't mention me

580
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,875
in the same
breath as that fraud...

581
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,750
So long as I am
propelled forward

582
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,708
by my own
unadulterated will,

583
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:04,875
I am heir to something
Arucard can only steal...

584
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,291
Even if I were
reduced to nothing more

585
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,166
than a brain in a jar,

586
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,541
synapses firing in a sea
of pure thought...

587
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,666
[MAJOR] I am human,
just like you are.

588
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,291
Within me,
rests a human soul...

589
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:24,875
and a human's will,
precious beyond all worth!

590
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,291
[MAJOR] He smiles at you

591
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,583
in the form
of a young girl...

592
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,666
or pulls at
your heartstrings

593
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,500
in the guise of
a weary veteran...

594
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,416
So many faces,
the monster has...

595
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,916
and all of them stolen...

596
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,541
All of them lies.

597
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,041
[MAJOR] I despise him...

598
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:48,291
Every cell in my body
called for his annhilation...

599
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,041
So I destroyed his kingdom

600
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:53,250
and cast him
down into the dust!

601
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,333
[MAJOR] Fitting that
it took a man

602
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,666
with the trappings
of a monster...

603
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,041
to slay a monster with
the trappings of a man...

604
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:06,333
[MAJOR] He was a
casualty to my will...

605
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,750
[MAJOR]
"My enemy is not human...

606
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,000
My enemy...

607
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,375
is less than a human...

608
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,166
Since the earliest
dawning of mankind,

609
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,208
this is the battlecry...

610
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:26,708
It just happened to be
more literal in my case.

611
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:28,416
[MAJOR] That battlecry...

612
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,833
those thoughts are running

613
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:33,041
through your mind
right now, aren't they?

614
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,333
[MAJOR] I planted
the seeds of this war

615
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,333
half a century ago.

616
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:42,750
Now, show me
what has blossomed.

617
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,250
[MAJOR] I finally
hit something!

618
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:37,041
[MAJOR] Ah, excellent.

619
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,708
[MAJOR] This was exactly,

620
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:42,750
what I hoped
my war would be...

621
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,958
[INTEGRA] You're wrong...

622
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,750
No one will think
of this as a war.

623
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,208
[INTEGRA] This was...

624
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:04,500
just an exchange
of bullets.

625
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,208
[INTEGRA] The death
rattle of a sad lunitic

626
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,250
half a century
past his prime.

627
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,875
I hardly think of you
as a proper opponent.

628
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,541
[INTEGRA] You needed
to be put down, Major...

629
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:28,041
Of that, there
is no doubt.

630
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,041
For all your
talk of humanity,

631
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,791
there wasn't
a shred of it left

632
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,375
to be found in you...

633
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:35,666
Perhaps there never was...

634
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,750
You died as you lived--
a cowardly beast.

635
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,791
[INTEGRA] A monster's
reign of terror

636
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:49,291
may be bloody and long...

637
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,833
but it's only a matter
of time before they fall.

638
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:56,083
[INTEGRA] Foolish creature,
mankind is a slave to duty...

639
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:59,041
And there is no greater duty

640
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:03,750
than to purge one's
enemy from the earth.

641
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:08,000
[INTEGRA] Your humanity
was but a pale facade...

642
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,875
Arucard can't be bested
by such imposters!

643
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:22,958
[DOC] Is it over?

644
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,833
[DOC] No, it isn't...

645
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,625
It can't be.

646
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,750
[DOC] Technology
and science speed ahead,

647
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:31,791
neck and neck...!

648
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,750
Each of them
a baying hound

649
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,125
in the elusive
hunt for Knoweldge!

650
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,833
[DOC] So what is missing...?

651
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:38,916
What component...?!

652
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,791
What spark...?!

653
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,458
What alchemy...?!

654
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,625
[DOC] The trail is cold...

655
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,375
The quarry eludes me...

656
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,375
But I mustn't lose heart.

657
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,541
I will gather my hounds

658
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,541
and live to hunt
another day...!

659
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:58,500
And soon, the world
will tremble...!

660
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,958
when they behold
what I have wrought!

661
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,583
[DOC] Science that
shatters reason,

662
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:05,958
and puts the miracles
of old to shame!

663
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,625
[WALLY] Leaving so soon,
are we, Herr Doktor?

664
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,791
[WALLY] Your best
wasn't good enough.

665
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,916
The least you
could do is lose

666
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,958
with some
dignity and grace.

667
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:17,916
[DOC] Walter, what
are you saying?

668
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,875
[WALLY] For all your talk
of a thousand-year Reich...

669
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:25,208
we bollocks this up
pretty good, didn't we?

670
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,208
[DOC] You... broken
piece of shit!

671
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,416
[WALLY]
Really, Doctor...

672
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,375
you're quite the piece
of shit yourself...

673
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:33,166
All your toys,
have fallen short,

674
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,500
myself included...

675
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,000
How could we not...?

676
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,250
Like "The Doctor
in Spite of Himself"...

677
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,375
Your science
wasn't good enough...

678
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,750
Don't you understand?

679
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,666
You're life's a farce.

680
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,958
[DOC] A farce...?!

681
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,625
You dare denigrate...

682
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,166
my work by
comparing it...

683
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,291
to some bit of fluff
by Moliere?

684
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,750
[WALLY] Moliere?

685
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,791
You should be so lucky.

686
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,583
[WALLY] We are the
evening's entertainment...

687
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:02,708
And I just wanted
to do something

688
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,750
with my time on the stage
worthy of applause.

689
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,500
[WALLY] Life is
so damned cruel...

690
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,666
Arucard coped
with it for centuries.

691
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,000
I truly don't envy him that.

692
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,166
[DOC] You're nothing more
than a broken turncoat!

693
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,666
How dare you
address me like this?!

694
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,166
You would lay in
a heap and mock us?!

695
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,750
You are a weapon!

696
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,750
Nothing but a tool in
the hands of your betters!

697
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:35,833
If you look
down your nose

698
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:38,458
at our plans,
I'll cut it off!

699
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:39,583
I will not allow you...

700
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,916
to mock the work
I have done!

701
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,416
[DOC] I am a visionary...!

702
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,541
I am a medical prophet...!

703
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,666
What I have done
with my vampires

704
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,833
is just the beginning!

705
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,333
[DOC] We will surpass her!

706
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:54,208
Arucard's best
will be nothing!

707
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,291
[WALLY] As lovely
as that sounds...

708
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,333
none of it is going
to happen, Doctor...

709
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,500
Your research dies
with you, tonight.

710
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:03,041
[DOC] Shut your mouth!

711
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,750
[WALLY] Mina Harker...

712
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:20,416
The ghoulish centerpiece
of your sad ambitions...

713
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,208
[WALLY] The only
person to have

714
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,625
ever been fed
upon by Arucard...

715
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,583
and then feed
upon him in turn...

716
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,250
Quite the trick.

717
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,791
[WALLY] They say
she returned to normal

718
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:34,708
after Professor Van Helsing
defeated her master,

719
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,375
but the beast
never quite let go...

720
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:41,666
Arucard's essence
hides deep in her bones.

721
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44,875
[WALLY] And so it waited
out the long years in slumber.

722
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:48,500
Immune to time, to the
Eucharist, to Holy Water.

723
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,666
Even to the cross itself...

724
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:55,000
A microscopic
transgression against God.

725
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,833
I suppose you couldn't

726
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,916
help yourselves, really...

727
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,041
Awakening it like you did...

728
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,666
You dug up her coffin

729
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,375
like a common grave-robber...

730
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,833
and did things to her bones

731
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,875
that should
never be spoken of.

732
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,000
When everything
is said and done,

733
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:22,333
all you did was crank
out two-bit imitations...

734
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,041
If that doesn't
qualify as a farce,

735
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,708
then I don't know what does.

736
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,375
The show is over, Mina...

737
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,875
The curtain's falling...

738
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,500
We've taken our bows...

739
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,750
It's high time
we make our exit.

740
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,916
[screaming]

741
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,166
Perfect shot...

742
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,708
It's a damn shame...

743
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:06,833
I'd hoped to give
Arucard, a proper send-up.

744
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,583
We had a good run...

745
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:16,875
Master Integra...

746
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,875
[INTEGRA] Walter...!

747
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:36,166
The Angel is Death
is no more, Seras.

748
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,250
Yes.

749
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,666
I am tired...

750
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,791
Let us return home...

751
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,208
to what's left of it.

752
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,833
[INTEGRA] Let's go!

753
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,041
[ISLANDS IV] The British
and American

754
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,791
Bio-Terrorist
Attack, or Zeppelin Incident...

755
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,208
Report 17.

756
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:51,041
[ISLANDS IV]
U.S. casualties: 64,300

757
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,291
including The President's
entire cabinet.

758
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:59,666
British casualties:
3,708,917.

759
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,500
[WALSH] Isn't this
your day for fencing?

760
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,166
Not like you
to cut class.

761
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,375
[ISLANDS IV] Quite...

762
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,916
But reading these
reports takes top priority.

763
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,958
Hmm.

764
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:12,708
Should anyone
care to replicate

765
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,458
the attack from
30 years ago...

766
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,500
I daresay I won't
be able to repel it

767
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:19,500
with a sabre
at the ready.

768
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,041
God's truth,
Islands.

769
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,791
When you make that face
you're making right now...

770
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,083
you remind me
a hell of a lot

771
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,750
of your
great-grandfather.

772
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,333
Fencers halt...!

773
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,708
That's the match!

774
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,250
Sir Integra wins!

775
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,875
[MAKUBE] That was
truly magnificent...!

776
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,333
The years
have robbed you

777
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,250
of none of your
vigor with a blade!

778
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,583
Don't you start...

779
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,958
I asked for Section 13
to wait in the lobby.

780
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,166
[MAKUBE] Yes, you did...

781
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,208
but it's not
in my nature

782
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,625
to sit and await
notice from a host...

783
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,750
and besides, when no one
could even be bothered

784
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,875
to offer us any tea

785
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,041
I had to find my own amusement.

786
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,125
Well you can't

787
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,791
have the run of
the place, Papist...

788
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,833
Back to the lobby
with you.

789
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,750
Yes... fine...

790
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,666
I meant no disrespect...

791
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:35,125
[ISCARIOT PRIEST] 
Chief Makube...

792
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,250
The security in this
building's as bad as ever...

793
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,583
We could conquer
them right now.

794
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,041
[HEINKEL] So naïve...

795
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,458
There's more to this
place than you know.

796
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:44,791
Huh...?

797
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:47,875
[PIP] Ow! Dammit!

798
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:48,791
That hurt!

799
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,208
What the hell
was that for?!

800
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,083
[ISCARIOT PRIEST]
Oh my God...!

801
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:56,041
[MAKUBE] Meet Seras
Victoria's shadow.

802
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,208
It wraps around

803
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:01,041
the whole mansion,
and every person inside.

804
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,416
[HEINKEL] We would die...

805
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,625
but we would take
out half the Round Table

806
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:06,708
before we did,
Chief Makube.

807
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,916
[MAKUBE]
Another day perhaps...

808
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,375
The church is still
licking its wounds...

809
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,833
The losses we incurred
in the Ninth Crusade

810
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,666
still cut us to
the very marrow...

811
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:21,125
For now...
we bide our time.

812
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,833
[MAKUBE]
We've waited 500 years...

813
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,208
At this point,
what is another

814
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,375
one- or two-hundred,
right?

815
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:31,166
The Tenth Crusade
will set all of this aright.

816
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,000
I think that's
enough traning for now...

817
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,041
Let's call it a day.

818
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,791
Sir Penwood, thank you
for a bracing match.

819
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,333
It was bracing...?

820
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:44,166
Your form's
much improved...

821
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,375
You've been practicing.

822
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,166
Thank you...

823
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,291
I mean, I have...

824
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:50,166
but I've got
a long way to go...

825
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,541
My grandfather...

826
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:52,708
I was curious...

827
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:56,083
I've... heard some
rather conflicting stories

828
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,958
about his swordsmanship...

829
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:04,166
You want
the truth, do you...?

830
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,291
Your grandfather
tore through

831
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,583
the Nazi horde as
if they were paper!

832
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,000
He laid hundreds of them low

833
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,916
with blade and pistol
before strapping satchel-charges

834
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,708
onto himself and blowing
a zeppelin clean to hell!

835
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:15,875
Sir Shelby Penwood's heroics

836
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,541
have yet to be matched!

837
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,500
He was England's protector...

838
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:24,833
I lost my left eye trying
to duel him for fun one day.

839
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:26,208
That can't be true!

840
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,875
It's all the truth...!

841
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:30,291
The unvarnished,
whole truth...!

842
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,291
Every word of it!

843
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,916
'd like to honor
his memory

844
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
with a new helicopter!

845
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,083
What do you say?

846
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,208
You want another one...?!

847
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:41,916
Do it for Grandfather...

848
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,791
[PENWOOD III] All right...

849
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,750
I'll take that as a yes...!

850
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,375
[PENWOOD III] 
I hate you!

851
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:53,291
[SERAS] I pity the man...

852
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,208
You treat him so badly...

853
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:56,291
I know he's a nitwit...

854
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,000
but he does have feelings.

855
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:00,125
[INTEGRA] He could use some
adversity in his life...

856
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,041
They all could...

857
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,708
And the sooner they
man up, the better.

858
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:09,625
[INTEGRA] When I die,
Hellsing comes to an end--

859
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,791
the family and
the organization both...

860
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:13,916
It will fall upon Penwood

861
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,416
and his ilk to
carry the torch,

862
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,083
as part of a state-run,
government agency...

863
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,333
Hereditary leadership
has run its course.

864
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,083
The years weigh
heavily on me today.

865
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,208
[SERAS] Huh...?

866
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:29,916
You're just a young
as the day I met you.

867
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,500
[INTEGRA] I discovered
another wrinkle

868
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:32,875
when I looked in
the mirror today!

869
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:36,291
[INTEGRA] When I
saw that new wrinkle...

870
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:40,041
I couldn't help
but think of Walter.

871
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:42,416
[WALTER] Stiff upper
lip, Master Integra!

872
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,250
[SERAS] Why's
he up there?

873
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:46,583
[SERAS] Well there's
no point moping about!

874
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,083
Some of England's
greatest women

875
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,083
have had wrinkles,

876
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,250
so where's
the shame in it?

877
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,125
And no more of this
talk about dying...!

878
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,791
I can drink your blood,
if you'd like!

879
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:59,000
[SERAS] Or I can
go all Arucard...

880
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:00,416
[SERAS] Why did you
kick me?!

881
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,541
That hurt!

882
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,458
That is not
something you joke about!

883
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,458
Haven't you
learned anything?!

884
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,666
And don't
think that master

885
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,041
of yours is off the hook!

886
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,000
He skipped out
and never come back!

887
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,083
And if he does
come back

888
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,125
I will have WORDS!

889
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,333
[SERAS] Oh, he'll
return, all right...

890
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,958
I know that because
he drank my blood...

891
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,791
Just try to be patient
a little while longer...

892
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,000
[INTEGRA] You've
been saying that

893
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,916
for 30 years, Seras.

894
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,666
Thirty years...!

895
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,416
[INTEGRA] Of course
you can wait patiently--

896
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,083
you're a bloody vampire.

897
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,916
[SERAS] Frowning
makes more wrinkles...!

898
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,833
[INTEGRA] Such a
mouth on you...!

899
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:03,916
Apologize...!

900
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,875
Apologize, dammit!

901
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,500
[SERAS] I'm sorry, okay...?!

902
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:08,500
I really am...!

903
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:18,583
Please, leggo!

904
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:28,583
Please, leggo!

905
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:38,583
Please, leggo!

906
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:48,583
Please, leggo!

907
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:58,625
Please, leggo!

908
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:08,625
Please, leggo!

909
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:19,708
Please, leggo!

910
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,500
[SERAS] Are we under
attack again, Master?!

911
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,833
[ARUCARD] Such a
violent welcome...

912
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,083
What an honor...

913
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:01,125
I feared you'd
forgotten about me.

914
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:02,916
[SERAS] You're back!

915
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:07,291
[INTEGRA] You're a bit later
than I expected, Arucard...

916
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,416
Care to explain yourself?

917
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,041
[ARUCARD] Killing oneself
takes some time...

918
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:15,083
And in my situation...

919
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,500
there was a lot
of self to kill.ß

920
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:26,416
3,424,867 souls
were within me,

921
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,291
clouding my mind, denying
me awareness...

922
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,208
I butchered them all,
until only I remained.

923
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:37,250
[ARUCARD] I have
returned here...

924
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:42,291
But I'm also
always nowhere...

925
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,000
It's a conundrum...

926
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:43,875
The truth of it is...

927
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:47,833
I am everywhere.

928
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,666
[INTEGRA] You've returned...

929
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,791
And in the meantime...

930
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:56,166
I have grown old and gray.

931
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,666
[ARUCARD] Do forgive me.

932
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,750
[INTEGRA] Were you
skulking in here...

933
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,166
to drink my blood?

934
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:06,958
[ARUCARD] Ah...

935
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,125
you need to ask...?!

936
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:11,500
I haven't eaten
anything in 30 years...

937
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:13,541
I'm famished...

938
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:25,750
[INTEGRA] The young
woman you knew is gone...

939
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:28,208
I'm ancient...

940
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:36,333
[ARUCARD] And I'm not...?

941
01:02:56,375 --> 01:03:01,333
[INTEGRA] You're
home my dear Count.

942
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:04,375
[ARUCARD] Back forevermore
my Countess.
