1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,166
God... Oh God...

2
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,291
An angel...

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,750
An Angel!

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,416
They're Angels...

5
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,541
We have come for you!

6
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,500
We are the righteous
soldiers of the Angel of Death!

7
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,166
And tonight the world
below shall know Judgment!

8
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:17,541
England is guilty!
The heathens, are guilty!

9
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:21,125
You are all now sentenced...
to your death!!

10
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,291
Death! Death! Death! Death!!

11
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,125
I can offer you my pity...

12
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,416
But forgiveness? Never!

13
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,166
Now, prepare to be
purged from the earth!

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,625
Mowed down like grass,
crushed like bugs!

15
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,583
Who knew?

16
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:04,000
That kid can really put on quite
a show when his heart is in it.

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,416
Major... Major,
this is dangerous!

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,333
Please, won't you
come back inside?

19
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,500
Doctor, is the
special project ready?

20
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,458
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,583
It has been prepared precisely
to your specifications.

22
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:24,500
I should remind you it is
untested, and extremely risky.

23
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,583
Of course doctor, thank you.

24
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,083
This is most splendid news.

25
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,625
Well, it is an
outstanding specimen.

26
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,333
Adequate work Doc.

27
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,333
It's not like you've
done any work, idiot!

28
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,875
I've done plenty of work!

29
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,416
I was watching Zorin at the
Hellsing house and everything!

30
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,125
Oh, yes...?

31
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:57,125
Achtung! All units, equip
your ultraviolet battlements,

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,250
and prepare to muster!

33
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,708
Masks!

34
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,583
Muster the battalion!
Muster the battalion!

35
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,541
Enemies stand to our left,
enemies stand to our right.

36
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,791
Eradicate all who
stand before you!

37
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:49,541
Execute them all!
Kill them! Destroy!

38
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,500
Major! Do you hear me?
Please, come back inside!

39
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,000
The armor plating
won't hold out for long!

40
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,333
Major, I...

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,416
He thinks that it is music.
Music of the battlefield...

42
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,708
The Major... He's conducting it!

43
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:10,291
The battlefield is his symphony,
and we are his instruments!

44
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:15,291
Great howling instruments,
wailing his cacophonous notes!!

45
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,750
How could anything
stand against him?

46
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,625
We've found our target!
He's on top of the airship!

47
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,750
What the hell is he doing?
He's crazy! A mad ghost of war!

48
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,583
Major!

49
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,875
Die!

50
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,333
Quick and excellent
work, my butler.

51
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,541
A plan half a
century in the works!

52
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,416
A death's head mark for the
Hellsing's Angel of death!

53
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,416
Didn't they come... to save us?

54
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,541
Die Die Die! Kill them all!

55
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:59,125
Filthy vermin! Feel the
full force of our wrath!

56
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,208
The power of the Vatican!

57
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:06,750
The only good Protestant
is a dead Protestant!

58
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,041
You have betrayed us, Maxwell.

59
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:23,000
Sneak attacks and betrayals
are par for the course in war.

60
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,250
In some circumstances,
I'd even say praise worthy.

61
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,875
Especially against
heathens such as yourself.

62
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:38,625
However... This...
this is different.

63
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,250
I cannot let this pass.

64
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,041
Maxwell, you have
become enraptured

65
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,958
by your own authority.

66
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,541
Intoxicated by your power.

67
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,791
We are meant to be mere
instruments of a higher power.

68
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,791
I am but a blade
wielded from on high.

69
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,666
A guillotine blade in
the service of God.

70
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,416
But this Maxwell,

71
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,791
what you do tonight is
not in the service of God.

72
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,625
It is in the service of power!

73
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:16,625
You, Maxwell!
You've turned your back on God!

74
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,958
Father Anderson, you need

75
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,208
to focus on your mission,
you're orders.

76
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,291
Maxwell wants
Sir Integra Hellsing

77
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,708
taken into custody immediately.

78
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,291
I don't like this.

79
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,666
What you like doesn't enter
into it Anderson. Understand?

80
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,041
I still don't like this!

81
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,458
Seras!

82
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,333
Seras Victoria!

83
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,666
You alright Sir Integra?
Any injuries?

84
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,916
I'm adequate.
How's the headquarters?

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,041
We were attacked
by enemy soldiers.

86
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,833
We managed to kill them all.

87
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,666
But the Mansion
has been destroyed...

88
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,666
...and Mr. Bernadotte,
he is dead, sir.

89
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,375
Yes, I see...

90
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,000
You drank from
Mr. Bernadotte, didn't you?

91
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,708
You've finally
become a vampire...

92
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,208
Yes, I have.

93
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,708
Stand down.

94
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,083
Even with both of
you power combined,

95
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,250
that girl is way too
much for you to handle.

96
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Seras Victoria the vampire...

97
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,583
I've got to say, you
are starting to become

98
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,458
quite the fearsome creature.

99
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,291
Yes Father, and I'm getting
stronger all the time.

100
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,250
I don't think I'll be afraid
of anything ever again.

101
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,291
It's as if your eyes have become
windows to a bottomless abyss.

102
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,375
It's striking, considering
how human you look otherwise.

103
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,375
I feel it...

104
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:20,500
He's returning!

105
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,666
This is fantastic.
It all comes crashing down...

106
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,708
There is something
moving up the Thames River.

107
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,500
What is it?

108
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,125
A... ghost ship...

109
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,750
And so it came
to pass that those

110
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,333
who had once gathered before
a painted line of spears,

111
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,416
found themselves reunited
before the real thing.

112
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,375
On one side a division of
panzer grenadier vampires

113
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,583
from Germany's Third Reich,
the dreaded 572 Vampire soldiers

114
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,458
of "The Last Battalion."

115
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,708
On the other side,

116
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:08,083
2975 Knights of the Roman
Catholic Vatican Curia,

117
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,916
ninth airborne mobile crusade.

118
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,083
In the middle, her Majesty's
Hellsing Organization.

119
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,583
Just three of these
mighty soldiers remain.

120
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:26,250
All is ready, the players
prepare to take the stage,

121
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,791
and the curtain rises
over this Walpurgis Dawn.

122
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,125
My lord and master,
Integra Hellsing!

123
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,958
Give me your orders!

124
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,125
Alucard, take heed!
Here are your orders!

125
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:01,625
Your silver gun shall
stain the white army crimson!

126
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,166
Your iron gun shall stain
the black army scarlet!

127
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,958
I would know my foes
by the stains of red

128
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,000
you leave upon their chests!

129
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,875
Now search and destroy!
Search and destroy!

130
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,166
Run them down!

131
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,375
Do not let any of them
leave the island alive!

132
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,375
My master.

133
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,291
It shall be done,
as you command.

134
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,458
Release control
art restriction, zero.

135
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,125
Announce your return!

136
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,916
Say the words and
release your full power!

137
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,916
Now!

138
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,416
I am... the Bird of Hermes...

139
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:16,750
Here standeth the Bird of
Hermes, eating mine own wings.

140
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
It's as if everyone
here can feel it coming.

141
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,875
Something terrible's
about to happen.

142
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,541
If we can't put this monster
down, we may all be doomed!

143
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,625
...to keep myself tame...

144
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,333
Here it comes... I can feel it!

145
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,916
A mighty river...
A river of death!

146
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,041
The dead shall dance...

147
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,958
...and all of hell shall sing!

148
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,833
Cease fire! Cease fire!

149
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,833
No... Stop it...

150
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,291
It's impossible!

151
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,000
How can something
like that exist?!

152
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:47,500
That is the true face
of the vampire Alucard.

153
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:52,250
For blood is the currency of
the soul, the vehicle of life.

154
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,875
Blood is the medium by which
life can be transferred.

155
00:18:55,958 --> 00:19:00,541
To drink blood is to take the
essence of a soul into oneself.

156
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,250
You understand the
full ramifications

157
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,166
of this now, don't you, Seras?

158
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,125
Yes.

159
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,041
The Kazan...
and the Yeniçeri forces!

160
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,250
You devoured all of them?

161
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,375
No matter how hard we try,

162
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,875
we're never gonna be
able to kill you are we?

163
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,791
How many people have you
consumed in your time on earth?

164
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,000
How many lost souls
are trapped within you?

165
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,375
Wallachia's... It can't be...

166
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,208
You consumed them...

167
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,166
your own soldiers...
your own subjects!

168
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,416
You're a fiend!
A monster! A devil!

169
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,416
You... Dracula!

170
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,416
Full perimeter defense!

171
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,916
Square up! Close formation!

172
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,750
No! What is this thing
that's been awakened?

173
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,000
It's death!

174
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,333
Death has been awakened!

175
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,750
This is simply magnificent!

176
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,708
Fantastic! I must have one!

177
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,583
Kill it! Everyone open fire!

178
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,291
Open fire!

179
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:51,208
Fire! Fire! It's a nightmare
down there! It's hell!

180
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,000
We keep shooting,
and it keeps coming!

181
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,500
Our lines are crumbling!

182
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,666
Bishop, please order a withdraw!

183
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,083
We're being slaughtered! Bishop!

184
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:26,083
Shut! Up! Stop calling me that!

185
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,208
You address me... as Archbishop!

186
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,041
This is hardened tektite
compound reinforced glass!

187
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,166
You wont even be
able to scratch it!

188
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,666
Aa... Aaaaa... nderson!

189
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,166
Anderson!!

190
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,541
We are the soldiers of Iscariot.

191
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,791
We are the instruments
of God's wrath on earth.

192
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,708
Together we march in lockstep

193
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:32,333
to shatter the dreams of
the unrighteous and unholy.

194
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,833
Goodbye, my friend.

195
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,541
Anderson! Anderson! Anderson!!

196
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:56,458
Save me, Alexander,
Please! Please sir! Please!

197
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,375
Please sir...

198
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:12,500
Is this it?
Am I to die here alone?

199
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:18,583
No...! No...!
I was born alone...

200
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,458
I don't want to die alone!

201
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,333
Jesus...

202
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,583
Teacher... Mr. Anderson...

203
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:54,625
I will become great.
And once I've done so...

204
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:59,208
I'll have my revenge,
on all who have wronged me.

205
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,000
You are such a foolish boy.

206
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:20,666
A stupid, foolish boy...

207
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,958
This is Father Anderson
calling all paladins.

208
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,083
We're returning to the Vatican.

209
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,083
The Ninth Crusade
expeditionary force,

210
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:34,708
Reconquista, has been
completely destroyed.

211
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,666
Dawn's approaching.
Our dreams are dashed.

212
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,333
We're returning to the Vatican.

213
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:47,041
Anderson, you're not serious!

214
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,833
It's not your place to die here.

215
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:56,666
Retreat! Return to the
Vatican. Protect the Pope!

216
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,958
Protect the Church
till the end days.

217
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,250
As for me, I'm going
to be staying behind.

218
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:10,125
I will find Alucard,
and I will defeat him!

219
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,083
Anderson! What do you
think is going to happen

220
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,500
if you fight him?

221
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,500
It doesn't matter.
It's now or never.

222
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,041
Finally, Alucard has unlocked

223
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,250
the last of the restraints
upon his power.

224
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,916
He's finally in a form
I may be able to do damage to.

225
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,791
The last of his demonic powers
have finally been laid bare.

226
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,375
He has dispatched all the
warriors from his stronghold.

227
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,875
Right now, the lord of
the manor... stands alone!

228
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,125
For the first time, I can face
a single vampire in combat.

229
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,333
Dracula stands alone!

230
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,125
This- All this was
the sole objective

231
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,458
of that mad battalion commander.

232
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,125
It was a giant
sacrifice designed

233
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,958
to make Alucard vulnerable.

234
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,958
A thousand SS soldiers,
three thousand crusaders,

235
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,916
a million British citizens, all
of them, friend and foe alike...

236
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,583
And finally,
he knew I'd be here.

237
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,416
Farewell, gentlemen!

238
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,125
Do not weep for Maxwell,
the poor hopeless fool!

239
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:28,083
He died as he lived,
a spineless coward.

240
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:32,916
Farewell, and may
we meet again in Limbo.

241
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,708
Anderson!

242
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,250
Father Anderson!

243
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,625
My Count... You have returned.

244
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,958
At your pleasure, my Lady.

245
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,291
Hi!

246
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,250
it's really nice to
have you back, Master...

247
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,833
Um, you seem to have
grown a mustache, Master...

248
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,166
A moustache...

249
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,625
Yes Seras...

250
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,208
My Seras Victoria...

251
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,750
Nicely done, my nemesis.

252
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:41,958
I am a servant of God; an agent
of divine punishment on earth.

253
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:46,041
I am called upon to cut
away the flesh of infidels.

254
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:50,208
And remove from the earth,
all those who would defy God!

255
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:01,125
Amen!!!!

256
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,500
You've become a
formidable warrior.

257
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,083
I'm impressed.

258
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,125
Ready for more?

259
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,750
Yes... bring me more...

260
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,500
try to pierce my heart
with your Bayonets.

261
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:42,166
500 years ago...
100 years ago...

262
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,291
Now you come back to challenge
me and awaken me again...

263
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,291
My beloved nemesis...

264
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,875
Don't even need to ask!

265
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,125
Pure silver,
macedonium-processed

266
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,958
mercury ammunition--

267
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,541
-in Marvels NNA9 cartridges.

268
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:27,250
39cm long, weighing 16kg, with
13mm armor-piercing rounds--

269
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,333
The Jackal!

270
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,041
This weapon is perfect, Walter!

271
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,833
Now what? What will you do?

272
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:14,291
Your Dragon stands
before you, Catholic!

273
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,833
You're going to
defeat me, is that right?

274
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,916
What do you think
your chances are?

275
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,541
One in a hundred?
One in a thousand?

276
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:25,708
In ten thousand? A million?
A billion maybe?

277
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,833
I am more than
prepared to destroy you,

278
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:31,958
you monster, no matter what
the odds are against me!

279
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,416
Contact with Nordland
Platoon has been lost!

280
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,708
Respond, Dummbatz!

281
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,625
Communiqué from
the aerial cruiser!

282
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,375
The Bürgerbräukeller
is out of ammunition!

283
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,041
Nobody is responding!

284
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,083
Oh butler, mix me up
some Verhoeden cocoa

285
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,458
and bring it right away,

286
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,166
and don't hold back on
the cream and sugar!

287
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,000
London has been destroyed.

288
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,166
The Crusaders have all perished,

289
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,708
and the Last Battalion
is dying in the streets.

290
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:05,708
Alucard is down there...

291
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:09,291
And I sit up here...

292
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:16,125
It's perfection. Everything
is proceeding just as I planned.

293
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,625
What's the matter, Christian?

294
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,750
Your dragon is waiting.

295
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,875
You are bruised and bleeding.

296
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,750
Your arm is hanging by
a few strands of meat...

297
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,583
What are you going to do?

298
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,958
Will you die like a dog?

299
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,625
Or on your feet like a man?

300
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,541
What does it matter, vampire?

301
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,750
You think a cut on
my arm will stop me?

302
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,166
Now shut up, and come at me.

303
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:08,125
Come on, fight me! Hurry! Hurry!

304
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,541
Exellent...

305
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,166
Humans are such
fascinating creatures.

306
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,208
Exploding chain!

307
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,250
I want more!

308
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,750
More! More! More! More!

309
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,375
What kind of man is this?

310
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:26,375
He reminds me...
so much of those other men.

311
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:32,875
Yes. Come to me,
Alexander Anderson!

312
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:36,125
Like those other men
in that far distant time,

313
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:39,666
come and stand before my gaze.

314
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,291
And as that man did long ago,

315
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,625
try and run me thru
and pierce my heart!

316
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,708
Out of my way!

317
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,291
Damn it, I said leave!

318
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,208
You stupid, meddling idiots!

319
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,708
And what did you
expect us to do?

320
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,625
Just pack everything up and
run back to the Vatican?

321
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,708
What sad sort of
thing would that make us?

322
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,958
Because, none of us would be
soldiers of Iscariot anymore!

323
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,333
"By the cry amen and the
slaughter of the unworthy,

324
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,958
the world slippeth
back into place."

325
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,291
Those are the words
you taught us, aren't they?!

326
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,333
Did you think we would
abandon our righteousness?

327
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,750
You are the idiot!

328
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,708
You are such a fool!

329
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:49,333
I just wanted someone to survive
and carry on with our work!

330
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,250
Too many have
gone to Limbo today!

331
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,625
But since I'm charging
full speed into hell,

332
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:58,416
I might as well
have some company.

333
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,333
Guess we're gonna
do this together then!

334
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,541
Let's tell them who we are!

335
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:07,041
We are the soldiers of Iscariot!
We are Judas Iscariot!

336
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,666
Countless little lives,
struggle and writhe together...

337
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,666
Like tiny cells making
up a great beast,

338
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,625
struggling towards
it's own illumination.

339
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,958
Seeking blood
whilst spilling blood

340
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,083
continuously
multiplying and receding,

341
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,250
fighting against itself,
without end.

342
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,666
Whether they seek
that enlightenment thru

343
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,125
their faith in a "God,"
or in the name of "Nazism,"

344
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:41,083
Or even in the creature
called Alucard,...

345
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:45,000
We are all now united
by the same thing!

346
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:51,500
It's a dream come true
isn't it, my dark brethrens...

347
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,708
Till death!

348
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,666
Now!

349
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,375
Go to hell!

350
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,250
Amen!

351
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,250
You stand before me.

352
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:43,666
I'm impressed...
I'm impressed, Iscariot.

353
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,750
Show me more,
Alexander Anderson!

354
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,125
You are not the only one

355
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,625
who carries a mighty
weapon, vampire.

356
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,833
So Is this the toy
that's going to defeat me?

357
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,166
A nail?

358
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,833
The Shroud of Turin...

359
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:24,583
the Holy Grail...
the Lance of Longinus...

360
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,208
Should I assume that
you're threatening me

361
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,208
with the last of the
holy artifacts of Rome?

362
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,333
Oh Yes...

363
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,958
It still smells of blood and
miracle. The Nail of Helena!

364
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,500
Prepare!!

365
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,458
Anderson! Stop it!

366
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,083
Do you know what that
thing will do to you?

367
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,458
You'll become one
of God's monsters!

368
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:49,375
Maintain your humanity!
Don't succumb to power!

369
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:53,250
Either side, it amounts
to the same deal.

370
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,750
Whether in the name of
the divine or demonic,

371
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,250
you're still a
monster in the end.

372
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,583
Do you intend to use
that scrap of miracle

373
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:04,750
to become nothing but a
scrap of miracle yourself?

374
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,166
This duel... between us...

375
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,416
would you really
push it this far?

376
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,000
Into the realms that
lie beyond mortal life?

377
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,958
A monster such as myself...

378
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,208
A creature of such
weakness that I could not

379
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,416
bear the weight
of a human life...

380
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,625
If I am to be defeated
it must be by a human.

381
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,041
Don't do it, human.

382
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:45,208
Don't become a monster...
A monster like me.

383
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:51,416
I want nothing more
than to be a bayonet.

384
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,083
A bayonet wielded
by the hand of God.

385
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,666
I would have been happy
to have been born a storm,

386
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,958
or a divine threat,
a mighty explosion,

387
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,291
or even a terrible hurricane.

388
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:10,541
A divine force of nature
without a heart or pity.

389
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,583
And if this relic
could transform me

390
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,250
into such a thing...

391
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:19,750
Then I am happy to
abandon my humanity.

392
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,125
Y-You fool...

393
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,666
You bloody fool!

394
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,458
It's thorns... All thorns...!

395
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:56,083
Anderson... What in God's name
have you done to yourself?!

396
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,750
His body is no
longer that of a man's.

397
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,416
The only way either of
us may return to dust,

398
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,500
is to have it gouged out of us--

399
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,875
...the sickness in our hearts.

400
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,833
Father Anderson!

401
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,750
Anderson!

402
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,166
Father Alexander Anderson
was no longer man,

403
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,500
nor demon;
neither day, nor night.

404
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,958
Master!

405
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,000
Ah, Michiko. Guess what?

406
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,583
Daddy's gonna be the
big boss of England again!

407
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,750
Hey, nice ass on that one!

408
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,791
Oh, yeah... that's me!

409
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,208
I'm the sort of serious guy

410
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:54,333
who was born to be
in charge of this world.

411
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,500
And Daddy's got
the balls of brass

412
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,833
that'll help get the job done!

413
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,333
And you know, if
there's anything I can do

414
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,916
to help you out,
you just say the word.

415
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,708
What, you think there's anyone
in Europe who's bigger than me?

416
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,166
Oh, you're pressing
your luck, pal!

417
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,708
That's enough out
of you, you punk!

418
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,708
Now, come here little one...
