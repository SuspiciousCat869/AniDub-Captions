1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,208
Well, boy? Why do
you stand there crying?

2
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,875
Because... the kids
at my school...

3
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,208
They said I was a
murderer's son...

4
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:02,000
And then they said, "Your whole
family fights wars for money!"

5
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,541
Waste of salt,
crying over the truth.

6
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,250
Our men have been mercenaries
for eight generations now.

7
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,750
Going back to your grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa's grandpa.

8
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,625
What do you think your pop
died of in Columbia? The flu?

9
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,125
He knew you were on the
way and needed cash...

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,583
Bit off more than he could
chew... What's that look...?

11
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,291
Didn't your mother
ever tell you?

12
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,291
But... does that mean...

13
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,750
you killed people,
too, Grandpa?!

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,500
Course I killed people, boy.
More than a few.

15
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,166
But, what for...?

16
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,791
What did they do
to deserve... that?!

17
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:46,375
Deserve's got nothing to
do with it... It's a job...

18
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,833
Anyone who found himself
at the end of my gun,

19
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,125
he was fighting for something.

20
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,083
Bring down a government,
or prop one up.

21
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,000
For homeland, or someone else's.

22
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:01,375
For family. For a woman.
Maybe just food and drink.

23
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:06,375
So many damn reasons.
Some good... some bad.

24
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,833
A mercenary doesn't
ask questions, boy...

25
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,000
It's enough to know the other
man's dying for something...

26
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,916
But that reason of his...
whatever it was...

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,958
was it really worth
fighting for...? Maybe...

28
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,041
But who says you
need some epic cause

29
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,708
before you can shed some blood?

30
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,416
Fighting for
filthy lucre's always

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,875
been good enough for me...
Pays the bills.

32
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:35,583
Toss us a bit of coin... and
we will risk life, and limb...

33
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,333
They dangle their spare
change in front of our nose,

34
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,041
and we come running.

35
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,541
We march onto chessboards
all over the world,

36
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,916
for mere pennies.
Kill for 'em. Die for 'em.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,750
But really...? It aint'
about the damn pennies.

38
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,166
We go because we enjoy it.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,458
We fight for money,
'cause fighting

40
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,166
for fun's just too
horrible to admit.

41
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,208
Die for a dollar?
Kill for some kroner?

42
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:06,666
Sign us up. We're the
scum of the earth, boy.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,250
With a legacy like ours,

44
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,833
course they're going
to pick on you at school.

45
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,083
You cry, but I bet you'll come
around one of these days...

46
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,041
You know, the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

47
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:29,375
You were right... It's never
been about the money.

48
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,333
It's always been about the fun.

49
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,791
Hurry up! Grab
anything we can use

50
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,083
to block the doors
and fall back A-SAP!

51
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,166
Yessir!

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,125
Get Squad Two on
the radio! Move, dammit!

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
Help! Help me!
Someone fucking help me!

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,916
Dammit, they're pouring in!

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,416
Keep shooting! Keep shooting!

56
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,833
Our bullets aren't doing shit!

57
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,416
Fall back, now!

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,708
Where's the medic?!

59
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,416
They flanked us--we're
totally cut off! Fuck!

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,125
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,541
This is Squad Two...!

62
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,833
Captain, we're in
the shit down here!

63
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,000
We're not gonna be able
to make it back to you guys!

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,208
Listen, asshole...!

65
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,250
I don't care if
you have to crawl...!

66
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,333
Fall back to the round
table room--that's an order!

67
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,625
This is the easiest
spot to reinforce...

68
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,250
We can hold out for a while.

69
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,208
You have to retreat--you're
a sitting duck out there!

70
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,041
We're not going to close the
barricade until you're back!

71
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,500
Negative, Captain--no can do.

72
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,916
They've torn us all
to hell, myself included.

73
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,625
He's dead, okay?

74
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,291
Cap him again before he
tries to fucking eat us.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,041
Someone... gimmie some water...

76
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,541
We'll hold them off
for as long as we can...

77
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,375
But you gotta close
that barricade now!

78
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,333
Good hunting, Captain.

79
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,125
[speaking French]

80
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,458
Be that way...
you brave bastard...

81
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,750
If you're ready
to die, go for it.

82
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,208
I guess this is adieu.

83
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,916
Been a hell of a ride,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,375
Captain--I don't
regret a thing...

85
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,291
Goodbye!

86
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,833
Let's close up the barricade.

87
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,750
Take this huge fucking table
and add it to the pile...

88
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,041
Seal that goddamn hole already!

89
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,083
But, sir... what
about the others?

90
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,083
All KIA.

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Understood... They'll be missed.

92
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
What's it matter...?!
We're all gonna die tonight!

93
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,000
Shut the fuck up!

94
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,958
How're we supposed to
fight Nazi vampires...?!

95
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,041
It's bullshit...! Integra
and Alucard sold us out!

96
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,166
I'm done--I'm fucking done!

97
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,750
What're you yellin' about...?

98
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,916
There's nowhere to go...
Not that I'm letting you leave.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,875
The hell you aren't...!
I'm outta here!

100
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,958
Face the facts...
This place will be our grave...

101
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,666
This mansion our
tombstone--our gravekeeper

102
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,833
that cast-iron bitch Integra...

103
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,791
And our epitaph...?

104
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,583
"Here lies the badass
Wild Geese--they kicked

105
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,500
beaucoup de Nazi ass
for Queen and crumpets."

106
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,583
But they won't
write any of that...

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,583
Thanks to you,
it's going to read...

108
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,125
"Here lie those gutless pussies
who died pissing themselves

109
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,666
and crying like schoolgirls."

110
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
Man the fuck up, bitch...!

111
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,583
You'll die with honor if I have
to tie you to your damn post!

112
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,416
You take the money
because you like it

113
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,250
and you fight because
you like it--and now...!

114
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,208
You're going to die
like a merc and like it!

115
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,958
Yessir... Yeah...!
Fuck...! Fuck!

116
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,583
Come on--no one ever said dying
tonight was a sure thing...

117
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,208
We got a nice big barricade.

118
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,625
Now... get up and
come lend a hand...

119
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,583
Just in case ma chere
leaves us any of 'em.

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Just keep shooting! Why can't
we hit these assholes?!

121
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,125
Fuck!

122
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,916
These sons-of-bitches
aren't slowing down any!

123
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,416
Don't you die on me, man!

124
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,166
I'm done--we all are.

125
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,625
Keep it together!

126
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,666
That's it! Burn it down!
Kill every bastard you find!

127
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,583
This is the best fight
Hellsing can put up...?

128
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,875
These sad meat-sacks
are your combat elite...?!

129
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,625
God, what a joke!

130
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,583
Flush 'em out.

131
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,333
I've got something
special for you!

132
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:05,000
That's impossible...
I'm back home...?!

133
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Daddy!

134
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,125
I'm so glad you're home, Daddy.

135
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,958
M-Michelle...? It's not...
You're not my daughter...

136
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,125
She's dead...
You're not Michelle...!

137
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,833
Why do you look like her?!

138
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,375
Why do I look like who...?
What's wrong, Daddy?

139
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,375
You're not real...
You're not real...!

140
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,875
Oh, God...

141
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,458
You're another illusion...

142
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,333
You can't be standing here...

143
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,833
but God, you look just
like her! Oh, Michelle...!

144
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,000
Daddy has missed you so much!

145
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,375
Joke's on you, Daddy!

146
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,416
She's worm-food...
and so are you!

147
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,375
Sorry I had to cut
your reunion short!

148
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,041
All right, Sergeant,
what about that one?

149
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,833
Another? Give me a second, ja?

150
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:22,416
It's pretty sour... I'm
guessing... A-negative...!

151
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,375
So? Did I get
it right this time?

152
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,833
That's amazing, sir!

153
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,458
You're quite the
blood connoisseur...

154
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,375
It's like he told you himself!

155
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,041
It has a certain...
"pungent" plate.

156
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,458
Such distinctions
are wasted on me.

157
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,208
Negative has more bite...

158
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,416
And, type-A has a certain
bouquet that I really...

159
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,916
I'll... make those bastards pay.

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,041
Every last... one of 'em...
will fucking die!

161
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,041
I'll tear them to shreds!

162
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,166
Fuck! Fuck!

163
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,916
Sons of bitches...
they got us good...!

164
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
We're losing him...! Come on!

165
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,125
Dammit...! Throw chairs
onto the pile...! All of 'em!

166
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,541
Hurry it up, guys...!

167
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,875
The barricade's
not gonna hold for long!

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,750
You want some, assholes?!

169
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,583
You idiot...!
Get down from there!

170
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,208
Fuck...!

171
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,541
God... We're all
gonna die here...!

172
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,208
Shut up! Keep that
shit to yourself!

173
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,541
Even if we surrender,

174
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,333
they're just gonna torture
the shit out of us...

175
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,791
Then they're gonna eat us
alive... It's fucking over...

176
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,250
Whatever ammo's left,
hand it out!

177
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,458
Here, Captain...

178
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,875
This is it... We're out
of silver bullets...

179
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,375
Damn near out of
regular ones, too.

180
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,583
Come on, kill me...

181
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,583
I can't even shoot
a gun anymore--

182
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
they blew out my fucking eyes!

183
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,458
I take it back, sir--I
didn't mean it...!

184
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,750
I don't wanna die!

185
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,916
Good--we're in agreement.

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,875
Now stop yelling in my damn ear.

187
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,500
'Member that time...?

188
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,041
That airfield in Uganda...?

189
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
Fuckers had us pinned down...

190
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,625
I thought our asses
were done for...

191
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,833
And then the cavalry
came riding in...

192
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,500
Somehow, I don't see
that happening this time.

193
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,333
Don't give up just yet...

194
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,625
Seras is coming... I'm sure
of it. Bet my life on it.

195
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,375
I'm getting damn sick
of those rockets...

196
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,791
How many more until
they run out, huh?

197
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,333
Damage report--now...!

198
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,875
How many wounded?

199
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,250
What are we looking at?!

200
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,750
No...!

201
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,458
Stay with me...!
Don't you fucking die!

202
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,291
Oh, God... I'm exhausted...

203
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,833
I'm just gonna close my eyes...

204
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,833
Go on... You've earned it...
I'll see ya soon.

205
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,500
A direct hit, Lieutenant.
Do we advance?

206
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,666
Not just yet.

207
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,166
Let's soften them up a bit more.

208
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,291
This is our last
Panzerfaust, Lieutanant.

209
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,041
It's our trump card.

210
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,625
I could care less...!

211
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,500
You take that Panzerfaust...

212
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,333
and you launch it straight
up their mercenary asses!

213
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,250
Jawohl.

214
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,875
What're they waiting for?

215
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,583
Schiess los!

216
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,875
It's the bitch who
downed my zeppelin...!

217
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
You're dead!

218
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Captain...?

219
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,541
Of course she's here--I
told you she'd come...

220
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,833
Ma chere is
reporting for duty...

221
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,666
Might as well smoke 'em
if you got 'em, ladies...

222
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,125
Time for the main event!

223
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,250
God, she's perfect,
isn't she...?

224
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,750
I should have kissed her
when I had the chance...

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,833
You're a damn fool,
Pip Bernadotte.

226
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Outta rounds...?

227
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,500
Or are you surrendering?

228
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,375
Tough talk from
the only Nazi left!

229
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,125
Trust me, you'll love this!

230
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,875
This... this isn't real...!

231
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,916
It's just an illusion...
It isn't real...!

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,875
It's not reaaaaaaaal!

233
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,625
Don't tell me that Seras girl
has been acting up yet again.

234
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,625
Afraid so.

235
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,833
She hit one of the boys

236
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,208
with a rock for taking
a toy away from her.

237
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,500
Just a memory...!
That's all it is...!

238
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,041
The teachers all say it's
like talking to a wall.

239
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,625
Probably still traumatized
from, well, you know...

240
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,250
Yes... but if she doesn't start
getting along with others...

241
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,583
I'll happily send her packing
for the good of the orphanage.

242
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,083
I'm not going to break.

243
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,333
I want more.

244
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,708
That's all very noble,
but, well...

245
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,083
isn't there anything
you'd rather do?

246
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,375
No.

247
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,458
At least pretend
to think it over.

248
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,750
Your father was a fine
policeman--one of the best.

249
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,958
But there's a world of
possibilities out there for you.

250
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,500
I just hate to see you
squander your potential.

251
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,916
That's ancient history...!

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,416
We're going to the very bottom!

253
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
Listen to your mum...

254
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,666
Stay in the closet... please...

255
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,833
Don't come out of here,
no matter what.

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,125
Mommy... Mommy...!

257
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,375
Oi, piggy-piggy.
Whassa matter? Come on, mate...

258
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,708
Squeal like a pig, why don't ya?

259
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,416
One bitty squeal!

260
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,166
Shoulda had him
squeal before you shot.

261
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,791
Nah, this one's special!
He's so fucking good at it!

262
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,083
Squealing like a pig's
what earned him this!

263
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,041
He stuck that
badge-wearing snout

264
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,208
of his in where it
didn't belong!

265
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,250
You were just for fun.

266
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,250
Big mistake!

267
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,750
My eye! That filthy little cunt!

268
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,000
You can bitch later.
We have to get out of here.

269
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,333
It hurts, goddamn it!
Gimmie a second!

270
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,375
You ain't the one
with a fork in ya!

271
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,583
Lemme toss one
in the wifey first...

272
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,291
Fuck you want? She's dead.

273
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,958
Still warm, innit?
Hell, I've fucked worse.

274
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,458
Good morning, Seras...
It's time to wake up...

275
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,416
Did somebody have a nightmare?

276
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:22,125
You can do better than that...!
Now...! Scream!

277
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,708
Not so tough anymore!

278
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,083
I love the way you squirm
beneath my boot heel!

279
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,625
God, you're such a weakling...!

280
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,041
And I was so sure you were
going to be a challenge.

281
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,458
You're trash...
Like all those men I killed.

282
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,583
Now... how to end this?

283
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,750
Maybe I should just
cut your head off...

284
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,500
I've seen what's in there.
This is a kindness.

285
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,291
Now, die!

286
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,875
You first, bitch!

287
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,875
What...?!

288
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,541
Leave her alone!

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,291
That's enough of
your shit... Stay down.

290
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,625
Hey, Captain! Hurry it up!

291
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,208
The mansion's a loss...!
We gotta go!

292
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,041
My pleasure.

293
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,666
Captain... Burnadotte...
what're you...?

294
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,791
Don't talk.

295
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,625
Captain Bernadotte...

296
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:20,833
Please, run away...
Save yourself...

297
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,625
Just leave me behind...!

298
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,125
I'm being a gentleman...
Don't talk back.

299
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,875
Shit--we got a live one!

300
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,541
You asshole!

301
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,541
Oh my God...

302
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,750
Captain, you're...!

303
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,583
Yeah...!

304
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,333
Bullseye...!

305
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,583
Who's laughing now, hero?

306
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,791
Captain Bernadotte...
Say something!

307
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,250
Jesus... what a bloody pair...

308
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,208
What'd she do?!

309
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,708
You come charging
in to save me...

310
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:45,750
and now I have to save
you... What the hell...

311
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,666
Why didn't you run away...?

312
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,541
Finally stole that kiss!

313
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,083
Took you being blind
to do it, but I got it.

314
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,541
Bernadotte...

315
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,875
Hey, now...
What's with the tears...?

316
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,791
I had a damn good run, Seras.

317
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,375
Now, suck my blood...

318
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,083
Take me into yourself
so we can win this fight.

319
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,833
I told you...

320
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,666
Don't waste your tears...
on a mercenary...

321
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,625
You lost those pretty blue eyes
of yours trying to save me.

322
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,458
You lost your arm, too...
What a waste...

323
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,541
Foolish, ma chere...

324
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,291
Another time, maybe...
another place...

325
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,833
You're a rare woman, Seras...

326
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:47,041
I die so that she
can live... Alright.

327
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,416
Oh God...

328
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
The Captain... is... dead?

329
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:56,791
Just breaks your
heart... doesn't it?

330
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:00,000
He was a bug, buzzing
around my face...

331
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,666
That's why I had to
swat him down... Like a gnat.

332
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,125
By the way...

333
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,958
if you thought you'd
killed all of my soldiers

334
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,291
in the mansion, you were right.

335
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,041
But, we've had
some late arrivals.

336
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,583
Fuck, more of them?!

337
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:17,916
She brought back-up!

338
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,708
Let's take these bugs...

339
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,041
and crush them
between our fingers!

340
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,791
Such is the death
they deserve...!

341
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,833
The death of an insect!

342
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:41,250
Not again...! Enough
of this mind-fucking!

343
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:45,375
You called him a gnat,
didn't you...

344
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,666
You called him... a gnat...!

345
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,458
You'll pay for this.

346
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,916
You will pay!

347
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:09,125
You're going to pay...
You'll pay!

348
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:22,541
Thank you, Captain...
Rest in peace.

349
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,541
But not yet...

350
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,625
Not yet!

351
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,958
What's going on...?

352
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,041
She broke Zorin's spell...!

353
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,083
I did what you told me.

354
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,875
And in return you're
going to help me...

355
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,916
send these Nazis to hell!

356
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,833
What? How is this possible...?!

357
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:50,083
They're trembling...! These
battle-hardened Waffen-SS...

358
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,333
these vampires, who charged
into gunfire and grenades

359
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,291
without a moment's
hesitation...!

360
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,958
They're ready to piss themselves
at the sight of a girl!

361
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:05,333
One stupid, weak little girl
who's more dead than alive!

362
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,416
What the hell's
going on...?! Verdammt!

363
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,416
Open fire! Everyone--shoot!

364
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,708
It's not possible...
It's bullscheise!

365
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,875
She's cutting through
my reinforcements...

366
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,750
God, she's headed
straight for me!

367
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,166
Even if I were about to die...

368
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,916
I wouldn't drink a single
goddamn drop of your evil blood!

369
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,750
I don't want you...
inside of me!

370
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,125
Let's go... deeper!

371
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:49,000
That's it...!
Even deeper... Yes, take it...

372
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:51,166
Show me your pain!

373
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:56,875
What am I looking at...?
These aren't her memories...

374
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,458
What's going on here...?

375
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:03,250
This isn't right!--everything's
in disarray...!

376
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,500
Why can't I go any
deeper into her head?!

377
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:09,583
It's like these fucking
memories are protecting her!

378
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,208
It's him...!
That arrogant mercenary...!

379
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,791
That goddamned gnat!

380
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,333
Blood is the currency of
the soul, the vehicle of life.

381
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:25,041
Having blood offered...

382
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:29,458
is a very different
experience... than taking it!

383
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,666
Are you okay...? You look awful!

384
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,916
How are you here?

385
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,250
Don't act so surprised,
Zorin...! Whoa!

386
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:42,625
As they say... I am
everywhere...! And nowhere!

387
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:46,250
I am here...! To deliver a
message from the Major...

388
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,208
Straight from our
fearless leader's mouth!

389
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:53,125
"Every soldier dreams of leading
the charge against the foe.

390
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,583
Such is their reward.

391
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,416
But the long-suffering
commander--

392
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,583
what is his reward
when they fail?

393
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,791
When they go against
orders, lose men,

394
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,833
and prove themselves inept?"

395
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,291
That's the message...!

396
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,875
Under normal circumstances,

397
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,833
they would have burned you to
a crisp long before now... but!

398
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,416
The Major and Doc
got their hands

399
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,208
on this fascinating new toy,

400
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,375
and they don't have
time to deal with you...

401
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:19,666
And Seras seems to have you
pretty well taken care of.

402
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,208
Such a paradox...!

403
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,541
This monster is Seras Victoria,
yet not Seras Victoria.

404
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,833
Rest assured, she'll be ending
your unlife any moment now...

405
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,416
Auf Wiedersehen!

406
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,708
How does it feel having someone
fuck with your head...?!

407
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:47,000
How does it feel, you bitch?!

408
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,458
Look at her...

409
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,708
How can that be... the same
sweet girl we knew before...?

410
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,791
I'm heading out.

411
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,833
Heading out?
But where is there to go?

412
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:20,416
He told me... to drink him in...

413
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,333
so that we could win this fight.

414
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:31,833
And now... I think the Captain
and I are only getting started.

415
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,208
I-Inside...?

416
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,291
Right here... Captain...

417
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:42,291
This is where you
made your last stand.

418
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:46,375
You're dead...
but you're not gone...

419
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,500
'Cause you're
inside of that girl.

420
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,375
One last thing...

421
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,250
Thanks, sir.

422
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,583
Sir!

423
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:31,375
The dawn is finally breaking...
come to slay the night.

424
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:35,416
Undaunted by the light of
the sun, she speeds away...

425
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,416
as though fired
from a bow drawn taut.

426
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,625
She makes for London...

427
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,500
For a raid upon the morn!

428
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:59,708
This is it... What my
eyes have so longed for...

429
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,458
Ah, what a sight...

430
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,166
For what it's worth,
Zorin's dead, sir.

431
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,500
Killed by a gnat.

432
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:15,458
Well, that's hardly a surprise.
Watch how it burns, boy.

433
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:18,750
Like the end of the
Gotterdammerung...

434
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,750
Major, you're such a meanie...

435
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,750
You bring a whole army with you,
but really they're nothing

436
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,875
but kindling for
your personal bonfire.

437
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,208
What is hell, if not a bonfire?

438
00:44:35,541 --> 00:44:37,458
"I am become death..."

439
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:44,208
I am the serpent,
devouring myself.

440
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:48,250
I take and am taken
from without end.

441
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:51,000
How many days of
wild aspiration...

442
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,375
how many nights
of black entropy...

443
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:57,208
have I slain to
witness this triumph...?

444
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,208
Our destruction approaches...

445
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:04,416
together with our victory!

446
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:41,625
A private army of Nazis
from Germany's Third Reich.

447
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,250
"The Last Battalion".

448
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:48,125
A division of Waffen-SS panzer
grenadiers turned into vampires.

449
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,875
Five-hundred seventy-two
of their number remain.

450
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:57,625
The knights of the ninth
airborne mobile crusade,

451
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:01,583
sent forth by the Vatican to
serve Archbishop Maxwell.

452
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,958
Two-thousand nine-hundred

453
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,541
and seventy-five of
their number remain.

454
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:09,583
Her Majesty's Hellsing
Organization of England.

455
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,125
Only three of
their number remain.

456
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:17,250
Release control
art-restriction level zero.

457
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:21,208
Acknowledged.
As you wish, my master.

458
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,541
Return to our shores,

459
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:33,375
and bury our foes under
the darkness within you!

460
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,750
Now!
