00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,000
Zeppelin 3 is going down!

[GER SOLDIER 1] Zeppelin 2,
The Alfred Rosenburg

is under heavy fire!

8
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,750
[GER SOLDIER 2] We've lost
contact with our ground forces!

00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,083
[GER SOLDIER 3 7th Brigade
has disappeared from radar...

00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,541
Communication has been lost!

11
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,583
[GER SOLDIER 4]
What happened?

12
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,041
Were they annihilated?

13
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,000
[GER SOLDIER 5] What the
hell's going on down there?

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:37,916
[GER SOLDIER 5]
Major, sir!

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,583
[GER SOLDIER 6]
Your orders sir!

16
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,375
[GER SOLDIER 6]
Major please!

17
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,583
We need orders!

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,958
[MAJOR]
You're very irritating.

19
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,666
Simmer down gentlemen.

20
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,958
Why don't you shut up, 

21
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,791
relax and enjoy
the thrilling climax!

22
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,166
So your subordinates
have been brutally killed.

23
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,833
It's no excuse for wailing

24
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,125
like a bunch of
cornered little virgins...

25
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,916
Captain?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,958
[GER CAPTAIN] 
Sir!

27
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,333
Go distribute
firearms and ammunition

28
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,458
to any crewmembers
healthy enough to stand.

29
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,125
If they can't stand,
give them grenades.

30
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,083
But sir,
we don't have

31
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,791
enough guns and
bullets anymore!

32
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,333
Not for the
whole crew!

33
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,041
Then arm them
with pipes,

34
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,500
scraps of metal...
whatever's handy.

35
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,750
Just arm and
assemble my soldiers.

36
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,166
Once that's
taken care of,

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,666
we'll begin a full
assault on the enemy.

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,208
How about it?

39
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,166
Sound like fun?

40
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,875
We'll charge their
ranks while singing

41
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,458
a jaunty rendition of
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

[MAJOR]
Oh, that's good.

I've had enough...

49
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,250
We are not the S.S.!

50
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,500
We are the German Navy!

We have only
followed your orders

in the hopes of
defeating the English Dogs!

53
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,750
But this is not war...

54
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,708
This is madness!

55
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,583
I will not allow any
more of my men to die!

56
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,375
[MAJOR] To come this
far yet still not grasp

00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,291
the true nature
of this struggle.

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,625
So be it.

59
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,750
Insubordination is
the flower of war.

He's hard to hit!

64
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,583
How you managed
to join the S.S.

65
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,791
is beyond me.

66
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,166
Your aim is as
terrible as ever Major.

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000

Oh... Shoot him.

Spare us his
defeatist attitude.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,125
Go arm every soldier
on board, Ensign.

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,333
Is that understood?

72
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,500
The fate of those
who will not obey

73
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,583
is in your capable hands.

74
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,875
It is time to teach
another lesson of war.

75
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,166
"All who live by the sword,

76
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,458
shall inevitably
die by the sword."

77
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,666
Everything is going
exactly as planned.

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,625
By the time they realize their
destinies never left my palm,

79
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,333
my fist will have already
closed in around them.

Oh... of course.

It's me...

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,416
[YOUNG VLAD] Lord, I would
not kneel in prayer

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,291
for my salvation.

87
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,416
[ARUCARD] Fight!

Fight for the glory
of your God!

89
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,125
God does not help
those who kneel before him.

90
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,083
God does not save
those who pray for mercy.

91
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,250
For those are
not true prayers.

92
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,833
Would you beg in the
presence of your Lord?

93
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,666
Your impiety begs
only for death.

94
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,125
True prayer is
forged in battle.

95
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,958
Dazzle your Lord with your
prayer, and you shall know Him.

96

You shall know Jerusalem!

After the tearing,
the crushing,

98
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,000
the breaking
of men's bones...

99
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,333
when the fruits of our
prayers lie at our feet...

100
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,500
God will descend
from his throne on high

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:37,375
to bring judgment upon his
wretched and pitiful servants!

102
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,541
Tell me, did your
promises come to pass?

103
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,708
Where's your God?

104
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,833
Where's your kingdom?

105
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,291
[ARUCARD]
What's the matter?

106
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
Answer me, King.

107
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,833
Mad King...

108
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,791
They're all dead.

109
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,291
Every last soul dead...

110
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:10,458
In service to you
and to your promises.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,625
For your prayers.

112
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,583
For your paradise.

113
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,833
For your God...

114
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,416
All were sacrificed.

115
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,333
Enemies and allies...

116
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,041
The people you
swore to protect...

117
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,583
The country you
would rule...

118
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:34,166
Men, women, old,
and young...

119
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,125
even yourself.

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,791
[MAJOR] Irredeemable.

121
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:44,750
You are truly a monster
beyond all salvation, Count.

122
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,875
[ANDERSON] That doesn't mean
we just give up now, does it?

123
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,875
[SERAS] Master!

124
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,666
[ARUCARD] That voice...

125
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
calling to me...

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,791
[ARUCARD] Oh... of course.

It's you...

[INTEGRA] It's burning...

00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,208
His whole world,
is burning away.

[ARUCARD] Stop yelling,
Police Girl.

140
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,500
Why must
you always insist

141
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,208
on making such
an awful racket?

142
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,250
You're liable
to wake the dead.

143
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,500
My Master...

144
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,708
[ARUCARD] Anderson.

145
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,291
There was a moment when

146
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,625
you could have
defeated me...

147
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,583
you had your chance...

148
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,458
As the sun set
on that barren field...

149
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,916
on that fateful evening
over 5 centuries ago...

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,166
I would have let
you claim my heart.

151
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,166
But now, your
moment has passed.

152
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,583
[ARUCARD]
You cannot defeat me.

153
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,166
Only a human
can destroy a monster.

154
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,083
Only a human
could dare hope to.

[ARTHUR]
Integra.

157
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,125
There are many immortal
monsters who roam this earth.

158
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,041
When I look at them,
I wonder...

159
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:53,833
Were they created out
of a desire for immortality?

160
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,208
Many of them desire war.

161
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:02,333
I've seen them roaming
the bloodiest battlefields.

162
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,875
But in their battle cries
I hear a craving...

163
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,916
I think, they cry
out for death.

164
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,041
Nosferatu: the No-Life King.

165
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,791
His castle, his kingdom,
it's people, his loved ones.

166
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,208
Even his very identity.

167
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,291
Everything was lost.

168
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,041
All that remains
is a pale shadow,

169
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,875
wandering from
battle to battle.

170
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,708
I have come to
believe, Integra,

171
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,416
that those
frightening immortals

172
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,458
are in fact,
frail sobbing children.

173
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,125
[heart beating]

174
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,833
You and I
are the same!

175
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,750
[gasping]

176
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,916
You are me!

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,541
I was just the same!

178
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,625
Don't you understand this
is how I became what I am!

179
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,500
[Arucard crying]

180
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,750
[Anderson laughing]

181
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,875
[ANDERSON] 
Demons do not cry.

182
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,750
Are these the tears
of a long dead child?

183
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,666
Demons do not cry.

184
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,333
You became a demon

185
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,916
because you couldn't
cry anymore, right?

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,166
Humans cry, and when
their tears finally run dry

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,875
there's nothing left,
but a demon or a monster...

188
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,750
And one final
prayer for death.

189
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,166
So laugh, demon.

190
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,166
Laugh that arrogant laugh
of yours, and remember:

191
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,708
I beat you to it.

192
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,541
So how long
will it be then?

193
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,583
How long before
you are no longer

194
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,208
cursed to
walk the earth?

195
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,583
[ARUCARD] Until the
weight of my past

196
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:02,333
is shattered by my
oncoming future...

197
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,250
It shouldn't be
too long, my nemesis.

198
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,125
I'll see you in Hell.

199
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,208
[laughing]

200
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,000
[ANDERSON] Who is that?

201
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,375
The voices of children?

202
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,041
[ANDERSON] I can hear them...

203
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,041
The children...

204
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
They're all playing and...

205
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,541
I should go...

206
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
They're all waiting.

207
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,750
It's...

208
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,625
Is that really
you Maxwell...?

209
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,875
You mustn't cry,
children...

210
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,291
Say your prayers...

211
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,791
before you sleep...

212
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,000
Amen, children.

213
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,583
Amen.

214
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,250
[WALTER] Amen.

215
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,291
[gasps]

216
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,583
[INTEGRA] Walter!

217
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,500
Is that you?

218
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,083
[WALTER] Trash.

219
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,291
The dead are
nothing but refuse...

220
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,041
And there is no need
for anyone to mourn filth.

221
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,500
Isn't that right...

222
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,291
Integra?

223
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,166
Walter...

224
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,958
Walter, sir!

225
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,291
What have they
done to you?

226
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,541
What have
they done to me?

227
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,875
Obviously I've been
captured, brainwashed,

228
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,541
and turned into a vampire.

229
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,875
Then forced
against my will

230
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,541
to tear my friends and
masters to bloody shreds.

231
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,500
Was that the sort
of explanation

232
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,541
you were
hoping for, Seras?

233
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,166
I answer to no
man's will but my own.

234
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,916
I am myself in
mind, body, and soul:

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,500
I am Walter C. Dolnez,
The Angel of Death.

236
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,166
And as the dawn light cuts
through the darkness...

237
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,750
so shall I reap each of
your souls in bloody turn.

238
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,000
[INTEGRA] Walter...

239
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,458
Enough, Walter!

240
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,250
Do not use that name!

241
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
[SERAS] Don't!

242
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,500
[YUMIE] I'll kill you! 
Kill you! Kill you!

243
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,458
You know nothing of what it
means to serve a master!

244
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,458
Nothing!

245
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,250
[HEINKEL] Shukuji!

246
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,958
[YUMIE] Shimabara
quick-draw attack!

247
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,958
Shoki! You're dead!

248
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,166
[WALTER] You're
the one who's dead...

249
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,250
[Yumie gasps]

250
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,708
Without a scream...

251
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,500
or a single slash...

252
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,083
I've nothing left...

253
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,625
And my world
tumbles to it's end...

254
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,750
[HEINKEL] Yumie!

255
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,875
There's nothing
you can do to stop me.

256
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:20,416
And no one will stand
in the way of my treasons.

257
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,500
[WALSH] Sir Islands.

258
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,000
[ISLANDS]
Has the Queen

259
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,041
been escorted to one
of the safe houses?

260
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,500
[WALSH] Of course.

261
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,541
And the nuclear submarine
Nereid should be here soon.

262
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,958
If things take a turn
for the worse

263
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,958
we can smuggle her all the
way back to the Americas.

264
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,625
What's London
looking like?

265
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,333
[ISLANDS] Same as
it was, total chaos.

266
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,708
Our last official field
report was from

267
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,666
Sir Penwood if you
can believe it.

268
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,666
Penwood, huh?

269
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,666
[ISLANDS] Yes.

270
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,666
Wonders never cease.

271
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,250
Such an idiot.

272
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,666
I knew all
that bluster

273
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,708
would be
the death of him.

274
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,708
I've known
some fools in my time

275
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,875
But very few
men have raised

276
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:17,125
foolishness into
an art form.

277
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,458
Damn!

278
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,375
These villains dare
rob us of good men.

279
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,250
They must be made to
answer for all their crimes!

280
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,708
Exactly.

281
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
Those undead
Nazi bastards

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,666
are going to pay.

283
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,875
And we'll
make them...

284
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,541
Whatever else
that much is certain.

285
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,875
Thanks to
the shock troops

286
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:34,875
you were so
kind enough

287
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,625
to drop in earlier,

288
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,958
we should
be able to

289
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,083
clear all the vampires
from our outlying bases

290
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,166
within...
lets be generous

291
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,208
and give it
half a day.

292
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,833
It's London
that's the real problem.

293
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,208
As it currently stands,
we're barely holding

294
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,333
our makeshift blockade
around the city.

295
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,750
There's also been
talk that the Queen

296
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,083
and her advisors
are considering

297
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,541
a final,
nuclear solution.

298
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,041
Madness...

299
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,375
Yes.

300
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,625
But three trident
SLBMs from the Nereid

301
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,916
is all it would take

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,375
to burn London
to the ground.

303
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,541
But only as a
last resort, obviously.

304
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,916
A nuclear attack

305
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,291
on her own subjects
is unthinkable.

306
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,375
And Her Majesty
still holds faith.

307
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,375
The battle of
London is not over.

308
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,375
Her soldiers still
fight for the capital.

309
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,416
[ISLANDS] Yes...

310
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,458
Arthur's daughter...

311
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,583
Arthur's daughter
still fights.

312
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,875
So, Sir Islands...

313
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,875
Concerning this traitor
at the Round Table...

314
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,125
Back when some

315
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,166
of our junior members
suspected Penwood

316
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,833
you were quite vocal
in your defense of him.

317
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,541
[ISLANDS] I was.

318
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,208
[ISLANDS] He was a fool.

319
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,708
He was also a man of
character and honor.

320
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,125
He would
have rather died

321
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,458
than betray the
Round Table Council.

322
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,916
Then who's
the traitor then?

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,750
You and I are all
that's left of the Council.

324
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,291
Is it you?

325
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,791
Or is it me?

326
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,583
[ISLANDS] Oh,
don't be absurd.

327
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,791
If I had turned traitor,

328
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,250
I imagine
I would of filed

329
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,500
a notice with the
main office by now.

330
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,125
There is something
that's been gnawing at me.

331
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,791
When Integra's father,
Arthur, died I gave a warning.

332
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,416
Arthur's younger brother
Richard was dangerous.

333
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,791
He would be willing
to kill Integra

334
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:34,083
to inherit
the family title.

335
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,166
"Keep your
eyes on Richard.

336
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,458
And don't take
your eyes off Integra."

337
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,583
That was the
warning I gave

338
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:46,458
to the Hellsing family's
butler, Walter Dolnez.

339
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,416
That night, the attack came,

340
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,833
but where was
Walter Dolnez?

341
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,666
What was he up to?

342
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,625
Arthur understood
the threat Arucard posed,

343
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,625
and took great care
sealing him away in his cell.

344
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,041
But on that
night, Integra,

345
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,041
in a desperate
attempt to flee Richard,

346
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,750
released Arucard...

347
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,333
Becoming the
creature's master.

348
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,416
What if...

349
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,916
that had been
the plan all along?

350
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,875
One could argue
that this was the seed

351
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,583
from which all that
chaos originated.

352
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,666
And if that's true,
when did his betrayal begin?

353
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,250
Ten years ago?

354
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,791
Twenty?

355
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:33,000
Or perhaps it was
September, 1944.

356
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,375
In Warsaw...

357
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,875
[HEINKEL]
He tore my face...

358
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,541
Why not just kill me?

359
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,083
"Don't interfere"?

360
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,708
Is that what
you're saying?

361
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,208
He took pity on me...

362
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,208
How dare he!

363
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,666
Am I not worthy of
a soldiers respect?!

364
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,916
Have I fallen so low,
that I am not even worth

365
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,833
considering as a threat?

366
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,875
[PRIEST 1] Heinkel!

367
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,166
[PRIEST 2] Heinkel,
are you all right?

368
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,458
[HEINKEL] I'm just fine!

369
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,333
Is Yumie alright?

370
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,500
[PRIEST 2] Yumie ...

371
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,375
I'm afraid uhhh...

372
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:37,125
[HEINKEL] 
No... Yumie...

373
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:43,666
Dammit! Dammit!
Dammit! Dammit!

374
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,333
That bastard!
That bastard!

375
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,000
[Heinkel crying]

376
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,500
[HEINKEL] Your gun!

377
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:55,333
Give me your gun!

378
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,041
[PRIEST 3] You're in
no condition for this!

379
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,333
Do you think I care?

380
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,500
Do you?!

381
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,916
He's dead!

382
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,333
I'm gonna kill
the fucking butler.

383
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,875
Do you understand me?

384
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,333
I'll kill him.
Kill him!

385
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,250
[WALTER] Get up!

386
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,000
Stand and face me Arucard...

387
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:29,000
lap dog of Hellsing!

388
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,041
[Arucard laughing]

389
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,791
[ARUCARD]
Angel of Death...

390
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,916
Weren't you the one
who said Englishmen

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,666
look forward
to growing old?

392
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,583
You've seemed to have
abandoned your maturity.

393
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,541
Truly a
terrible shame.

394
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,583
You were such
a lovely old man

395
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,208
It pains me to
see how retched

396
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,333
and ugly
you've become.

397
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,625
Your body and
soul corrupted.

398
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:05,958
A dark reaper
to the very core.

399
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,250
[WALTER]
Yes.

400
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:11,166
This world is after all,
a violent, fleeting dream.

401
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,041
And as the dawn breaks,

402
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,625
I shall be ready
to reap the earth!

403
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,500
Stand and
face me, Arucard!

404
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,958
You know damn well...

405
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,083
that the two
of us are dogs.

406
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,000
We don't bark
unless we're told.

407
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,958
[ARUCARD]
Your orders...

408
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,041
Give me your
orders, Master!

409
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,250
I can kill...

410
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,625
I can slaughter him

411
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,041
without the
slightest hesitation

412
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,333
or hint of regret.

413
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,041
I am a monster
in his cage.

414
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,416
And, you are...

415
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,250
Integra.

416
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,625
My hand holds
the weapon...

417
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,791
My sight finds
the target...

418
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,000
I can chamber
the round...

419
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,083
I can pull back
on the bolt

420
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,750
and I can
release the safety...

421
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,041
But you...

422
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,666
it is your will that
commands the killing.

423
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,750
So what will you do?

424
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:25,083
What are your orders,

Annihilate all forces

00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,541
Yes, My Master.

of my years of service!

However this

You're nothing
but my enemy now.

You are Hellsing's enemy.

You are Britain's enemy!

You are nothing
but a traitor.

It is my pleasure
to defeat you.

460
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,583
To destroy you.

461
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:30,208
[MAJOR] Well said, Integra

To think I called
you an amateur!

It appears I owe
you an apology.

At long last, you have
become worthy of this battle.

494
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:45,250
Farewell, and may
we never meet again.

Ladies, Welcome.

[INTEGRA]
Obnoxious Jokers.

497
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,416
I've had enough.

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,708
Call your bet indeed...

[ARUCARD]
Remarkable women,

500
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,833
don't you think?

501
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,750
[laughing]

502
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,125
They are mine now.

503
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,291
Mine alone...

504
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,875
My dear Master
to whom I belong...

505
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,791
my darling servant,
mine to mold.

506
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:32,083
They are lost
to you forever.

507
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,083
Did I make
you angry?

508
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,583
Get angry!

509
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,791
This foolish plot
of yours, ends today!

510
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,333
Eat this!

You once told me...

That true
Immortals don't exist.

514
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,375
You might be on
to something.

515
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,458
So let's put
it to the test!

516
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,166
Let's keep
killing you

stay down.

So what's next?

00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:23,875
What clever
little trick

524
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,208
do you have
for me, Arucard?

525
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,333
Offer some proof
of your worth...

526
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,541
Did you forget

527
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,750
who made
that gun for you?

528
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,625
That gun was meant
to defeat Anderson.

529
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,708
And I'm no Anderson.

Ah! It's him!

Oh dear, what

Eh... that's right!

I recall he was
eaten by the dog.

Now, with the dog dead,

00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,958
he's able to manifest
himself once more.

to give out...

I rebelled knowing
this would happen!

I can't die before 
I finish killing him!

567
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,666
Just as I thought,
we put him

568
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,875
through the process
too quickly.

569
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,375
It was risky surgery
to begin with.

570
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,875
[MAJOR] Nonsense.

571
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:11,583
We gave him everything
we had to give.

572
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,250
And in return
for these gifts

573
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,708
We've taken from him
everything of value.

574
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:22,833
His life, his master,
his honor, his loyalty...

575
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,333
and yet it still
wasn't enough!

576
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,333
He lives
on borrowed time,

577
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:33,375
and we are his loan sharks,
waiting to collect our interest.

578
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,708
But time grows thin,

579
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:39,916
and when the rooster crows,
he shall be no more.

580
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,500
We have all invested

581
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,750
the last 50 years
preparing for this fight.

582

50 years to prepare for
one glorious night

of battle against
the mighty Arucard.

The cards
have been dealt,

585

and it's all
down to one hand,

586
00:36:56,541 --> 00:37:01,208
winner takes all, and his
opponent holds the Joker.

Show us what you're
made of, Walter C. Dolnez!

588
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,166
[ARUCARD] That was
very good shooting.

Well done,

590
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:25,125
Your talents were obviously
wasted inside that dog.

And that's Checkmate!

592
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,500
You've broken
my new toy...

Still!

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,416
I've got you cornered.

595
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,208
This is it Arucard!

596
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:57,958
Yes, it's time to put
an end to this dance.

597
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,625
The heart...

598
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,875
it's not over
without the heart...

599
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,125
His heart...

600
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,291
Just his heart!

601
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,208
It's wrong...

602
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,291
No...

603
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,125
It isn't him!

604
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,166
[ARUCARD]
That's right.

605
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,583
Good try though.

606
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,583
Who knew that he
would be so useful?

607
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,458
But it turns out that

608
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:31,333
dog food will
do in a pinch.

609
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,000
Well come on then,
Angel of Death.

610
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,416
Stand up.

611
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,458
You're not going
to let this all end

612
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:47,000
with just one punch,
are you kid?

613
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:47,958
Whatever it is you did

614
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,916
to change
yourself into this,

615
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,875
it doesn't
seem too reliable.

616
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,333
You're not regenerating.

617
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:55,291
You're just wearing

618
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,291
that body
down to nothing.

619
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,333
So what's the plan then?

620
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,250
I mean, look at you,

621
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,541
you've burned through
the height of your power.

622
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,125
You're not
going to be able

623
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,708
to hold that
form much longer.

624
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:09,083
So where do
you go from here?

625
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,791
Back to the old man?

626
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,291
Or maybe, you'll slip
further back into childhood?

627
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,708
Hello little Walter.

628
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,833
Haven't seen that
face in 60 years.

629
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:22,958
[WALLY] 
Bastard...

630
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,166
What sort of game
are you playing?

631
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,541
Answer me!

632
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,375
What game
am I playing?

633
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,625
Really?

634
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,541
No, this game
is all yours.

635
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,833
I'm just better at
playing it, foolish child.

636
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,791
The trappings of
mortal forms mean nothing to me.

637
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:44,833
I explained all of this
to you 60 years ago.

638
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,166
And still you
thought your betrayal

639
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,583
had the slightest
chance of succeeding?

640
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:54,375
Not a very good
listener, are you?

641
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,833
It hardly matters.

642
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,541
When all is said and done,
this is really nothing more

643
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,833
than a childish squabble.

644
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,125
And since your form now so
perfectly reflects this,

645
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:08,166
I felt it would be rude
not to follow suit.

646
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,208
It's the nature of battle.

647
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,708
Until you defeat
what cowers you,

648
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,208
you cannot truly
become yourself.

649
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:18,625
But to do that,
you must break the shackles

650
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,000
that hold you down.

651
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,375
Just as I did.

652
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,166
Just as Anderson,
and even the Major did.

653
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,291
We have all gone through

654
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:28,791
the metamorphosis
you're experiencing.

655
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,208
From the moment we met
you wanted to fight me.

656
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,875
Otherwise, how could
you ever move forward?

657
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,291
Would you even know how?

658
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,750
Were you afraid
of becoming useless?

659
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,083
Were you afraid
of getting old?

660
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,583
Or maybe you were afraid
of being forgotten...

661
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,708
Little John Bull...

662
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:49,833
Don't make me laugh!

663
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,333
You're the one
playing games.

664
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,708
Look at you!

665
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:57,041
60 years and in your heart
you're still the same.

666
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,458
Just a scrawny brat!

667
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,833
Now come on...

668
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,875
show me what you got.
