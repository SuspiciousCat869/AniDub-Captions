1
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,708
This orphanage is my home now.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Father... why have I been
brought to this place?

3
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,541
Why did my parents
abandon me to the Church?

4
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,666
Is it because I'm a bastard?

5
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,958
I don't need them, anyhow...

6
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,666
I don't need parents...
I don't even need any friends.

7
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,000
I will become great.

8
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,708
And once I've done so...

9
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:24,416
I'll have my revenge on
all who have wronged me...!

10
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,125
Your Excellency...

11
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,958
Your Excellency...

12
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,625
It's time to wake up, Bishop...!

13
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,125
Please, Bishop Maxwell...!

14
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,083
I'm happy to report that
Anderson and the paladins

15
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,708
who went on ahead with him
have captured Integra Hellsing,

16
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,458
He engaged the Last Battalion
during the course of their task.

17
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,500
Well of course he has...

18
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,166
This after I asked
him not to engage.

19
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,416
Just look how it burns...

20
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,583
Il purgatorio...

21
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,000
London has been humbled,
your Excellency--

22
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,333
not since the Blitz has their
capitol known such fear...

23
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,291
The number of dead
are beyond estimation...

24
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,083
And as that tally increases,
so do the ranks of the undead.

25
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,916
God has punished them...

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,833
How they've clung
to their heresy

27
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,958
in this Babylon on the Thames...

28
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,916
It serves them right.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,791
Indeed it does.

30
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,208
And America?

31
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,541
Chaos, Your Excellency.

32
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,416
The White House
is burning even now.

33
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,791
It seems a
presidential aide turned

34
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,166
into a vampire--during a
Cabinet meting, no less.

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,541
Fourteen people
were slaughtered,

36
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,500
including the
president himself.

37
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,958
Sounds about right.

38
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,625
Our American
Bishiops await orders.

39
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,916
They strike only if
the vampirism spreads.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,958
Otherwise, we will
not get involved.

41
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,291
Let the world's policeman tend
to their own house for a change.

42
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,500
And while they
are distracted...!

43
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,083
Yes sir...

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,708
I thought the Americans would
react to what's going on here...

45
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,291
This is unusual.

46
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,916
It's no matter... so long
as they stay out of our way...

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,125
Britain, Hellsing and
Alucard are my only concerns.

48
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,833
The Vatican is content
to let the Major be,

49
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,833
since they were bedfellows
during the last war...

50
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,916
I'm not so forgiving.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,791
He and his ilk will
know a Crusader's wrath!

52
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,791
On this night...
we reclaim Britain

53
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:05,375
from monsters and pagans for
the glory... of Almighty God!

54
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,291
I kill the faithless
and demonic...

55
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,750
just as you have
taught me, Father...!

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,708
From the Order of
the Sword of Courland,

57
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,208
I pledge unto thee 340 souls!

58
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,750
From the Order of
Calatrava la Nueva,

59
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,083
I pledge 118 souls unto thee!

60
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,875
The Order of Santo
Stephano di Toscana

61
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,875
pledges 257
souls unto thee!

62
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:39,250
And from the Order
of Malta, 2,457 souls!

63
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,375
The Holy Father
has ordered us here.

64
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,916
He has promoted you in absentia
to the rank of archbishop,

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,958
as befits your task.

66
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,250
Congratulations, Your Grace.

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,208
We, the faithful here assembled,

68
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,125
form the Knights
of the 9th Crusade.

69
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,291
We are yours to command,
Archbishop Maxwell--

70
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,875
employ us as you will!

71
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,958
Amen...! I accept this
with all of my being!

72
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,916
Your target is London...!
Destroy it!

73
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,083
Let this new era
of Catholic might...

74
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,833
this Reconquista... now begin!

75
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,958
Amen! Amen! Amen!

76
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,125
Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen!

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:08,833
Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen!

78
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:14,250
Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen!

79
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,958
To think that a bastard,
reviled and spat upon

80
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,875
by polite society, would
be made an archbishop...

81
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,958
and given an army...

82
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,250
Director!

83
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,416
Well, what is it?

84
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,750
Here... Look...

85
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,416
It's that carrier,
the British one...

86
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,666
These coordinates...
it's moving again...?!

87
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,291
That's absurd!

88
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,208
After the damage it took?!
It's impossible!

89
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,583
Director! Its speed
is just a few knots...

90
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,083
but the ship's definitely
heading... to London!

91
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,125
Alucard is...

92
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,666
...coming.

93
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,666
Let him come...

94
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,958
Hellsing, Millennium and Alucard
alike will perish at our feet.

95
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,416
The Lord will use us as a cudgel
to lay His foes in the dust.

96
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,833
Now go...!

97
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,833
Our time as the tool of
God's holy wrath... is begun!

98
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,291
Look at them... every one,

99
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,791
charging into hell
with a joyous heart.

100
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,708
What man among them
can enter such carnage

101
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,583
and hope to return alive?

102
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,916
They're going to die...

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,750
all of them--and they'll
thank God... for the battle.

104
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,833
That aroma...
it's so familiar...

105
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,625
The aroma of men
being impaled...

106
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,125
of women being cut
down where they stand...

107
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,125
of babies burning to a crisp...

108
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,916
of the old being
lined up and shot...

109
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:39,000
The bouquet of death...
The smell of war...!

110
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,958
I'm coming for you, Major...

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,916
Zorin, dear...
begin your attack.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
Right away, sir.

113
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,041
Luftschiffe Zwei, full rotor!

114
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,833
We're moving in,
men--on the double!

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,875
Our target--Hellsing
headquarters!

116
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,916
So... how many of us remain?

117
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,416
Half of us have fallen...
The Nazis are fierce.

118
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,541
Get the Thermite!
Burn this tainted demon-meat!

119
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,750
Burn 'em all to ashes!

120
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,625
Enjoy your fire.

121
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,416
Where are you going?

122
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,541
To my mansion, obviously...

123
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,708
My forces are under attack;

124
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,416
as their commanding officer,
I need to be there...

125
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,291
So lower the gun, Papist.

126
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,625
I don't think so...

127
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,750
You're in Vatican custody
now, you left-legger.

128
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,500
Light me.

129
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,958
Light my cigar,
Miss "burn 'em all".

130
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,041
Well?

131
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,291
I've got a gun and you want me
to light your damn cigar?!

132
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,833
Light?

133
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,333
Do it.

134
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:32,416
You do... realize... I'm the
one holding the gun on you, yes?

135
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,416
Light me.

136
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,750
Now then, I'm going home...

137
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,833
If the thought of it vexes
you... go ahead and shoot.

138
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,458
Cut it out, Yumie.

139
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,666
Why can't I deal with her?!

140
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,833
She's just one woman!
What the hell!

141
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,291
Hey! How about we tie her up
and take her away with us?

142
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,166
That would work!

143
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,500
I wanna shoot her!

144
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,750
I can hear you, you know.

145
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,916
They want to tie
me up or shoot me...

146
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,208
What is it that what
you want, Anderson?

147
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,083
What do you think?

148
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,583
Teaming up against
an unarmed woman

149
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,291
to do God-knows-what to her...?

150
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,625
We're paladins, not rapists.

151
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,958
I'm glad we're of one mind...

152
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,458
But I really shouldn't
walk home alone... Come on.

153
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,291
Aye, we'll protect
your maiden virtue.

154
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,208
Huh?!

155
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,000
Step lively, Papists.

156
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,791
You're not the boss!

157
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,500
What are we doing? How did
she rope us all into this?

158
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,625
This is terrible... Bishop
Maxwell's gonna be so angry.

159
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,291
Y'know, we have sort of
taken her into custody...

160
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,333
Figuratively.

161
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,500
Please, he's not gonna buy it.

162
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,583
Shut your pie hole!

163
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,125
Heinkel, see if you can't
find us an automobile...

164
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,041
We're a bunch of sitting ducks
on foot.

165
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,541
Right...

166
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,125
Father Anderson...?
Do you think this is wise?

167
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,500
Your obedience will
be called into doubt.

168
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,833
Let 'em call it into
doubt, if they dare...

169
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,125
There's something
about Maxwell's methods

170
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,833
that just don't
sit right with me.

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,083
We're almost over
Hellsing headquarters.

172
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,166
Good... All hands,
to battle stations!

173
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,291
The flagship is launching
V1s... It's support fire.

174
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,541
The Deus Ex Machina is running
interference for us, huh?

175
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,416
Open wide, Hellsing--you're
in for a treat!

176
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,125
Our rockets...!

177
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,791
What the hell...?

178
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,958
Fucking status report!

179
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,750
We have sniper fire!

180
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,125
Straight out of the
Hellsing compound!

181
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,833
That bitch.

182
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,750
All the V1 missiles
have been shot down!

183
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:44,625
Impossible... All 24 of them
were fired at the same time!

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
Searchlights now!

185
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,708
I want it bright
as day down there!

186
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,875
But sir! If we use the lights,
they'll fire upon us!

187
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,125
Just do it!

188
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,541
That vampire whore
can already see us!

189
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,083
Twenty-four for 24, ma chere.

190
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,125
Your new equipment is
nothing to scoff at.

191
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,500
The Harkonnen II 30-millimeter
semi-automatic cannon.

192
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:49,125
Maximum range, four kilometers;
gross weight, 345 kilos.

193
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,000
We're pulling out
all the stops against

194
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,875
these Krauts--aren't
we, ma chere.

195
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,208
Mr. Bernadotte...

196
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,875
would you please stop
calling me "ma chere"...?

197
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,125
I have a name, and it's Seras.

198
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,291
Apologies, ma chere.

199
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,208
Tell me...

200
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,416
Can you see London right now?

201
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,500
Of course.

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,208
Piccadilly Circus, Soho
and Covent Garden

203
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,708
are nothing but ashes...

204
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:32,000
The London we knew is gone...
replaced with this Hell.

205
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,291
I can't stand
London--never could...

206
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,000
It always seemed like
such a stuffy town...

207
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,125
We never saw eye-to-eye,
ol' London and me...

208
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:46,291
But the boys would always drag
me out to this one cabaret.

209
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,458
The beer was cold,
and tasty--which is good,

210
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,958
because the only thing
dumber than the bartender

211
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,791
were those jokes of his...

212
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,458
Or we'd go whoring,
at this cathouse filled

213
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,833
with the ugliest girls
you've ever seen...

214
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,166
But you know...

215
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,000
They were all nice to us...

216
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,291
and they had the saddest eyes...

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,333
Then there was the lady with
the place on Versailles Road.

218
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,833
I never ordered fish and chips,
but it's all she'd serve me.

219
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,291
She'd say,
"Here, love--have a taste

220
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,708
of some right proper
British fare." Every time.

221
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,583
I wanted to tell her
it was too greasy--

222
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,916
I couldn't eat it--but
I didn't want to offend her.

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,250
So I choked it down,
bite by bite.

224
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,333
I'm not really going
to miss this London...

225
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,250
But the people who lived here...

226
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:42,041
That bartender, and the whores,
and the fish-and-chips lady...

227
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,375
This pissing match
was never theirs to lose.

228
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
That little major...

229
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
And Section Thirteen...

230
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,333
The Last Batallion...

231
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,708
Even Hellsing itself
meant nothing to them.

232
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,750
But now... they're all dead.

233
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,000
Corpses feasting
on each other...

234
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,000
And that is something
I just cannot abide.

235
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,791
Let's avenge them...
You and me, Seras.

236
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:15,750
Do it... Blast them
clean out of the sky.

237
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,583
Yes, sir... For those
who've died tonight...

238
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,166
And for London.

239
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,625
Now, ma chere...!

240
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,291
Target the enemy dreadnaught!
Fire upon my mark!

241
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,750
Fire!

242
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,833
We're taking fire!

243
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,708
Hit those Nazis...

244
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,833
Send them down...
into the pits hell!

245
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,208
Hull breach in sections
one, three and four!

246
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,750
Explosion in ready room 2, sir!

247
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,708
Aft engine mounts
4 and 5 have been shot!

248
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,750
Flight capacity down 32 percent!

249
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,958
Lieutenant!

250
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,000
We have to turn this
ship around right now!

251
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,583
Hold your course, dammit!

252
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,708
This zeppelin's armor
might as well be paper

253
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,708
against that much firepower...

254
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,708
We cannot escape this fate...!

255
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Bring us down...!
Crash-land us...!

256
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,041
Crash-land us, dammit!

257
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,375
Target the mansion...!

258
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,416
No...! Target that bitch!

259
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,666
Target Seras Victoria!

260
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,875
Seras! Get out of there!

261
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,958
Those are the Harkonnen's
incendiary grenades?!

262
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,125
Mon Dieu...!

263
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,000
They are so big...!

264
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,208
We're going down!

265
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,416
Welcome to the U.K., assholes!

266
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah!

267
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,625
We're not done!

268
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:26,250
You heard her, ladies...
Don't call it a night yet!

269
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,000
They're still coming.

270
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,083
Did they bail out
before it crashed?!

271
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,625
Not a scratch on
'em--what the fuck is this?!

272
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,583
What'd you expect, la gare...?

273
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,250
Those aren't people...
They're monsters.

274
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,291
What now?

275
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,041
Fall back, and reload, ma chere.

276
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,083
Right!

277
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:11,625
All right, Wild Geese... It's
time for us to take the stage.

278
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,666
No more foreplay.

279
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,458
These Nazis want it rough,
and I'm feeling generous.

280
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:24,166
Let's give them a wild night...
Lock and load, men!

281
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,250
Those grenades weren't
standard issue...

282
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,125
Only 42 of us survived
the attack, Lieutenant!

283
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,541
We've lost more than half
our fighting force already,

284
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,208
and all of our
heavy artillery, sir.

285
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,916
But our spirits have
never been higher!

286
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,958
Your orders,
Lieutenant Zorin Blitz!

287
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:48,750
Go in there... and grind 'em
down into a thin red paste!

288
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,208
Kill them...

289
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,833
Kill them all!

290
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,541
These creatures...
they are vampires, n'est pas?

291
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,666
They're stronger and
faster than any man alive...

292
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,625
and they'd storm heaven
itself for a juicy goose dinner.

293
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:18,208
To them, we're marionettes,
wobbling on strings...

294
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,250
They know the moves
we make before we do.

295
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,583
They'll dodge our bullets
and take off our heads

296
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,041
before we even
realize we've missed.

297
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,041
Ma chere... does
that about sum it up?

298
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,250
Mines...! They've got mines!

299
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,333
They got wise... Hit it.

300
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,875
Shit.

301
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,958
Like that?

302
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,708
It's what you get for
underestimating me.

303
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,041
Your men...

304
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,916
booby-trapped the yard?!

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,083
"Booby-trapped?"
You make it sound so tawdry.

306
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,208
Serves them right
for charging in.

307
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,791
If our foes are going to play
dirty by going vampire...

308
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,166
the least we can do
is try to even the odds.

309
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,250
Sixty claymores packed
with blessed ball bearings,

310
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,166
all detonated at once...

311
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,583
Let's see them
try to dodge that.

312
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:39,625
We're not the greatest
fighting force...

313
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:43,458
Engaging the enemy in the
open is such a messy affair...

314
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,708
This is more our speed.

315
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,625
Third floor
grennadiers, fire...!

316
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,625
Constant bombardment, men!

317
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,208
Keep those leeches
pinned to the dirt!

318
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,708
That's it! Tear that
perimeter to shreds!

319
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,500
Rifle squads, concentrate
all of your fire

320
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,916
into one spot at a time...

321
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,208
Anything twitches, you shoot!

322
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,541
Captain!

323
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,333
We've halted the
enemy's advance...

324
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,791
They're pinned down
behind those hills...

325
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,791
Fuckers aren't moving an inch.

326
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,916
Oh, they'll come
out eventually...

327
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But for now, this will do...

328
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,791
If we keep out of range...
we win by default.

329
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:33,916
We play a high-stakes game...
but the rules are simple.

330
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,875
If those musty old Krauts
get inside, it's over.

331
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,833
We don't stand a
chance in close combat.

332
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,958
So, you don't
think they'll retreat?

333
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,416
One would expect.

334
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,166
Any other night, I'd say...

335
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,208
"Without a doubt...
They will run."

336
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,666
But these things
aren't afraid of death.

337
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,708
They are death.

338
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:28,083
[incantation]

339
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,833
Huh...?

340
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:11,583
Holy shit... What the
hell is that thing?!

341
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,208
Sit-rep!

342
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,416
Hey, you guys... Have you
lost your fucking minds, too?

343
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,958
Talk to me...!

344
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,291
Someone tell me what the hell
is going on...! Goddamn it!

345
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,291
What the hell?

346
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,416
Resume fire! Now!

347
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:49,208
Mon Dieu... nobody said
they could do... this...!

348
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,125
This can't be...!

349
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,583
We're getting torn
to pieces by a giant?!

350
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:45,291
Oh God! That fucking
bitch took my leg off!

351
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,958
My arm...! It's gone...!
Where the fuck's my arm!

352
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,291
Please help me!

353
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,125
Please, no...
this isn't happening...!

354
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,541
Wait a second...
Why do I feel...

355
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,541
like I'm watching this
moment... all wrong...?

356
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,291
I told you about
your third eye...

357
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:38,958
Yes, there... right in the
middle of your forehead.

358
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,958
Your human eyes are
not to be trusted.

359
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,583
All they'll do is lie to you.

360
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:51,500
Besides... you are
no longer a human...

361
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,666
You have become...
so much more...!

362
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,375
An illusion...?

363
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,500
It's an illusion!

364
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,666
Oh, God! She's huge!
She's all I see!

365
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:15,875
Snap out of it!
Please, sir! This isn't real!

366
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,875
I just need a goddamn medic!

367
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,291
Why... can't I move...?!

368
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,916
Listen to me!
It's all in your mind!

369
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,333
Wiped out... by a damn giant...?

370
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,416
How is this happening...?!

371
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Because, Captain! It isn't!

372
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,541
This isn't happening!

373
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,208
Wake up!

374
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,875
Wow... My arm... It's fine...

375
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,500
What the hell was that?

376
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,041
I dunno...

377
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,083
That was fucked up!

378
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,333
Snap out of it!

379
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,875
It was just an illusion,
witchcraft or something!

380
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,875
An illusion...?

381
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,583
That gargantuan
whore wasn't real?!

382
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:46,916
That's right!

383
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,041
You saw through
my projection, eh...?

384
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:52,500
Very clever of you...
not that it matters...

385
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:58,375
You'll still die screaming!

386
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:43,750
We've lost the
front of the estate.

387
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,666
Captain, we got trouble!.

388
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,500
They've figured
out the land-mines...

389
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,708
We're getting hammered!

390
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,375
Let's gather the flock.

391
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:07,625
Whoever's alive to hear this,
fall back to my position...

392
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,833
Keep shooting, though--make
the Krauts work for it.

393
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,708
Bring all the grenades
and plastique you can.

394
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,041
Ma chere...

395
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,916
Sir?

396
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,791
We're going to set up
barricades here--

397
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,250
dig in as best we can
and fend them off.

398
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,250
While you, mademoiselle...

399
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,041
...go make their acquaintance.

400
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:33,291
Reduce them to nothing
but Nazi carrion.

401
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,833
Yes, sir!

402
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:39,250
You are the ace up
our sleeve... Remember.

403
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:43,208
The life of every man in
this room is in your hands.

404
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,625
In case I die.

405
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,833
Well... good luck!

406
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,541
Ah--I almost forgot
the most important part!

407
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,666
Seras!

408
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,041
Sir!

409
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,916
You must close your eyes!

410
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:20,750
You... kissy-face...
What the...?! Why?!

411
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,750
No fair, Captain!

412
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,125
Yeah! No fair!

413
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,833
Well, enough
lollygagging. Let's go!

414
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,166
God, you're a cad!

415
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,083
I want one, too!

416
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,375
Me, too!

417
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,416
Me, too!!

418
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,125
Me, too!

419
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,291
Me, too!!

420
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,083
Bugger off!

421
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,083
Seras, ma chere...

422
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,416
Come back to me...
That's an order.

423
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,791
Yes, sir... give 'em hell!

424
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,625
Right, go!

425
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,750
Moving out!

426
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,375
That is a hell of a girl.

427
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,166
Indeed... Far too good
for the likes of us.

428
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:29,375
If she dies this night...
we are no longer men...

429
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:32,458
We are cowards...
meant for hell.

430
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,791
Fuckin' A.

431
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,250
Ain't that the truth.

432
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,291
Well said, Captain.

433
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:43,916
Seras isn't going to die--not
on the Wild Geese's watch.

434
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,125
Make peace with
your god, ladies.

435
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,416
You're dying with your
boots on. Here. Tonight.

436
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,333
Geez, Captain... do we gotta...?

437
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,125
If this were some war movie...

438
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,958
the guy playing you'd be all,

439
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,000
"If you're gonna run,
now's the time"--

440
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,666
or you'd sacrifice yourself
to let us get away.

441
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,000
Tais-toi, mon ami.

442
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,375
We all are nothing
more than prodigal sons

443
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,083
who kill for pocket change.

444
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,583
Hell, for the fun of it!

445
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,541
Fair enough.

446
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,208
Come on, ladies...

447
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,666
We have a date with death.

448
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,166
Go out guns blazing,
screaming, "Fuck!"...

449
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,125
Bellies full of lead...
heart full of steel.

450
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,416
What the hell.

451
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,125
Fuck, why not.

452
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,708
I'm in--old age's for pussies!

453
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:03,541
This glorious war has
only just begun, my friends.

454
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,833
Atrocity...
will beget atrocity...

455
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:16,875
It must. For such is
the nature... of war.

456
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:33,541
You'll pay for
shooting me down...

457
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:40,041
I'll paint that
mansion with your blood!

458
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,875
Keep shooting, dammit!

459
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,083
Verein! Sturm! Sturm! Sturm!

460
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,583
Sturm! Sturm! Sturm!

461
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,416
You'll paaaaaay!

462
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,833
Now... be obedient little
sheep... and die already!

463
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,125
Back when I was a boy,

464
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,958
I thought there was such
a thing as a good war.

465
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:57,625
Hell... even bad wars
are a paycheck, right?

466
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,541
I've been a damn fool...
