1
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:49,083
Where are you? Where are you?

2
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,958
My lovely little niece.
My pretty niece.

3
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,708
My budding little fräulein.

4
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:02,125
Miss. Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing.

5
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,750
The Grand Successor to
the Hellsing Organization.

6
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,416
Oh, my poor lost little
Integra, I wish I could

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,458
help you to understand.

8
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,500
Twenty years.

9
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,666
Twenty years of waiting for
my brother, your father to die.

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,250
And then mere
hours before his death

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,416
he chooses you to succeed
him as head of the family.

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
This insult against
me I cannot accept.

13
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,208
I will never accept.

14
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,916
What an unforgivable
act of betrayal.

15
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,500
Hellsing is mine!

16
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:39,458
Integra... If the time
should ever come...

17
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,250
When all other hope is lost...

18
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,500
If you should fine
yourself surrounded,

19
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,666
with your enemies closing in...

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,708
Go to the last cell of the
deepest dungeon of the estate.

21
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,208
There lies one of the Hellsing
family's darkest legacies.

22
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:01,625
It will be the instrument
of your salvation.

23
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:19,416
No. How can this corpse...
be my salvation?

24
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,875
There you are, my fräulein.

25
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,125
Uncle...

26
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,666
Something on your mind,
my little fräulein?

27
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,916
Are you really so
desperate to claim

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,833
the family title that you
would actually be willing to...

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,125
What an astute
observation, Integra.

30
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,791
Oh god... The corpse...

31
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,333
Bastards!

32
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,916
What? Are you really serious?

33
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,416
I'm sorry but could you
perhaps repeat yourself

34
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,416
one more time,

35
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,416
Sir Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing is it?

36
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,291
Very well, I'll start again.

37
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
They're Ghouls, and
the village of Cheddar

38
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,791
has become a den of Ghouls.

39
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,791
A Ghoul is what happens
to deflowered humans

40
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,250
when they are
bitten by a vampire.

41
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,458
They are much like zombies under
the control of the vampire.

42
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,958
And that means, there's a
vampire somewhere in Cheddar.

43
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,291
 That's ridiculous. Vampires?

44
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:06,208
Do you really expect me to
believe this occult nonsense?

45
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
Why on earth would
a cheep bureaucrat

46
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,416
like yourself know
anything on the matter?

47
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,958
How dare you even
question my credentials.

48
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,000
The Hellsing Organization
has been defending

49
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,666
he British Empire from such
monsters for generations.

50
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,333
I will Illuminate.

51
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,000
The Hellsing organization is a

52
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,708
Special Operations Agency
Charged by her Majesty,

53
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,125
with the duty of finding and
Eradicating all Supernatural

54
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,541
and Satanic threats
to the church and crown.

55
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,125
There's a vampire in Cheddar
that's controlling the ghouls.

56
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,208
A monster from the pits of hell.

57
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,083
Send in all troops you wish,

58
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,958
send every last man
under your command.

59
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,833
They will end up
little more than a meal.

60
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,791
Or they may suffer a worse fate.

61
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,458
When a vampire
drinks from a virgin

62
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,416
of the opposite sex a
new vampire is created.

63
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
Otherwise, your
people become food,

64
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:05,083
and then join the vampire's
unholy legion of Ghouls.

65
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,458
Sir, I've completely lost radio
contact with Squads 2 and 3.

66
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,291
Ballocks!

67
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,083
You what? What's
going on? Repot! Come in!

68
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,041
If you are to stop the Ghouls
from further multiplying,

69
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,250
you're going to
have to terminate

70
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,416
that vampire at the source.

71
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,291
And this is where
Hellsing comes in.

72
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,125
We will take care
of your vampire.

73
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,250
That's... insane...

74
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,375
I can assure you gentlemen that
one of our finest anti-vampire

75
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,750
field agents is already
on route to Cheddar.

76
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,833
This will be settled
in a matter of hours.

77
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,416
What sort of agent
would handle this?

78
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,875
When dealing with monsters...
Vampires especially...

79
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:01,625
I promise there is no greater
expert walking this earth.

80
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,250
How beautiful.

81
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,125
Nights like this, make me
want to have a bite to drink.

82
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:15,291
Yes, I couldn't imagine
a more, perfect evening...

83
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,125
There's no use running.

84
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,666
Guns won't help you either.

85
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,750
Eddie... Simon...

86
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,708
That's right. Your little
boyfriends belong to me now.

87
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,666
And soon you'll
belong to me too.

88
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,250
I look for loyalty
in my servants.

89
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,750
I wouldn't want a vampire
with free will running around.

90
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:35,000
Pity I can't find a
virgin as lovely as you.

91
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,875
I'm going to violate you.

92
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,833
I'm going to drain your blood.

93
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,583
Slowly. Then you will join
with the rest of my ghouls.

94
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,625
My slave for eternity.

95
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,041
Who the hell are you?

96
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,750
Your death.

97
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,208
My death...

98
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,333
Oh Really?
My god. This is pathetic!

99
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,791
Kill him.

100
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,333
Is that the best you've got?

101
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,125
 Your agent's a vampire?

102
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,583
Correct.

103
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,250
You see, humans make
poor vampire killers.

104
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,958
They're frail, They're mortal.

105
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,500
They're corruptible:
body, mind, and soul.

106
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,500
The most effective
weapon against

107
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,250
a vampire is another
more powerful vampire.

108
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,375
The Hellsing Organization

109
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,333
has such a creature
in its menagerie.

110
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,416
And let me
assure you gentlemen,

111
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,291
our vampire has power
beyond imagination.

112
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,666
No... how can he
be killing them?

113
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,125
It's those bullets...

114
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,333
The silver cross of Manchester
Cathedrial was melted down,

115
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,083
to make these 13mm
exploding shells.

116
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,666
Nothing I shoot ever
gets back up again

117
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,875
But why? Tell Me!

118
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,541
Why fight to save
these pathetic humans?

119
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,583
Don't take another step.
The girl's the last survivor.

120
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,708
Don't you want to save her?

121
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,208
Be reasonable.
I'm not asking for much.

122
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:47,458
Just a bit of help.
You can look the other way.

123
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,333
Are you a virgin, my dear?

124
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,875
What did you just say?

125
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,541
I'm asking if you're a virgin.

126
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,416
But... I...

127
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
You bastard!

128
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,750
Answer me!

129
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,208
Yes! Yes! I am!

130
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You... you...

131
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,250
What's your name?

132
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:45,833
My master, your
father called me...

133
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,583
Alucard...

134
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,125
I had to shoot through
you to pierce his heart.

135
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,791
I'm sorry, but you're dying
and there's no time left.

136
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,208
The choice is yours.
What do you want to do?

137
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,875
Daddy...

138
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:35,333
Police girl. Tonight is
truly, a beautiful night.

139
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:49,875
Where am I?

140
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,250
Blahhh! It's a cop!

141
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,250
A cop?

142
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,333
Ghhaa! A police girl!!

143
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,750
Get her!

144
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,291
Oh my god! I'm going
to die! I don't wanna die!

145
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,875
Police girl. What's it
feel like to be dead?

146
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,958
Still... The choice
was all yours.

147
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,708
The path of the Draculina.

148
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,041
Oh God...

149
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,166
Where am I?

150
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,541
Police girl, how does it feel
now that you're a Vampire?

151
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,291
You're too loud, police girl.

152
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,708
I don't care if
you are a vampire.

153
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,666
You're still English,
have some manners.

154
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:24,875
So I'm a vampire...
Sorry but where am I?

155
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,750
This is our headquarters.

156
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,208
We are called the
Hellsing Organization.

157
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,916
We are the monsters that protect
England from the other monsters.

158
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,083
So you're telling me...
You're saying that I'm...

159
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,625
Given your condition, you'll
be working for us from now on.

160
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,916
We've received word of a
string of vampire attacks.

161
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,833
Go and kill the
vampire, police girl.

162
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,875
The victims' heads
have been ripped off...

163
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,500
messages are left on
the wall, written in blood.

164
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,041
This is a offence against
God and Christendom.

165
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:12,208
They mock our church, our
country, and Hellsing itself.

166
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,666
The target is moving
north on Route 17

167
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
butchering whole
households along the way.

168
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,458
Do not leave a
single freak standing!

169
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,375
Soon both of us will
have eternal life.

170
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,666
Invincible vampires forever.

171
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,541
You don't know how to change
your body into a mist or a bat.

172
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,625
You can't heal any
of you gunshot wounds.

173
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,208
And now that
you're out of bullets,

174
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,875
you can't even defend yourself.

175
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,750
you dare to call yourself
Nosferatu? You disgust me!

176
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,750
Your turn, police girl.

177
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,875
Yes, sir.

178
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,125
What are you waiting for? Do it.

179
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,500
Sir, she's already five--no--
six hundred meters away...

180
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,083
Imagine a third eye,
on your forehead.

181
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,583
Aim from there.

182
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,541
If you shoot like a human,

183
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,833
you're going to
miss like a human.

184
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,833
But sir...

185
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,833
Aim right for her heart.

186
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,791
Don't worry, you'll put
the bullet right through her.

187
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
But it's so dark and
I don't have a scope.

188
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,375
That's a human complaint.

189
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,916
Now, it's time to make the
shot like a proper vampire.

190
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,208
It's such a big gun, yet I
hardly felt any recoil at all.

191
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,208
It's pitch black, yet I can see
more clearly then in daylight.

192
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,625
Good shooting, police girl.

193
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,958
And now...

194
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,083
I'm hearing voices,
like some sort of telepathy.

195
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,208
It's all too fast...
What on earth am I becoming?

196
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,333
I'm...

197
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,583
Not yet. This is
only the beginning.

198
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,333
And there's a long
road ahead of you.

199
00:23:56,666 --> 00:24:00,666
Too many. Far too many.

200
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:05,416
Suddenly we have far too
many vampires causing trouble.

201
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,791
Third and fourth rate vampires,

202
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,083
killing randomly,
keeping us busy.

203
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:16,583
Pointless, cheap pathetic,
acts of barbarism.

204
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:20,083
It's as if someone were churning
out vampires off a factory line.

205
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,916
Now, both of you, stop that!

206
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,750
There's no fighting
between friends!

207
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,250
How do you expect to go
to heaven acting like that?

208
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,125
Sorry, Father.

209
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:44,333
Listen. Violence is
never the right answer.

210
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,666
Except when used against
heathens and monsters.

211
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,958
All right.

212
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,875
I want both of you to
run strait up to your rooms.

213
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,791
Yes Father.

214
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,166
Come on!

215
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,166
Wait!

216
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,750
To what do I owe this visit?
What happened?

217
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:09,250
I'm afraid we've been hearing
a lot of bad news lately.

218
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,416
Coming from England.

219
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,583
Yeah. They're working hard
to keep everything quiet.

220
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,000
Vampires.

221
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,541
There've recently been
multiple vampires attacks

222
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,583
within their borders.

223
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:26,083
Far too many to
be pure coincidence.

224
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,791
Well, nothing wrong
with that, is there?

225
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,875
If a vampire wants to
eat some protestants

226
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,583
then how is it our business?

227
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:38,166
But there's more.
Hellsing. They're a problem.

228
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,625
They've been holding a
stronger front then we expected.

229
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,375
Keeping damage to a minimum.

230
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,916
They're nothing but amateurs.

231
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,458
Hellsing is practically a
kindergarten compared to us!

232
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:55,166
The Catholics. The Vatican.
And the Iscariots.

233
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:59,333
We were fighting against the
forces of darkness centuries

234
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,833
before the Hellsing
Organization even existed.

235
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,958
So why are you here?

236
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,708
If all the trouble's
over in England

237
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:09,208
then surely the English can
take care of it on their own.

238
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,083
But it's not only in England.

239
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,791
What?

240
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,208
There's been an
attack in Ireland.

241
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:21,500
Northern Ireland.
A little town called Badrick.

242
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Hellsing is on the move.

243
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,041
And we will not just
sit back and watch.

244
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:30,958
The nerve of them
sneaking around

245
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,958
where they're not wanted,
like they belong there.

246
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:37,041
Those fools are as shameless
and presumptuous as ever.

247
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,791
We will teach them to
know their place Anderson.

248
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,916
They tread on Catholic land.

249
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,875
This vampire is ours to destroy.

250
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,416
We want you to deal
with this before they do.

251
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,000
And if I should run into
the agents of Hellsing?

252
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,708
Just remember.

253
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,083
We are part of God's
divine instrument on earth.

254
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,083
We do not retreat when we
are challenged by heretics.

255
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,625
If anyone does not love
the Lord Jesus Christ,

256
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,666
let him be accursed
at his coming.

257
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,375
God save you
from your fate. Amen!

258
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,625
They're not real people.

259
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,875
They might as well be...
zombie pumpkins.

260
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:47,625
They're just dolls. Take aim.
Just one shot and it's all over.

261
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,541
Police girl, when you aim,

262
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,958
make sure to put a hole
through the heart or the head.

263
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,333
Just remember.

264
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:32,541
These people did not become
undead ghouls by choice.

265
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,375
There's no way to cure them
once they've been changed.

266
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,708
It's for their own sake

267
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,833
that we put them to rest
as quickly as possible.

268
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,958
Sir. Yes Sir, my Master.

269
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,458
Now you're starting
to understand

270
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,875
what it is to be a vampire.

271
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,166
Blessed Blades...

272
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,916
Barrier?

273
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:08,000
We are the servants of god and
the messengers of his justice.

274
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:12,250
We are the instruments of
his divine wrath on earth.

275
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,333
We are called upon
to cleanse his kingdom,

276
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,500
bringing ash from the flesh...

277
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,250
of thane enemies.

278
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,000
Praise to our lord.

279
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:26,083
Sir, a report from our
Vatican Intelligence Officer.

280
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,500
It reads: Our fears confirmed.

281
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,625
The Vatican Special operations
"Iscariot organization"

282
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,583
is on the move.

283
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:38,416
Iscariot. The Vatican's
special operations unit.

284
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,166
The most powerful agents
the Vatican commands.

285
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:46,041
Professional exorcists,
assassins trained

286
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,958
to deal with heathens
and heretics.

287
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:53,791
They're working under section
13, a black operations unit.

288
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,625
How large a force did they send?

289
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,833
Just one agent was deployed...

290
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,791
The Paladin,
Father Alexander Anderson!

291
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,541
Did you say Alexander Anderson?

292
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,958
God knows what would happen

293
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,875
if he were to run into
Alucard and the girl...

294
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,708
I'll leave for
Badrick immediately.

295
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:20,458
Fetch my gun, my sword,
and prepare two bodyguards.

296
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,791
Yes sir.

297
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,125
Walter, I want you to keep
working on the Vatican.

298
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,500
Of course, sir.

299
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,708
Paladin Anderson, Executioner
Anderson, Bayonet Anderson,

300
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:35,625
off with it's head Anderson,
Dust to Dust Anderson.

301
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:39,000
Place of birth unknown.
Age, unknown.

302
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,958
Even his origins remain unknown.

303
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,750
The only fact we can nail down

304
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,333
is that he's an expert
monster hunter.

305
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,750
In much the way Alucard

306
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,375
is our best line of
supernatural defense,

307
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,500
Anderson can
reasonably be described

308
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:56,291
as the finest agent Vatican
Section thirteen has to offer.

309
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:02,791
The Paladin monster
slayer, the purifier...

310
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:06,208
God I hope that haven't
started killing each other yet.

311
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,666
Beautiful moon tonight,
don't you think?

312
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,166
Your voice sounds so very lovely

313
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,958
when you're whimpering
in agony, young lady

314
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,625
Don't worry though,
you're not dying yet.

315
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,375
I haven't pierced your heart.

316
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,416
It's been a while
since I've had a good hunt.

317
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,083
I plan on enjoying this.

318
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:48,000
Vatican Special Division 13.
The Iscariot organization.

319
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:52,916
Right you are, you
pathetic Hellsing dogs.

320
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,583
And you must be Alucard?

321
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:59,583
The housebroken vampire... The
monster who hunts his own kind.

322
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,500
The famous
Hellsing family pet...

323
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,708
What did you do with
vampire we were hunting?

324
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,791
He's dead.
Not much fun really...

325
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,666
I didn't even have
time to enjoy it.

326
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,750
Seems you two are
the only ones left.

327
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,958
Really?

328
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:00,541
You attacked a vampire, head
on, in the middle of the night.

329
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,291
You didn't eyen try to
catch me by surprise.

330
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,833
You're a brave man, Father.

331
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,375
But you're also a fool.

332
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,541
Master.

333
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:14,916
Don't talk. You've been
stabbed with a Blessed blade.

334
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,166
Now, just...

335
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,083
What...?

336
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,875
Amen.

337
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,166
A regenerator.

338
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,458
Correct. A living weapon
engineered by the human race

339
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:40,666
to defeat vile
monsters like you.

340
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,000
Amen!

341
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,916
Master!!

342
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,916
Hurry! Knowing Iscariot...

343
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,500
No, knowing Alucard...
it's probably already started.

344
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,625
That's it? This thing was
Hellsing's ultimate weapon?

345
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,458
The great domesticated vampire?

346
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:55,416
What a terrible disappointment.
He's a joke!

347
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,083
Bloody Protestants
screw up everything.

348
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:07,125
Well... after all that
she's still able to crawl away.

349
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,291
It seems I may underestimated
my little Draculina...

350
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,166
Master.

351
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,333
Please... You can't do this...

352
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:46,625
Dragging me into this world,
only to leave me...

353
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,208
I can't do this alone...

354
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,583
Where do you think you're going?

355
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,666
There's no place to run.

356
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,666
Ashes to Ashes. Dust to Dust.

357
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,750
We are nothing more than dust.

358
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:06,291
And to the dust we shall return!

359
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,166
Amen!

360
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,250
I have to get out of here...

361
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,583
I have to escape...

362
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,791
I just have to run
and find Sir Integra...

363
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,583
What is this?

364
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,291
That is a spiritual
barrier, little girl.

365
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,333
It's impossible for
vampyric creatures

366
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,833
such as yourself
to penetrate it.

367
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,958
Now settle down,

368
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,500
while I put you to slaughter,
you goddamn monster.

369
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,333
He's going to kill me.

370
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:52,375
I'm going to die.
I'm going to die.

371
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,083
Oh God I'm going to die. Oh...

372
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,333
This is no time to lose
your head, police girl.

373
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,166
Master?

374
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,583
Drink my blood, police girl.

375
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,833
Drink and you shall never again
be treated like a slave...

376
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,625
Drink and you shall
truly become one of us.

377
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,500
You will drink blood
of your own choosing,

378
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:28,208
wandering the night
powerful and singular.

379
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:31,375
Become eternal and complete!

380
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:37,041
Drink my blood police girl.
No... Seras Victoria!

381
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,125
It's over.

382
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,916
That girl belongs to me.

383
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,166
What's your business here?

384
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,583
Paladin of Iscariot,
Father Alexander Anderson?

385
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:06,166
Sir Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing.

386
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,500
To what do I owe the honor
of such a personal appearance?

387
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,666
Enough Father Anderson.

388
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,416
This is a violation
of our agreement.

389
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,041
The situation here
is under our control.

390
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,125
Withdraw immediately!

391
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,833
Neither the Iscariot nor
the Hellsing organization

392
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,625
can afford this sort of battle.

393
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:27,041
I don't care who
you think you are,

394
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,041
this act of aggression ends now.

395
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,958
Withdraw? Is that an order?

396
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,791
You expect the
Iscariot organization,

397
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,833
God's own chosen
instruments of judgment

398
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:41,458
to just withdraw on your order?

399
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,208
Did you really expect me
to run away screaming

400
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,291
in fear from a filthy
Protestant whore?

401
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:58,833
An artificially Bio-engineered
regenerator agent.

402
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:03,166
And they've upgraded your
healing... You're a thing.

403
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:07,291
Perhaps, But you're
nothing but weak.

404
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,333
You're worthless.

405
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,666
And as for that pathetic
pet vampire you love

406
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,541
to parade around with...

407
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,208
you just missed
his decapitation.

408
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:19,791
You cut off his
head off? Is that all?

409
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:20,833
What?

410
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,583
Get your hands off
Sir Integra, monster!

411
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's not looking good
for you, Father Anderson.

412
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,125
If I were you, I'd leave
while I was still able.

413
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,708
Have you gone insane?

414
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,666
I'm about to paint the
walls with the two of you.

415
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,833
Then you'd better make it quick.

416
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,625
That vampire you decapitated
will be coming back

417
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,583
to life any second now.

418
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,000
He'll What?

419
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,000
Why didn't you just
drink the blood you idiot?

420
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,833
Cut off his head?
Pierced his heart?

421
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:20,541
He is nothing like any
vampire you've ever known.

422
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,333
Your tricks won't kill him.

423
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:26,750
You may be the fruit of the
finest anti-vampire technology,

424
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:29,333
but a hundred years of the
Hellsing family's

425
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,000
occult knowledge
produced this achievement.

426
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:36,250
Our Crowned glory!
The vampire, Alucard!

427
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,625
Master!

428
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,875
I think you're beginning
to understand.

429
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,375
What will you do now, Anderson?

430
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:19,708
I'll leave. I need further
preparation to kill this one.

431
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,416
We'll meet again, Hellsing.

432
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:31,000
Next time,
I'll butcher you all.

433
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:45,333
It's over.

434
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,583
Are you all right, Alucard?

435
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:58,750
Yes. It's been a while since
I've had my head cut off.

436
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,708
And now we've finally met
Father Anderson from Iscariot?

437
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,791
He has violated our agreements,

438
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:09,916
attacked without provocation,
and killed my men.

439
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,916
The Vatican will
pay dearly for this

440
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,666
However, they are
not our priority.

441
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,041
There's a shadow organization
somewhere out there

442
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,625
that is responsible for this
increase in vampire attacks.

443
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,833
Then what are my orders master?

444
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:30,166
Shall I destroy them?
Wipe them from the earth?

445
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,083
Grind them to dust?

446
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:38,416
Just give the word,
my master, Sir Integra Hellsing

447
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,958
When the time has come, I will.

448
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,958
Really? I can't wait.

449
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:51,291
It'll be a pleasure.
A truly great pleasure.

450
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,083
You.

451
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,875
Why didn't you drink the blood?

452
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,916
Why not drink?

453
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,708
Um, I'm not sure.
But, it felt like...

454
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,041
It felt like if
I drank the blood...

455
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,291
it would mean the end

456
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:14,041
of something
important inside of me.

457
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,833
You are an idiot.

458
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:20,000
But perhaps you have a point.

459
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,041
Perhaps It's time for a vampire

460
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,750
who does not walk
alone through the night.

461
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,250
Why on earth did you
turn her into a vampire?

462
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:38,125
Why indeed...
For fun? For sport?

463
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,166
Maybe it was just a whim?

464
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,416
Maybe, but that
doesn't sound like me.

465
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,000
Perhaps after years
spent with humans,

466
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,041
you've finally rubbed off on me.

467
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,791
I might be developing
a sense of whimsy.

468
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,125
Let's go, police girl.
Don't dawdle.

469
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,458
Yes, sir. My master.

470
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,750
But, you see sir my
name's not police girl.

471
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,250
It's Seras Victoria, sir.

472
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:10,166
Enough, you coward.
You are a police girl.

473
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,791
"Police girl" will do.

474
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:15,291
But... Ohhh, you're mean!

475
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,666
Master!

476
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,500
That's quite a thing
for you to say.

477
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:32,375
Just what I'd expect, from a
King of Vampires. Or a Count.

478
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:43,708
Damen und Herren,
we will move forward

479
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:47,166
with our plans for
the impending war.

480
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:53,125
And for the war beyond that.
And the war beyond that.

481
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,708
And the next, and the next...
