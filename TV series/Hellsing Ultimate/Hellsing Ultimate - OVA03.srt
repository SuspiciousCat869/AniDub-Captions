1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,208
Sir Integra.

2
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,625
In light of your orders to
bolster our current

3
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,958
Hellsing membership,
I've taken the liberty

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,708
of hiring a group of
professional mercenaries.

5
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:47,708
Mercenaries? Men motivated
by a lust for money.

6
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,666
Can we trust such soldiers?

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,541
Normally, I'd worry, but these
men are proper professionals.

8
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,250
As long as they have a contract
and get their money on time,

9
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,583
the Wild Geese will
never break their word.

10
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,625
Tell those assholes
they're supposed

11
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,041
to bombs the other guys!

12
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,125
Inbred motherfuckers
don't give a shit!

13
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,833
They got a dozen sisters
at home to knock up!

14
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,208
That's not bad it works
out to like two a day

15
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,708
if you don't count Sundays.

16
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,166
Shut up, Shape up, and put
you're head back in the game.

17
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,208
They drop the bombs on us
because we don't matter.

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,000
We mean nothing.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,125
They blow us up
and buy new ones.

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,625
I think can all agree

21
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,583
there's no shortage
of idiots willing

22
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,375
to shoot guns for money.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,333
Captain, we just got word that
the Palace has surrendered.

24
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,375
That's just pathetic.

25
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,291
Couldn't they at least
try to put up a fight?

26
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,416
I guess this civil war is
over and we're out of a job.

27
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,875
I've been working
on something...

28
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,208
Please tell me it's
not another sand trap.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,458
There'll be no sand
where we're going.

30
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,958
The next job? It's in
a city of fog.

31
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,000
Captain Bernadotte,
what the hell is this?

32
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,416
Huh?

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,750
So what? Are we gonna be
fighting in London?

34
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,916
Since when do
we work security jobs?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,625
I didn't sign up to
shadow some rich asshole.

36
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,500
My god you people.

37
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,916
I really can't think of
any other way to put this,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,250
so here it is.

39
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,166
They are going to be
paying us to kill monsters.

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,416
They're gonna be
paying us to do what?

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,000
Monsters! You gotta
be kidding me!

42
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,875
It's true.

43
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,958
The enemies are
immortal creatures

44
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,125
who sustain themselves
by drinking human blood.

45
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,708
Your job gentlemen,
is to fight these monsters

46
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,166
with bullets, garlic,
and holy water,

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,375
put a stake through it's
heart, cut off it's head,

48
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,291
burn the corpse, and scatter
the ashes at a crossroads.

49
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,041
For further instructions
you may consult Bram Stoker.

50
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,500
That's just ridiculous.

51
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,958
Everybody knows there's
no such thing a vampires.

52
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,208
Then everyone is quite mistaken.

53
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,958
Or more accurately,
we've helped them maintain

54
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,166
a state of blissful ignorance.

55
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,875
For over a century the
Hellsing Organization

56
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,708
has served the British Empire,

57
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,291
fighting a secret war
against the forces of darkness.

58
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,666
The vampire in particular.

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,291
For those of you who
still need convincing,

60
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,166
I present to you
a genuine vampire

61
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
AH... Oh... Oh no...

62
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:52,583
Just hold on... You...
Are you really a vampire?

63
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,541
Yes. I am. Hello!

64
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,708
I get the feeling they're
laughing at me sir...

65
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,833
Then show them something to
make them stop, police girl.

66
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,875
Oh! Right of
course sir! Come on!

67
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,625
If this is supposed
to be a vampire,

68
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,625
then I am
Frankensein's monster.

69
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,791
Captain!

70
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,500
She's some kind of monster!

71
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,708
I just... She kept
poking me with the...

72
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,041
It happened so fast...
And my head was just...

73
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,208
I don't believe it,
you're really telling me

74
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,041
that that girl is a vampire?

75
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,833
Damn right she is.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
The police girl may be
the lowest of the low,

77
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,583
but a vampire
is still a vampire.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,708
What a pathetic bunch
of sniveling cowards.

79
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,041
Do you really think
they'll be of any use to us?

80
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,208
My deepest apologies Ma'am.

81
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,583
I tried to stop him...

82
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,458
These men are going to be
guarding me while I sleep.

83
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,041
I wanted to take their measure.

84
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
Now that introductions are over,

85
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,083
a most unusual letter
arrived in the post today.

86
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,958
What sort of letter?

87
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,375
Vatican Special
Operations Division 13,

88
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,125
the Iscariot Organization...

89
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,000
Enrico Maxwell.

90
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,083
What time is it, Walter?

91
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,625
Just past 3, Ma'am.

92
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,041
They arrange this meeting
and still manage to be late.

93
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,958
Do you think this is a trap?

94
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,291
I doubt Iscariot
would be bold enough

95
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,208
to stage a daylight attack.

96
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:50,166
Especially an attack in public
in the heart of enemy territory.

97
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,625
It's true, pictures do not
do the collection justice.

98
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,666
It must be seen in person.

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,375
And look at how well they've
maintained everything.

100
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,041
Truly you would
expect no less...

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,041
I think we're a bit late.

102
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,625
It would appear so sir.

103
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh dear. So sorry
to keep you wai--

104
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,500
That's close enough!

105
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
What business does
the Vatican have here?

106
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,041
And why send the Iscariots,

107
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,458
the dirtiest of their
dirty little secrets?

108
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,791
How unfortunate.

109
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,583
It appears our reputation
has proceeded us.

110
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,583
Allow me to introduce myself.

111
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,958
My name is Enrico Maxwell.

112
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,125
I'm the current head of
the Iscariot organization.

113
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,083
It's an honor to meet you.

114
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
I really don't care who you are.

115
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,041
Just tell me
what you want.

116
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,500
There is no need
for such a harsh tone.

117
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,166
We didn't come all the way to
England way just to pick a fight

118
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,250
with you Sir Integra.

119
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,750
I don't believe you.

120
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,750
You have done nothing but
show contempt for our treaties.

121
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,833
This latest incident
with Father Anderson

122
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,000
in Northern Ireland
was inexcusable.

123
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,375
He killed two of
my best men in Badrck.

124
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,166
I barely managed to escape

125
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,041
with my head
still attached..

126
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,125
And you have the gaul--

127
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:04,791
Would you shut up?!

128
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,458
How dare you...

129
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,500
You really expect us to just
let you just do as you please?

130
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,000
Two men?

131
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,083
If we had slaughtered two
million of your Protestant scum,

132
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,791
I would not have shed a tear.

133
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm here under direct
orders from His Holiness.

134
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,458
Otherwise I would not bother
with you filthy creatures.

135
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,875
So just shut up
and pay attention,

136
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,708
you miserable English sow.

137
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
A sow?

138
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,791
Nothing like Section 13
to inspire the fear of God.

139
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,583
Such terrifying insults.

140
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,833
2000 years of you
ridiculous prattle.

141
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,041
Truly, some things
never do seem to change.

142
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,291
The Great Vampire Alucard.

143
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,333
The Hellsing family's
pet creature.

144
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,125
I don't believe I've ever
seen you in person before.

145
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,875
it's a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance

146
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a pleasure
to meet you as well,

147
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,166
and now I must say goodbye.

148
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,541
You call my master a sow
and expect me to let you live?

149
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,458
I'm afraid I'm
just going to have

150
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,041
to put a bullet in you,
you stupid little man!

151
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,833
Oh, how absolutely terrifying.

152
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,083
How can a man
be expected to deal

153
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,208
with people who
put gun in his face?

154
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,166
I think you agree that
turnabout is fair play.

155
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,958
So why don't we make
this fight interesting.

156
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,000
Anderson!

157
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,708
Ask of me, and I shall
give thee the heathen

158
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,333
for thine inheritance,

159
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,375
and for thy possession
the ends of the earth.

160
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,500
Thou shalt break
them with a rod of iron;

161
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,333
thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potter's vessel.

162
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,791
Be wise now therefore, ye kings:

163
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,625
be admonished,
ye judges of the earth.

164
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,791
Serve the LORD with fear,
and rejoice with trembling.

165
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,458
Kiss the Son,
lest he be angry...

166
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,416
No... Anderson, Stop!

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,958
though his wrath be
kindled but a little.

168
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,916
This can all be over
with one swing of my sword.

169
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,583
Iscariot does not shirk when
the enemy presents itself!

170
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,375
Neither of us could ever back
down in front of an enemy.

171
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,833
Come on then Judas Priest!

172
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,875
You won't be so lucky
this time, vampire!

173
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,833
Stop! I'm ordering you to stop!

174
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,500
Hi! Right this way everybody!

175
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,250
Everyone with the
Japanese tour this way please!

176
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,916
Kochi desu yo!

177
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,125
Right this way...

178
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,375
We're walking...

179
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,750
Kochi desu yo!

180
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,125
This isn't the time
or place for a fight.

181
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,625
Yes, I think you
may have a point...

182
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,833
I'm going back to sleep.

183
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,000
Getting up in the middle
of the day is exhausting.

184
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,750
If you'll excuse me sir,
I'm going back to Rome.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,458
I must say this is
an excellent museum.

186
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,791
Perhaps next time
you'll allow me

187
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,833
to bring some of the
children from the orphanage.

188
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,958
Of course.
That won't be a problem.

189
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,208
Next time I swear
I'll rip him to bloody pieces.

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,208
It seems we both have

191
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,583
to contend with some rather
difficult subordinates.

192
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,166
Well, are you done pig?

193
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,416
Oh yes, I am quite done.

194
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,791
Now that the violence
is out of the way,

195
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,750
perhaps you would like
to join me in café garden?

196
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,583
Well after you then.

197
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,500
Well done!

198
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,041
Thank you.

199
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,458
We are aware that
you've been looking into

200
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:04,000
a particular word in connection
to your recent troubles.

201
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,416
We also know you haven't
uncovered anything of value.

202
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,583
Yes, that's more or less true.

203
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,916
Millennium, correct?

204
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,625
I know this is Special
Operations' business,

205
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,625
but we do have some information

206
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,958
regarding the name,
"Millennium".

207
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,416
Do you want our files?

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,291
Do you really want
to know what we know?

209
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:34,958
Come on, yes or no?

210
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes please.

211
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,375
I give you... Millennium.

212
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,833
It started over half a century
ago during the second world war.

213
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:06,083
Nazi party loyalists were
preparing to flee from Germany.

214
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,000
An extraction
operation began just

215
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,250
as allied forces
took the country.

216
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,666
Understandable, they needed
enough time to evacuate,

217
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,500
while still standing
their ground long enough

218
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,000
to not be considered traitors.

219
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,833
The majority of
these Party members

220
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,583
and soldiers ended up
in South America,

221
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,333
where they found refuge with
a number of Nazi sympathizers.

222
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,625
Those survivors are
the Millennium group?

223
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,916
Yes. Millennium also refers
to the classified operation

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,375
to move these individuals and
supplies to South America,

225
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,250
and the military unit
that carried out the orders.

226
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,250
You just figured out
how we know all this...

227
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,583
Yes, We helped the Nazi's do it.

228
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,291
The Vatican gave full support,

229
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,083
and helped create
the Millennium group.

230
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,625
I think perhaps they've
starting to put it together.

231
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,250
They know about Millennium.

232
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,916
Put it together you say?

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,750
Nonsense. They don't know
anything about anything yet.

234
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,916
Is it my imagination,
or are you enjoying this?

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,291
Enjoying is hardly the
word for this feeling Doctor.

236
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm ecstatic, positively
giddy with anticipation.

237
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,541
Just think of what a terrible,
bloody struggle awaits us now!

238
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,541
It will be the greatest
struggle of them all!

239
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,833
The... Geinz Kamph!

240
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,583
I assume you've heard the news?

241
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,375
Yes.

242
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,583
The Nazis again...
It's unbelievable.

243
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,833
But now here we
are fifty years later.

244
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,708
Is it really that surprising?

245
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,000
I had a feeling they
might be involved.

246
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,541
This whole mess
feels very familiar.

247
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,541
Oh? And why's that?

248
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,875
"Why's that?" You're asking why
after all we've been through?

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,416
There are not a lot of people

250
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,916
who are willing to enlist the
undead to do there fighting.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,250
There's you, There's them,
and then there's me.

252
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,791
We assumed their
undead research institute

253
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:11,083
was completely destroyed over
fifty years ago during the war.

254
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,791
We killed every last Nazi we
found, don't you remember?

255
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,041
Oh yes. We did, didn't we?

256
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,541
God it's been ages...

257
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,666
Growing old seems so awful.

258
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,250
Nonsense.

259
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,625
Curmudgeonisim is a traditional
pleasure for English gentlemen.

260
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:33,000
Alucard, we're sending
you to South America.

261
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,583
We are not the sort of people

262
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,458
who are used to backing down,
especially when someone

263
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,416
has clearly tried
to pick a fight

264
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,958
Hah! That's a very
British attitude.

265
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,791
Perhaps some discretion
would serve you better

266
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,583
If something can
be achieved easily,

267
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,041
it probably isn't worth it.

268
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,166
Good evening. Has Walter
explained the situation?

269
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,541
My orders are simple.
Search and destroy.

270
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,083
Now go.

271
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,791
Whatever you wish, my master.

272
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,791
A vampire drinking wine
in a private jet,

273
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,500
flying to Rio De Janeiro
in broad daylight?

274
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,125
The stories got
everything wrong!

275
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,791
Well, to be fair
maybe not everything.

276
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:44,291
Hello? Someone please
open this thing!

277
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,875
Let me out!

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,166
I believe I have a suite.

279
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes Mr. Brennan, thank you.

280
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,750
I have your
reservation right here.

281
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,333
The Penthouse has
been prepared for you.

282
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,125
Over here! Come on! This way!

283
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,250
You can bring that
to the penthouse please.

284
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,958
Right, you got it

285
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
Hey, you heard...

286
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,791
That goes up to the penthouse.

287
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,083
Excuse me sir...
is that your luggage?

288
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,583
I'm sorry sir, but the
hotel doesn't allow such...

289
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,458
large personal belongings...

290
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,000
The hotel can't
be held responsible

291
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:36,791
if something were
to happen and-

292
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,958
It's fine.

293
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,625
I'm sure, but I have
to just call my ah...

294
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,583
It's just...
Your luggage looks a bit...

295
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,583
Enough... Everything's fine.

296
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,541
Everything...
Everything is fine.

297
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,625
Everything's perfectly fine.

298
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,208
Yes sir. Everything
is perfectly fine.

299
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,333
Good. Now hurry up with my bags.

300
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,041
Yeah. Fine.

301
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,541
What the hell was that?
Black magic?

302
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,291
Or maybe he has some
kind of evil love beam.

303
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,125
What is this?

304
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,791
My hotel is a trash heap
on the edge of town.

305
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,958
Oh the Inequity!!!

306
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,833
Damn you bourgeoisie!!!
Damn you!!!!

307
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,375
Cheap hotels can
be extremely charming.

308
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,958
Is that so?

309
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,208
This is Red Glove to White Sock.

310
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,166
The guests have
checked into the hotel.

311
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,291
I repeat. The guests have
checked into the hotel.

312
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,541
All right, we'll start
the investigation tomorrow.

313
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll come by for
you once the sun sets.

314
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,750
You vampires do
prefer to work at night,

315
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,416
according to the movies.

316
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,458
I can hardly wait.

317
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,333
What?

318
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,375
I can hardly wait till until
tomorrow. Good evening

319
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,708
I see.

320
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,625
We seem to have found ourselves

321
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,333
sharing common
interests with Hellsing.

322
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:29,333
It won't be easy, cleaning up
this fifty year old mess.

323
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,791
I'm sorry I must
always be asking you

324
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,916
to perform such
unpleasant tasks.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,666
Your Holiness, Please
think nothing of such tasks.

326
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,291
Iscariot is a blade

327
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,916
to be wielded in
whatever way you see fit.

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,708
But I think we
should let the heathens

329
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,916
fight it out
amongst themselves.

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,250
With any luck, they'll not
only dig their own graves,

331
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,208
but pay for the funeral as well.

332
00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:00,916
Seras, wake up. Seras.

333
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:06,000
Uh... Who are you?

334
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,083
I am the spirit of your gun,

335
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,458
my name is the great Harkonnen.

336
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,666
Wait, don't run away!

337
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,541
I said don't run away!
At least don't run that way!

338
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,958
You've been working so hard

339
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,291
I want to
give you my support!

340
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,500
Now, go ahead and ask
me anything you want to,

341
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,250
and don't hold back.

342
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,875
Oh, Wise spirit of Harkonnen,

343
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,541
there is one little
question I'd like to ask.

344
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,750
I've suffered a terrible
series of misfortunes,

345
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,416
and have landed in the most
dreadful of circumstance.

346
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,916
How long will I be
plagued by this bedlam?

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,416
Oh boy...

348
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Wait!! Hold on!! I didn't
mean that. I take it back.

349
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,541
Listen to me Seras.

350
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,000
What is happening now
is not a dream.

351
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:55,125
Something very very bad is going
to happen to you any second.

352
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,291
Huh? What do you mean
"very very bad"?

353
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
I mean terrible.

354
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,125
Any second?

355
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
Right now...

356
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,875
No!

357
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,875
Wake up.

358
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,458
Oh... Hello, good morning.

359
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,750
Good evening.

360
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,166
There's something
interesting going on.

361
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,208
Huh? Light's gone out...

362
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,958
Wha? That sounds just like...

363
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
What?? What??

364
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,916
This is NKT Brazil's
Julia Eduardo reporting...

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,291
Oh my god?
What the hell's going on?

366
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,500
...where tensions are high.

367
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,125
Just 30 minutes ago,
two armed terrorists,

368
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,458
a man and a woman,

369
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,833
killed several of the
hotel's guests and staff.

370
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,500
They have now situated
themselves on the top floor

371
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,083
and have taken over
a dozen people hostage.

372
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,875
Yes, with respect to
that I will find a way

373
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,458
to get in contact with them...

374
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,625
No. No I really don't think
that's the situation at all.

375
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,583
You would really
declare war against us?

376
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,625
You bring this on yourself.

377
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:04,333
We've just received an update on
the situation in Rio De Janeiro.

378
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,958
Let's see you dance, you freaks.

379
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,166
Wind up your waist
and show me some hell.

380
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,416
We still don't have names yet,
but the authorities

381
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,666
are still maintaining a
perimeter around the hotel...

382
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,958
Now, It's time
for us to go to war.

383
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,833
Snipers are in place.

384
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,500
SWAT teams Yanan and
Dagaran are both in position.

385
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,833
We're go! All teams move in!

386
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,333
The targets are in the penthouse
and are confirmed heavily armed.

387
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,208
Extreme prejudice is
advised. Shoot to kill.

388
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,708
We are not taking prisoners.

389
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,541
I repeay, the terrorists
are to be shot on sight.

390
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,541
There. Everything has been
arranged as you instructed.

391
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,541
Anything else Mr. Alhambra?

392
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,208
Oh no. This is very good.

393
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,083
I can think of no new
tasks for you at the moment.

394
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,583
You are well on your way

395
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,916
to being granted entrants
to the kingdom of immortality.

396
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,041
This is Dagaran.
12th floor secure.

397
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,708
Roger. All teams,
12th floor secure.

398
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,708
Quito Team,
secure the elevators.

399
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,250
This is Quito, elevators secure!

400
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,791
I've just been informed

401
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,250
that a SWAT team
has stormed the building.

402
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,916
How do you think Alucard is
going to handle the situation?

403
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
I imagine he'll feel that they

404
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,791
are an obstacle barring
his way to the main objective.

405
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,750
And history has made clear

406
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,625
his favorite tactics for
dealing with obstacles.

407
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,666
Even if they're humans?

408
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,125
Just ordinary ignorant men?

409
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,333
You seem to sometimes
forget what he really is...

410
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,625
Alucard... He's a monster.

411
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,541
Rear guard in position.
Dei Romeo, you're clear.

412
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,875
Roger! We're moving in!

413
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,750
Dogs...

414
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,291
That was a very
good try. However...

415
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,250
I cannot be killed by dogs.

416
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,416
It takes a man
to kill a monster.

417
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,500
Lock the door...

418
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,250
No! You're a monster!

419
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,625
Yes, people keep
telling me that.

420
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,375
And what does that make you,

421
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,125
who would stand
against me, soldier?

422
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:25,125
A man? A dog? A monster?

423
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,458
Master?

424
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,166
Seras, prepare for battle.

425
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,916
But...

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,083
Is there a problem?
Do as your told...

427
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:56,625
But... Master...
These people, they're human.

428
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,791
Your point?

429
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,791
These people are human beings!

430
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,166
I don't care what
these things are!

431
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,666
They came here to kill us!

432
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,041
It no longer
matters what they are!

433
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,958
Now they must die!
They'll be slaughtered.

434
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,458
Corpses, left to rot in
their graves like filth.

435
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,833
This is just the way it is.

436
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,041
This is what has to be done!

437
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,000
And no one has the
power to change that!

438
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,375
Not God, the devil, or you!

439
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:27,875
I know... But... they're just...

440
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,250
This is just the way it is.

441
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:38,500
Uh... yes, Master.

442
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,625
Come along now, Seras.

443
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,250
No time to be a coward...

444
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,083
Sorry sir...

445
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,833
Yes! Right!

446
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,791
Someone's calling
the direct line.

447
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,125
Do you think it's...?

448
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,750
Who is it?

449
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,458
It's your humble
servant, Sir Integra.

450
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,250
Give me my orders, Master.

451
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,125
What did you do
to that SWAT team?

452
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,166
I killed them.

453
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,500
I slaughtered them like cattle.

454
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,583
There's not one left standing.

455
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:20,916
Now, all that I require
is your order, Sir Integra.

456
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,875
I believe the senior
officials of the local police

457
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,208
are under Millennium's control.

458
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,041
These people who
stand against me

459
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,958
may be innocent humans,
but I will kill them.

460
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,833
I'm ready to strike
them down without

461
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,708
a moment's hesitation or
the slightest hint of regret.

462
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,500
I can do this for you.

463
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,708
I'm a monster, and I will
do what needs to be done.

464
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,791
But what will
you do, Sir Integra?

465
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,625
My guns are prepared for battle.

466
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,625
My sights are trained,
my magazine is fully loaded.

467
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:54,208
I've pulled the slide
and removed the safety.

468
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,541
Everything is ready
and waiting. But...

469
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,083
You must be the one
to pull the trigger.

470
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,541
So what will you do?

471
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:05,208
I'm waiting for
orders, my master.

472
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,500
Sir Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing...

473
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,166
Don't you dare
question my resolve!

474
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,000
I've already given you your
marching orders soldier!

475
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,958
You will search and destroy!
Search and Destroy!

476
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,083
Any resistance you
encounter is to be crushed.

477
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,208
Hellsing does not run
form our enemies!

478
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,750
Kill them all!

479
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,208
I order you to leave nothing
but bloody stains in your wake.

480
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,875
The final veil removed!

481
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,750
This is excellent news indeed!

482
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,916
You still know how to
inspire my passion, Integra!

483
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,416
By your orders, my master
I hope that you enjoy the show.

484
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,625
Master...

485
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,625
What do you think Walter?

486
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,833
Did I make the right decision?

487
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,125
I'm your butler Ma'am.

488
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,458
It's not my place to pass
judgment on your decisions.

489
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:41,708
I simply hope my service
helps you make decisions.

490
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,166
Now, why don't I go start
a fresh pot of tea?

491
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,458
I believe I saw a fresh shipment
of Ceylon tea in the kitchen.

492
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,875
Headquarters!!! Headquarters!!!

493
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,208
This is the QUITO team leader!

494
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,500
We're stuck on the top floor.
Please send help!

495
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,166
Anything! He's a monster!
You have to-

496
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,541
Headquarters!!

497
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,833
Get us the fuck out of here!
Oh, God, it's like hell

498
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,958
Goddammit! Please Goddammit!!!!

499
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:49,125
So, is that it?

500
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:53,083
On no. The bloodbath
has only just begun.

501
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,708
He's not even close
to being finished yet.

502
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,208
How do you wish to proceed?

503
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,041
Well it's no fun yet,
that's for sure.

504
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,291
Who cares how many

505
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,833
of these little police
people he tears apart.

506
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:09,291
It's like sprinkling
water on a raging fire!

507
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,041
I know how to liven this up!

508
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:15,291
Tell Tubalcain Alhambra
it's time to attack!

509
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,750
Come on! Let's go! Move! Move!

510
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,583
He's coming! Run! Run!

511
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,375
Come on! Move!

512
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,291
Damn it... Let's go!

513
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,083
Stop it!

514
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,708
What the hell are you doing!

515
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,916
Shut it! Hurry!

516
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,583
Open sesame.

517
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:29,208
Good work soldiers.
Now goodnight...

518
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,166
It's been five minutes since
the SWAT team went in.

519
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,708
We still haven't had
any word from inside.

520
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:44,125
What a glorious spectacle.
I love it!

521
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,916
I've missed my beautiful
war so very much!

522
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,375
Look at him.

523
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,875
So hideous it
makes my spine tingle.

524
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,125
That is what I want!

525
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,541
A creature who dances
between life and death,

526
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:03,083
who mocks the borders
between sanity and madness!

527
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:06,750
He looks as lively as
the first day I saw him!

528
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:11,125
He is truly inhuman this one,
this stranger from the night.

529
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:14,083
This noble vampire.

530
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:19,708
I can hear the symphony of war.
It's been so very long...

531
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:24,291
the chorus of screams,
rising from the pits of hell.

532
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh my, you really shouldn't
play with your food.

533
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:33,583
You certainly do live up
to your reputation.

534
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:39,416
My name is Tublacain
Alhambra Mr. Alucard.

535
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,291
Though some people have taken
to calling me "The Dandy Man".

536
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,958
Fascinating. Did these
poor souls belong to you?

537
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:50,625
Oh, you're speaking of those
unfortunate men up there?

538
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,500
Their superiors were fools,

539
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,666
and so they allow their men
to end up in such a state.

540
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,250
Truly amazing what some people

541
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,750
will do on the
promise of immortality.

542
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,541
Taking advantage of idiots.

543
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,875
We both know that there's
no such thing as immortality.

544
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:09,833
No need to be cruel, they
still served their purpose.

545
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,833
After all how many of your
precious holy ammunition rounds

546
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,458
do you have left now,
Mr. Alucard?

547
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:18,333
You're starting to
bore me, cut to the chase.

548
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,083
What are you here for?

549
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:23,625
I'm here to take your
un-life, Mr. Alucard.

550
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,125
Millennium has given me
the task of bring you in.

551
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:32,500
Or, at least a
sample of you anyway.

552
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,041
I get it.

553
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,291
There is absolutely no
reasoning with you people.

554
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,416
Which leaves me no choice
but to keep killing

555
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,500
until there are none
of you left standing.

556
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,208
Didn't your masters
learn anything

557
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,833
from the first time
I decimated them?

558
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,541
Fell right into my trap.

559
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,750
Oh, no you don't.

560
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,625
Alucard the vampire,
you're so disappointing!

561
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,583
Mr. Alhambra is still in
the middle of fighting him!

562
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,083
What? If anything
happens to him,

563
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,291
we won't get
what's coming to us.

564
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,958
According to
ground reports, the...

565
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,833
I guess that's a step
toward earning my paycheck.

566
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,125
Now where did they
put that helicopter?

567
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,166
I can't stop the bleeding.

568
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,958
Those cards of his
must be very special.

569
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,625
Magic playing cards.

570
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,291
How interesting.

571
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:59,250
You sir, dandy man,
are very amusing.

572
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,500
Hi...

573
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,208
Are you ready for
another round, Mr. Alucard?

574
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,083
I bet they have special
place ready for you,

575
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,541
in the deepest pits of hell.

576
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,333
What? Is something funny?

577
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,666
I'm just pleased that's all.

578
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,250
The world would be so boring

579
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,375
without idiots like
you to amuse me.

580
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,291
A new Millennium group?

581
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:26,250
A revived Last Battalion?
Yes, I know.

582
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,833
You remind me of that
insane little major

583
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,250
and his freakshow menegerie.

584
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:36,125
I'm grateful that the world
still breeds such madness.

585
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:40,208
Now, it's time to play Alhambra!

586
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,833
I want to hear you
squeal like a pig!

587
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:46,083
You expect me to squeal?
Are you serious?

588
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,000
Don't you see what's happening?

589
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,791
If only the world wereso simple.

590
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:53,500
You really have gone
completely soft in the head!

591
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,291
Trying to run again? Useless...

592
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,416
You bitch!

593
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,958
Go to hell!

594
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,083
I've had enough of these pests!

595
00:38:56,458 --> 00:39:01,041
I want to hear
it pig... So squeal!

596
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,833
That's Checkmate
Tubalcain Alhambra.

597
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,166
Now, It's time
we started dealing

598
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,791
with the business at hand.

599
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,958
I'm obliged to give you a
thorough interrogation.

600
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,708
So you are going to tell
me everything you know.

601
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:50,458
Well, your blood will.

602
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,833
So it's war then is it?

603
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh yes, it's war.

604
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,500
A war without distraction
or interruption.

605
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,541
Master... Master!

606
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,416
My god...

607
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,250
Uh... Um, Master...

608
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,291
What was that?

609
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,083
Mr. Alucard and Ms. Seras!

610
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,666
Can I offer you
a lift somewhere?

611
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,375
We ruin the countries we govern

612
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,041
and the people in our care.
We slaughter our enemies,

613
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,791
and sacrifice all our allies.

614
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,750
We'll keep killing till
there's nothing left

615
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,875
but to destroy ourselves.

616
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,458
It will never be enough.

617
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:09,750
We are incorrigible
warmongers, aren't we Major?

618
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,000
Hurry up!

619
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,708
Come on people!
We need to get going now!

620
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,791
Poor Dandy man, looks
like broken rag doll, eh?

621
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,833
Our opponent is quite
impressive, isn't he?

622
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,750
He's stronger than any of us
could have possibly imagined!

623
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:33,083
I'm... I'm so sorry, Major.

624
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:37,166
I suppose this means... that
I still have much work to do.

625
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,958
Please! Don't be ridiculous!

626
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,708
This is the dawn
of a great success!

627
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,875
The things we've learned
today will serve us well

628
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,083
against the Alucard
in the future.

629
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,125
We've gained access to a
most extraordinary being!

630
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,791
A median! More than
a person, a vampire!

631
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,041
I tell you doctor,

632
00:41:57,125 --> 00:42:00,083
fifty years of hard
work are about to pay off!

633
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:04,291
You will build monsters,
turn them into soldiers,

634
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,458
organize them,
train them, supply them,

635
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,666
militarize them,
and command them.

636
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,083
We are the Last Battalion...
the Last Battalion!

637
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:17,916
It is magnificent!
My Grand Professor!

638
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,458
Thank you, Major.

639
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,166
Good!

640
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:27,125
This most delightful show
must now draw to an end.

641
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:32,375
It's time we headed back home
for a bit, don't you think?

642
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,041
Kapitän!

643
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,500
Let's bring her home,
and quickly.

644
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,958
We've kept the gentlemen

645
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:41,541
at the opera house
waiting quite long enough.

646
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,625
So please let us make haste.

647
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,000
I imagine by this time
they are about ready

648
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,000
to explode with anger.

649
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,916
Understood, very
serious business indeed.

650
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,250
I'll have her at full
tilt the whole way Major.

651
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,541
[speaking orders in German]

652
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,166
[repeating orders in German]

653
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,666
Starboard 20!

654
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,458
Starboard 20.

655
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,625
Destination...
Jabro, Panterschanze.

656
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,291
We're coming.

657
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:15,041
I don't care how many
hundreds, or thousands,

658
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:19,333
or millions, or billions
of people try to stop me.

659
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:26,166
Yes. Anyone who dares to stand
in my way will be destroyed!

660
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:31,416
Welcome to this crazy time.
