1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,708
All flesh is grass, and
all the comeliness thereof

2
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,666
as the flower of the field.

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,500
The grass withereth,
the flower fadeth;

4
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,041
but the word of our
God abideth forever.

5
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,708
Have I been... bested... sir?

6
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,375
Yes, you are bested.

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,416
This is not a nightmare
you will be awaking from.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,458
Your castles are plundered.
Your dominion's in ruin.

9
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,208
Your servants destroyed.

10
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:22,000
And the girl has fled
this place forevermore.

11
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,708
She will never be yours, Count.

12
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,541
You are Judged, and found
wanting, Vampire King.

13
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,125
You have nothing.
You are nothing.

14
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,541
Nothing!

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,958
Dreaming...
It was just a dream.

16
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,458
It was nothing.

17
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:38,541
Well now... The situation
must be impossibly dire,

18
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,333
if you've the gall to convene
a round table conference.

19
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,333
Am I right, Sir Integra?

20
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,708
Yes.

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,083
Civilian reports of vampire
attacks on British soil

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,750
have been rising steadily
over the past few months.

23
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,000
We can't keep this
quiet for much longer.

24
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,791
There are limits to the
information we can suppress.

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,791
What is going on Sir Integra?

26
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,000
We have been conducting

27
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,250
a thorough investigation
into the matter.

28
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,083
And finally we have come across

29
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,750
our first solid
piece of evidence.

30
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:07,958
Huh?

31
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,166
And what is that
supposed to be?

32
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,750
A transmitter,
perhaps much more.

33
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,250
We've been finding
these microchips

34
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,166
embedded within the vampires.

35
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,791
These chips seem to
relay information regarding

36
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,000
the creatures' physical
and mental state,

37
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,875
movements and altercations.

38
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,375
Good God!

39
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
These attacks are not random.

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250
There is someone
creating these vampires.

41
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,041
Controlling them. Moving
towards some unknown purpose.

42
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,250
And that's not all.
It gets worse.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:37,875
What?

44
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,083
Please, go on.

45
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,041
These are different.

46
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,083
Traditionally, ghouls
come from the corpses

47
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,000
of deflowered men and women once

48
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,583
they have been drained
of blood by a vampire.

49
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,458
But not anymore.

50
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,416
During these last few incidents

51
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,375
not one new vampire
has been created.

52
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,000
Even young boys and girls
who were clearly virgins

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,000
have become ghouls
instead of vampires.

54
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,208
Also the traditional
ghouls we've encountered

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,166
in the past do not survive
the destruction of their host.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,458
But, during the Badrick
incident Vatican Agent Anderson

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,750
claimed to have destroyed the
vampire well before our arrival.

58
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,416
The host vampire had
already been dispatched,

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,708
and yet, the
ghouls still walked.

60
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,625
So what does it all mean?

61
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,208
We are at war against a
conspiracy of vampire experts.

62
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,083
and they're displaying
remarkable skill

63
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,583
Gentlemen, the enemy
is just like us.

64
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:41,458
Walter... what the
hell is that... thing??

65
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,958
That "thing" you're
referring to is a coffin.

66
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,500
I know. Why is there
a coffin in my bedroom.

67
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,458
Oh, it's here on
orders from Sir Integra.

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,083
"We can't have a vampire who
doesn't sleep in a coffin".

69
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,833
So there you are.

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,500
What have you done with my bed?

71
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,250
I had it disposed of. Of course.

72
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,208
Walter!

73
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,250
Fine, if it helps the
orders were confirmed

74
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,666
by Alucard as well.

75
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,916
Huh? Master?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,416
Yes, Since you're still
refusing to drink blood

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,083
like a proper vampire,
you will slowly become weaker.

78
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,916
You must now sleep
in a coffin filled

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,666
with the soil of
your birthplace.

80
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,458
This smallest of concessions

81
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,166
is the only way to
keep up your strength.

82
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,750
I take it you're still
feeling uncomfortable

83
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,416
with the situation.

84
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,000
You're an idiot.

85
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,416
Master!

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,875
You chose the night.

87
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,333
Once you've turned you're
back on the light of day,

88
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,208
all the sunlight
should ever mean to you

89
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,125
is smoldering pain
and a slow death...

90
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,583
Good evening Alucard,
I have something very special

91
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,708
I was hoping to show to you.

92
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh? What is this?

93
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,125
"The Jackal" a custom

94
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,333
13 millimeter
Anti-freak combat pistol.

95
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,250
It fires custom made rounds,

96
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,000
far more powerful than the 454
Casull rounds you're used to.

97
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,750
Thirty-nine centimeters long,
16 kilograms in weight.

98
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,666
Six rounds per magazine.

99
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,375
The Jackal has more firepower

100
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,166
then any human could
be expected to handle.

101
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,500
And the rounds?

102
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,166
Thirteen millimeter
explosive shells.

103
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,625
Casings?

104
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
Pure Macedonium silver.

105
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,208
And the tips?
Explosive or mercury?

106
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,166
Mercury tips, and
they're already blessed.

107
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,500
It's perfection, Walter.

108
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm pleased that
you're pleased, sir.

109
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,833
I bet this beauty could

110
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,583
even stop father Anderson
dead in his tracks...

111
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,583
Oh my god. Master,
that's amazing!

112
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,958
Ms. Victoria, I believe
I have something special

113
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,416
for you as well...

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,750
Huh?

115
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,291
"The Harkonnen" A 30 Millimeter
Anti-freak Cannon.

116
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,625
Designed to be used with
both depleted-uranium shells

117
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,875
and exploding incendiary shells.

118
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,583
This weapon will destroy all

119
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,500
but the most heavily
armored of targets...

120
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:27,750
W-w-w-w-what the hell is that!

121
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,666
So this dude's friend,

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,166
I mean he's like a
real doctor but like,

123
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,625
does the cosmetic shit
on the side, right?

124
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,333
So then that same crazy
fuck with the horn comes back

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,166
but now he wants a
plexiglas plate for his skull.

126
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,916
And the Doctor fucking
does it! He makes a window!

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can see the
fucker's brain and shit!

128
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,833
This guy's got a
big monster horn

129
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,458
and his head meat on display!

130
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,458
The guys a freak!
I mean, what the fuck?

131
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,833
Yeah, you get it?

132
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,541
Shut up.

133
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,708
This, stream of drivel pours

134
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,333
from your mouth
before every job.

135
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,291
Can we just this once try
for quiet, focused, and cool.

136
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

137
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,125
Same old shit.
I know. Fucking-A Bro.

138
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,250
Failure is not an option.

139
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,125
Oh please.

140
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,041
I could pull this job
in my goddamn sleep.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,666
Hey, what are you
two doing here?

142
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,333
These grounds are off limits.

143
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,500
Oh, I'm so sorry.

144
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,875
We're on a sight seeing tour
of famous English estates.

145
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,166
Are you saying this mansion
isn't open to the public?

146
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,500
This is private property.
Please leave at once.

147
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,041
Yes sir.

148
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,583
All right.

149
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,666
Dude's looking kinda queasy.

150
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,083
He could use a nap.

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,708
Right then, ciao.

152
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,000
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

153
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,875
I said hold your fucking fire!

154
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,666
Dude, Bro...

155
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
These guys are
complete fucking idiots.

156
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,833
Are you sure about this shit?

157
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,208
Please. This is a test.

158
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,791
An insignificant, ordinary test.

159
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,083
Don't forget the big picture.

160
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,625
His plans are moving forward,

161
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,708
and we are but the smallest
cogs in this great machine...

162
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,791
Fine Whatever.
Now, let's have a little fun.

163
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,250
Listen up maggots!

164
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,541
You know how the plan goes!

165
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,000
You make the kill,
you drink the spill!

166
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,875
And if you run into Alucard
or the Hellsing beyotch...

167
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,166
Don't you quit till
they're dead! Dead! Dead!

168
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,541
Calm down!
What's going on, Sir Integra?

169
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,291
Sir Integra,
this is control room 1!

170
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,333
What happened? Report!

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,041
We're under attack.
It's an unknown enemy!

172
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,291
What?

173
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,416
All outside communication
has been cut off!

174
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,333
We're currently exchanging
fire at the front entrance

175
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,250
Hold the line!
Buy as much time as you can!

176
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,833
Yes Ma'am!

177
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,291
Officer? I need
details! How many?

178
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,625
Who are we fighting?

179
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,958
The enemy...

180
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,583
Oh god... they're
enemy are ghouls...

181
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,708
Aim high!

182
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,791
Dammit! Why won't they die?!

183
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,791
Bastards!

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,208
Up, up!

185
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,375
Down, down!

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,041
Left, right. Left, right!

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,166
Bringing the motherfucking
death by Konami!

188
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,166
I am so goddamn hard right now!

189
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,666
An army? A ghoul army?

190
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,875
We... we need to buy time.

191
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,166
First priority
is our evacuation.

192
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,166
Secure a path to the heliport!

193
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,791
Great Scott!

194
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,333
What happened? What was that?

195
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,166
I'm afraid it was
the heliport, sir.

196
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,375
What?

197
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,500
This is a very well
planned attack. Damn.

198
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,791
Sir Integra. We can't hold
this position for much longer.

199
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,000
We're being overrun! It's...

200
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,416
Officer, report!!!

201
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Jesus, it's...

202
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
Officer!! Hello!!!

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,333
Hello... Is this
thing on? Cool...

204
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,708
This is a message going out

205
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,208
to the round table conference.

206
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,750
And a very personal
and heartfelt shout out

207
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,833
to the queen bitch
herself, Ms. Hellsing!

208
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,583
All right!

209
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,083
You're ass is
currently being kicked,

210
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,791
by the Valentine Brothers!

211
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,416
My name is Jan Valentine,

212
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,250
and I can't wait to meet
each and every one of you.

213
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,291
We'll be getting
intimate as soon as

214
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,875
me and the boys finish lunch.

215
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,208
And let me be the
first to thank you

216
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,833
for providing us all
these tasty smacks.

217
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,291
By tomorrow Hellsing will
be nothing but a pile of shit

218
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,875
You've got no where left
to run and no where to hide.

219
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,250
Cause now I am
coming to kill you.

220
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,500
I wanna see you cry and beg.

221
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,750
In the meantime I highly
recommend pissing yourself,

222
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,958
followed by a course of
praying to your impotent God!

223
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,250
But, hey,
there's still time left

224
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,208
to just be a man
and kill yourself!

225
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,541
Thank you London!
We love you! Good night!

226
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,375
What do you plan to
do about this, Integra?

227
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,333
He said the ghouls have
taken over the estate...

228
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,750
They're coming for us.

229
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,875
What's worse,
we have a security leak.

230
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,291
Damn it, Integra!

231
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,000
What's your position, Walter?

232
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,625
Ms. Victoria's room
in the sub-basement.

233
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,625
I have already been brought
up to speed on the situation.

234
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,666
Outside communications
have been cut off

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
so I wouldn't expect
reinforcements

236
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,166
for at least
4 hours, maybe five.

237
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
In the meantime, our current
forces have been ordered

238
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,833
to defend the conference
room with their lives.

239
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,083
What do you recommend?

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
Well for starters,
pleases fortify the door

241
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,166
to the conference room.

242
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,583
Since both Alucard and
Ms. Victoria are with me

243
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,875
down in the sub basement,

244
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,500
I propose we divide
into two teams.

245
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,083
Alucard will head upstairs.

246
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:34,375
Ms. Victoria and I will make our
way towards the conference room.

247
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,708
How will you manage?

248
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,541
The hallway is full of ghouls.

249
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,666
How did you manage to find
Alucard's cell 10 years ago?

250
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,625
The air ducts of course!

251
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,791
Seems to be the best
option at the moment.

252
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,333
We'll both be there
shortly. Good luck.

253
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,541
Walter...

254
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,916
These animals are
eating my people.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,875
Show no mercy. Do not let
them leave the grounds alive!

256
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
By you're orders
then, Sir Integra.

257
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:11,791
Oh, does Walter Dolneas,
the angel of death ride again?

258
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,291
Come on, what are
you two talking about?

259
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,708
You'll see soon enough.

260
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,166
Put the Veteran and
the rookie together

261
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,750
and you may as well
have one normal soldier.

262
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
This could actually
end up being fun.

263
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,458
Makes you wonder doesn't it...

264
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,541
If there are any normal people

265
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,208
who work in this bloody place?

266
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,958
Please, be quiet.

267
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,583
What?

268
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,833
Yo Luke, what up?
Can you hear me now?

269
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,875
This is your
brother Jan Valentine,

270
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,083
commander of the army of
the undead Hellsing slayers.

271
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,458
Ah yeah.

272
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,958
Letting you know the first
two floors are secure.

273
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,750
Now all that's left is
to take the third floor,

274
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,250
crash the Round Table
Conference and kick the shit

275
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,375
out of a little girl and
a bunch of old people!

276
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,166
Just stick to the plan.

277
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,666
Don't give them an inch.

278
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,833
I think I'm heading
for the basement.

279
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,208
Well that's enough of that.

280
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,166
Time to see what you
can really do, Alucard.

281
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,083
What the hell's going on?!

282
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,833
They're closing in, and fast.

283
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,500
They've taken the first two
floors as well as the roof.

284
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,666
Escape is impossible.

285
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,500
Just do something!
You're responsible for this!

286
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,041
Sir Penwood!

287
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,083
This is neither the time
nor place for such behavior.

288
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,500
I believe what Sir Integra
is trying to say is

289
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,333
that we must all
be expected to fend

290
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,583
for ourselves when the
time comes. Is that correct?

291
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,166
Yes Sir.

292
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,000
And they're ghouls,
aren't they?

293
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,666
And they're armed too the teeth!

294
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,041
We're all...
We're all going to die!

295
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,291
It's a... It's a bottom?

296
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,833
Are you're all right,
Miss Victoria?

297
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,708
Seras! Walter!

298
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,791
I do apologize for the delay.

299
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,291
Hi!

300
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,416
The manor's defensive forces
have been roundly decimated.

301
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,541
I don't know who armed and
trained these creatures,

302
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,000
but whoever did
is a tactical genius.

303
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,708
They knew exactly how
and where to hit us.

304
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:35,541
Walter, honestly.
Do you think we're done for?

305
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,166
No. Of course not!

306
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,500
Compared to the sorts

307
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,791
of trouble Van Hellsing
faced a century ago,

308
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,541
I think it's fair to say
this hardly rates as a crisis.

309
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,833
The plan is as
follows, Sir Integra.

310
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,791
Alucard will intercept our
attackers in the sublevels.

311
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,166
Seras and I will
clear this floor.

312
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,208
You're standing orders will
be followed to the letter.

313
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,708
I promise that not one

314
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,541
of these villains will ever
see the light of day again.

315
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,916
Now with your permission Sir,

316
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,750
I believe it's time
I gave these young people

317
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,041
a proper lesson in violence.

318
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,750
Fuck these are
some fine cigars.

319
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,583
Like all bourgeois and shit.

320
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,791
I mean, come on.
That's just fucked up.

321
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,000
People starving in the world
and she's wasting money on this?

322
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,416
A slow and agonizing
death is too good

323
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,208
for that stick-up-her-ass bitch.

324
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,458
I think it time someone gave

325
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,625
her an old fashion
working-class ass kicking.

326
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I know you're in here.

327
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,666
Even when you're hiding,
I can feel your presence.

328
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
Why on earth would I hide?

329
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,750
Don't dare mistake
my patience for cowardice.

330
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,666
Honestly I was starting to
get a bit bored waiting for you.

331
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,041
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance Alucard.

332
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,375
My name is Luke Valentine.

333
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,833
I'm a really
big fan of your work.

334
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,250
Little Hellsing chicky...
we're coming to find you...

335
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,041
Come on out and
play little Hellsing.

336
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,750
I promise it's gonna
be a lot of fun.

337
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,083
We just want to
torture you, kill you,

338
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,416
maybe skull-fuck your
corpse a couple times.

339
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,000
Burn the house to the ground
go home and masturbate, OK?

340
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,250
Oh dear, did I miss?

341
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,333
I guess I'm not as
spry as I used to be...

342
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,750
My name is Walter Dolneas.

343
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,958
Butler to the Hellsing family.

344
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,875
And former master
vampire hunter.

345
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,083
Fire!

346
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,875
Bit on the slow side,
aren't they?

347
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,875
After all a ghoul
is just a ghoul.

348
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,041
In theory threatening,
certainly tenacious.

349
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,791
But honestly they're
quite a distance

350
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,625
from indestructible
or invincible.

351
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,000
I highly recommend
pissing yourself...

352
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,916
Followed by a course of
praying to your impotent God.

353
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,250
Now that's fucking great...

354
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,333
Cause I gotta tell ya,
plowing thru you people

355
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,416
was really starting to
bore the fuck out of me!

356
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,250
Oh my.

357
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,791
Hut!

358
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:42,166
Miss Victoria, Now would be
a good time for some support.

359
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,958
Sir! Right!

360
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,375
Huh?

361
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,291
Second volley!

362
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,541
Fire an incendiary-round

363
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,583
with a VT fuse strait
thru the center ranks!

364
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,833
Yes, sir!

365
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,875
Oh fuck you!

366
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,541
Like that, you old fuck?

367
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,416
Ow!!

368
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,416
Die!

369
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,333
I've got him Walter.
Are you alright?

370
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,083
Get off bitch!
I'm supposed to be on top.

371
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,625
Shit this is just
fucking degrading!

372
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,791
I think I'm starting
to feel my age

373
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,208
That is quite an impressive
hold, where did you learn it?

374
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,791
Well, you know I was
a police officer once.

375
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,083
Get the fuck off me!
Fucking vampire slut!

376
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,500
Is this chick the best you got?

377
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:12,458
No wonder you all went down
like a bunch of pussies!

378
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,333
I'll be asking the questions!

379
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,666
What's the objective
of this attack?

380
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,625
Who are you taking orders from?

381
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,083
Me? I'm just a tourist.

382
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,541
I was passing by, totally
minding my own business,

383
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,416
and I thought I'd have look.

384
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,541
So we cool, dude?

385
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:33,083
Young man...
the left one's next.

386
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,291
We were following
orders, alright?

387
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,375
We were told to attack
the Hellsing headquarters,

388
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,583
and kill everyone
we found inside.

389
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,750
We supposed to confirm the
deaths of the Round Table,

390
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,166
and your pet vampire.

391
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,875
Hold on. You're not the
only one in charge here.

392
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,208
Who else?

393
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,916
Wow. You're quick.

394
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,375
Right now big brother
Valentine is downstairs

395
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,291
beating Alucard
into a carpet stain!

396
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,166
Your named gets thrown
around quite a bit, Alucard.

397
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,541
The things people say.

398
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,291
They tell stories of
your amazing strength,

399
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,166
how you glide
thru oceans of blood.

400
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,416
They call you
Night-walker. Beyond human.

401
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,708
A monster whose powers radiate

402
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:30,541
with a darkness that casts
a shadow on darkness itself.

403
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,750
Finally I get to know once

404
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:36,125
and for all if there's anything
more to you then rumor.

405
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,250
When I was human, I feared you.

406
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,250
The stories anyway.
And when I gave up being human,

407
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,416
when I became this,
I began to admire you.

408
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,125
You... the first great
pioneer of immortality.

409
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,583
No matter what
the rest of us do,

410
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,916
really we're all just
chasing your shadow.

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,416
That's ridiculous.

412
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,583
You fool. There's no
such thing as an immortal.

413
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,250
Yes I know.

414
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,416
And once I have
your head on a stick,

415
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,666
everyone else will know too.

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,333
So now I get to kill you

417
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:12,166
and make my wildest
dreams come true.

418
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,666
You've never seen
anything like me before!

419
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,041
I was designed to
surpass you in every way.

420
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,708
I was born to be your death!

421
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:04,750
Check!

422
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:22,500
A pistol... did that? Jesus.

423
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,041
Your reflexes are amazing.

424
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,583
I told you I am
completely different

425
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,541
from any creature that
you've ever faced before.

426
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,333
I have the sum total of your
vampiric power at my disposal.

427
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,041
All of it and more!

428
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,083
Me and my brother,
we were designed

429
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,916
with the soul intention
of killing you fucks.

430
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,125
You people are so fucking
dead you don't even know it!

431
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,708
You're in no position
to make threats.

432
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,875
Dude, you must be
going senile Alfred!

433
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:21,041
And now for our next trick,
check out door number three!

434
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,750
My god what have you done?

435
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,750
It's time to get
this party started!

436
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,583
Stop!!

437
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,916
You made it. Congratulations.

438
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,666
Oh fuck me...

439
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,416
What?

440
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,666
He's not even trying
to dodge the bullets!

441
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,541
Does he think he's
indestructible?!

442
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,833
Everything has a breaking point!

443
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,875
He may act like
he's not injured,

444
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,041
but he's taking far
more damage than I am!

445
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,166
I can beat him!

446
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,875
Yes! Excellent!

447
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,625
I haven't had this
much fun in ages!

448
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,625
What did you say your name was?

449
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,916
It's Luke. Luke Valentine.

450
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,250
Luke Valentine.

451
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,416
It's obvious that
your powers are beyond

452
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,625
even the highest
category of vampire...

453
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,416
Releasing control art
restriction systems

454
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,958
3... 2... 1...

455
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,750
Approval of Situation
A recognized.

456
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,083
Commencing the
Cromwell Invocation.

457
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:11,333
Ability restrictions
lifted for limited use

458
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,458
until the enemy has
been rendered silent.

459
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,125
Now, Luke Valentine,
it's time to educate you

460
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,041
on how a real vampire
does battle!

461
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:22,166
What are you?
What in the hell are you?!

462
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,833
Come on! Get up!

463
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:31,125
Attack me! You've only
suffered the loss of your legs!

464
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:35,208
Summon up your familiars!
Transform your body!

465
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,750
Heal your severed
legs and stand!

466
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,166
The evening is still so young.

467
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,041
Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

468
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,208
Pull yourself together!
The fun has just begun!

469
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,916
Come on! Hurry!

470
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,250
Monster!

471
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,625
So. I see you for
what you really are.

472
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:09,958
You're pathetic. Nothing but a
useless sniveling lump of meat!

473
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,833
Shut up! You're nothing
but the Hellsing family toy!

474
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,708
A dog for the Church of England!

475
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,541
Not even fit to call himself
a vampire! A puppet of the-

476
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,791
Silence!

477
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,625
I'm a dog?
Then you're dog food.

478
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,208
Was that was really all you had?

479
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,125
Such a shame
I overestimated you.

480
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:46,375
As a vampire, you were
just a pathetic piece if shit.

481
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,791
Now you're nothing but dog shit.

482
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,875
The one upstairs
didn't seem like much,

483
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,458
but they're having
more trouble with him

484
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,375
than I would have expected...

485
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,250
My men...

486
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,833
They've turned all
my men into ghouls!

487
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,791
Seras!

488
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:58,208
That's enough! You can stop!
Seras! Please. Stop!

489
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,000
It's all over, boy.

490
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,208
Nice. Come on
kill me limp dick.

491
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,250
Oh, I'm not going to kill you.

492
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,958
Not until after you tell
me who put you up to this.

493
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,083
Then I'll put you
out of your misery.

494
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,541
Are you serious?!
You fucking pussy...

495
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,916
What up, bitch?!

496
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:36,833
We'll have no more
of that. I'm pissed off.

497
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,875
Who the hell are you people?

498
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,416
What did you hope
to accomplish here?

499
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,083
Who's responsible
for this? Start talking!

500
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,125
Answer!

501
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,500
Come on, bitch!

502
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,958
You know! The ones that
put the fucking chip in me.

503
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,916
The chip that's
sending information

504
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,583
and letting them
know we fucked up.

505
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,458
They can hear us talking.
Every last goddamn word.

506
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,000
And if they know I'm standing
here all fucked up and dying,

507
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,416
about to tell you everything,

508
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,333
you think they're gonna
let me fucking live?

509
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:23,291
See? I so fucking told you!

510
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,916
Well, since I'm fucked,

511
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,750
how 'bout I piss a little
wisdom on you dipshits?

512
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,500
You can take this clue and
shove it up your ass, bitch!

513
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:39,458
Beware the Millennium!

514
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,458
That's it? Millennium?

515
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,125
Are you all right, Sir Integra?

516
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,208
Yes, I'm fine. And as for them,

517
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,333
please, put them out
of their misery Walter?

518
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:02,333
Of course.

519
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,458
Walter, you will
belay that order.

520
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,125
The responsibility must
fall to their leader.

521
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,833
Sir Integra, it's your duty.

522
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,666
No, Sir Islands!
That's going too far!

523
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,791
This entire situation
should have been prevented.

524
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:22,000
Integra, Your lack of
preparation is an offence.

525
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,708
And since this facility
is under your command,

526
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,291
the responsibility is yours.

527
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,750
The fact that these men
died and were reanimated

528
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,958
as these creatures
is entirely your fault!

529
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,416
How dare you, sir?!

530
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,250
Walter!

531
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,500
I do not ask for
your forgiveness.

532
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,375
This is my burden.

533
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,708
Now, Walter.

534
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,125
See what you can find
out about this "Millennium".

535
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,166
I expect you to work
quickly and thoroughly.

536
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,458
Yes. Of course, sir.

537
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,625
We will see them pay a
thousand fold for this horror.

538
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,041
Out of the 96 members

539
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,541
of the Hellsing Organization's
Headquarters in London,

540
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:23,291
only 10 are left, 8
of which are only alive

541
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,875
because they were away
at the time of the attack.

542
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,541
Excluding them,
the only survivors

543
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:32,333
from this ordeal are myself,
and you, Sir Integra.

544
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,291
What about Seras and Alucard?

545
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,458
Aren't you forgetting
about them?

546
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:40,000
I didn't include them because
they're already dead, Sir.

547
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,333
Yes of course.

548
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,500
Any word yet on "Millennium"?

549
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,833
We solicited the resources

550
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:49,041
of the British Intelligence
Service, as well as

551
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,041
the National Public Safety
Commission, who went so far

552
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,375
as to rummage through
the unsorted book stacks

553
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,916
at the British Museum.

554
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,833
Internationally, we
discovered seven occult and

555
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,541
military enthusiast
organizations throughout Japan,

556
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,416
France, and the United States,

557
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,750
including a "Star Wars"
related club in Los Angeles.

558
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,291
Star Wars?

559
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:12,708
The Millennium Falcon... it's
the name of Han Solo's ship.

560
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,625
So what you're telling me

561
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:17,083
is that we have
no solid leads at all.

562
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,708
My apologies, ma'am.

563
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:22,625
At this point, the only thing
we know is its definition.

564
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,458
A span of One Thousand Years.

565
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,875
Now that is something...

566
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,041
Yes?

567
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,166
Don't you remember, Walter?

568
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:36,333
The Empire of the Millennium.

569
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,583
The order that sought the
glory of a 1000-year kingdom

570
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:44,625
and plunged the entire
planet into a world war.

571
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,625
Hitler's Germany.

572
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,208
The Millennium-order
of the Third Reich.

573
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:12,208
All is well gentlemen.
The experiment can move ahead.
