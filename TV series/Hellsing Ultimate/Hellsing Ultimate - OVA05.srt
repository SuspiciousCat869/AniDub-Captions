1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,458
Alucard... Hey,
wake up, Alucard...

2
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,291
And who the hell are
you supposed to be?

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,833
I'm the spirit of your gun.

4
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,750
You can call me
Jackal... Willis.

5
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,666
Come on! Don't shoot the Willis!

6
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,375
Stop it, just hear
the Willis out!

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,583
This is ridiculous.
I'm going to leave now.

8
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,916
You think you can just leave?

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,833
Man, you're living in
the Willis-space now.

10
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:29,083
And one does not simply
leave Willis-space, my man.

11
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,750
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life in the Willis-space,

12
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,750
making cameo's in
various productions,

13
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,250
regardless of their
entertainment value.

14
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:40,083
And another thing, stop saying
I weigh 10 kilo's, already!

15
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:46,458
Get, it, right! The Jackal
weighs 16 Kilo's, my man.

16
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,625
Really...

17
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,083
The two of us will
have a savage pedal

18
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,875
to the metal burn
through Nakatomi Plaza...

19
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,916
Or you can help me
rescue Ving Rhames

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,416
from getting sodomized wielding
nothing but a samurai sword!

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,083
You, me, and Steve
Buscemi will sweep

22
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,791
the Golden Raspberries by going
into space to blow up a meteor!

23
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,750
Along the way we're
going to get jerked around

24
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,666
by a kid with a weird
name who can see ghosts,

25
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,708
and after that we're going
to roll our taxi trying

26
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,791
to catch Milla Jovovich...

27
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,416
That was a close call.

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,708
You let that impostor
get too close.

29
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,458
One always has to be on guard,

30
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,166
expecting sneak
attacks and betrayals.

31
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,750
Never, let another man
choose your weapon.

32
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,208
It's time to wake up Alucard.

33
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,750
Seras and Integra
are waiting for you.

34
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,708
Look! Isn't that General
de Gaulle up there?

35
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,125
Up where?

36
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,500
Oh!

37
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,291
Damn, I missed.

38
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,625
Hello, I'm Christopher Walken.

39
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,333
And I'm Tom Berenger.

40
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,666
Together, we are
the Dogs of War.

41
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,083
Stop it...

42
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:59,125
I'm Maximillian Schell.
I say, we kill them all.

43
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,291
Stop it!

44
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,000
Hello, I am the Emperor.

45
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,750
Who are you?

46
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,500
Hello. I am the Fourth Protocol.

47
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,791
That makes no sense.

48
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,208
Hello, I am the Negotiator.

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,083
Then good luck to you...

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,000
And thus, the seelöwe
shall cross the ocean,

51
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,125
and climb atop the hill.

52
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
Sir, our communication feed

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,291
to Vauxhall Cross has just been
cut off! The SIS is offline!

54
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,625
It's what?!

55
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,250
We've also lost contact
with London BTN control.

56
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,416
Civilian communication
networks across the city

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,916
are apparently also offline.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,541
Sir, we've lost contact
with Ark Air Force Base!

59
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,500
No response from the Atlantic
Fleet or from Fleet Command.

60
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,166
We've had no word from Defence
Intelligence Headquarters.

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,875
All lines are down.

62
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,375
General, we've
received civilian reports

63
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,333
of a fleet of dirigibles
moving north over Newhaven.

64
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,500
They're on a direct
course for London.

65
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,833
Dirigibles? A fleet of airships?

66
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,958
Impossible. They can't be
trying to declare war on us!

67
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,750
We're past that.

68
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,625
Sir Integra...

69
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,875
The enemy... is at the gate.

70
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,416
Full speed ahead! Onward!

71
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,916
Faster! Faster, faster!

72
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
Push the engines harder!

73
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,166
Faster! Faster!

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,291
Schneller! Schneller!

75
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,041
We see the spires of
London! Charge the city!

76
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,791
Schneller! Schneller!

77
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,791
We shall strike the city,

78
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,708
and burn it down to
ash once again! Faster!

79
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,291
Come on, just hold up a sec!

80
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,583
Fuck off, you little prick!

81
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,458
Aw, sweetie,
don't be such a bitch!

82
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,500
Hey Jansen, have a
friend's back would you?

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,583
The moon...

84
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,083
It's the moon...

85
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,791
That's cool!

86
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,541
Soldiers of the
Last Battalion, achtung!

87
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,041
Gentlemen, night has fallen.

88
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,916
Tonight, my invincible
warriors of millennium.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,083
Tonight, all our
promises bear fruit!

90
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,791
Welcome to the eve of war!

91
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,541
All right everyone,

92
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,916
it's time to for us to
open up our handbooks.

93
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,583
We'll start on page three:

94
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,291
"Operation Sea Lion,
British Invasion 2"

95
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,791
Please note the information
under the bullet points

96
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,500
"London Explodes!" and
"Crack Battle Vampires."

97
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,791
Uhh... Huh... Uh-oh...

98
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,458
Oh, dear, what is the problem
this time, Herr Schrödinger?

99
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,708
Doctor, I'm sorry, I seem to
have misplaced my handbook.

100
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, such trouble...
What to do with you?

101
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,833
Go share with
the captain for now.

102
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,500
Zorin... Lieutenant
Zorin Blitz...

103
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,458
Ready for orders.

104
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,083
Our primary targets are
the Hellsing Organization,

105
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,291
and the vampire Alucard.

106
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,416
The men under your command
will be the vanguard unit.

107
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Take your Zeppelin and make your
way to Hellsing headquarters.

108
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,083
Yes sir.

109
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,666
Please avoid a
direct assault for now.

110
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,000
I will arrive with the
main force post haste.

111
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,916
I don't know why you
would even bother sir.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,041
Without Alucard the Hellsing
forces are as weak as children.

113
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,083
Do not take the
Hellsing women lightly.

114
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,375
Integra Hellsing
and Seras Victoria

115
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,541
are not to be trifled with.

116
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,333
Sir Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing,

117
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,041
scion of the famed
Dr. Van Helsing, and the head

118
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,625
of the greatest family of
vampire hunters in history.

119
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:29,541
And she is the only authority
the Vampire Alucard recognizes.

120
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:34,708
Then there is the policewoman,
the vampire Seras Victoria.

121
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,458
She is... perhaps a miracle?

122
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,416
Perhaps you might think,
something of a joke?

123
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,500
I suspect that she herself

124
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,750
may not fully
understand her nature yet.

125
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,333
It certainly makes it exciting
though, don't you think?

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,833
They are both inexperienced,
imperfect, and untested.

127
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,208
I would therefore
argue that like Alucard,

128
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:03,000
they are archenemies worthy
of caution and scrutiny.

129
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,750
And that is why you shall
hold, without engaging.

130
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,125
Do you understand
your orders Zorin?

131
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,083
They are crystal clear,
Battalion Commander.

132
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,458
Perfect.

133
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,250
Then everything is set.

134
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,791
It is time for us to open
the floodgates of war!

135
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,500
Our first target shall
be the City of London--

136
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,083
The west bank of
the Thames; Big Ben;

137
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,791
the Houses of Parliament;
Ten Downing Street;

138
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,166
the Ministry of Defence;

139
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,708
Buckingham Palace; Scotland
Yard; Westminster Abbey;

140
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,125
Piccadilly Circus; Soho;
the City; Southwark--

141
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,458
burn it to the ground!

142
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,500
Burn the poles.
Burn the central government.

143
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,916
Major, what about
the Cabinet War Rooms?

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,375
Blow them up. They're awful.

145
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,333
Don't leave the slightest
hint they ever existed.

146
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,208
What shall we do about
Trafalgar Square, Major?

147
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,458
Destroy it.
Topple Nelson's Column.

148
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,833
The Tower of London,
the British Museum...

149
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:05,291
the British Library -- destroy
them all. They're repulsive.

150
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,583
And Tower Bridge?

151
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,583
Topple it. London Bridge
as well, like the song.

152
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,833
And what about the
Imperial War Museum?

153
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,125
Blow it up.

154
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,541
Go forth, and destroy
everything that you see.

155
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,875
Devour everyone you meet.

156
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Feast and imbibe to
your hearts content.

157
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,166
This mighty capital of
8 million souls are nothing

158
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,625
but our supper.

159
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,875
Come, gentlemen, it's time
for us to kill and be killed.

160
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,916
To give, and receive death.

161
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,708
Now... let us
toast the occasion.

162
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,250
For tonight is a feast,

163
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,083
the likes of which has
never been seen before.

164
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,541
Prosit!

165
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,291
Prosit!

166
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,666
I want more...

167
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,750
Ready the refitted V1's!

168
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,500
Prepare to drop the
Waffen-Shutzstaffel!

169
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,958
Ya vol!

170
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,750
All retrofitted V1's
have been fired!

171
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,083
The blow has crippled
the infrastructure!

172
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,000
They are crippled! Crippled!

173
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,375
It's not enough...

174
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,125
More... I demand more!

175
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,333
Harvest the fruits of battle!

176
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,458
It's beautiful...

177
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,166
Like a twilight view of hell.

178
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,583
Below us is the only place
fit for monsters such as us.

179
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,583
It is the only place
we would wish to be.

180
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:09,791
Commence ground combat
operation. Deploy paratroopers!

181
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,458
Here we go you Frontschwein!
Off to war!

182
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:28,666
Fünf... vier...
drei... zwei... eins...

183
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,791
What is the meaning of this?!

184
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,666
Please, no sudden moves...
Sir Integra.

185
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,958
As of now, this facility is
under the control of Millennium.

186
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,375
Enough! What is going on!

187
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,000
Shut up!

188
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:31,250
What is going on, Sir Penwood,
is a very good day for Vampires.

189
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,708
A very good day indeed,

190
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,291
considering I've just
captured the great Sir Integra.

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,041
What's so funny?!

192
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,125
Why the whole thing of course.

193
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,166
Really, you're the vampire
equivalent of newborns.

194
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
We on the other hand

195
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,833
are the institution
of your annihilation.

196
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,458
Frogs parading
in front of a viper.

197
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
Of course it's funny

198
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,083
I'm not scared of you!

199
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,833
I hope you can
claim your Iron Cross

200
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,125
from your corporal in hell.

201
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,291
Shut up!

202
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,416
Walter, clean up.

203
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,666
As you wish, Sir Integra.

204
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,708
Now then, It's time to take
these children across my knee.

205
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,750
Die!

206
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,250
That all?

207
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,666
Bloody traitors.

208
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,833
Sorry, Sir Penwood.
Are you all right?

209
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,000
Up until now,
I had been convinced

210
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,583
that you were the
traitor in our midst.

211
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:17,166
I may be powerless against them,
but I'm certainly not a coward.

212
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,041
Sir, the city is under siege!

213
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,625
No word from the
Chiefs of Staff!

214
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,916
We've already lost
contact with over

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
150 military installations
and command centers

216
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,250
across the British Empire!

217
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,916
It is possible they're currently
engaging the enemy forces!

218
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,166
It'll be the same everywhere...

219
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,125
This facility is sure to
be on their list of targets.

220
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,291
We should be gone before they
arrive. It's time to leave.

221
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,666
There are Nazi soldiers are
dropping from the airships!

222
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
It's the Waffen-SS!

223
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,833
It can't be!

224
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,875
Sir Penwood, it's time.

225
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,833
This building is about to be
overrun by an army of vampires!

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
Sir Integra.

227
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,250
You and your man will return
to Hellsing headquarters

228
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,291
as quickly as is possible.

229
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,916
There are duties you are
honor bound to perform.

230
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,333
Go, and see to your
sworn obligations,

231
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,666
I must stay and perform mine.

232
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,416
This place can no longer
function as a command center.

233
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,166
Do you have a death wish?

234
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,416
It's still possible for us to
restore communications,

235
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,583
and we may be able
to issue orders again.

236
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,750
We will need to establish
a chain of command

237
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,041
with whatever bases are still
fighting off the invasion.

238
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,041
I am the commanding
officer here.

239
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,041
This is my facility.

240
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,583
I cannot abandon my post.

241
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,333
I know that
I'm not a strong man.

242
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,708
I've always been nervous.

243
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,625
Even I'm not entirely sure

244
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,333
how a man like me ended up
in such a position of authority.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,625
No, that's not true.

246
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,208
I was born with
a title, and money.

247
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,333
My authority was expected,

248
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,416
and my position handed
to me by obligation.

249
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,250
So, given that,
the least I can do

250
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,458
is perform the
responsibilities I was handed.

251
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,750
Now, off with you Sir Integra.

252
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,500
There are evils moving
against us that only you-

253
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,333
That only Hellsing can face.

254
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,250
It's loaded with blessed
atomized silver tip rounds.

255
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,125
You should find them more
effective than ordinary iron.

256
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,625
Sir Penwood.

257
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,541
Best of luck, and good hunting.

258
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,708
Thank you, and good
hunting, Sir Integra.

259
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,625
All staff prepare
for evacuation.

260
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,875
Only essential personnel
will stay behind.

261
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,416
On second thought,
in truth, I suppose,

262
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,458
I'm capable of operating
the emergency systems myself.

263
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,166
All of you, get out
of here. Quickly.

264
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,750
That's enough. What's so funny?

265
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
I gave an order! Evacuate!

266
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,375
I'll try and establish contact

267
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,583
with National
Defence again, sir.

268
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,000
Start looking for a line!

269
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
Gather weapons and ammunition!

270
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,541
Let's form a garrison. Quickly!

271
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,750
Sir!

272
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,208
Hey, wait!

273
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,708
Start setting up barricades
at the entrances. Go!

274
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,625
I told you idiots!

275
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:52,291
You don't even have
to be here anymore!

276
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,416
There's no need
for hysterics, Sir.

277
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,083
And everyone knows you have no
idea how the consoles operate.

278
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,416
Please, sir, just
take your normal seat.

279
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,958
Otherwise you'll
just get in the way.

280
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,000
Thank you, gentlemen. Carry on.

281
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,000
Reassessing damage reports.

282
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,416
We're going to need runners!

283
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,041
Even if the lines are
down, we'll get through!

284
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,333
Then try contacting
the foreign branches.

285
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,875
We need data!

286
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,291
We're leaving Walter.
As quickly as possible.

287
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,833
As you say, Ma'am.

288
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,125
We'll take the car.
Will that be a problem?

289
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Not in the slightest.

290
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,500
Nothing is going
to get in my way.

291
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:10,541
As head of the Hellsing
family... I swear it!

292
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,291
Run!

293
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,166
Oh no!

294
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,541
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

295
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,166
Damn it... Damn it...

296
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,375
Damn it... Damn it... Damn!

297
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,708
Little girls,
lost in a sea of flame?

298
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,791
Look around you,
it's hell come to earth.

299
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,208
But it's still a pale
shadow of the world to come.

300
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,666
Good boys. You defended
Queen and country.

301
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,291
Rest in peace.

302
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,333
Time is short. Let's move on.

303
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,666
Integra Hellsing sighted.

304
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,500
She is traveling
at high speed down

305
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:41,458
Regent Street
toward Hellsing Manor.

306
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:46,291
Capture her. Capture her!

307
00:26:55,916 --> 00:27:00,583
Attention all soldiers...
Attention all soldiers...

308
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,125
Attention, anyone...

309
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:05,833
This is Vice Admiral
Penwood, speaking

310
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,916
from the British Security
Special Command Center.

311
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,416
I don't even know
if there is anyone left

312
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,666
to receive this message.

313
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,250
This facility will soon fall.

314
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,666
The monsters are almost upon us,

315
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,208
and through the
last of our defenses.

316
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:33,833
I now deliver the final
orders from this facility

317
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:37,958
to whomever is listening
to this transmission.

318
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,375
Keep fighting. Do your duty.

319
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,833
Are you saying... This is it?

320
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,875
The new head of the family?

321
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,458
Walter, this is a little girl!

322
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:27,625
"A Little girl?" A bit rude,
don't you think, Sir Penwood?

323
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:31,083
Well, no I, uh... It's just...

324
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,041
I am Integra Fairbrook
Wingates Hellsing

325
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,875
My uncle is dead, by my hand,

326
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:39,041
and I am now the head
of the Hellsing family.

327
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:42,125
So you are never to address
me as "Little Girl" again.

328
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:46,958
M-My apologies
Ms. Hellsing. So sorry!

329
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,250
Before my father died he said,

330
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,208
if I were to ever need
anything at all, Mr. Penwood

331
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,000
would happily provide.

332
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,875
Yes, of course!

333
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,208
Arthur was always

334
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,083
"Penwood I need you to get
me this new fancy gun!"

335
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,833
Or "I need a helicopter."

336
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:07,000
Or some other God forsaken
ridiculous piece of equipment!

337
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,750
Well, not to outdo my father,

338
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,541
but I may have some
requests of my own.

339
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,375
I am quite grateful.

340
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,916
You put up quite a fight,
you fat blood sack.

341
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,916
You think this is funny do you?

342
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,666
Pathetic.

343
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,208
Pathetic am I? This coming
from an undead maggot?

344
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,333
'Course it's bloody funny.

345
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,208
Farewell, Integra Hellsing.

346
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,708
It was an honor and a privilege.

347
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,875
No! Put down the switch!

348
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:19,250
Never!

349
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:23,666
I do not take orders
from swine like you.

350
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,250
Walter...

351
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,958
Yes, ma'am?

352
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,708
Faster!

353
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,875
What is it?

354
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,250
Sir Integra, please
take the wheel of the car,

355
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,375
and find another
way across town.

356
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:21,291
What are you doing?

357
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,875
Take the car and go,
as fast as you can.

358
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:32,416
Do not try and find me; and no
matter what, do not look back.

359
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,625
Walter...

360
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,833
The way I am now...

361
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,916
I don't know how long
I'll be capable

362
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,875
of holding out against that man.

363
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,291
Walter... Live through this.

364
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,000
Consider that an
order. Understand?

365
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,666
If you insist ma'am.

366
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,458
Of course... I knew it was you.

367
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,250
You are correct, my boy.

368
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,916
So, butler...

369
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,250
It's been what, 55 years?

370
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:17,041
It's nice to know that after all
this time, you still manage

371
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,583
to find a way to interrupt
me during my dinner.

372
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,666
Integra Hellsing is on the move.

373
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,916
She has changed routes,

374
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,291
and is moving towards
the manor at full speed.

375
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,000
Attention, all available
squads! Stop her!

376
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,541
Whatever it takes!

377
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,750
Integra Hellsing is unprotected.

378
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,125
I repeat, whatever it takes!

379
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:44,833
Pursue her! Stop her!
Capture her! Capture her!

380
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,000
There she is!

381
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:31,333
Panzerfaust! Zielen... Feuern!

382
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,708
Integra Hellsing!

383
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,125
By the order of battalion
commander, Prepare to-!

384
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,166
Hmph. You don't know
when to give up, fraulein.

385
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,208
No matter how much you struggle

386
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,583
your situation is hopeless.

387
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,916
Surrender. This is not
your London anymore.

388
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,666
This is Midian,
where there is no place

389
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,666
for humans to run
and hide. Give up.

390
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:31,250
Surrender? Run and hide?

391
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,083
Oh yes... and give up.

392
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,708
I should give up...

393
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:44,375
That is, what someone
like you would say to do.

394
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:49,000
Cowards, who could not bear the
weight of their own humanity.

395
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,666
You pathetic
monsters disgust me.

396
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,041
Come on! Let's have it!

397
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,791
Die!

398
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:17,041
What is... My body... tearing...

399
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,750
Oh dear!

400
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:36,750
It's you...! The Iscariot
Organization... Section XIII...

401
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,125
God's Assassin...
Saint Guillotine...

402
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:42,666
The Regenerator,
The Angel's Dust...

403
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,583
The Bayonet Priest...

404
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,875
Alexander Anderson!

405
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,875
Facing down the
big scary vampires,

406
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,833
sword in hand,
bleeding on the street?

407
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:04,416
"Come on! Let's have it!"?!

408
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,500
Did you hear that?
Well, Heinkel?

409
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,000
How about you, Yumie?

410
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,625
No doubt about it.

411
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:23,500
This woman... These people...

412
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,625
who else could be worthy
to be our sworn enemies?

413
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:29,208
Our archenemies!

414
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,416
Father Anderson,
I thought our orders

415
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,541
were to do nothing more
than observe at this point.

416
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:40,166
And for that matter, rescuing
the Hellsing woman sir...

417
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,125
that's a serious breach
of orders, is it not?

418
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:48,000
What was I supposed to do,
just sit back and watch?

419
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,583
WE will be the ones
who will crush them!

420
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:54,291
WE are the only ones
who deserve to crush them!

421
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,208
No one else may interfere!

422
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,083
No one else can have them!

423
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,833
Just us! Just us!

424
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,791
So you're with Iscariot...

425
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,875
You won't stand in our way!

426
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:11,875
Hold your tongue.
The dead don't speak!

427
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,083
Do the dead dare walk
the earth before my eyes?

428
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:21,833
Will the undead raise an
army, fall in, and advance?

429
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,791
Would those who
would abandon God,

430
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:28,708
and embrace a heretical order,
dare presume to meet my gaze?

431
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,125
Iscariot will not allow it!

432
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,333
I will not allow it!

433
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:43,708
You will be cut down like straw
trembling before my wrath!

434
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:46,250
Amen!!

435
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Speak up you men of God.

436
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,458
Tell us all who you are!

437
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,875
We are the soldiers of Iscariot!

438
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,041
We are truthers Iscariot!

439
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:04,625
Well then Iscariot, I ask you,

440
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:07,041
what do you hold
in your right hand?!

441
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,166
Daggers and poison!

442
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,791
Well then soldiers of
Iscariot, I ask you...

443
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,458
What do you hold
in your left hand?!

444
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,625
30 pieces of silver
and a straw rope!

445
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,416
Now...!

446
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,791
Show them who you are,
my soldiers of Iscariot!

447
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,500
We are apostles,
yet not apostles!

448
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,875
We are believers,
yet not believers!

449
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,333
We are disciples,
yet not disciples!

450
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:43,333
We are heretics,
yet not heretics!

451
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,916
We are solders in
the service of death,

452
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,083
who bow are heads in reverence
to our Lord and whose prayers

453
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,416
are found in the withered
bodies of our enemies!

454
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,916
Our poisons served
at every supper,

455
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,791
our daggers flashing
in the moonlight!

456
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,666
We are the Apostles
of Judas Iscariot...

457
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,125
We are his holy
flock of assassins,

458
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,583
and upon the hour
at which we were called,

459
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:14,458
we cast our 30 pieces of silver
into the sight of the holy,

460
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:17,791
and hang ourselves
with a rope of straw.

461
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,333
Thus do we move to meet hell's
legions as a mighty army,

462
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:30,416
and form our squared ranks
against hell's gates,

463
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,625
and prepare to meet the
seven million four hundred

464
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,750
and five thousand nine hundred

465
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,750
and twenty-six
demons of iniquity

466
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,458
My nemesis...

467
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,625
My master...

468
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,500
I am being drawn closer...

469
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:17,458
And I shall continue the journey
within my dream as well...

470
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:34,000
Onward... to the battlefield!

471
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,708
Was it a dream?

472
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,291
I had a dream in which
I did not get to fight.

473
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,666
Master, I don't think
that was a dream.

474
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,125
What?

475
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,125
Well you see, these next two
volumes are mostly about,

476
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,000
Iscariot, the Nazis,
Seras, and myself.

477
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,708
I think you're
barley in it at all!

478
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,291
I do okay, though.

479
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,125
I feel so sorry for you.

480
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm all over these volumes

481
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:09,625
