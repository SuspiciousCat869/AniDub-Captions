00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,833
[AOI] 
Looking over these,

2
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,583
the umi-bouzu's likes and
dislikes seem pretty apparent.

3
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,416
The record from a hundred
years ago says...

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,583
...he wasn't satisfied 
with the food.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,750
Maybe because the menu
was chosen just to pair

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,000
with the liquor?
That'd make it pretty flat.

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,000
Plus, he didn't try any
clam or sea snail dishes.

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,916
Even though they're some of
the southern land's specialties.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But he did like the grilled
sea urchin a lot.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,166
The sea urchin in this land is
sweet, so even kids can eat it.

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,541
[GINJI] 
Sorry I'm late.

12
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,333
[sighs]

13
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,583
Wait, did something go wrong?

14
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,791
After all that, was
the Hourai's gem branch

15
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,166
that the toad brought a fake?

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,625
We're still not sure.

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,041
Raiju is the only person
who would be able to tell,

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,750
but he keeps dodging
the question.

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,291
[BOTH] 
He's a tricky one.

20
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,125
He said he would
consider telling us

21
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,958
if we showed him
something interesting.

22
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,625
So Hideyoshi is performing his
loach-scooping dance for him

23
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,666
right now, though I don't
really know how that'll fare.

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,250
"Loach-scooping dance"?

25
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,083

[sighs]

28
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,583
What do you have?

29
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,583
Kirisame, a Suiun drink.

30
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,333
According to Hatori, the taste
is about as close as you can get

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
to the tengu's secret liquor.

32
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,541
[AOI]
So, we're checking to see

33
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,833
if the dishes will pair
well with this instead?

34
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,416
[KAI] The secret liquor
is currently...

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,166
[MEI] ...being cleansed
for the ceremony.

36
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,416
It's not perfect,
but it should work.

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,875
I brought something else
for us to try, too.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,750
Oh, wow!

39
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,166
[BOTH] 
That beef looks good!

40
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,916
This is called Kiseki beef!

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,666
It's a well-known brand that's
the pride of the southern land.

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,708
And sukiyaki got a high mark,

43
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,166
so that can really
only mean one thing!

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,208
The spread doesn't have
to all be seafood,

45
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,916
even though the requirement
says "ocean treasure"!

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,166
What lovely marbling!

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,333
So would you all like
to give it a taste?

48
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,875
[ALL] 
Mm-hm!

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
I'll cook us up some
garlic butter rice

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,541
to serve alongside it.

51
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,208
[KAI, MEI]
That sound is heavenly!

52
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,250
It smells so enticing, too!

53
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,041
Help me!

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,625
I take it you finished?

55
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,500
He told me to stop, and
then he said he lost some

56
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,166
of his spiritual power
because of me,

57
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,750
and now he's demanding
something to eat immediately!

58
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,333
He needs a meal!

59
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,583
I guess I'll make it.

60
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,666
Not possible.
You're far too busy

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,250
working on the ocean
treasure dishes right now.

62
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,625
You two do it. Please.

63
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,791
Can we at least eat our
beef and rice first?

64
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,916
Yeah, can we?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,708
This has to be done right now!

66
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,791
[MEI, MAI] 
Kiseki beef!

67
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,291
Don't worry, I'll save you some!

68
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,416
Heh. I have some vinegared
cucumber and daikon that I

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,083
made in advance, so let's have
them as palate cleansers.

70
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,875
That sounds good!

71
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,916
 It tastes great!

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
[AOI] The more you chew, the
more the flavor comes to life!

73
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,375
Oh yeah, that's exactly it!

74
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,958
This food is delectable,
there's no doubt about that!

75
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,000
It would definitely
pair well with beer!

76
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,875
I wonder if this would
go with the liquor.

77
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,916
Shall we try and see?

78
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,916
 It smells nice, and the
profile's good, as well.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,791
But I worry that the sweetness
of the aroma might overpower

80
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,375
the flavors of the garlic steak.

81
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,000
Not everyone may be bothered by
it, but if that's your instinct,

82
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,416
it's probably better to
prepare other options.

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Wow, this is kinda fun,
with just the two of us.

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,833
[AOI]
Uh.

85
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,458
To be fair. When I drink in
the evening, it's usually alone.

86
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,833
Oh, is that true? I find it
hard to picture that.

87
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,666
Unfortunately, that's the
reality of being a single guy.

88
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
So, you're saying you don't
have a girlfriend then, Ginji?

[GINJI coughs]

90

Where did that come from--
and so suddenly?

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,416
Because, you were just
talking about being single.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,750
What? Would you really
assume that I wasn't?

93
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,458
Since I moved straight from
Orio-ya to Tenjin-ya,

94
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,708
I've always been very
busy my work duties.

95
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,083
Truth be told, I don't
have any experience

96
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,750
with that kind of thing.

97
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,000
I see.

98
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,958
Well, I shouldn't talk
but I can't imagine why.

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,250
If the rumors are all true,
you were pretty well-known

100
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
around the inn as "the last
good catch" at Tenjin-ya.

101
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,958
Do you think me shameful
for having come this far

102
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,750
as a man without ever
even knowing love

103
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,125
or having any sort
of relationship?

104
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,375
That's not it at all!

105
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,166
Ginji, you should really have
more confidence in yourself!

106
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,416
Well, then can I ask
about you, Aoi?

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,916
I know you were taken to the
hidden realm by the Master.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,208
But, back in the apparent realm,
did you perhaps have someone?

109
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,333
No way!

110
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,875
That was quick.

111
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,625
I guess you could say I was
always Grandpa's little angel.

112
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,958
At least when I was small.

113
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,625
Heck, I even wanted to
marry him once I grew up.

114

So Shiro was popular even with

I did still have a
first crush, I guess.

118
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,125
Yeah. In my heart, I'm sure
that was my first love.

119

I was little then too, though.

The story of your
very first love.

123
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,125
I'm sure the Master would
like to hear all about it.

124
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,458
[AOI] 
What?

125
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,208
I've been noticing that
he keeps coming to Orio-ya

126
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,208
disguised as a fish peddler.

127
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,875
So how are things
going with him,

128
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,708
any new developments
between you two?

129
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,416
Absolutely not!

That ogre is exactly
the same as ever.

131
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,583
The Master's the Master, no-one
knows that better than you!

132
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,083
There you go again.

133
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,916
But even with that attitude
of yours towards him,

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,083
I don't think he could stop
worrying about you now,

135
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,708
even if he tried.

136
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,500
 I mean, I guess.

137
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,416
It's true he's more approachable
than many think.

138
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,625
I understand now that
he's just mischievous.

139
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,208
[GINJI]
Uh.

140
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,208
But I, well, I still find
him very mysterious,

141
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,416
and he seems so aloof compared
to everyone else here.

142
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,333
I just don't get it.
What's the real reason

143
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,458
why the Master wants me
to be his bride so badly?

144
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,875
 Is it because I'm
collateral for a loan?

145
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,875
Because I'm a human girl?

146
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,125
Can a guy decide to marry
for reasons like those,

147
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,833
but then really fall in love?

148
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,375
The whole situation seems
completely backwards!

149
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,416
Why doesn't he just
tell me how he feels?

150
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
Okay, relax...

151
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,583
Right, there'll be no more
relationship talk tonight!

152
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,000
Hold on now, are you
seriously drunk already, Aoi?

153
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,833
No, not yet, but...

154
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,583
Idea. How about...

155
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,666
...we try making roast beef
with this Kiseki cut, huh?

156
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,791
Okay sure, why not? I've never
had it before myself,

157
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,375
but I have heard it's pretty
popular in the apparent realm!

160
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,208
Do you still have...

161
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,500
...the grilled beef?

162
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,208
Oh, yeah, I do. I'll heat
some up for you now.

163
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,583
Are you two already done
cooking the meal for Raiju?

164
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,583
He didn't want any...

165
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,666
...food cooked by us.

166
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,791
Maybe I'll start
the preparations

167
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,333
for roast beef now
and suggest it

168
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,958
at tomorrow night's
tasting session.

169
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,875
Ranmaru will be back by then,

170
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,291
so I want to have him eat
your food and admit defeat.

171
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,625
Maybe that will
humble him a bit.

[door slides open]

00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:51,833
You're back real late
tonight, Aoi. What's up?

176
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,083
I was preparing what I
could for roast beef,

177
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,583
and I also had to check over
the menu and ingredients

178
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,416
for tomorrow's tasting
session with Ginji, so I just--

179
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,291
[yawns] I guess I lost
track of time. Yeah.

180
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,958
I'm concerned that you neglected
to put a cucumber dish

181
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,041
on the menu. Oh no, get up, Aoi!

182
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,041
You shouldn't fall asleep
here on the floor.

183
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,875
I'll do my best for
the tasting session.

184
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,291
Ugh, you reek of alcohol.

185
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
I should bake the bread first.

186
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,250
Then I'll finish up
the roast beef.

187
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,416
I also need to come up
with dessert ideas.

188
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,166
Mm? Looks like it could
rain at any minute.

189
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,166

Hello...

[AOI screams]

00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,166
Did I frighten you,
young miss? Oh, how cute.

194
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,291
[AOI]
I know who that is. It's Raiju!

195
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,041
Well, would you look at that.

196
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,458
You look just like
Shiro Tsubaki.

197
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,666
Especially when it comes
to your eyes and your mouth.

198
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,583
What the--?

199
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,125
What're you talking about?

200
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Since Shiro was a man, he was
all sharp angles and bones,

201
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,750
but you look so soft and
delicate. How delicious.

00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,875
[AOI yelps]

203

[AOI panting]

204
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,625
[AOI] The nerve of that guy.
Keep your hands to yourself.

205
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,708
Or what?

00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,083
[screams]

207
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,916
Why are you still running
away from me, my dear?

208
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,458
[AOI screams]

209
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,875
Why? You can tell me.

210
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,375
I was told that you're a thunder
god, and you are, aren't you?

211
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,583
Well, I'm not good with
thunder and lightning!

212
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,083
I see--that's what it is.

213
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
[gasps]

214
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,958
[RAIJU] I don't mind
this reaction, really.

215
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:56,250
If you're that scared of me, I'm
truly honored, as an ayakashi.

216
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,708
I don't have time for you
or for any of this!

217
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,958
I've got an important job

218
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,291
that I have to do today
for the ceremony.

219
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,416
Oh, but I do wish for the
ceremony's utmost success,

220
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,208
I assure you of that,
little human.

221
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,666
You won't even do us the basic
courtesy of telling us

222
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,208
if the Hourai's gem branch
is the real thing!

223
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,041
You just keep messing with us!

224
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,791
[RAIJU]
Hm...?

225
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,958
What now? Something I said?

226
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,083
How should I put it?

227
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,583
Despite all your posturing,

228
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,708
you really do trust ayakashi
far too much, you know.

229
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,208
What do you mean?

230
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,583
[RAIJU] You were abducted
and exploited by ayakashi.

231
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,083
Yet you want to make
the ceremony successful

232
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,625
for those same captors of yours.

233
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,625
Fascinating how
nonsensical that is.

234
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,375
I'm just doing whatever it takes
to make sure I can survive here.

235
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,583
And if cooking is what
leads to me being protected,

236
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,291
then so be it. So it's not
just for the ayakashi!

237
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, you certainly told me.

238
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,541
[AOI]
Do you have a problem with that?

239
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,291
You seem to have
quite a lot of sass

240
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,958
for a girl in a captive
situation, that's all.

241
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,750
[AOI] 
I'm just desperate.

242
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,916
If no one thinks that
my food is delicious,

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,250
I won't be able to repay
the debt and go home.

244
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,833
Ah. I would like to try
some of this food

245
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,208
that the other ayakashi
so delight in.

246
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,875
Will you make something for me?

247
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,458
Sure, uh.

248
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,958
Are you saying you're hungry?
Well then, if that's the case!

As if I would really ask you to!

250
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,083
My, you're surprisingly
gullible.

251
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,375
Really.

252
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm tired of eating dishes
made by human hands.

253
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,208
On top of that, your food seems
rather low-class, I'm afraid.

You're a piece of work.

257
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,500
After all this time...
Normal food can't excite me.

258
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,041
There's only one type of dish
in the world you could prepare

259
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,750
that could even
hope to satisfy me.

260
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,416
And what dish is that?

261
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,750
[RAIJU]
Isn't it obvious? You, my dear.

[AOI gasping]

263
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,291
[RAIJU] The greatest delicacy
known to ayakashi

264
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,750
is the flesh of a human girl
with potent spiritual power.

265
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,583
There's no possible
way you could create

266
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,958
any culinary hodgepodge
that would be better.

00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:11,250
So I suppose you're just going
to eat me right here, right now?

269
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,625
It's really quite tempting,

270
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,875
but now isn't the ideal
time. Even so...

[gasps]

272

How exactly are you planning
on protecting yourself

against someone when you can't
use cooking as a weapon?

Or what if you became
unable to cook?

[gasping]

276

Unable to defend yourself or
do what you're most proud of?

Would you resign your fate to
becoming useless food yourself?

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
[AOI]
I hadn't thought about that.

279
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,041
Shiro was smart.

280
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,666
By setting you up
to marry the ogre.

could possibly protect you.

Stop it.

[RAIJU] To an ayakashi, the
only uses for a human girl

284
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,000
are to marry, or to
be eaten up whole.

A matcha candy?

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,750
 It's delicate, but tasty.

291
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,833
It's a sweet meant
to soothe your throat

called a Matcha Drop.

293
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,833
Honestly though. I'm just
so terribly bored.

294
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,000
That is why I meddle

295
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,375
until I'm hated and cursed
all across the land.

296
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,750
There are so few things
that still excite me

297
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,000
in the hidden realm.

298
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,166
Shiro was like a hit
from a powerful drug.

[gasps]

300
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,875
He was the kind of scum
who would cause trouble,

301
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,458
dump it on others
and then run away.

302
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,000
But he had the sort of bold
presence that made people

303
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,041
forgive him.
No matter what he did.

304
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,833
What could you possibly
offer to an ayakashi

305
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,208
who's known the likes
of someone like Shiro?

[AOI whimpers]

307

Are you really going to
shut yourself in a kitchen

308
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,916
and hope this goes away? Oh,
how excruciatingly boring!

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,708
I want to experience something
much more exciting than that!

00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,500
Like Shiro.

311
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:06,416
I am not the same person
my grandpa was!

You should have just
quietly gone through

00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,166
with your betrothal.

314
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,000
[yelps]

315
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,833
[AOI] 
I'm sorry!

316
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,791
[RANMARU] Why are you
running around like that?

317
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,000
Are you slacking off?

318
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,791
Ranmaru, I...

319
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,875
[RANMARU]
Hm?

320
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,458
Oh no, there's a scary
looking dog in my way.

321
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,166
Let me be clear Raiju.
There is no need for you

322
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,666
to concern yourself with
this human and her affairs.

323
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,541
You have worked so
very hard, Ranmaru.

324
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,458
You took the trouble
to go to Youto,

325
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,000
and yet, you still
could not find

326
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,125
any of Hourai's gem branches,
isn't that right?

327
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,000
Such branches come from
a tree with spiritual power

328
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,208
that was given to the
ayakashi king as a present.

329
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,833
The tree was lost in
the Great Youto Fire,

330
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,416
a famous part of the
hidden realm's history.

331
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041
Only a few branches
actually survived,

332
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,166
but no one knows who has
come to possess them

333
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,541
after all these years.

334
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,041
There is no way that
the nobles in Youto

335
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,833
would give any information
on them to a rural innkeeper

336
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
such as yourself.

337
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,333
Hey now, that--

338
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,041
It's not 300 years ago anymore.

339
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,291
Things are different now,

340
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,833
and we shall complete
the ceremony this time.

341
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,375
Have a good day.

342
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,958
Good luck with everything.

343
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,208
[AOI] 
Thank you, Ranmaru.

344
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,500
[RANMARU]
I don't recall helping you.

345
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,416
I see you're back
to your old self.

346
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,208
[RANMARU] 
Remember this, Miss Tsubaki.

347
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,250
At tonight's tasting session,

348
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,375
if you serve anything
odd or peculiar,

349
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,958
we'll roast and feed you
to the umi-bouzu instead.

350
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,250
Seriously? Jeez,
stop talking like that.

351
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,250
Three hundred years ago,

352
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,375
it was Raiju who
betrayed our land.

353
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,916
[gasps]

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,583
Stay very far away from him.

355
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,250
He is dangerous
and unpredictable.

356
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,791
And if the ceremony fails...
Well, we all have a lot to lose.

357
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,416
I understand.

358
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,583
[RANMARU] You should go get
prepared for the task ahead.

359
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,666
Prepare... Right.

360
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,916
[AOI] You seem like
such a sensitive guy,

361
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,708
but your writing is
so masculine, Ginji.

362
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,333
I don't know what that
means, but, uh, thanks?

363
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,166
[KAI, MEI]
This menu looks amazing!

364
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
I would like to try
the roast beef!

365
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,583
What'll we use to wrap
the fried food?

366
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,083
Raw tofu skin.

367
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,708
[KAI, MEI] Oh, the two of us
are good at making that!

368
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,958
That settles it. I'll leave that
dish up to the two of you.

369
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,833
Perfect!

370
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,333
We'll do our best!

371
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,791
[MEI] The temperature of
the ayakashi fire disc

372
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,125
may be a little too high.

373
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,333
Try this then. How about now?

374
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,875
Yeah, that's good!

375
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,083
Mistress Aoi! Let me
help you out, okay?

376
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,291
Ah! Ai is flat out ignoring me

377
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,833
and posing as Aoi's
devoted follower!

378
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,833
That's all right.

379
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,208
I'm going to prove to them

380
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,333
that I'm also an excellently
devoted follower to Aoi!

381
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:26,416
Please allow me to help
you out in the kitchen!

382
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,958
Oh, I didn't see you there!

383
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,458
I'm busy right now so I'll
play with you later, 'kay?

384
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,708
No! I can help you, please!

385
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
Let me help you, Aoi!

386
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,041
Okay now. No need to get upset.

387
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
[CHIBI hums]

388
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,875
[AOI] Wrap up the jam
pies for me, will you?

389
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah, I'll do it!

390
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
You sure perked up quickly.

391
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,833
[laughs] Aoi, you sort of treat
Chibi like you're his mother!

392
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,291
[AOI] 
Aw. Don't say that.

393
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,458
Anyway, the official
participants of the tasting

394
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,583
session are Ranmaru and Hatori,
but I also heard that Tokihiko,

395
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,958
Hideyoshi, and Nene plan
to each come by in turn

396
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,000
to try out the food.

397
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,875
Hello all, I've brought the
cleansed secret liquor for you!

398
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,625
Oh, Hatori!

399
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,041
So, uh. Are we really having
the tasting session here?

400
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,541
[AOI] No, we decided to
use the next room over.

401
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,416
All right Hatori,
you and I are the ones

402
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,625
who have been put in charge
of all the heavy lifting.

403
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,916
It's time to get
this room into shape.

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,708
[HATORI] Is that why you told
me to arrive early?

405
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,916
Time to take a taste!

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,791
Oh, so tender!

407
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,666
Oh, it looks like beef <i>tataki.</i>

408
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,791
Yeah, I suppose it's pretty
similar. Would you like to try?

409
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,666
[KAI, MEI] Yes please,
of course we would!

410
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,458
[AOI] 
Can I sample this, too?

411
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,916
That's the only one that
has two shrimp inside it!

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,375
Oh wow! Looks delicious!

413
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,541
 Mistress Aoi!

414
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,541
[CHIBI]
Please let us have some, too!

415
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,833
[HATORI] 
Hey!

416
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,208
Huh?

417
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,000
I can't believe you guys are
over there sneaking food

418
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,125
while we're stuck carrying
heavy tables and breakin' stuff!

419
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,375
Wait, breaking?
Did I hear that correctly?

420
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,125
Unfortunately, our sweet
Hatori got carried away,

421
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,250
flew around the room, and ended
up breaking the table's legs.

422
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,166
You don't have to sound so
extra cheery about it, Ginji!

423
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,583
Well, you are the one
that broke it, not me.

424
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,083
The point is, it seems

425
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,625
we'll have to have the tasting
session on another table.

426
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,875
It's much smaller.

427
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,291
But if we arrange everything
correctly it should work, right?

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,750
Oh my, this is seriously
the best you could manage?

429
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:31,041
I think that it's charming, like
a poor family's holiday dinner!

430
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
Whatever.

431
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,208
Are the dishes ready yet?

432
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,208
Yes, and please don't hold
back on your critique, okay?

433
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,791
Of course I won't.

434
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,250
Prepare yourself for
my honest disapproval.

435
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,625
Look, Ranmaru.

436
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,083
Do not go into this
underestimating Aoi's cooking.

437
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,375
Her food is absolutely--

438
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,208
Ginji, it's fine. I want
to hear his honest,

439
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,458
unfiltered opinion,
so I can handle it.

440
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,583
[RANMARU]
Hmph.

441
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,916
Here's to the ceremony's
success. Let's toast.

442
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,916
[GROUP] 
Cheers, everyone!

443
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,375
Cheers, everyone.

444
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,416
Come on, this isn't a party!

445
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,250
Would it kill you to
have a little fun?

446
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,541
[GROUP laughs]

447
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,250
--[KAI, MEI] Oh, what a flavor!
--[CHIBI] This is super yummy.

448
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,125
[GROUP chatting, laughing]

449
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
[gasping]

450
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,666
[RAIJU] Now, let us have
our own secret party,

451
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,375
just the two of us.

452
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,375
[muffled] As expected, this
is totally different from

453
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,250
the manufactured Suiun
liquor. The flavor's great.

454
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,000
[AOI] 
What? Am I...

455
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,750
[HATORI muffled] And that's why
it's called the secret liquor!

456
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,625
[RANMARU] The real
question is, was the girl

457
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,000
smart enough to make food
that pairs well with it?

458
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,500
Or is it being wasted.

459
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,875
[GINJI] Ranmaru! Stop being
so rude for once!

460
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,083
As soon as you eat it, you'll
understand how valuable

461
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,333
her food is to the ayakashi,
just wait and see.

462
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,500
Hold on. Aoi?

463
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:53,208
Hey, Aoi? What's this look,
are you feeling okay?

464
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,125
[GINJI gasping] 
Aoi!

465
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:13,500
[RAIJU] Well now. How fortunate
that I wished you good luck.

466
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,041
[AOI whimpers]

00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,541
