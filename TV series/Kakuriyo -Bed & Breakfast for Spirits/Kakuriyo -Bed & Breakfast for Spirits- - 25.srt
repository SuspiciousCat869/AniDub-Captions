There's something
that we need to ask.

Yes, what is it? By the look
of you all, it's serious.

00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,291
I was afraid.

00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,000
When Raiju sealed my
sense of taste away,

9
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,333
I had lost my most
important asset,

10
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,375
and my primary means of
surviving in the hidden realm.

11
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,625
So, I couldn't help it.

12
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,166
I felt powerless, set
adrift with no purpose.

13
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,166
Then there was the fear I'd get
eaten by some hungry ayakashi.

14
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,916
But, it turns out I was wrong.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,875
Even if my taste buds happen
to be useless at the moment,

16
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,458
I've still got helpers
I know I can depend on.

and Mei, the white crane.

20
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,666
I'll face this.

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,916
Well, Aoi.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can attest to the fact that
losing your sense of taste

23

the quality of your food.

Thanks, Ginji.

26
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,833
Ranmaru. I think
it's worth noting

27

that Princess Iso put
this task in Aoi's hands.

28
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,291
It's not like you to question
the princess' instructions,

29

to doubt her before, right?

You cannot afford to fail.

It's a way to get

Isn't it?

ever since then, I've become
really fond of this place.

But especially
the ayakashi here.

68

That's the main reason.

I don't want anyone to suffer,

I must say, this request
surprises me.

162
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,458
If I agree, will you
allow all of Tenjin-ya

163
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,833
to remain here for the event?

164
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,208
[RANMARU]
Huh?

165
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,875
Because of all the attention
this ceremony has been

166
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,791
getting in Youto
lately, it's natural

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,500
that all Tenjin-ya's customers
wanted to witness it.

168
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,666
Therefore, in order to cope
with the exodus of our guests.

169
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,416
We decided to bring
them in our fleet,

170
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,750
which has room to house them,

171
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,208
and we brought our
entire staff, as well.

172
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,000
If you are open to the idea,
we would like to propose

173
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,250
that our inns do business
together, just for today.

174
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,666
Us? Do business together?

175
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,958
[MASTER] And besides,
isn't it infuriating?

176
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,583
That those big shots in Youto

177
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,625
get to relish the drama and
chaos they've caused?

178
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,333
They do say the enemy of
one's enemy is his friend.

179
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,208
The consensus is
that our two inns

180
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,916
will forever be in
bitter competition.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,625
We could work together
and give them a shock.

182
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,916
I think the idea sounds
exhilarating, don't you?

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,666
Ha. So, in other words,

184
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,875
we let your fleet anchor
here for the ceremony,

185
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,250
and in return, Tenjin-ya
will lend its staff.

186
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,416
Is that a fair assumption?

187
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Indeed. That's the
deal I propose.

188
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,583
Also, we can provide
ships, if need be.

189
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,375
Yes, that'd be helpful!

190
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,083
Master Ranmaru,
how do you feel about it?

191
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,833
I trust you, Hideyoshi, so
do what you think is best.

192
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,125
Right. Thank you very much, sir.

193
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,958
I only ask that you
move the vessels.

194
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,708
Guide their course
to a safe place.

195
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,000
At the moment, their position

196
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,333
would interfere with
the fireworks.

197
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,958
Please, leave that part to me.

198
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,333
I'll take care of it.

199
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,000
By all means.

200
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,083
Miss O-Ryo, would you be willing
to assist me and my staff?

201
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,583
You really want to work with me?

202
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,666
We have way too
many guests here.

203
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,083
To tell you the truth, I would
be honored to have your support.

204
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,708
I suppose I could give
you a hand this evening.

205
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,833
Our room attendants are
spectacular, you know.

206
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,583
I'm glad to have them.

207
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,958
Great!

208
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,916
Then leave the fireworks
event to us, Master Ranmaru.

209
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,458
[barks]

210
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,583
All right, then. We'll make this
our greatest ceremony yet.

211
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go!

212
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,125
[MASTER]
Aoi?

213
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,375
[gasps]

214
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,750
What's this?

215
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,250
A token of my good wishes,

216
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,166
just in case you
find yourself in need.

217
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,666
I'm grateful for all you
do for me, Master.

218
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,541
Just do your best, yeah?

219
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,291
Don't trouble yourself
with anything but that.

220
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,416
Yep, you can bet on it!
Thank you, again!

221
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,875
[AOI] That's right,
all I can do is my best!

222
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,833
--[MEI, KAI] Ooh...
--Breathtaking!

223
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,708
You both look incredible!

224
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,666
I feel a little vulnerable.

225
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
But this is the purpose
of my female form.

226
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,333
I use it just for the ceremony.

227
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,958
Wow, I had no idea!

228
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,958
I've something for you.

229
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,166
[gasps]

230
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,666
[RANMARU]
You may have this back.

231
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,041
[gasps] You're giving
it back to me?

232
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
[RANMARU]
Hmph.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,041
One last thing. Take this.

234
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,250
Take what?

235
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,958
Hey! My old kimono!

236
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,500
[CHIBI] That's the one you
wear to work at Moonflower!

237
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,083
The master had this custom
made specifically for you

238
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,875
to wear while you're
cooking tonight.

239
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,541
He must've known that
you'd be preparing

240
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,458
the dishes of ocean treasure,
even before we found out.

241
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,125
[gasps]

242
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,791
I know that you're taking on
an enormous responsibility

243
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,500
in doing this work
for the ceremony,

244
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,833
but I hope you can think of it

245
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,041
as just like being in the
kitchen at Moonflower.

246
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,541
Thanks, Ginji.

247
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,416
And yes. Agreed.

248
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,250
It'll be best for
everyone involved

249
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,333
if I don't overthink it.

250
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,250
Princess Iso did tell me that
the umi-bouzu had become

251
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,916
bored with the food
from the hidden realm

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,166
and craved something new.

253
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,166
So all I have to do
is cook what I like,

254
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,000
and the rest will
take care of itself.

255
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,625
There's no need to do
anything beyond that.

256
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,166
Exactly right.

257
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
Your food will be new to him,

258
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,958
but with familiar elements
that he'll find appealing,

259
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,500
there's no doubt in my mind.

260
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,875
That's your specialty, you know?

261
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,750
The whole reason
Moonflower was a hit.

262
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,916
For sure!

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,166
[RANMARU]
Hey!

264
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,208
[gasps]

265
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,000
[RANMARU]
We're approaching Jouno Island.

266
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,708
This is where we'll
host the umi-bouzu

267
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,916
for the duration of
tonight's event.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,750
Oh, yeah. That's right.

269
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,708
[AOI inhales]

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,916
[AOI]
Just like cooking at Moonflower.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,708
My home restaurant.

272
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,583
Now! Time to entertain!

273
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,166
[GINJI] Guided here by the
light from the fireworks,

274
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,583
the umi-bouzu will land
there, on the beach.

275
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,416
Then, he'll come in
past the tori gate

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,583
and follow the path to
the main building.

277
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,083
The structure facing that
is the kagura hall.

278
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,416
There's a stage there,
which is where Ranmaru and I

279
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,791
will dance the night kagura,
and the umi-bouzu

280
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,083
will watch us perform
from the main building.

281
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,791
I think I can picture all that.

282
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,541
So, he'll enjoy
the liquor and food

283
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,125
while you and Ranmaru
are dancing?

284
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,250
[GINJI]
Yes.

285
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,875
And then, once the
night kagura's over,

286
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,291
he'll return to the ocean,

287
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,916
to disappear for
another century.

288
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,750
[GINJI] Here it is, the main
building, where you'll cook.

289
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,750
[ALL gasping]

290
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,458
[KAI] All the treasures
for the ceremony.

291
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,041
[MEI] So, is the umi-bouzu going
to take these things with him?

292
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,208
No, for some reason he
never brings the treasure

293
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,208
back to the ocean, but he always
drinks the secret liquor.

294
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,083
Then what's the point of taking
the time to collect this stuff?

295
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,625
[GINJI]
Apparently, the important thing

296
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,041
to the umi-bouzu is the
simple act of offering.

297
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,875
To be honest, most of
this makes zero sense.

298
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,041
[KAI] That's the kagura hall
over there, isn't it?

299
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,583
[MEI] Will he have to watch the
dancing through the screen?

300
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,125
[GINJI]
That's right.

301
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,458
That means I'll have to serve
him the food from outside?

302
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,375
Yes, you just raise
the screen a little bit,

303
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,333
slide the dishes under it,
and he'll take them.

304
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,875
No one really understands
who the umi-bouzu is,

305
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,291
or why this ceremony is the
one thing that stands between

306
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,041
the southern land and
utter catastrophe.

307
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,791
[BOTH] No one understands
why we do this?

308
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,583
But, the most important
thing to remember

309
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,916
is that you must never pull the
screen more than you have to,

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,041
and never, ever look
upon the umi-bouzu.

311
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,750
Legend has it misfortune will
befall anyone who sees him,

312
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,416
so avoid that, at all costs.

313
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,541
That lore's been passed
down from ancient times.

314
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,166
'Kay.

315
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,708
And this is where you'll

The kitchen itself is old.

317
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,833
But the equipment's new!

318
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,958
Yeah!

319
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,666
Well, they brought the supplies.

320
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,666
Everything I asked for!

321
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,791
[CHIBI]
Cucumbers!

322
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,208
Wow, they smell so
fresh and delicious!

00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,083
[AOI laughs]
Here, you deserve a treat!

324
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,083
Yummy, thanks so much, Aoi!

Om nom nom nom nom.

The night kagura's
supposed to begin

327
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,541
precisely at the
stroke of midnight.

328
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,333
As soon as the umi-bouzu lands

329
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,833
and gets settled in
the main building,

330
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,583
that's when you'll bring
the food, appetizers first.

331
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,333
But, we're not
allowed to see him.

332
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,500
How will we know when he's
ready for the first course

333
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,333
if we can't even take a peek?

334
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,083
[GINJI] Watch above the building
for an ayakashi fire.

335
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,583
That's the signal to start.

336
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,250
Well, that's good
to know, thanks.

337
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,250
All right, Ginji, the moment
of truth has arrived at last.

338
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,625
Ready to head up to the stage?

339
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,458
Mm. Yes.

340
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,791
Good luck to you Aoi,

341
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,500
and if you have any final
preparations to make,

342
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,791
now's the time to finish
those and stand by.

343
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,875
Okay, just a couple little
touches and I'll be ready, too.

344
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm counting on you.

345
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,958
Right, see you on
the other side!

346
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,291
[AOI]
Thanks for your help, Ginji.

347
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,958
Well, friends, whaddaya say?

348
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,708
Are you ready to make
this meal a success?

349
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,875
I'll leave you two in
charge of the appetizers.

[KAI]
Sounds good!

351
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,666
[MEI] We'll cook them exactly
like we'd planned.

352
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,208
[AOI]
Perfect, then I'll take care

353
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,708
of the final preparations
for dessert!

354
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,416
For just one meal, there sure
is a lot to take care of!

355
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,416
It all feels like a gamble.

356
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,958
Yeah. This is new territory.

357
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,166
But we're the ones
who agreed to do this!

Yay!

[GINJI]
This is it.

361
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,791
Here comes the umi-bouzu.

362
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,125
There he is!

363
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,833
Uh. He's... enormous.

The night kagura.

It's starting now.

370
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,916
The umi-bouzu's coming.

the main building.

Okay, I'll go ahead and bring
out the appetizers, I guess.

00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,125

Good luck!

00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,583
Thanks, guys!

Don't be nervous.

Don't be nervous!

There's hot, simmered
pumpkin and bacon,

380
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,958
cold hors d'oeuvres made of raw
tofu skin and sea urchin,

and special squid shumai.

It's all gonna be okay.

383
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,916
I know it.

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,791
I have no doubt the
umi-bouzu will like these.

Hello, I've brought you
some appetizers.

[AOI] How strange.
His hand is so tiny.

390
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,375
Uh. Pardon, here's
a menu for you.

391
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,291
[AOI]
If you wouldn't mind,

392
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,125
please choose what
you'd like next.

393
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,416
Letting the umi-bouzu pick
what he wants to eat

394
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,833
is a good idea, huh?

395
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,708
Yeah, only Aoi could come
up with a plan like that.

396
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,750
[AOI] Getting to choose what
they want to eat is enough

397
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,000
to make anyone feel
like royalty, right?

398
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,791
So, I think I'll give
him a few options

399
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,500
and prepare the one he picks.

400
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,916
I can't imagine anyone's
ever thought to try that

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,333
for the ceremony before.

402
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,875
But I think it's great,
the umi-bouzu's gonna love it!

Huh. Interesting.

405
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay. The stir-friend shrimp

406
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,416
in miso-mayo
paste is tasty.

407
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,416
I'll have it right out.

408
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,791
I've got a surprise, friends--

409
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,166
he ordered the
stir-fried shrimp!

410
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,666
That's unexpected!

411
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,083
I thought for sure he'd
go for the <i>kiseki</i> beef.

412
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,416
[AOI]
Yeah, I did, too!

413
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,291
It's a good thing we
let him choose, right?

414
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,750
Looks like your strategy
is really paying off!

415
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,791
Yep! Okay, let's make the best
