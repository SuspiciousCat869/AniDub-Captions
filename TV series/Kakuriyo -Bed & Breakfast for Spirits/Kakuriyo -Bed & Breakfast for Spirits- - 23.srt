[AOI]
Are you gonna eat me?

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,166
[AOI] If that's what
you came here to do,

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,958
then do it, if you want.

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,083
I'll be dead soon, anyway.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,583
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI]
I'm confused.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,208
Are you saying you don't want
to get out of this place?

7
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,708
[AOI]
No, but I can't leave,

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,791
because I'm scared of
thunder and lightning.

9
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,750
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI] I see,
but if you remain in this world,

10
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:50,833
you will die. You'll
suffer starvation.

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,250
There is another realm where
you'll have to go, eventually.

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,875
That realm needs you, but you
are not quite ready yet.

13
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,333
[gasps]

14
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,625
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI] You must
promise me one thing.

15
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,416
Many years from now, when
you've grown into an adult,

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,458
I'll come back for you.

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,291
When I do, I will
make you my bride,

18
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,916
and when that happens, promise
that you'll try to love me.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,541
[AOI] Hold on, tell me
who you are, at least!

20
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,541
[GINJI]
Aoi.

21
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,083
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,166
Aoi.

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,916
You're awake!

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,458
[sighs]

25
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,083
Thank goodness, I hope
you're feeling better.

26
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,750
It's my fault for letting you
drink a strong, natural liquor

28
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,375
from the hidden realm.
You're not even used

29
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,250
to drinking regular alcohol
from the apparent realm.

30
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,708
I imagine that your
throat really hurts.

31
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,125
Your body had to process a
substance with a great deal

32
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,333
of spiritual power.
It's only natural to faint.

33
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,583
[AOI] Wow, this is what
a hangover feels like?

34
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,791
[GINJI]
We brought you to the infirmary.

35
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,041
Tokihiko acts as both
the bath caretaker

36
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,625
and the doctor in
residence here.

37
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,250
You're still running a fever.

38
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,041
And it's gotten quite late.

39
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,208
You should stay
and get some rest.

40
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,833
[BOTH]
We're so glad you're awake.

41
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,291
We were scared!

42
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,166
[MEI] Tokihiko said to
give you this miso soup

43
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,166
made with freshwater clams.

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,625
He tells us it's a good cure
for hangovers. Want some?

45
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,458
[AOI] Yum, miso soup.
It smells so good.

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,208
[gasps]

47
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,916
[KAI]
Well? Do you like it?

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,875
Do you think it might work?

49
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,500
Be careful. Try not to
eat it so fast! Please!

50
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,208
[GINJI]
Mm? What's going on?

51
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,083
Did you lose your voice?

52
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,875
Can she write? Hold on.

53
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,125
[KAI, MEI]
Mm?

54
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,291
[gasps]

55
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,375
[BOTH]
You can't taste anything at all?

56
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,416
Really? That's odd. It's common
for humans to get sick

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,041
from drinking liquor with high
levels of spiritual power,

58
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,583
but it shouldn't cause you
to lose any of your senses.

59
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,958
You must have fallen victim
to some kind of curse.

60
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,250
From whom?

61
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,041
In the hours before
having the liquor,

62
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,000
did you eat or drink
anything strange?

63
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,000
Or touch something odd?

64
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,041
[gasps]

65
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,375
[AOI] Of course! The Matcha
Drop Raiju gave to me!

66
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,625
He is an ancient ayakashi,
and the worst kind, too.

67
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,041
He would know of many spells,

68
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,375
some created specifically
to do harm.

69
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,208
How dare he mess with Aoi?

70
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,708
It must have been a cursed seed.

71
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,458
Those react with the spiritual
power of the secret liquor

72
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,083
and can block one's
ability to taste.

73
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,458
[AOI]
Oh, no!

74
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,125
Unforgivable!

75
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,291
I don't care if he's here
to observe the ceremony,

76
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,875
I'm going to kick him
out of this inn

77
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,375
before he can hurt anybody else!

78
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,791
No, calm down!

79
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,875
Lashing out will only
make the situation worse.

80
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,666
All we can do is
plan our next move

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,041
as quickly and
quietly as possible.

82
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,250

83
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,708
What a mess this has
turned out to be.

00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,333
Ranmaru!

85
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,041
[RANMARU] That settles it, then.
I've made up my mind.

86
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,750
You'll no longer cook
for the umi-bouzu.

87
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,333
I can't trust you with that.

88
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,375
Don't do this.
It may be temporary,

89
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
so her sense of taste could
come back at any moment!

90
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,250
Have you forgotten how few days
are left before the ceremony?

91
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,833
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for her to recover.

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,125
That's absurd!

93
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,041
[AOI]
No, it isn't.

94
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,916
This ceremony will
determine the fate

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,708
of all the ayakashi
in this land.

96
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,125
I can't taste anything right
now. How could I expect him

97
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,458
to let me cook the dishes
of ocean treasure?

98
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,791
I wouldn't.

99
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,875
It is unfortunate that
we won't have your skill.

100
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,375
But luckily, the twins have
been working alongside you,

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,000
watching your technique.

102
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,041
[RANMARU]
Do you know what this means?

103
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,791
Under the circumstances.

104
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,541
We don't have a choice.

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,916
[GINJI grunts]

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, but there's no reason
for you to apologize now.

107
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,708
It's plain to see Raiju
is the perpetrator here.

108
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,000
[BOTH growl]

109
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,041
[RANMARU] It's also clear we
weren't nearly vigilant enough,

110
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,375
and because of our slip,

111
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,250
I simply can't allow you
to cook for the ceremony.

112
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,083
Try not to let
this get you down.

113
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,166
You're an incredibly
strong person.

114
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,500
One who always manages to rise
to the occasion, no matter what.

115
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,708
So, we forced our
expectations on you.

116
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,125
We forgot that you're human.

117
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,750
And, that does carry
a certain frailty.

118
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,166
You're much more vulnerable
to attack than ayakashi are.

119
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,708
I can't help but place
all the blame on myself.

120
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,583
I feel I broke my promise to
support and watch over you.

121
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,833
[AOI]
He's wrong. This is my fault.

122
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,166
I ignored every warning.

123
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
[AOI]
I was still taken in by Raiju,

124
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,166
and I ended up getting hurt.

125

[ATTENDANT 23A]
Excuse me, Ginji?

126
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,791
Master Ranmaru is
asking to see you.

127
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,166
[GINJI] What you need
most right now is to rest.

128
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,708
So try not to worry.

129
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,375
We'll make sure everything's
taken care of.

I should have known better.

131

Grandpa warned me about this
stuff from the very beginning.

[AOI] It's almost like
everything was going too well

to be true, but I see now.

134
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,875
There are some ayakashi who
have ill will for no reason,

135
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,291
but for the sake
of causing harm.

Don't worry.

137

[RANMARU]
Hm.

140
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,166
It's unfortunate that we
can't serve Aoi's cooking

141
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,041
to the umi-bouzu, who would
benefit from the spiritual power

142
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,583
in her food, but we
don't have a choice.

143
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,583
Where is Raiju staying?
Still in the Tougenkyou room?

I will handle him, you stay
out of it. Understand?

something, just to see.

148

Still nothing.

What will I do if it
stays like this forever?

151
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,250
[SHIRO]
When you meet hungry ayakashi,

152
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,583
make sure you have delicious
food on hand to give them.

153

If you do that, then they won't
have any excuse to eat you!

00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,458
[CHIBI] That looks so tasty!
Can I have some of it?

158
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm happy to be your follower,
Aoi, because it means

159
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,125
I get to eat your delicious
cooking every day!

160
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,875
[AOI]
That's sweet.

161
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,041
Everything's gonna be all
right. So don't be sad.

162
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,750
No, Ginji, wait!

163
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,666
I'm just going to ask
him about an antidote

164
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,166
for the spell he put on Aoi!

165
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,416
[door slides]

166
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,708
[AOI]
I wonder if this is any good.

167
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,750
[door slides]

168
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,541
[RAIJU]
It must be hard for you,

169
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,875
knowing you're nothing more
than a meal for ayakashi.

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
[AOI]
Raiju!

171
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,833
Were you sad to find your sense
of taste had been sealed off?

172
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,583
[AOI]
Give it back! My voice, too!

173
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,708
You'll pay for this!

174
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,875
Sorry, I can't hear you!

175
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,666
Now, you finally understand.
Ayakashi in this world

176
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,166
aren't always as kind as
you've known them to be.

177
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,333
Don't listen to him!

178
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,125
[AOI]
But many of them are kind.

179
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,875
Like Chibi. He trusts
and loves me.

180
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,000
And there's the ayakashi
from my childhood, too.

181
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,416
It's the same with humans--

182
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,375
some are good, and some
are awful, like you!

183
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,791
[RAIJU]
Oh?

184
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,541
I see you've cooked, dear,
even after what happened.

185
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,125
Well, since I'm already here,

186
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,750
I should try the food everyone
seems to be raving about.

187
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,916
[gasps]

188
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,708
[gasps]

189
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,125
This is awful.

190
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,916
The worst meal ever, if
you ask me! Ugh. So nasty.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
Disgusting. Truly. Sick.

192
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,083
[gasps]

193
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,291
Not only have you lost the
opportunity to cook the dishes

194
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,041
made of ocean treasure,
but with food this bad,

195
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,583
you'll never run
Moonflower again, either.

196
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,125
Good luck with that debt.

197
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,500
[laughs]

198
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:27,416
[CHIBI grunting] You better stop
being mean and lying to Aoi!

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,958
I tasted that omelet she made,
and it was delicious!

200
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,083
What's this? Get away from
me, you little nuisance.

201
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,250
[CHIBI whimpers]

202
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,625
[CHIBI screams]

203
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,916
[AOI]
Chibi!

204
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,291
Now, my lovely.

205
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,291
Why don't I eat you
here, in secret.

206
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,250
It's how I most enjoy
deviance, after all.

207
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,916
I do feel kind of bad
for the ogre-god,

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,666
but it's so much fun getting
a rise out of someone

209
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,000
who's so aloof and untouchable.

210
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,875
[AOI gasps]

211
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,000
[GINJI] You get your filthy
hands off her!

212
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,333
Let go of Aoi and back
away from her, now.

213
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,416
[gasps]

214
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,916
Ah, Ginji, what a
pleasant surprise.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,833
Aoi is the master of
Tenjin-ya's beloved fiancée.

216
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,750
So unless you want
some real trouble,

217
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,708
I suggest you let
her go and leave.

218
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,541
Oh? Real trouble?

219
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,083
From whom? You gave me
that insolent attitude

220
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,958
300 years ago. That's why your
precious Princess Iso died.

221
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,750
[gasps]

222
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,791
Don't ever forget that I could
easily sabotage your

223
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,500
little ceremony
according to my whims.

224
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,708
[GINJI grunts]

225
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,750
[RAIJU] Surely, you've thought
about eating this tasty

226
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,625
morsel before? Miss Tsubaki
looks delicious, does she not?

227
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,791
[AOI whimpers]

228
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,875
I refuse to play your
sick little games.

229
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,166
How could I imagine eating
someone like Aoi?

230
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,875
I've never thought that!

231
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,625
Not even once, because I'm
not despicable, like you!

232
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,125
Huh?

233
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,000
To me, Aoi represents hope,
like no one I've ever known.

234
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,416
When I look in her eyes, I
see an innocence she's had

235
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,875
since she was small.

236
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,291
[gasps]

237
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,958
And then, when she cooks,

238
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,000
she makes food with the
power to warm any heart.

239
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,791
Just because she loves to do it!

240
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,791
That alone is enough
to restore my hope!

241
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,000
[AOI]
I was right.

242
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,916
Ginji was the ayakashi
who saved me!

243
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,333
I am so utterly disappointed.

244
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,041
Modern ayakashi have become
so annoyingly soft.

245
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,166
In the olden times, we
ate humans without mercy.

246
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,833
And we lived and thrived
under the veil of darkness,

247
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,375
where fear and power
control everything!

248
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,666
[GINJI grunts]

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,125
[BYAKUYA] You're as crooked and
melodramatic as ever, Raiju.

250
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,791
[BYAKUYA] Only a fool refuses to
adapt to the changing times.

251
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,291
[RAIJU gasping]

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,625
I see you still haven't
forgotten my pretty face.

253
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,583
You old rake.

254
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,250
But, Byakuya! How?

255
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,291
Why are you here?!

256
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,416
[GINJI]
Uh!

257
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,083
[BYAKUYA] Our investigation
revealed the truth.

258
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,000
You were behind the assassin
who infiltrated Tenjin-ya

259
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,208
and made an attempt
on Aoi's life.

260
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,666
You're an unemployed reprobate,
rotten to your stinking core!

261
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,583
Amorality aside, per the
terms of Shiro's contract,

262
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,000
Aoi belongs with our master.

263
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,000
You'll be punished for
violating said terms.

264
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,875
I will not!

265
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,041
[GINJI]
Ah! It's okay!

266
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,541
Oh, but must I insist.

267
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,750
You must learn your lesson,
and I am happy to teach you!

268
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,375
[RAIJU screams]

269
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,500
No need to be afraid
now, he's gone.

270
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,083
I guess he ran away,
the coward.

271
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,250
Well, I'll beat him to a pulp
the next time I see him.

272
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,916
Already did, but you used
your words as weapons. Heh.

273
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
It's funny. Raiju
acts big and bad

274
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,500
until you show up, and then
he seems like a child.

275
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,875
He's a living fossil who's
wasted his life on trifles.

276
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,000
If he had only devoted his life
to diligent work, like me,

277
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,166
he would be fine.
More importantly...

278
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,166
...I've brought some
guests with me today.

279
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,666
[gasps]

280
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
It's been too long
since we last met.

281
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
How have you been?

282
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,416
[BOTH gasp]

283
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,416
So, it's true. You lost
your voice, then?

284
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,333
You poor darling.

285
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,708
Once again, thank you
so much for coming today,

286
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,166
Master Nuinoin and
Mistress Ritsuko.

287
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,666
I'm sure you're
probably wondering

288
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,416
what's going on here, Aoi.
It's quite a lucky development.

289
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,166
The Royal Couple's
here to help us.

290
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,166
They own one of Hourai's
gem branches, actually.

291
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,291
[gasps]

292
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,541
[GINJI]
As a matter of fact,

293
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,083
the Master is who
initially discovered

294
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,666
they were in possession
of the branch.

295
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,750
He sent O-Ryo here
to alert Ranmaru.

296
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,291
That's when Ranmaru went
to Youto to look into it.

297
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,833
Byakuya used to be an officer of
the Imperial Court, remember?

298
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,500
Through him, we invited
the Royal Couple to join us.

299
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,958
[gasps]

300
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,375
[GINJI]
We had to do it that way.

301
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,291
If Orio-ya had
asked them directly,

302
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,208
Raiju would have interfered.

303
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,416
The Master negotiated with
Orio-ya in return for his help

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,625
and asked that you and I
be released to go back

305
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,416
to Tenjin-ya, when all
is said and done here.

306
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,750
[RANMARU]
Mm.

307
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,083
[AOI]
Wow. I had no idea.

308
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,583
In addition, since the two
of you have been gone,

309
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,541
Tenjin-ya has been mired
in chaos and confusion,

310
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,916
and Moonflower sustained
a substantial profit loss.

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,333
When the ceremony is over,

312
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,333
we will compensate for that
damage, with interest.

313
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,000
[RITSUKO]
It's a well-known fact, Aoi,

314
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,583
but I wonder if you've heard it.

315
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,791
That all ayakashi have a strong
affinity for dramatic narrative.

316
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,875
[AOI]
So, they like a good story?

317
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,625
The great yokai in Youto
are especially fond of this.

318
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,291
And Raiju is the
worst of them all.

319
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,541
Out of boredom, yokai like him

320
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,791
control ayakashi for
their own amusement.

321
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,458
As a result, some fall
victim to these whims

322
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,458
and meet tragic ends.

323
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,250
It's a horrid,
despicable pastime,

324
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,791
and it's only practiced by the
coldest, most jaded of them all.

325
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,541
[BYAKUYA] Ougon-douji
and the Master played

326
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,500
their parts expertly, that's
why the plan succeeded.

327
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,291
So, arrangements for the
ceremony are nearly complete.

328
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,250
I wish you success
with everything,

329
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,625
and I hope you serve Raiju
appropriate justice.

330
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,666
It's a shame that the
gem branch we purchased

331
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,458
from the oogama was
really a counterfeit.

332
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,833
If I may, what is
the real branch like?

333
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,208
Well, one thing's for sure,
it's far less ornamental.

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's a lovely hanging
scroll, what's it for?

335
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,166
[BYAKUYA] Nuinoin purchased
it in the apparent realm,

336
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,791
but there's something
special about it.

337
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,041
The ink brush painting is a
bewitched contained space.

338
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,708
Commonly called a "threshold."

339
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,166
[RANMARU]
Fascinating.

340
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,791
Ritsuko and I have always
stored our family heirlooms

341
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,875
inside this painting.
To keep them safe.

342
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,833
Yes. This idiot took a
sacred contained space

343
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,041
and relegated it to little
more than a broom closet.

344
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,708
[AOI] He just called the ruler
of this world an idiot!

345
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,291
I'm not the brightest
in the realm.

346
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm confused, are you saying
their Hourai's gem branch

347
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,750
is stored somewhere
in this painting?

348
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,333
[BYAKUYA]
Yes, exactly.

349
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,708
As I recall, it settled and took
root somewhere near the summit.

350
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,708
I'm sure it's grown into
a glorious tree by now.

351
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,458
They're happy to lend their
Hourai's gem branch to you all.

352
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,583
They deem Orio-ya's protection
of this land a noble cause.

353
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,291
But, it's up to you to go into
the painting and find the tree.

354
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,291
I'll take on that task myself.

355
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,375
I'll climb mountains,
or even go through them.

356
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

357
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,375
You don't have the time.

358
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,541
You have to stay and oversee
preparations for the ceremony.

359
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,291
[RANMARU] Hideyoshi can do that
in my stead, with Nene's help.

360
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,750
Tokihiko and Hatori
can assist as well.

361
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,208
My executive staff
is more than capable.

362
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,333
You must take care
while in the space.

363
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,291
Its magic will consume a great
deal of your spiritual power.

364
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,916
Interesting. So, it's
like a survival game.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,916
We should find a way to
replenish within the space.

366
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,250
Why not bring Aoi?
She could cook for you

367
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,125
and restore your power
with her food.

368
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,166
[gasps]

369
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,625
We could, but she's
not healed yet.

370
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,708
We should ask what she thinks.

371
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,625
You're not one to
back down from a fight.

372
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,458
Don't you want to thwart
Raiju's sabotage attempt?

373
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,833
[AOI] If I go, I might end
up just being a burden.

374
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,250
But, still...

375
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,250
Right. I want you to take
this special tincture.

376
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,958
[AOI]
What's that?

377
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,333
[BYAKUYA] This is the
Tenjin Hyper Infusion.

378
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,458
It's a highly effective
medication developed

379
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,458
in our basement
lab at Tenjin-ya.

380
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,541
That's great! They finished it!

381
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,500
[BYAKUYA]
Shizuna entrusted it to me.

382
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
She wanted to
make sure you had it

383
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,708
in case something
happened to you.

384
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,125
[AOI] Thanks, Shizuna.
That means the world to me.

385
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,750
Even though Aoi's
sense of taste

386
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,000
has been sealed off by
some powerful magic,

387
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,416
this medicine should
bring her some relief.

388
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,541
It's incredibly bitter,

389
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,458
but right now, that
won't be an issue.

390
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,250
That's somewhat lucky.

391
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,250
I wouldn't want to taste it.

392
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,958
[cork pops]

[AOI]
I can't breathe!

394
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,500
[RANMARU] Are you able to
give us further details about

395
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,458
the painting? We'd appreciate
anything you can share.

Hello! I'm glad you're awake!

Good news, your
fever came down.

Hopefully you're starting
to feel better.

[stomach grumbles]

401
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,000
[GINJI] Don't worry,
I made you breakfast.

402
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,666
Food is a huge part of your life

403
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,041
and you should
be able to enjoy it.

404
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,250
You can't taste right now,

405
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,375
so I focused on texture
and appearance.

406
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,125
And I put my heart
into it, I guess.

407
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,875
[AOI]
I still can't taste anything.

408
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,458
But I can tell by the popping
that there's <i>ikura</i> ,

409
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,750
and the crispy ones
are lotus root.

410
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,958
Also, I can smell the aroma
of the stock in the soup.

411
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,208
So, what do you think of it?

412
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,375
[GINJI]
I'm so glad.

413

[AOI]
Oh, Ginji.

414

He's only ever been kind
to me. It's so sweet.

415
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,250
He said he put his heart into
making my breakfast today.

416

Okay!

Your voice is, at least!

I'm so happy to be able
to hear you again!

[AOI laughs]

423
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,541
We should take the leftover
roast beef from

424
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,208
the tasting session. Even
if it doesn't taste good,

00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,125
I'll make sure you
eat it, anyway!

You know, I think the medicine's
working too well.

It's my breakfast. 'Cause

to get inside?

There's a special key. Until
you return, I'll have it

and the scroll on my person,
to keep you as safe as possible.

space, where the Hourai's
