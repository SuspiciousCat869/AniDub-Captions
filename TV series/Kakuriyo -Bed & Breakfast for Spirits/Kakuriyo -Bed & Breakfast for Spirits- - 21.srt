Sit back and watch an expert.

316
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,483
This is super chewy.

317
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,608
I know, right?

318
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,358
Don't you think it's
delicious, though?

319
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,608
You said that it's from
the apparent realm.

320
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,483
Yeah, it used to be
incredibly popular there.

321
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,942
I see. I think I like it, too.

322
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,275
[laughs]

323
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,692
[NENE] I wonder...
what's the matter with me.

324
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,192
What?

325
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,733
[NENE]
Hey. Can I ask you something?

326
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:48,067
Is there someone in your life
that you admired, and,

327
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,817
it got so intense that you
started feeling really jealous

328
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,067
and angry at them?

329
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,192
That intense? I'm not
really sure about that.

330
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,650
I don't think so,
but it's probably because

331
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,400
I've never met anyone
who was great enough

332
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,108
to make me feel that way.

333
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,275
[NENE]
Right.

334
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,067
But I gather you have.

335
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,400
[NENE]
Mm-hm...

336
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,567
Are you talking about O-Ryo?

337
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,942
When I was younger,
a very long time ago,

338
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:15,192
I went on a vacation with my
grandparents to Tenjin-ya.

339
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,442
While I was there,
I bumped into a drunk.

340
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,817
[GUEST 21A]
Ouch!

341
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,025
What's your problem,
dumb little girl!

342
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:21,858
[whimpers]

343
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:23,233
[O-RYO]
Oh, there you are!

344
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,775
I've been looking
all over for you.

345
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,733
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

346
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,692
The hot saké is
going to get cold,

347
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,400
so we had better hurry back!

348
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,483
Come on, let's go!

349
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,442
[GUEST 21A]
You bet!

350
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,692
[O-RYO laughs]
You ready?

351
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,025
[GUEST 21A]
Yeah!

352
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,275
I was just thinking it was
time for another drink!

353
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,733
Later, she snuck me snacks

354
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,233
and told me not to
worry about him.

355
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,358
She's the reason I decided
to be a room attendant

356
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,108
in the first place.

357
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,858
Wow, I had no idea.

358
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,733
[NENE] But I feel like I'll
never be as wonderful as her.

359
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,025
Why?

360
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,567
I just know it's true.

361
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,150
And, so, when Hideyoshi and
Ranmaru talked about her,

362
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,400
all I wanted was to run
away and hide somewhere.

363
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,025
I don't measure up.

364
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,775
[NENE] And I couldn't
control that feeling,

365
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,150
so, it got to the point
where I couldn't

366
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,108
hear anyone say her name.

367
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:07,442
I know how pathetic
this must sound.

368
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:09,692
No, not at all.

369
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:11,858
I think you're
incredible, you know?

370
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:13,442
Do you really?

371
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,400
[AOI]
I do. It takes a lot of courage

372
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,733
to acknowledge a feeling as
uncomfortable as jealousy.

373
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,067
And that's a lot healthier
than lying to yourself

374
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,067
about this stuff!

375
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,108
Interesting. Never
thought of that.

376
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,358
Anyway. Why was I even chosen
to be the young hostess?

377
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,567
Are you saying that
you don't enjoy it?

378
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,483
Oh, no, it isn't that at all.

379
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,025
I truly adore being
the young hostess.

380
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,650
It may be that I'm a
little tender hearted,

381
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,400
but I need to get
stronger to succeed.

382
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:45,733
Tell me, aren't you even
a little bit afraid?

383
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:46,942
About what?

384
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,567
[NENE] You're a human,
and you're in charge

385
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,983
of the dishes of ocean treasure,

386
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,858
plus a lot of other
responsibilities.

387
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,858
Yeah, that makes sense, but, no.

388
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:56,150
You see, if I notice an
<i>ayakashi</i> who needs help,

389
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,483
and if I know there's something
I can do to assist them,

390
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,733
then why wouldn't
I want to do it?

391
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:05,317
Huh. I've been meaning to ask.
Is your foot okay, Aoi?

392
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,275
[AOI]
She called me by my name!

393
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,608
[NENE] Did you hear me?
How's your foot feeling?

394
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,150
What? Oh, uh, my foot?

395
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,608
I'm the one who tripped you
when you first got here.

396
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,150
Right, you were!

397
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,233
I'm sorry. I just lashed
out at you that day,

398
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,692
and I had no good reason.

399
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,233
It's okay, no hard feelings.
My foot's healed!

400
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:25,608
Seriously?!

401
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,192
You mean, I've been beating
myself up for nothing?

402
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,775
[laughs]

403
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,192
[gasps] Oh no, I changed back,

404
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,358
but I'm still wearing my
young hostess kimono!

405
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,483
Don't worry.
You look so precious!

406
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,775
I know that.

407
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,567
[laughs]

408
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:47,400
[AOI] If you'd like,
you can wear this.

409
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,483
Thank you for everything, Aoi.

410
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,483
You are a really good listener.

411
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,108
I am?

412
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,817
[AOI]
Thank you for the snack, sir.

413
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,567
Wait, I have something
else you might like.

414
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,733
[AOI] What?! Coconut
milk and coconut oil?

415
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,067
No way! Whoa!

416
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,900
I never thought I'd see
those around here!

417
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,817
Your excitement seems
disproportionate.

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,275
Yes, I'll take 'em!

419
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,192
Give me three cans of milk
and one can of oil, please!

420
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:13,983
Right away!

421
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,192
[laughing]

422
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:21,108
Oh, yeah, take this
hat as a souvenir.

423
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,733
[grunts]

424
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,358
Yep, it looks great.

425
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,483
Uh, thanks, I guess, but...

426
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,942
I mean, it is just a straw
hat for farming work.

427
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:33,817
Do your best, all right?

428
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,692
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

429
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:36,942
[NENE]
Mm...?

430
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,108
[NENE] Hey, are you dating
that fish peddler?

431
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,192
Tell the truth!

432
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,442
Huh?!

433
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,358
Seems like it. Things
could get ugly, y'know.

434
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,900
I heard that Tenjin-ya's
Master is a scary guy.

435
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:51,942
If he finds out, he'll kill you!
Or worse. You'll be fresh fodder

436
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,817
for the front page
of the <i>Weekly Youto</i> !

437
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,150
We're not dating!

438
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,233
You sure about that?

439
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,317
[AOI]
What about you?

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,067
What is your relationship
with Hideyoshi like?

441
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,358
[NENE]
Hideyoshi? Why?

442
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,525
[AOI] He was really
concerned about you earlier.

443
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,983
Got me thinking.

444
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,192
[NENE] Hmm. He's just an
old friend of the family.

445
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,400
His house was next door to ours.

446
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,317
[AOI]
Oh, I could see that.

447
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,233
Also, he was
infamous around town

448
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,567
for being kind of naughty.

449
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,108
Ha, yeah, I could totally
see that being the case.

450
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,358
But then Ranmaru
started getting involved.

451
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,275
He recognized
Hideyoshi's abilities,

452
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,567
brought him to the inn,
and it changed his life.

453
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,108
Ranmaru did that for him?

454
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,525
Yeah, but Hideyoshi has
an even tougher row to hoe

455
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,150
than I do over there. Since
he's always getting compared

456
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,025
to the former young master.

457
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,483
I think that, as far
as Ranmaru's concerned,

458
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:45,067
no one could be better
at the job than Ginji was.

459
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,233
No matter how
special Hideyoshi is.

460
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:48,567
He can't compete with someone

461
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,483
who was like a
brother to his boss.

462
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,317
Nevertheless, Hideyoshi
always works hard

463
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,650
and never complains,

464
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,692
and I respect him for that
above everything else.

465
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,358
That's great.

466
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,567
This one looks really nice,
think I might have to get it.

467
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,067
Now that I look more closely,
I recognize you.

468
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,192
You're the young
hostess at Orio-ya.

469
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,900
You're right about that, mister.

470
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,900
That's our Nene, isn't it?

471
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,650
[CHILD 21A]
Wow, it is Nene!

472
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,025
[CHILD 21B]
Wanna play with us?

473
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,567
[CHILDREN chattering]

474
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,025
[WOMAN 21B] Take these, we'd be
honored for you to have them.

475
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,358
[NENE]
What?

476
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:29,942
[WOMAN 21A] Stop by my place
whenever you'd like!

477
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,692
[CHILD 21B] Come with us
to the beach sometime!

478
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:35,025
[OLD MAN 21A]
And take this back with you!

479
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,275
[AOI]
I know this,

480
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,150
O-Ryo would never have
gotten this reception.

481
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,192
[HIDEYOSHI] I see she went
back to her normal form.

482
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,525
[AOI]
Yeah.

483
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,358
Did she tell you why all
this might have happened?

484
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:56,150
Well, from what I gathered,
she just lost her composure.

485
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,150
I have to admit,
I misunderstood her initially.

486
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,108
But I think she's a kind person.

487
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,275
Of course she is,
otherwise Ranmaru never

488
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:05,567
would have made her young
hostess in the first place.

489
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,150
She's still quite inexperienced,

490
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,817
so I see why she
gets discouraged.

491
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,067
But there are those of us here

492
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,858
who understand and
accept her as she is.

493
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,108
I hope one day she really
lets that truth sink in.

494
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,400
Yeah I do, too. Because
she deserves to know.

495
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,233
[AOI]
Hey, Hideyoshi?

496
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:39,733
Yeah? What?

497
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:42,108
Be honest with me, do you
perhaps have feelings for Nene?

498
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:45,108
Yeah, of course I do,
you got a problem with that?

499
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:47,858
Uh. I don't.

500
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,150
[AOI]
Aw, man.

501
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,275
I asked him to tease him,
but he admitted it.

502
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:54,108
But promise you won't tell
her I said that, 'kay?

503
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:56,775
'Cause she has feelings
for Ranmaru, not me.

504
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:00,233
I know it's weird,
but I'm rooting for them.

505
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,942
Kay, bye.

506
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,192
[AOI]
When we first met,

507
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:08,483
I thought he was completely
unpleasant, but I was wrong.

508
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,942
I happen to be rooting
for you, Hideyoshi.

509
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:16,317
I like Orio-ya,
and its people!

510
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,025
[CHIBI] That ogre god sure can
work in any kind of business!

511
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:54,983
Maybe he'll become
a greengrocer!

512
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,775
Then I could have all
the cucumbers I want,

513
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,150
whenever I want! Awesome!
