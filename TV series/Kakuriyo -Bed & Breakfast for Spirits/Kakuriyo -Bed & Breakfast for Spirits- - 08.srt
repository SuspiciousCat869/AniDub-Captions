00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,250
Indeed.

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,000
I would like you to cook
a special meal

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,125
for Master Nuinoin and his wife
on their anniversary.

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,333
Hold on a minute.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,833
The Royal Family?

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,000
You want me to cook for
those fancy <i>ayakashi</i> ?

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,500
Well, Mistress Ritsuko

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,375
is originally from the apparent
realm, like yourself.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,708
[gasps]

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,875
[BYAKUYA] She heard about
Moonflower's reputation,

11
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,916
and she requested your cooking.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,958
Likely,

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,625
she feels nostalgic
for the food

14
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,625
from the realm of her birth.

15
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,000
So, Aoi, will you
accept this job?

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,875
Yes, I accept.

17
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:51,958
I'll do it,

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,166
and I'll give it my best!

19
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,916
[AOI] Cooking for Master Nuinoin
and Mistress Ritsuko, huh?

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,375
[AOI]
It's their anniversary,

21
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,083
so I hope I can
serve them something

22
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,208
that will bring back
good memories.

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,708
Or at the very least,

24
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:51,291
a dish that they'll remember
fondly this time next year.

25
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,500
But,

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,625
I don't know a thing
about Ritsuko.

27
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,583
[AOI]
I wonder how old she is,

28
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:03,416
and how she ended up married to
someone from the hidden realm.

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,083
I hope she wasn't collateral
for someone's debt, too.

30
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,625
[sighs]

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,041
[AOI] Well, I won't get
answers on my own.

32
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,916
I've got no choice
but to ask him.

[growling]

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,750
Oh boy.

35
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,875
I was really hoping
to avoid him.

You gluttonous little creatures
don't listen to a word I say.

There's plenty of food
to go around, don't worry.

Hey, don't wander too
far off on your own.

It's dangerous without
your companions. Mm?

Aoi, what are you doing here?!

How long have you
been watching me?

Well, you know
when you said, "Now, now,"

58
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,333
and, "Hey, I told you guys
to stop that?"

59
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,583
Since then.

Oh, but don't you mind me!

00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,791
I couldn't see very well
from where I was standing,

63
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,375
and you know what?
Why don't I just leave?

64

'Kay, bye!

You're a human woman,
aren't you?

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You smell really good.

67
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,208
It's not every day
you get to see a human.

68
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, you're right.
It's super rare.

69
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,291
Forgive me for prying,

70
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,208
but are you raising
these kittens?

71
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,583
I'm not.

72
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,250
I can see why you'd ask,
but these are just friendly,

73
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,000
wild <i>ayakashi,</i>
known as tube kittens.

[AOI]
Tube kittens?

75
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,375
Well, whatever you're
doing out here,

76
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,166
it's clear that you
like them a whole lot.

77
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,583
That's irrelevant!

78
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,083
It doesn't matter
if I like them.

79
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,750
They're especially weak,

80
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,791
so I provide some protection.

81
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,000
That's all.

82
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,291
You totally like them,
I can tell.

83
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Is that a problem?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,458
No! It's endearing.

85
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,291
In fact, I've always had a soft
spot for feeding palm kappa,

86
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,750
so I can relate.

87
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,458
You just reminded me
of that a bit.

--[gasps]
--[CATS meowing]

89

They're really weak, too,

90
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,875
and it's not like I was
able to protect them

91
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,625
like you are these tube kittens.

92
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,000
But, I was able to spare them
from their hunger pangs,

93
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,500
so I understand
how you must feel.

for getting so excited.

As a matter of fact,
I have a healthy appetite.

Uh, just a few things about

so I can plan the menu better.

I know that
Mistress Ritsuko is human,

150
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,916
but do you know how long ago
she lived in the apparent realm?

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,458
[BYAKUYA] She was born in
the early Showa period.

152
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,291
[AOI]
Was it really that long ago?

153
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,291
[BYAKUYA]
She's from Nagasaki,

154
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,208
and lived in Fukuoka
during her school days.

155
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,500
It was around that time
that she met Master Nuinoin

156
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,916
in the apparent realm.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,166
Wait, they met there?

158
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,750
That's right.

159
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,250
They often went on secret dates
in Western-style restaurants,

160
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,958
as those were popular
at the time.

161
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,875
Well, that's certainly
good to know!

00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,125
I wonder if I should make them
beef stew or fried cutlet, then.

163
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
That is, if it's even possible

164
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,625
to find the right ingredients
around here.

165
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,041
You don't need to worry
about that part!

166
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:49,916
[gasps]

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,541
What are you doing here, Ginji?

168
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,208
[chuckling] I heard what you
were up to,

169
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,500
so I thought I would help.

170
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,166
If you're in need
of Western ingredients,

171
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,333
look no further than
the foreign delicacy market

172
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,916
held in the eastern land.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,458
The foreign...

174
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,416
...what now?

175
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
Delicacy market.

176
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,833
It's a place where they sell
things from the apparent realm,

177
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,541
as well as other realms.

178
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,416
It's being held in
the eastern land as we speak.

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,583
What perfect timing!
If I can get there,

180
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,958
then I should have no problem
making Western dishes!

181
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,208
[BYAKUYA]
Yes. Now, then.

182
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,541
I thank you very much
for the food.

183
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,041
I'll be taking my leave.

184
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,916
[AOI]
No, thank you for the help.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
Feel free to stop by anytime.

186
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,208
Like when you go
to the mountain out back.

187
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,458
A-- Aoi!

188
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,458
[BOTH]
Huh?

189
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,875
[clears throat]

190
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,416
[GINJI]
Well, that was strange.

191
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,916
I've never seen
the chief of accounting

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,583
panic like that before.

193
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,250
[AKATSUKI]
All right, Aoi, tell us.

194
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,208
What did you do to the guy?

195
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,750
I beg your pardon?

196
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,541
[AKATSUKI] The man looked
as if he'd been threatened

197
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,833
by someone wicked. Like Shiro.

198
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,166
So now I'm wicked?

199
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,875
Anyway, Ginji, I'd like
to go shopping

200
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,291
in the eastern land tomorrow.

201
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,083
Do you think
that'd be a problem?

202
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,458
I don't believe so.

203
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,166
Of course, you will
have to ask the master

204
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,958
for his permission first.

205
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,541
[AOI]
Uh...

206
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,000
Sure, that's fine.

207
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,833
You want to go there
tomorrow, correct?

208
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,250
[AOI] Yes. I need to get
the right ingredients

209
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,208
for the anniversary
dishes I'll be making

210
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,750
for the royal family.

211
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
[MASTER]
Hmm...

212
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,500
I wish I could travel
with you, but...

213
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,500
Huh?

214
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,041
I can't do tomorrow.

215
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,833
I must attend the Hachiyo Night
Meeting being held in Youto.

216
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,291
[AOI]
Hachiyo?

217
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,666
That refers to the <i>ayakashi</i>

218
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,333

in the hidden realm, right?

00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,458
[MASTER]
Yes.

220
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,708
It is a very important meeting.

221
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,875
Even someone such as myself
cannot ignore it.

222
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,000
That's okay, I understand.

223
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,541
It's a shame that you
can't go yourself,

224
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
but I'll just
take Ginji with me.

225
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,000
No. If I'm not
able to be there,

226
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,500
then you shouldn't go.

227
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,625
Someone did try to kill you
the last time we went out.

228
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,166
Oh, I'll be fine.

229
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,583
You can be far too
overprotective, you know.

230
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,875
It's like your my grandpa
or something.

231

[MASTER grunts]

232

Hold on.

233
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,500
Do I sincerely look
that old to you?

00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,833
[AOI]
What? No, not really.

235
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,250
Wait, aren't you several
hundred years old anyway?

236
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
What are you so worried about?

[MASTER sighs]

You got it all wrong.

239
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,875
I meant that you're acting like
my grandfather, specifically.

240
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,958
He was like that.

[MASTER grunting]
Shiro...

Huh! Everyone here
keeps telling me

00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,125
that I'm just like him.

I'm glad I'm not the only one

who feels insulted by that now.

246
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,958
So, you won't let me go
unless it's with you?

247
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,500
Yes, it's not safe for you
to be there without me.

248
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,250
Can't you just send Ginji
to find what you need instead?

249
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,750
If I'm going to cook
for a couple's anniversary,

250
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,916
then I wanna be there to pick
out the best ingredients myself.

[gasps]

252

[AOI] To think,
I made you this bento. Huh!

253
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,500
It was supposed to be
as thanks for letting me go.

I can't go.

So, I guess I'll just have
to lug it back to Moonflower,

and stress-eat it all
by my lonesome.

calm down here?

00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,666
Hey...

323
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,750
There's something
I'd like to ask you about.

324
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,875
Back when I was a little girl,

325
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,791
I...

326
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,791
Actually, on second
thought, never mind.

327
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,083
[footsteps]

328
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,125
Thank you for walking me
all the way here.

329
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,500
I hope you enjoy
your trip tomorrow.

330
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,791
Get some rest.

331
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,375
[AOI]
Good night, Master.

332
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,208
[AOI'S MOTHER] Don't go outside,
no matter what.

333
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,333
You got that?
Keep the door shut tight,

334
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,041
even if someone comes by.

335
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,250
Come back, Mommy.

336
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,791
[thunder claps]

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,000
[groaning]

338
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,500
It was that
same dream again.

339
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,916
[amulet hums]

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,083
This feels so warm.

341
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,500
Huh?

342
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,083
[AOI]
What's all this?

343
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,416
[MASTER] This bento you made
was quite delicious.

344
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,125
The thunder and lightning
may be gone,

345
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,166
but there are plenty of other
frightening things out there.

346
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,041
So, please return to Tenjin-ya
as soon as possible today.

347

[AOI]
Simmering pork belly

348
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,875
in carbonated water
makes it taste great.

349
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,791
I'm glad he agrees.

350
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,791
[giggles]

351
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,750
[AOI]
But, he sure is a worrier.

352
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,000
Once again, he sounds
just like my grandpa.

353
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,375
[AOI sighs]

354
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,000
He calls me his bride,
but treats me like a child.

355
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,708
It's so weird. Like,

356
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,750
he might as well be my guardian.

357
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,500
[BYAKUYA] You sound like
you're her guardian.

358
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,791
I'm finding it hard
to follow your logic.

359
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,125
If you're that worried,

360
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,250
why did you ever grant
her permission to travel?

361
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,750
Aoi isn't a bird
in a cage, you know.

362
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,125
Also,

363
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,666
she strongly wished to pick
the ingredients herself.

364
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,833
[BYAKUYA grunts]

365
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,583
I'm sure she's taking this
very seriously.

366
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,833
That's the kind of woman she is.

367
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,083
[MASTER]
She's probably arriving

368
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,375
in the eastern land
right about now.

369
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,541
[AOI]
Wow! Heh!

370
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,541
It's beautiful!

371
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,416
It's just like the oceans
back in the apparent realm.

372
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,791
Uh--

373

[whales singing]

374
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,291
Well, except for the flying
rainbow whales, that is.

375
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,458
If you look ahead,
you can see how close we are

376
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,291
--to the eastern land.
--Huh?

377
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,458
Interesting.
This place is so different.

378
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,666
The buildings are Western.

379
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,125
Not like Ginten.
Or Youto, either.

380
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,791
I'm kind of surprised.

381
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,291
I thought you might be.

382
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,166
This place is also known as,
"the Land of the Sea Gate."

383
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
Sea Gate, huh?

384
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,875
[GINJI] It's a harbor town with
a history of flourishing trade.

385
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,208
So the architecture
has lots of influences.

386
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,583
[AOI]
Fascinating.

387
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,000
I notice there are a lot
of fish shops here.

388
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,166
[GINJI]
Right.

389
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,791
Actually, we get our
seafood at Tenjin-ya

390
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,750
from the market
in this town as well.

391
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,375
[AOI]
Oh, I see.

392
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,291
Ah! And there it is.

393
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,458
[AOI]
Mm--

394
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,708
[GINJI]
That's the building in which

395
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,875
the foreign delicacy market
is being held.

396
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
[AOI]
Wow!

397
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
It's pretty big.

398
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,416
[AOI]
This is great!

399
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,291
Look at all this sweet stuff!

400
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,583
Oh, and they have a bunch
of chocolate, too!

401
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,916
Chocolate isn't
all that common yet,

402
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,250
but it's quite popular
among the wealthy.

403
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,041
Were you thinking
about buying some?

404
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,791
I was, but it's expensive.

405
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,791
It costs so much more than
it does in the apparent realm.

406
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,666
Maybe, but they gave us
a big budget.

407
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,291
So, let's see...

408
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,166
These three should be fine.

409
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,291
Yeah, sure!

410
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,583
I'll have to make
chocolate sometime,

411
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,416
so we don't have to spend
so much money.

412
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,833
Wait, we can't buy this now!

413
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,458
We haven't gotten anything
we came here for yet!

414
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,083
Well, I can't argue with that.

415
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,750
[AOI] Okay, first let's grab
what we need for beef stew.

416
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,750
I want to get some bouillon
and make the sauce from scratch.

417
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,833
Let's head to
the Western section, then.

418
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,416
Oh great, they have
cake flour and bread flour!

419
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,208
Flour is used in tons
of different recipes,

420
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,416
and it looks like
they have dry yeast, too!

421
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,041
[GINJI]
What's that used for?

422
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,291
Usually just for baking bread.

423
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,208
Aoi...

424
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,416
Do you know how to make bread?

425
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah!

426
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,041
I read a lot about it when I was
in high school and never forgot.

427
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,708
Could I still get
some milk and butter

428
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,500
if you contact
our dairy supplier?

429
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,166
I was planning to bake
some nice rolls

430
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,708
to go along
with the main course.

431
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,125
It'll be great!

432
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,416
Yeah, I bet! Good thing we have
that dairy connection.

433
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,625
[AOI]
Here we go!

434
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,875
Spices!

435
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,500
[GINJI] Oh! They've got
curry mix here, too!

436
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,916
Huh?

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I have to say, I was quite fond
of the curry and rice

438
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,041
that you made when you
came back to the hidden realm.

439
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,833
I could eat a ton of it.

440
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,166
[giggles]

441
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,375
That's just because
the curry roux was so good.

442
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,833
Do you wanna buy
some of those?

443
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,208
Yes, absolutely!

444
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,583
I guess you like curry
a lot, huh Ginji?

445
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,833
[GINJI]
Huh?

446
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,166
Well, it's not so much
that I like it.

447
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
I just thought curry
was your favorite,

448
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,333
so I figured
we should get some.

449
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,541
That's all!

450
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,625

I'm very hungry.
It's making my stomach hurt.

453
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,708
And all I want now
is my mom's curry and rice.

454
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,125
[AOI]
That couldn't be, right?

455
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,333
[GINJI]
Uh! Aoi!

--Hey, Aoi!
--[AOI] Huh?

00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,208
Look what I found!

458
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,916
Saké!

459
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,416
[AOI] That's the last thing
we needed for the beef stew.

460
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,916
I almost wanna
buy some for myself.

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,416
It's tempting, since it's
from the other realm.

462
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,333
I take it you
like alcohol, then?

463
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,333
I'd be lying if I said no.

464
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,916
What about you, Aoi?

465
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,458
I've never had any.

466
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,541
I only recently became of age.

467
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,791
Oh?

468
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,833
Then why don't we all
have a drinking party?

469
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,750
You, me, and the Master!

470
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,166
I'd love for us to get together

471
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,041
and celebrate
your drinking debut!

472
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,166
Uh...

473
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,291
Wait a second.

474
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,375
You wanna drink
and you need an excuse.

475
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,916
[GINJI]
Uh, it's not like that.

476

Hmm...

477
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,041
I swear, that wasn't
my intention.

[AOI sighs]

I'm starving.

00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,333
Would you like to have some of
the delicious local seafood?

482
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,666
Oh, yeah!

483
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,583
The ocean is beautiful.

484
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,291
It always reminds me of the time

485
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,083
when I lived
in the southern land.

486
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,291
If I'm not mistaken,

487
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,791
you worked at an
inn there, right?

488
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,208
Yes, it was a beautiful
inn called Orio-ya,

489
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,333
constructed right
by the seashore.

490
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,875
Oh, wow. I might have
to visit it someday.

491
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
Come to think of it,
Hakkabou told me

492
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,541
that he bought his mask
in the southern land, too.

493
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,333
That's a funny coincidence.

494
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,125
--[jingling]
--Uh?

495
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,375
[jingling]

496
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,625
Heh.

00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,458
Hold on!

500
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,708
[GINJI]
Aoi!

501
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,541
[AOI]
My legs won't stop moving.

502
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,833
Why?

503
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,416
[gasps]

504
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,708
Aoi?

505
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,583
Why don't you take a little nap?

506
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,708
[jingling]

507
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,125
[rain pouring]

508
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,541
[sigh]

509
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,625
Raining?

510
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,916
Hold on.

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,166
What?

512
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,750
How'd I... get here?

513
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,125
It smells like the ocean.

514
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,958
[AOI]
Am I locked in a storeroom?

515
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,083
Oh, maybe I can
use Matsuba's fan.

516
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:17,833
[AOI]
It's gone!

517
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,916
Indeed.

518
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
I ask that you remain
close to Ginji

519
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,375
because it truly is dangerous.

520
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,208
Don't wander off without him.

521
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,666
[grumbling]

522
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,958
[AOI]
Hmph!

523
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,333
Hello?!

524
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,000
Is anybody there?!

525
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,583
[AOI]
Okay...

526
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,500
Yah!

527
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,750
Someone! Anyone!

528
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,291
Is anyone there?

529
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,875
--[DARUMA C] Quiet!
--[gasps]

530
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,875
[DARUMA C] I'm only keeping you
down there for about two days.

531
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,458
--[AOI] Huh?
--[DARUMA C] You know,

532
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,166
until the royal couple's
anniversary has passed.

533
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,541
You what?!

534
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,333
--Hold on! Why would you...?

[CHIBI]
Whoa!

541
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,166
Looks like the eastern land
is a pretty fun place, too!

542
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,375
But, where did Aoi go?

543
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,000
Aoi? Hey, Aoi!
