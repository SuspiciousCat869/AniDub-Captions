That's right, it's a tree

00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:17,067
Ranmaru finally deigned
to compliment you!

163
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,608
Ha! It's only because
I'm so hungry!

164
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,150
They do say hunger is
the best spice, after all.

165
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,025
[laughs]

166
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,358
[CHIBI]
Cucumber's good!

167
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,983
Nom nom nom nom nom.

168
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,733
[RANMARU]
I'm going to survey the area.

169
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:30,817
[AOI]
What?

170
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,108
[GINJI]
Fog is settling in.

171
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,067
It's too dangerous
to go out now.

172
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,442
I don't care.

173
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,317
I can't just sit here lazing
around, like you two.

174
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,358
[AOI]
And he's gone.

175
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,233
[GINJI]
He's just desperate, I think.

176
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,192
He's scared to make the same
mistake from 300 years ago.

177
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,608
So, what exactly happened?

178
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,942
With that year's ceremony.

179
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,233
[gasps]

180
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,400
It was a lot like right now.

181
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:04,067
We were trying to locate one
of Hourai's gem branches.

182
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,608
Raiju offered his help.

183
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,900
He said he knew where one was,

184
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,942
and he'd do what he could
to get it for us.

185
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,692
But at one point
in the process,

186
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,442
he said something so
insulting to Princess Iso,

187
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,108
that it shattered her
dignity completely.

188
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,442
[gasps]

189
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,483
I couldn't forgive him
for hurting her,

190
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:22,150
which made me become
cross and defiant.

191
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:25,442
He's arrogant, so that
choice made him furious.

192
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:29,233
And he disappeared before
getting the gem branch for us.

193
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:30,525
I see.

194
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,192
Although, I bet
that he'd planned

195
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,108
to cause trouble from the start.

196
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,817
Yes, I agree.

197
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,942
Because the moment
that I challenged him,

198
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,858
this look of pure satisfaction
fell across his face.

199
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:45,192
As if I had walked
right into his trap.

200
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:46,942
I shouldn't've been surprised.

201
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,442
I'm certain he was anxious
to see the ceremony fail

202
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,358
and chaos ensue.

203
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,275
He's always been a wicked,
miserable <i>ayakashi.</i>

204
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,817
Unforgivable.

205
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,733
[GINJI]
And to make matters even worse,

206
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,192
we lost Princess Iso
because of him.

207
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:05,400
After that, Ranmaru was
never the same again.

208
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:09,150
[AOI] Maybe, he felt like
he had to change,

209
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,525
in order to protect the
southern land, perhaps.

210
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,858
Is that what you think, too?

211
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:18,442
Yeah, I suppose that
is how I see it.

212
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,233
But grief is a funny thing.

213
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,067
I understood, but still.

214
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,858
I couldn't stay by
his side anymore,

215
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,567
and I stopped supporting him.

216
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,067
Hey, Ginji. Do you regret it?

217
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,067
Going to work at Tenjin-ya?

218
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,608
[gasps] I don't.
Not even for a second.

219
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,733
I've gained so much
from my time there.

220
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:39,108
Countless experiences that
mean the world to me.

221
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:41,733
And not only that, but
Tenjin-ya has been vital

222
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,733
in the ceremony this year.

223
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,858
Honestly.

224
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,733
Even though I want to face
Ranmaru and tell him how I feel,

225
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,817
I can't bring myself to.

226
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,983
Whenever I'm around him,

227
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,400
it's like I turn into
a stubborn kid.

228
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,817
I understand.

229
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,317
Do you want to save
the relationship?

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,983
If he were willing to,
would you try

231
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,442
to go back to being brothers?

232
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:03,817
Of course I would.

233
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,525
But only if Ranmaru
felt the same way.

234
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,567
[chiming]

235
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,108
You know,

236
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,067
I believe you can go back
to the way you were.

237
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,983
[gasps]

238
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,525
[AOI]
But if that happens,

239
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:24,275
Ginji might decide he wants to
stay at Orio-ya, after all.

240
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,233
[gasps]

241
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,442
Oh, yeah! The figs!

242
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,442
I forgot.

243
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,025
How about a palate cleanser?

244
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,442
Yeah, that sounds great!

245
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,525
[AOI] Man! I've never seen
such a perfectly ripe fig!

246
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:39,858
Delicious!

247
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,192
[AOI]
That's too bad.

248
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,233
I still can't taste it.

249
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,817
It's gonna be all right.
Don't worry.

250
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,650
[AOI]
Uh?

251
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,942
I have no doubt.

252
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,608
Before you know it,
your taste will come back,

253
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,150
and you'll enjoy
your food again.

254
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,400
I won't entertain
any other possibility.

255
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:00,608
It just isn't fair.

256
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,567
You should taste the
fruit of your efforts.

257
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,233
Thanks, Ginji.

258
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,650
You deserve that.

259
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,233
To eat hearty,
scrumptious meals,

260
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:10,567
and to savor every bite of them.
You should feel that happiness.

261
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,817
[gasps]

262
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:14,942
So, have faith.

263
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,317
You'll continue to cook,
and you'll do it well.

264
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,150
For all the <i>ayakashi</i>
in the realm.

265
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,858
They'll come from far and away

266
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,025
to experience your artistry.

267
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:23,567
Hey, tell me something.

268
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,233
Have you and I met before?

269
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,650
When I was a child, I mean.

270
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,025
[GINJI]
What?

271
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,275
Did you save my life
when I was little?

272
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,067
[GINJI gasping]

273
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:35,067
[AOI]
I knew it.

274

Please, tell me. [gasps]

275
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,858
It's Princess... Iso.

Princess Iso, is that you?

Ginji, wait, that's not her--!

280
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,400
You're right.

281
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,400
Yes. It's an illusion, not real.

282
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:18,567
Remember Byakuya
telling us about it?

283
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,483
They come from the
tree's spiritual power.

He might see it, too!

Ha! Why, yes, of course.

What's with you?

Telling me not to leave,
then going out after me?

Don't act tough.

Yes, why are you
trembling, human girl?

I'm so relieved. Thank you!

Don't cry.

You know, if I hadn't
eaten your food earlier,

I may well have died.
That was quite a long fall.

00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,900
had perished in
that little spill.

324
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,608
[gasps] How can you say that?!

325
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,025
You're wrong!

326
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,942
He's the one who went
after you in the first place!

327
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,317
He was so scared.

328
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,275
He thought the illusion
would hurt you somehow!

329
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,775
That's right.

330
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:44,233
He cares about you immensely,
despite your differences.

331
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:45,983
Because you two are brothers!

332
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,900
You can't deny that.
You two and the Princess--

333
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,983
You're family, always!

334
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,317
That band.

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,150
You found it in the ruins
of the dragon palace?

336
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,608
It's Princess Iso's.
She gave it to me there.

337
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,650
It was her, the real princess,
not an illusion.

338
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,358
She called it her thought form.

339
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,150
She told me lots of stories.

340
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:11,650
All about you and Ginji as
little <i>ayakashi,</i> growing up.

341
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,983
She was really concerned.
She wants you guys to reconcile.

342
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,108
[gasps]

343
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,192
And also. That's
when she told me

344
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,900
to cook the dishes
of ocean treasure

345
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:22,692
for this year's ceremony.

346
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,692
But I can't. Because I--

347
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,192
I have no sense of taste now.

348
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,692
I'm so sorry.

349
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,817
Princess Iso, I'm sorry
I let you down.

350
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,900
What a pain.
I said not to cry.

351
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,900
[gasps]

352
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,317
Let's go.

353
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,150
Hold on.

354
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,233
Ginji knows me quite well.

355
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,650
He'll be expecting me to
prioritize finding the branch

356
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,858
over anything else.

357
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,317
In which case,

358
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,858
he'll probably make for the
summit, so we should, too.

359
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,525
I know that we'll
find him up there.

360
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,650
We'll get the branch as well.

The rainbow spiritual power.

[RANMARU]
Uh! Rainbow clams!

366
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:36,192
[laughs] Just like the
shell Master gave me.

367
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:39,775
Whoa! These shells
are super sparkly!

So, that's Hourai's gem tree?

370
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,150
It's so brilliant.

Thank goodness!

You're both safe!

[RANMARU]
Ha.

What you were seeking was right
in front of you the entire time.

Get your head out of
the clouds, now, Ginji.

Although, I must tell you.

You're all looking a little
worse than you did before.

But, still, you did very well.

Excellent work.

The fireworks event

I'll take those two.

They need a visit
to the infirmary.

422

I'll give them medicine to
recover their spiritual power.

423
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,192
Eating will help them more
than medicine would.

I'll cook up a little
something for them.
