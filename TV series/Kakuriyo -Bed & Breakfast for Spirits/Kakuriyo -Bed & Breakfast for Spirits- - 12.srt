00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,083
[SHIZUNA] Thank you so much
for everything.

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,041
It was such a lovely time!

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,208
We can't wait to come
back and eat here together,

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,541
if you'll have us!

5
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,291
Mm-hmm. You two
are always welcome!

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,083
I'm relieved. They'll be
all right, won't they?

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,208
Yeah.

8
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,208
[door closes]

9
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,208
Hmm.

10
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm glad things went well.

11
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
It's good that they reconciled.

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,958
[door slides]

13
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,625
Hey, how are you?

14
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,958
[AOI]
Mister Hatori!

15
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,458
Restaurant still open?

16
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,833
Closing time, but you're
welcome to have a seat.

17
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,500
All right! I heard
that you're a good cook--

18
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,916
Shiro's granddaughter!

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,125
[gasps]

20
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,041
[AOI] So, I take it
you knew my grandpa?

21
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,416
I did! We were best buds.

22
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,291
Hit it off right from the start,
'cause we had a lot in common.

23
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,666
Best buds, huh?

24
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,750
Whoa. What's that smell?

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,250
It's nice and spicy.

26
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,625
That's curry.

27
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,625
I've been experimenting
with a few new menu items.

28
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,125
Oh. Mind if I try?

29
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,125
Do you think you can
handle the heat?

30
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm not like most tengu.

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,541
Because I love spicy foods.

32
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,125
[AOI]
Here, enjoy!

33
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,541
Oh!

34
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,875
[HATORI gasping]

35
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,958
My mouth's watering
from just looking at this!

36
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,125
It's sweeter than I thought.

37
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,000
Whoa, spicy! But tasty!

38
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,166
I guess that means
you enjoy it?

39
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,583
[sighs]

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,625
[HATORI] I heard my old man
is crazy about you.

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,541
Now I know why.

42
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,791
Who's your old man?

43
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
Master Matsuba
from Mount Shumon.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,125
I'm that rascal's
third oldest son.

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,208
[AOI] What? You're Master
Matsuba's son? No way!

46
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,166
I sure am.
Although he did disown me.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,708
Why would he do that?
You deserve it?

48
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,250
Oh, I broke the code.

49
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,083
So, we got into a huge fight

50
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,916
then I got the spit kicked out
of me, and Pops disowned me.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,208
Jeez.

52
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,416
[AOI] I wonder what he did
to break this code.

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,791
But, I wasn't planning
to stay on that lame mountain,

54
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,625
so I don't care.

55
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,291
I'm way better off now.

56
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,833
[AOI] Oh. How about
some dessert on the house?

57
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,833
[HATORI] Wow! How'd you know
I had a sweet tooth?

58
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,333
That really hits the spot!

59
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,625
Especially after
that spicy curry!

60
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,416
This <i>warabi-mochi</i> is good.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
Do they have it for sale
in the gift shop?

62
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,375
Of course not!

63
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,625
It doesn't keep well,

64
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,291
so the guests aren't able
to travel with it.

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,666
No, I mean for them
to eat here at the inn.

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,666
Guests sometimes
come down to our gift shop

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,916
and buy snacks
to eat in-room.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
If you sold this
in your shop,

69
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,458
I'd bet good money that the inn
would make a killing from it.

70
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,458
That never even occurred to me.

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,333
You certainly have the mind
of a front desk manager.

72
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,708
And I like the way you think,

73
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,875
reminds me of your
grandfather in a way.

74
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:41,958
[AOI]
What?

75
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,583
Shiro was the
most-talked-about man

76
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,791
in the hidden realm.

77
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
He loved Tenjin-ya,

78
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,416
and was its most loyal patron
around, no contest.

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,458
Orio-ya, he never even
gave it a glace.

80
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,583
[HATORI]
Thanks to Shiro,

81
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,375
Tenjin-ya was the talk
of the realm.

82
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
Everyone came here.

83
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,708
Our lead manager, Ranmaru,

84
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,041
wasn't very happy about that,

85
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,958
as I'm sure you can imagine.

86
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,416
Yeah, I bet not.
Why would he be?

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,708
Do you have any idea
why Ginji left your inn

88
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,250
to come work here
at Tenjin-ya?

89
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,500
Nope, no clue.
But, then, again,

90
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,125
I never could figure out that
crafty fox bastard's intentions.

91
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,250
You watch it!

92
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,333
Ginji is a good, 
decent <i>ayakashi.</i>

93
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,708
You better be nice to him!

94
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,916
Oh?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,791
You're telling me
that you trust Ginji?

96
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,791
I see.

97
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,041
What if I do?

98

Ah-ha! You!

00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,916
Oh!

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,375
Akatsuki, what happened?

103
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,833
Did you finally
get tired of chasing

104
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,125
after little one-eyed kids?

105

[CHILDREN laughing]

00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,000
[AKATSUKI]
Stop it right now!

107
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,500
Well. Wouldn't you like to know!

108
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,916
Hey, come on,

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,125
is that any way for you
to treat your former boss?

110
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,625
[AKATSUKI]
You're work for our main rival,

111
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,125
so that's how I'll treat you.

112
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,666
Stop bothering
the master's fiancée!

113

That mean, scary front
desk manager

114
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,208
is flipping out again.

115
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,958
No wonder he made
those little kids cry!

116

[growling]

117
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,916
Akatsuki, you didn't
make them cry, did you?

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,708
Never mind.

119
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,791
Well you didn't ask
to be born with that face,

120
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,583
but, as front desk manager,

121
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,666
you should still try
to be pleasant.

122
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,250
But I was pleasant.

123
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,875
I was just concerned, so I asked
them if they had gotten hurt.

124
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,500
You're terrifying,
even when you're being nice.

125
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,083
That's not a good quality
to have at the front desk.

126
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,750
Maybe you should be the janitor.

127
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,083
You shut your mouth!

128
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,583
Just because our
master isn't here

129
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,375
doesn't mean you can say
whatever you want!

130
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,583
Go back to your room

131
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,875
if you can't treat me
with some courtesy!

132
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,458
Okay, jeez.

133
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,875
Fine, then,
I'll go to my room,

134
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,208
but you should check
your attitude.

135
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,375
Bye, Missy. Food was great.

136
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,500
Huh?

137
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,833
Don't you want your change?

138
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,250
Nah, keep it. Thanks, anyway.

139
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,791
See ya around.

140

--What's the matter with you?
--Huh?

141
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,250
That guy is a jerk,
and he works for our enemy,

142
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,958
so how could you be so nice
and serve him your food?!

143
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,791
Excuse me, but he came
in here as a customer!

144
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,791
Hatori is an irresponsible,
trash-talking, womanizer

145
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,916
who actually reminds me

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,416
a lot of your grandfather,
to be frank.

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,333
Seriously, that interaction
gave me a headache.

148
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,375
I thought he was amusing,
and quite sharp-witted, too.

149
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,791
[AKATSUKI]
You don't have to tell me,

150
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,500
I know that better than anyone.

151
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,541
Huh?

152
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,375
[HATORI]
Guess who's back?!

153
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
[TOKIHIKO]
Where have you been hiding?

154
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,416
I paid a visit to the
master's fiancée, Aoi.

155
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,041
What? You mean Aoi Tsubaki?

156
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,000
[HATORI]
I wanted to confirm the rumors.

157
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,041
They're true.

158
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,916
She's a great cook,
and a nice girl.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,458
Also, very pretty.

160
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,666
She is stubborn,
but no one's perfect.

161
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,875
Gotta say, she's exactly
the type of woman

162
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,458
Ranmaru loves to hate,

163
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,458
and she reminds me
a lot of Shiro, by the way.

164
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,041
That's not exactly
the impression I got of her.

165
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,666
[HATORI] You're wrong.
I've got that girl pegged.

166
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,458
Her curry was
phenomenal, though.

167
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,541
I'm not gonna lie.

168
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,916
And the <i>warabi-mochi</i> ? Man!

169
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,333
[GINJI]
You want to sell shaved ice?

170
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,916
Yeah. We can set up chairs
under the willow tree

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
and direct all the customers
to eat it over there.

172
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,291
Great idea!

173
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,000
O-hii's ice is delicious,
so it would sell!

174
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,000
Thanks, so kind of you to say!

175
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,291
I can't wait to work
with you both on that!

176
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,666
What flavor of shaved
ice do you plan to serve?

177
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,916
First, I was thinking
about serving Shirokuma.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,166
What's that?

179
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,041
It's a frozen dessert
from the apparent realm

180
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,916
that originated in a place
called Kagoshima, right?

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,416
That's correct! It's shaved ice

182
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,041
with syrup-preserved fruit
and sweet bean paste mixed in,

183
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,666
with condensed milk
drizzled over top.

184
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,041
Very pleasing to the eye.

185
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,666
I can't wait to try that!

186
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,708
It sounds just like a dream!

187
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,500
[O-HII] Better head out,
see you both next time!

188
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,750
[AOI]
I made this, too.

189
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,916
It would go really well
with the shaved ice.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,958
Huh?

191
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,625
What is that?
Wait, let me guess.

192
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,458
It's too firm to be gelatin,
but nope, I'm at a loss.

193
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,250
Why don't you just try it?

194
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,708
[GINJI]
Hold on, is this <i>konjac</i> ?

195
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,958
Bingo!

196
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,583
And you're right,
it is firmer than gelatin.

197
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,000
Interesting, right?

198
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,083
I think it'll be perfect
to put on top of the shaved ice.

199
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,291
Yeah! What an awesome idea!

200
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,250
And we could put
Okara crackers on it, too,

201
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,458
for some variety.

202
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,333
It'll be a lovely little
summer-time dessert!

203
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,875
Young master!
Come quick, there's trouble!

204
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,166
Why, what's going on?

205
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,583
Those kids who
are staying here

206
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,375
with their family
have disappeared!

207

[BOTH gasp]

00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,875
[indistinct shouting]

209
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,833
[AKATSUKI]
I'm sure you remember them.

210
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,833
They're the children you saw me
chasing through the hall,

211
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,666
the little one-eyed
<i>ayakashi</i> kids,

212
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,958
two young boys and a girl.

213
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,166
Is there cause to think
they were kidnapped?

214
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,458
I don't think the intruders

215
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,166
would have gotten
past our guards.

216
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,458
That's true.

217
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,541
If they weren't taken,

218
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,916
any clue where
they might have gone?

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,916
No. We've checked
the main building

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,708
and the courtyard,
but so far, nothing's turned up.

221
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,791
[GINJI] All right, so the
only places left to look

222
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,583
are the airship dock
and the basement?

223
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,916
[AKATSUKI]
Mm.

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,250
[GINJI] I'll start searching
at the airship dock.

225
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,291
But, we should still
make arrangements

226
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,500
to extend the search
beyond Tenjin-ya--

227
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,250
just for good measure.

228
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,000
You go and check
the basement.

229
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,166
[AKATSUKI]
Yes, sir.

230
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,833
Akatsuki, I'll help
you look down there.

231
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,625
This has nothing
to do with you.

232
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,375
It was the front desk's mistake.

233
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,208
Have you forgotten that
I'm a Tenjin-ya employee?

234
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,166
Two heads are better than one,
don't you know that?

235
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,416
[AKATSUKI]
This is it.

236
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,541
I never knew Tenjin-ya
had a basement.

Yeah. There's no doubt about it.

Come on, no time to waste!

240

Hey, what's the hold up?

Aoi,

if the children start crying
when they see me...

...will you calm them down?

Okay, you just leave
that part to me.

[pendant hums]

247
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,375
Is that a pendant with
the master's ogre fire?

248
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,583
Yeah, he told me it had
already served

249
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
the task it was intended for,
but I just like it.

250
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,791
The fire inside
is burning bright.

251
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,666
It's using your spiritual power
as an energy source.

252
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,500
What? Is it really?

You didn't know that?

How cool.

--A workshop.
--Oh, yeah?

the toiletries for Tenjin-ya,

and the gift shop souvenirs.

260
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,958
There's also a facility

261
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,541
that maintains the ogre fire
for the whole place.

262

All that work's done
in the basement, huh?

263
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,250
We couldn't do business
without these facilities.

264
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,916
They're definitely the force
behind the scenes.

They're mice?

Sort of, they're mice
<i>ayakashi</i> , known as tesso.

270

They make Tenjin-ya's

sugar rice crackers.

272

Then they pack
them into boxes.

to the depths
of the basement?

Well, Doctor, have you seen

Children? No, I haven't.

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,416
Fact is. I've been
trying to work out the formula

305
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,583
for a new hot spring bun.

when the idea came to me,

308
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,791
but I can't seem
to figure out the method

309
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,625
to achieve the flavor
my subconscious created.

310
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,416
Was the coating made
of sweet bean paste?

311
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,958
And if so, was it coarse
or smooth, white or green?

312
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,791
The plum-flavored crackers
are selling well,

313
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,916
but that's led to a reduction
in hot spring bun capacity.

00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,666
[SHIZUNA]
Thanks, Aoi, I can't wait!

484
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,875
[TOKIHIKO]
Hey!

485
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,791
Your cracker. Sorry.

486
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,125
Do you mind?

487
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,208
[barks]

488
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
Nom, Nom, Nom,
Nom, Nom.

489
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,541
Here, Akatsuki,
do you want some?

490
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm not a fan
of sugary foods.

491
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,166
Oh, come on, please!

492
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,833
Just consider it a thank
you gift for saving my life.

493
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,583
[growls]

494
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,708
Fine then. It's a hot day,
guess I'll try.

495
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,125
Mister Manager?

496
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,541
Here! This is my
thank you gift for you!

497
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,916
Uh, wha...?

498
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,125
[CHII]
Open your mouth!

499
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,958
Aahh! [giggles]

500
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,416
[growls]

501
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,833
Come on, do it!

502
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,791
Aaah.

503
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,541
[giggles]

504
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,625
[GROUP laughing]

505
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,291
Hey! What's so funny?

506
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,916
[GROUP]
Nothing!

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,458
[ALL laughing]

508
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,291
I'm so glad that everyone
seemed to have fun today.

509
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,583
Although, I wonder when
Ginji will come try it.

510
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,166
--[clattering]
--Uh?

511
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,125
[groaning]

512
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,791
There you are!

513
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,416
What happened?

514
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,958
You just hang in there,
and we'll take care of you!

515
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:11,833
Ginji!

516
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,166
[panting]

517
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,833
[CHIBI]
What happened to the fox guy?

518
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,166
Did he work too hard?

519
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,291
I hope he's gonna
be all right!

520
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,416
At a time like this,

521
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,166
better leave things to Chibi!
