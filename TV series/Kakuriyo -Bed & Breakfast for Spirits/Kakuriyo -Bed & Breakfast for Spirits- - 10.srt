[BYAKUYA] Thank you for
making the anniversary dinner

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,875
an indisputable success.

8
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,750
The Royal Couple was full
of compliments for you.

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,750
It was my pleasure, sir.

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,625
And have you made
a full recovery?

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,500
Yes. I'm back up to 100%.

12
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,041
Moonflower reopens
tomorrow, thankfully.

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,125
Excellent.

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,666
Right, then.
Keep up the good work.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,875
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

16
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,166
Just a moment, Byakuya.

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,291
--Here. Take these.
--What are they?

18
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,041

Oh, ah, Ginji, a word?

00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,208
[GINJI]
Yes?

23
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,000
Men from Orio-ya were

[GINJI gasps]

25
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,250
That's roused my suspicion

26
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,375
that they were somehow involved
in Aoi's kidnapping.

27
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,208
What? Oh, no.

28
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,041
I guess that will have to do.

29
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,375
[RITSUKO] Ah, what lovely
Tanabata decorations!

30
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,000
[AOI]
Mistress Ritsuko!

31
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,458
[RITSUKO]
Thank you.

32
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,958
I'm looking forward to the
Tanabata festival tomorrow!

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,083
Excuse me, Mistress Ritsuko?

34
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,541
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you all goodbye.

35
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,833
I collapsed after
I served you dessert.

36
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,666
I know, dear, Byakuya
told us what happened.

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,958
I hope you didn't overwork
yourself on our account.

38
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,708
In fact, I came to
express my gratitude.

39
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,333
Please accept this gift.

40
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,166
Go on, open it.

00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,375
[AOI]
What is this?

42
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,791
A <i>hagoromo</i> .

43
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,916
At the Imperial Court
in the capital,

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,125
all of the women
wear these.

45
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,125
I can't accept a gift
this nice!

46
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,583
I insist.

47
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,500
It's a token of thanks
for reminding me

48
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,958
of the flavors of my home.

49
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,958
And all while feeling ill.

50
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,125
It must have been
quite difficult for you.

51
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,791
Trust me, I know how
it feels for someone

52
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,541
to make an attempt
on your life.

53
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,666
Mistress, may I ask you.

54
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,916
What made you marry someone
from this realm?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,125
Oh, my.

56
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,250
What a question.

57
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,250
At the time Nui and I
got married,

58
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,166
the whole apparent realm
was at war.

59
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,541
[RITSUKO]
I was in school then,

60
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,541
in a town far away
from my parents

61
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,958
and everything I'd ever known.

62
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,333
They were back home in Nagasaki.

63
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,166
I adored books,

64
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,375
so, I went to a local
bookstore every day.

65
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,000
That little shop is
where I met Nuinoin,

66
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,041
who was visiting the apparent
realm incognito.

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,916
[RITSUKO] We found ourselves
spending a lot of time together,

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,250
talking about literature.

69
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,250
Soon, it was clear
we had fallen in love.

70
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,791
[RITSUKO]
Then, one day,

71
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,958
Nuinoin disappeared suddenly,
without a word of goodbye,

72
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,416
much less an explanation.

73
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,750
Soon after he left me--

74
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,958
one hot, late summer day,

75
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,125
my family and the rest
of my hometown

76
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,166
were reduced
to dust and ash.

77
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,875
[RITSUKO]
But I wasn't alone for long.

78
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,208
Around that time,

79
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,416
Nuinoin returned
to the apparent realm.

80
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,000
[RITSUKO]
He had come for me.

81
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,291
To bring me to another world,

82
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,416
and take care of me
for the rest of his life.

83
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,791
So that's my answer.

84
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,750
That's how I married someone
from the hidden realm.

85
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,916
Do you ever have
regrets about it?

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,125
No.

87
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
There have been some
tough times, of course,

88
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,083
but with Nui,
I've no regrets.

89
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,125
He's kept his promise
to stay by my side,

90
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,166
and I know he'll keep it
for the rest of his life.

91
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,666
As a matter of fact,

92
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
Nui alters his appearance
to match mine,

93
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,125
since we age differently.

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,375
Huh?

95
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,208
<i>Ayakashi</i> aren't like us;

96
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,083
they have a much longer life
expectancy than humans do.

97
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,625
But not to worry.

98
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,791
We have more longevity here than
we do in the apparent realm.

99
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,708
Huh? What's that mean?

100
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,208
There's something
about the food

101
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,125
in the hidden realm
that changes us.

102
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,666
I don't know how
it works, exactly,

103
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,791
but the more we eat,

104
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,791
the more like <i>ayakashi</i>
we become.

105
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,958
No way! And here I've been,

106
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,375
binge-eating hidden realm
food this entire time!

107
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,208
Nevertheless,
at the end of the day,

108
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
we are still human.

109
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,041
And the fact remains,

110
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,125
people die much younger
than <i>ayakashi.</i>

111
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,833
This is the inevitable truth

112
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,625
we and <i>ayakashi</i> must
accept when we intermarry.

113
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,791
You'll be fine.

114
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,250
Whoa, back up a bit.

115
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,916
It's not like I've
made up my mind yet.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,666
Maybe I won't marry the master.

117
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,958
Ha, ha. Oh, yes, I forgot.

118
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,875
But one never truly knows
what the future will hold.

119
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,166
In any case,

120
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,791
preparation is still
the key to success.

121
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,625
This <i>hagoromo</i> does
a great deal to conceal

122
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,750
the enormous vulnerability
that comes with being human.

123
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,375
It has that power?

124
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
Listen, Aoi.

125
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,041
If you do become the wife
of a great <i>yokai</i> one day,

126
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,583
promise me that you'll
show no weakness

127
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,416
to malicious <i>ayakashi</i>
who would do you harm.

128
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,750
Come.

This particular shawl
is the Seven Stars Hagoromo,

Yes. It's an honor

Stunning!

140

It's nice to remember
to look up at the stars

Honestly, I just wanted
to see your face.

Oh, yeah?

Well, is it okay
that you're here

while everyone else
works their tails off?

151
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,250
Not that it matters,

152
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,625
but all the events
have concluded

153

without a single misstep.

154
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,541
Now, then.

155
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,333
I simply must eat <i>somen</i> noodles

while gazing up
at the Milky Way,

or my Tanabata
won't be complete.

I am ravenous tonight.

But I was under
the impression

please use this hair tie.

324
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,333
Are you sure about that?

325
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,666
It's yours, after all.

326
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,375
Indeed, but I don't
mind sharing it.

327
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,250
Really?

328
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
Well, in that case, I accept.

329
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,666
Thanks so much.

--[CHIBI sighs]
--This feels amazing.

331
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,041
The water seems a bit denser
than usual, huh.

--[door opens]
--Huh?

333
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,166
Pardon, miss.

334
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,833
If you'll allow me
just a moment,

335
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,041
today's bath theme
is "summer citrus."

336
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,083
[AOI]
Huh.

337
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,041
[AOI]
Heh! Great!

338
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,500
Sweet Citrus Bath Enchantment.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,333
It does smell
sweet and citrusy.

340
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,000
Did you do something
special to it?

341
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,875
Yes, an enchantment.

342
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,333
[AOI]
Oh, like, magic?

343
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,000
Exactly right,
a special <i>ayakashi</i> technique.

344
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,916
Wow, cool!

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,125
So, are you, like some kind
of witch or something?

346
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,375
[SHIZUNA]
Huh? What?

347
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,875
A witch?

348
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,083
What am I even talking about?

349
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,250
[SHIZUNA]
Uh. Um... Miss Aoi?

350
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,250
Huh?

351
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,666
I, um...

352
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,458
I just wanted to apologize.

353
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,458
[AOI]
Uh?

354
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,375
That day, when you
first came here,

355
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,375
and you asked me if you
could work in the baths--

356
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,875
I turned you down
and I feel terrible.

357
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,166
It's been on my mind,
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,875
Listen, don't worry about it.

359
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,833
I found work, and in
my own restaurant, to boot.

360
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,750
Oh, hey, you'll have
to come eat there some time.

361
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,625
It'll be on the house.

362
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,875
That means so much to me!

363
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,666
[AOI]
Hmm?

364
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,625
Master, what are you doing here?

365
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,833
Welcome back, Aoi. Oh, my.

366
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,750
You look lovely.

367
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,375
Jeez, how did you
get into my room?

368
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,166
I just thought we could
share it, sleep together.

369
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,083
Yeah, I don't think so.

--[MASTER sniffs]
--Hey.

What're you doing?

372
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,250
I thought I smelled
sweet summer citrus.

373
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,958
Have you been to the baths?

374
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,166
I have. Shizuna used an
enchantment in the water!

375
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,375
She is quite
a talented caretaker.

376
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,416
Her abilities are exceptional.

377
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Many of our guests
delight in her.

378

They come to Tenjin-ya to enjoy
special enchantment techniques.

Oh, wow.

00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,458
And he hasn't
even eaten yet! So...

381
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,208
...you know he must be tired.

382
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,000
Perhaps we should
just let him sleep?

383
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,958
Done!

What a lovely, seasonal menu!

Those are dishes
our Chief Chef

395
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,958
has guarded for years.
So, let the feasting begin.

Yeah!

--[AOI] Uh...

[MASTER scoffs]

403

Look, I don't think one
sip of a Kabosu cocktail

404
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,416
could lead to anything
too dangerous.

Anyway, in the event
that something did,

Good. It's easier to drink
than I had thought.

are delicious.

It's lightly sweet,
and very tasty!

This dish is our
corn tempura.

The Chief Chef takes great pride
in that creation.

[AOI] I'm impressed that he can
make tempura from the kernels!

And he doesn't even
pop them, either!

424
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,791
Do you think he'd teach me
how he does it?

425
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,708
Perhaps.

426
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,875
It wouldn't hurt for you to ask.

But don't be surprised
if he says it's a trade secret.

[KIKUNO] And here we have
the sashimi du jour.

Wow. They're so pretty!

how the Chief Chef made them.

So, did you
enjoy the meal, Aoi?

Yeah. I can tell the Chief
Chef takes great care

to let other people
cook for me more.

It's such a great way
to expand my horizons

and get ideas
for new dishes.

I feel so inspired to get back
to Moonflower and cook!

As usual, you don't
hide your feelings.

this chance to eat with you.

Does that mean
you're going to miss me?

I won't. Not really.

And after the delightful meal
we just shared, too.

It's only dinner,
it doesn't mean I'll miss you.

take it easy, if you like.

483
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,875
No, it's fine. I'll go.

484
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,250
I mean, I am an official
employee of Tenjin-ya,

485
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,458
after all.

486
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
That's true.

487
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,541
All right, Ginji,
I leave Tenjin-ya

488
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,166
in the care of
your capable hands.

489
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,166
Yes. I'll do my best.

490
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,250
[MASTER]
Aoi, I'm going now.

491
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,208
Try not to do anything reckless.

492
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,750
I'll do my best.

493
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,958
And also...

494
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,375
Take care of everyone here.

495
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,500
Huh? Sure.

496
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,500
Hey, Master!

497
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,750
When you get back, I'll cook
something for you, 'kay?

498
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,666
So, be thinking about
what you want to eat

499
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,791
and I'll make it.

500
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,791
[sighs]

501
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,000
[GINJI] Looks like they made
it across Iwato just fine.

502
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,500
So, Ginji?

503
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,458
How long do you think the
Master'll be away on this trip?

504
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,916
Five or six days,
I think, give or take.

505
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,833
It's going to be that long?

506
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,333
[GINJI]
Why, will you miss him?

507
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,916
Huh? What?

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,583
No, I'm just curious.

509
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,208
And I imagine that things can
get rough when he's not here.

510
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh, Aoi.

511
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,500
You're not being honest
with yourself.

512
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,583
Come on, like I said,
I was just--

513
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,083
[CHIAKI screams]
Oh, no! Ah, Young Master!

514
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

515
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,625
We have a problem.

516
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,458
I just saw him,
that awful man is here!

517
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,458
What "awful man"?

518
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,750
It's Hatori.

519
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,833
Orio-ya's front desk manager!

520
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,208
[grunts]

521
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,208
Orio-ya?

522
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,166
[barks]

523
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,833
[CHIBI] A bunch of
dangerous-looking <i>ayakashi</i>

524
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,958
just showed up!
And what's with that dog?

525
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:53,958
--He scares me!
--[dog barks]

526
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,500
[CHIBI whines]
It's licking me!

527
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,125
Please don't eat me!
