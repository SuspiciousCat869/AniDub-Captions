160
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,250
My dear...

161
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,666
You're family.

162
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,083
And you should be together.

163
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,666
Sasara. I'm sorry.

164
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,625
Forgive me, Hatori.

165
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,166
[AOI]
Master Matsuba...

166
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,375
Aoi?

167
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,875
Since you and Hatori
had that awful fight,

168
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,166
I wanted to make sure
you were doing okay.

169
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,125
I hope that's all
right with you.

170
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,625
I see. Of course it is.

171
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,125
Were you having a bad dream?

172
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,125
You were talking in your sleep.

173
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,458
I still remember,
all these years later.

174
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,000
What she said to me
just before she died.

175
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:44,166
Do you mean your wife?
What exactly did she say?

176
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,458
She told me that family should
always to be together.

177
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,500
So...

178
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,333
Oh, I see.

179
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,666
[sighs]

180
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,250
Did Hatori ask you to
come here, by any chance?

181
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,125
No, it was Orio-ya's staff.

182
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,166
Of course. They sent
you to persuade me,

183
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,250
but that's just
too bad, won't work.

184
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,416
That liquor is a treasure
that's been guarded

185
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
by tengu leaders
for generations,

186
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,708
and I am forbidden from
letting it leave our clan.

187
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,666
We shall be returning
to Mount Shumon

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,416
early tomorrow afternoon.
I'm so sorry, Aoi.

189
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,083
Don't apologize for that.

190
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,583
I'm not an Orio-ya
employee or anything.

191
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,541
This fight between you
and Hatori's different.

192
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,916
[MATSUBA]
Hm?

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,250
Look, I know that I'm meddling.

194
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,250
But, he told me
how it all began.

195
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,708
You were an incredibly bossy
husband, weren't you?

196
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,083
Be honest now.

197
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,041
I don't even know what to say.

198
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,958
She was always such
a loving, kind wife.

199
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,500
Think about this.

200
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,333
Do you believe Sasara would
want things to stay this way?

201
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,625
I think that would
make her feel sad.

202
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,625
I'm not saying you
have to make up,

203
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
'cause that isn't
always possible.

204
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,625
Some bonds can't be repaired,

205
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,875
even if they're between
a parent and a child.

206
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,000
Aoi?

207
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,458
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
Don't worry about me.

209
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,875
You two can heal this.
I know it, so please try.

210
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,625
You are a kind girl.
Thanks, Aoi.

211
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,750
I think you're kind.

212
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,250
I wonder...

213
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,791
How can I help them
to reconcile?

214
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,250
[AOI]
A mother's cooking.

215
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,833
My mother didn't do that for me.

216
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,875
[AOI]
Uh?! Oh, Ginji?

217
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,375
[AOI] Ginji always works hard,
and this event is no exception.

218
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,708
[AOI laughs]
I have to do my best, too.

219
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,583
[CHIBI]
Flap, flap, flap, flap!

220
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,875
Flap, flap, flap, flap!

221
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,583
[AOI] What's that?
Oh, Hatori forgot his book.

222
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,625
Uh?

223
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,000
[AOI]
That woman must be Sasara.

224
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,708
She's pretty and has
such a kind face.

225
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,833
[AOI]
Poor Hatori.

226
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,333
This picture's all
he has left of her.

227
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,250
When Matsuba ate the <i>gameni,</i>

228
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,750
he got mad because
it tasted different.

229
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,875
I have a hunch about why
that may have been.

230
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,000
They'll be fine.

231
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,458
Their bond isn't
completely severed.

232
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,000
I just know they
can make things right.

233
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
[AOI]
Amazing! It's all fixed.

234
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,333
Well, except the ceiling.

235
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,333
Hi, missy, what's up?
Thanks for the food last night.

236
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,083
You're welcome! Are you
feeling any better today?

237
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,791
Yeah, all because of you.

238
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:31,541
Listen, your father... He's
leaving this afternoon, he says.

239
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,083
Yeah. I heard the
same story earlier.

240
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,958
He just won't budge.
He's stubborn.

241
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,458
There's hope. I've got a
plan that might sell him.

242
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,833
Uh? What plan?

243
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,791
Oh! Master, it's you!

244
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,250
I'm so glad! I've been
wanting to see you!

245
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,750
Heh! Is that so?

246
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,500
Well, same here. Hello.

247
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,625
The thing is, I have
a favor to ask.

248
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
What is it?

249
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,250
There's this dish
that I wanna serve

250
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,833
to Hatori and Master Matsuba,

251
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,458
and I thought you
could be my sous chef.

252
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,500
[gasps]

253
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,666
Right. I guess that
is overstepping.

254
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,125
--You'll have me?
--What?

255
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,208
I have always dreamed
the day might come

256
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,125
when you would ask me
to help you cook.

257
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,916
It made me so jealous
that Ginji got that honor.

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,791
I had no idea! So,
it's okay to request it?

259
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,291
Absolutely!

260
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,958
I'd become fish peddler all
over again for this chance!

261
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,208
Now. I'll have Sasuke bring up
the ingredients immediately.

262
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,250
So, what would you
like me to do first?

263
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,875
Yeah, actually, we're not
gonna be cooking in here.

264
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,208
Oh?

265
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,916
Uh. Wow.

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,041
You really look like
a wingless tengu!

267
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,541
How does it suit me?

268
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,833
Great. I think that you
wear that quite well.

269
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,125
[MASTER] Thanks.
This is a good idea, Aoi.

270
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,333
Even if something goes awry,
since we're out here,

271
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,375
it won't cause
trouble for Orio-ya.

272
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,708
Yep. I wanted to do
this in a location

273
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,208
that would force them
to face each other.

274
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,625
We've got all the
ingredients. Now, then.

make an ogre an ogre!

Very well. They'll grow
back... soon. It's fine.

00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,958
[AOI] So, this is what
we're going to cook.

282
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,833
Chicken and rice, dumpling soup,

283
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,791
and two different
kinds of <i>gameni.</i>

284
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,291
Two kinds?

285
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,416
Yep. I think that's the key
that will help them make up.

286
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,666
Oh.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,583
Great! Now the <i>gameni.</i> [laughs]

For real. I can't believe
you made me come out here.

You're pretty bold, Missy.
That's for sure.

The ship's casting off.

That means we'd better hurry
or it's going to be too late.

You're right. We're close.

But why have you
prepared two kinds of it?

Just wait. For now,
go ahead and eat.

[gasps]

320
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,666
So how are they?

321
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
Well...

322
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,916
This <i>gameni</i> here tasted
similar to the one I'm used to.

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,458
Like mother used to make.

324
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,916
And to me, the other batch had
a much more familiar flavor.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,333
It tasted just like the one
my mom used to make

326
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,625
back in the day.

327
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,125
Of course, both versions
tasted great!

328
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,500
So, what's the secret?

329
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,625
What made these two batches
taste different, Missy?

330
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,500
Can you say?

331
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,583
Yeah.

332
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,833
I made this one using
bone-in chicken,

333
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,791
and this one was
made with boneless.

334
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,791
Bone-in?

335
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,291
And boneless?

336
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,958
Right. I had a
sneaking suspicion

337
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,458
involving the chicken broth, and
what made Matsuba dislike it.

338
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,708
Bone-in chicken broth tastes
slightly different than

339
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,083
boneless broth, and that
led me to another thought.

340
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,541
Which was this...

341
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,708
[gasps]

342
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,583
Sasara's plan, was to use
Matsuba's mom's bone-in recipe,

343
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,625
but she intentionally
made her <i>gameni</i>

344
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,000
with boneless broth instead.

345
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,041
[BOTH]
Huh?

346
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
But why?

347
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,625
Because, if you have
active children

348
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,083
and a busy husband, you might
be worried about them

349
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,041
choking on the
little chicken bones.

350
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,541
Just to be safe, you'd choose
the broth with boneless chicken.

351
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,125

I was jealous of you two,

I was left alone

You see, she was raised
by her grandfather, Shiro.

I guess she didn't have
a bond with her mother.

392
