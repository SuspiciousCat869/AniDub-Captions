1
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,125
[MASTER] And this building
where you find yourself

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,125
is known as Tenjin-ya.

3
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,416
Now why won't you
just give in and agree

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,625
to be my bride?

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,250
I'll stay and work
till it's paid--

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,083
that settles the debt,
but I won't have to marry you.

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,833
How would you like to
open your own restaurant here?

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,875
My name is Matsuba.

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,875
Master Matsuba.

10
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,958
You're a great cook.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,416
And so, sweet Aoi.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,125
I would like you
to take this gift.

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,541
[MASTER] It's not going to be
an easy task.

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,083
A human has never run
a restaurant for <i>ayakashi</i>

15
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,708
in the hidden realm before.

16
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,125
Very well, then.
You can give it a try.

17
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,208
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI]
What do you wish me to do?

18
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,791
Say my name.
I wish to hear my name.

19
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,166
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI]
Aoi.

20
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,250
[gasps, giggles]

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,166
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI] Do you
have another wish, perhaps?

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,875
I'm very hungry,

23
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,750
and all I want
is my mom's curry and rice.

24
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,541
[MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI]
This wish is difficult to grant.

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,958
But...

26
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,000
[AOI]
Gorgeous!

27
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,416
I didn't know
the Hidden Realm

28
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,291
had this much nature!

29
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,125
Yes, we have a variety
of environments here.

30
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,750
It must be big.

31
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,375
Tenjin-ya is located
at the Northeast end.

32
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,666
It's called the, "Ogre gate."

33
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,458
I see.

34
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,875
[MASTER]
The capital is surrounded

35
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,708
by eight lands
called the Hachiyo,

36
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,083
or "eight leaves."

37
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,166
The <i>ayakashi</i> who rule
each of these lands

38
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,208
also carry the title of Hachiyo.

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,125
Is Master Matsuba one of those?

40
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,916
Indeed, he rules
the land called Mt. Shumon.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,125
Wow.

42
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,541
You did a great job
with Master Matsuba.

43
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,666
Your cooking protected
Tenjin-ya from great dishonor,

44
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,750
and for that,
you deserve a reward.

45
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,916
I do?

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,375
[UME, TAKE, MATSU]
Yeah, come on, Miss Aoi!

47
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,583
Ah! You scared me,
don't sneak up!

48
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,875
[MATSU]
Let us do your hair!

49
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,833
[TAKE]
Let us do your face, too!

50
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,291
[UME]
Let us get you dressed up!

51
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,583
[AOI] Whoa. I gotta say,
I wouldn't have

52
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,333
picked this one out
for myself, but I love it!

53
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,625
[MATSU]
It's so beautiful!

54
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,333
The master chose this kimono
especially for you!

55
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,291
What? Why would choosing
my clothes interest him?

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,208
[TAKE] If that coquettish
young hostess sees it,

57
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,125
I bet she'll be green with envy!

58
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,583
Wait, the young hostess?

59
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,750
[UME] Yes, she's head over heels
in love with the master.

60
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,958
[TAKE] She's even told most of
the staff at Tenjin-ya

61
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,750
that she's his mistress!
Can you believe it?

62
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,916
[MATSU]
Stop it!

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,875
You're spreading gossip,
true as it may be.

64
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,791
[UME, TAKE]
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,000
[AOI laughs nervously]

66
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,166
[MASTER]
Oh. Just as I thought,

67
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,041
the red camellias look
lovely on you.

68
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm delighted to see
you like it, too, Aoi.

69
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,541
Um, yeah, I do like it.
It's so beautiful.

70
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,166
Thanks so much.

71
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,916
Now, final touch.

72
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
My, you wear it
incredibly well.

73
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,375
Wait. Doesn't the bud
seem bigger to you?

74
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,916
[MASTER]
It's made of rose quartz,

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,166
but it's enchanted to grow
like a real flower.

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
Soon, it will become
a full camellia blossom.

77
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,500
You mean it's gonna bloom?

78
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,833
Yes, and fall off one day,
just like a real flower.

79
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,375
[AOI]
What? It'll fall?

80
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,416
But, no then it's not gonna
be pretty anymore.

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,666
[MASTER chuckles]

82
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,833
[Aoi grumbles]

83
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,625
You must pay
your grandfather's debt

84
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,416
before the bloom falls
from its setting.

85
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,833
Now, you have your deadline.

86
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,833
Good luck.

87
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,916
[AOI grumbles]

[ATTENDANTS laugh]

00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,791
Come, we're expected
to arrive soon.

90
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,250
Where to?

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,541
[AOI] It's unbelievable!
What is this place?

92
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,833
[MASTER] This is the capital
of the hidden realm.

93
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,083
It's called Youto.

94
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,500
Youto?

95
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,250
Right. It translates to,
" <i>ayakashi</i> capital."

96
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,500
The <i>ayakashi</i> king resides here.

[MAN 3A] Look! Tenjin-ya's
Master Innkeeper!

100
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,958
[MAN 3B] Such a fine ogre,
if I do say so!

00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,083
You're famous here,
aren't you?

102
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,666
I am, but listen, Aoi.

103
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,458
You must keep your mask on,

104
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,833
or they'll know you're human
and you'll be in danger.

105
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah, duh, I know that.

106
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,208
[AOI] It seems like
there's a festival going on.

107
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,958
[MASTER]
It's called Youto cut glass.

108
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,708
That name does make sense.

109
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,333
It's made using
a technique

110
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,541
from the apparent realm,

111
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,958
but we modified it,
so our method's unique.

112
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,250
Ah, well it sure is pretty.

113
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,500
This pink bowl
strikes your fancy?

114
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,625
I'll buy it for you.

What? No, it's okay!

Oh. Don't be shy.

117
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,666
I'm not. But they say
everything comes at a price,

118
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,750
"Oh." What?

to a tasty meal right now?

the offal hot pot

If I had to choose,

134
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,291
I'd probably say it's
the blood entrails

of a young human girl.

Is he in the hidden realm
with you?

Uh, my grandfather is--

When I got to

I was commanded
to marry into Yahata-ya.

she's our front desk

I am under the impression

that Suzuran
doesn't even like you.

283
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,708
So this idea of forcing her
to marry you,

00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,708

on your part, wouldn't you say?

00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,250
I would've-- I would've--
Oh, Brother!

320
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,416
[sobbing]

321
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,250
What? What happened to you?

322
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,916
Breathe!

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,583
[HOSTESS]
O-Ryo!

324
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,375
[HOSTESS]
Where've you been?

325
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,125
You disappeared
without permission--

326
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,791
at a very busy time!

327
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,708
[O-RYO] I know.
I'm incredibly sorry, Mistress.

328
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,416
This behavior's intolerable.

329
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,208
I assumed you had
great potential,

330
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,291
which is why I recommended
that you become young hostess.

331
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,250
And yet you repay my kindness
by disgracing me?

332
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,458
Um, I was just-- I was--

333
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,416
O-Ryo, I commanded you

334
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,833
to look after
Tenjin-ya while I was gone.

335
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,958
Why did you choose
to disobey me?

336
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,625
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

337
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,041
I was very worried
about you, Master.

338
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,166
Enough. Your sweet, repentant
act won't work on me this time.

339
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,375
I saw what you did to Aoi.

340
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,625
[gasps]

341
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,250
It appears you're still

342
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,208
far too immature
to be young hostess.

343
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,541
[O-RYO cries]

344
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,208
[MASTER] I order you to be
confined to your room,

345
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,291
until your punishment
is decided.

346
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,375
[O-RYO cries]

347
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,833
[AOI]
I still can't believe

348
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,958
how relaxed
this place makes me!

349
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,375
[GINJI]
Welcome back, Chef Aoi.

350
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,541
How did you enjoy
your trip to Youto?

351
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,375
Tell me, were you able
to have a good time

352
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,625
taking in all the sights
there with the Master?

353
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,583
Did I "have a good time"?

354
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,000
U-Um, the whole trip
was chaos, honestly.

355
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh?

356
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,500
[GINJI]
I see what you mean.

357
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,625
You certainly had
your hands full!

358
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,916
All right, what is all of this?

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,875
Well, I figured we should
start planning the menu

360
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,041
for your new restaurant.
These will help us brainstorm.

361
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,208
Oh, good call.

362
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,041
We have to come up
with a wide variety

363
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,833
of dishes to appeal
to all kinds of <i>ayakashi.</i>

364
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,125
Here. I want you to try this.

365
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,666
Is it alcohol?

366
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,125
[GINJI]
No, it's fruit juice.

367
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
Delicious! It's sweet
cherry juice, right?

368
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,250
Cherries that have been simmered
with a bit of sugar mixed in.

369
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,583
You're exactly right.

370
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,208
We're in
a cherry-growing district.

371
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,041
This is one of the most popular
items in our gift shop,

372
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,833
but some of the bottle labels
got messed up

373
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,291
in the fight with the tengu,

374
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,666
so I asked if we could have
some of the damaged ones.

375
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,208
Spectacular! I'd like to make
some kind of dessert using this.

376
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,875
Yes. Great!

377
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,916
I wonder what else we can
put on our new menu.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
The dishes served
in the main building

379
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,375
are all more traditional fare.

380
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,625
So in our place, let's focus on
dishes from the apparent realm.

381
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,500
Ones mostly still unknown
to us here in the hidden realm.

382
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,000
Uh, you'll have to help me
learn what those are.

383
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,291
Right. The rice omelette
you made me, for example.

384
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,041
I know it'd be a hit!

385
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
I'm happy you liked it.

386
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,541
Anything else you can think of?

387
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,416
Let me see...

388
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,041
Well, curry and rice, maybe?

389
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,458
I know that dish
is your favorite.

390
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,166
Curry, huh?
We could add a little fruit

391
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,666
to make it sweet enough
for the <i>ayakashi</i> palate.

392
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,291
Good idea! I can't wait
to help experiment!

393
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,208
All right, I'd better get back
to my official work now.

394
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,666
Ginji, thank you
for all your help.

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,166
Heh.

396
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,875
He's really into all this.

397
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,208
Hold on. How did Ginji even
know I liked curry and rice.

398
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,208
That's odd.

399
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,958
[KASUGA]
Hey! Miss Aoi!

400
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,791
[AOI]
Kasuga? Hey. What's going on?

401
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,291
[KASUGA]
Miss O-Ryo collapsed!

402
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,875
[CHIBI] The hidden realm can
be just as tough a place

403
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,375
as the apparent realm, huh?

404
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,791
But it's okay, don't worry!

405
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,208
I bet if you give the Snow Woman
some cucumber pieces,

406
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,791
she'll be your friend too!
