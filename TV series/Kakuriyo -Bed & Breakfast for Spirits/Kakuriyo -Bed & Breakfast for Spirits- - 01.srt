When I was a very young girl,

12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,166
an <i>ayakashi</i> saved my life.

I'll never forget that.

I was shocked by its kindness,

Some of these are dangerous

Nothing is permanent, though.

I could get by day-to-day,
at least.

here at Tenjin-ya,

which sent him deep into debt.

So, we struck a deal.

If he couldn't pay me back,

he'd give me his granddaughter
in marriage in place of payment.

Thus, to put it indelicately,
you are his collateral.

the "Torture in Hell" treatment.

Huh? "Torture in Hell"?

Uh, no thanks.

This is the hot water torture.

<i>Ayakashi</i> are weird.

177
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,791
[MASTER] So, how are you
liking Tenjin-ya?

178
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,875
My, you look
breathtakingly beautiful

179
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,666
in our inn's signature yukata,
my lovely wife-to-be.

180
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm not your wife-to-be.

181
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,791
So, you still refuse
to accept my proposal?

182
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,416
Ugh, my grandpa's gone now,

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,291
can't you just forgive the debt
and find someone else?

[gasps]

185
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,041
When we eat human girls

186
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,083
who possess strong
spiritual powers,

187
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,125
they taste
the most delicious. So...

188
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,666
Eat me?

189
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,583
You'd taste like a delicacy,
so you're special.

190
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,791
You're dear to me,
so I cannot eat you.

191
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,791
Thus, you're forbidden
and tempting,

192
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,291
which makes me want
to eat you even more.

193
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,958
But, I cannot do it.

194
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,333
It's said that this dilemma

195
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,333
can be the most exhilarating
pleasure of them all.

On top of all that,

you just happen to be
Shiro's granddaughter.

199

He's a very famous human
among the <i>ayakashi,</i> you know.

200
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,958
That fact alone
makes you valuable,

even without
your beauty and power.

202
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,833
Why is he famous?

203

You'll find out soon.

204
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,083
Now...

...why not give in
and agree to be my bride?

206

How much is it?

207

[MASTER]
Hmm?

208
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,958
The debt that Grandpa owed.

209
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,125
Well, let's see. All told,

210
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,375
it's about 1,000,000 yen.

211
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,708
Huh?

212
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
Let me pay it back.

213
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,875
I can just work it off.

214
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,875
[Master]
Hmm...

215
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,708
I'll stay and work
till it's paid.

216
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,500
That settles the debt,
but I won't have to marry you.

217
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,666
That's not even possible.

[AOI] You don't know that,
just let me try!

219
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,750
Plus, none of your employees
want you to marry me, either.

220
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,583
So, why don't we make
a compromise?

221
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,625
Or, at least, think it over.

222
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,166
Well, this is quite interesting.

223
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,833
A human, trying to
negotiate with me?

224
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,958
You arrogant brat.

[whimpers]

226
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,208
I'll permit you to attempt to
find a job here at Tenjin-ya.

227
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,000
But, if that's the case,
and you get hired,

228
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,750
then you'll be treated
as an employee,

229
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,291
not my bride-to-be.

230
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,916
So, you won't be allowed
to stay in a guest room,

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or get the benefit
of my protection.

232
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,708
Furthermore, you'll lose
your right to complain.

233
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,333
Even if someone around
here devours you.

234
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,583
You're showing your
true colors now, Ogre!

235
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,875
[MASTER] Don't blame me
for the bargain you struck.

Eating is essential,

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,041
for both humans and <i>ayakashi.</i>

239
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,166
When <i>ayakashi</i> get too hungry,

240
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,250
sometimes it can lead them
to prey on people.

Someone like you,

who has strong spiritual power,

243
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,250
is more likely to be targeted.

244
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
If that happens,

245
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,541

[AOI] Grandpa was irresponsible
in a lot of ways,

I'm the nine-tailed fox, Ginji,

Hi, Ginji.

Wait, so if you're
the young master,

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,791
you're the other master's son?

Huh? No, that's not
how it works.

The master and I are
relatively close in age.

And I can take nine

Yeah!

less likely to scare you

if I showed up
to introduce myself like this.

preferred my female form.

I'm glad to hear that!

I'm sure you have

about marrying
someone you don't know,

He's stoic and ruthless,

he's got an enormous

Everyone on staff adores
working for him.

And he also happens to be
one of the most powerful

The answer is no.

I'm honestly offended that

I guess finding a job
is hopeless.

So, what brought you here?

375
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,208
This place is kind of
off the beaten path.

376
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,291
I stumbled upon it
in my futile job search.

I see.

378
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,083
This is some kind of
restaurant, isn't it?

379
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,750
Yeah, or it used to be.

380
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,583
It was a restaurant until about
two days ago, but it closed.

The building is going to be
torn down soon, sadly.

But, why did it close?

00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,125
It seems like a nice place.

385
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, you'd think that,

00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,583
but it's had nothing
but lousy luck.

387
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,125
No matter what, nothing seems
to thrive in this location.

Teahouse.

The little restaurant.

392
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,583
It doesn't matter.

393
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,750
They've all failed miserably.

394
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,500
I believed it would be different
with the restaurant, honestly.

395
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,208
Since the guests always say
they get tired of the fancy,

396
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,083
rich food that the kitchen
in the main building prepares.

397

But, that didn't work, either.

Even though I tried
everything I could

to entice the guests
to come in.

Entice them? Uh...

were a bad choice.

everything that's still usable

to the kitchen staff
over in the main building.

an appetite?

for me last night, after all.

teach me all his secrets.
