[HATORI]
Hello?

2
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,916
Is it a Tenjin-ya policy

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,333
to make guests wait in
the lobby for an eternity?

4
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,250
[GINJI]
Orio-ya...

5
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,125
My most sincere apologies.

6
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,708
[TOKIHIKO] It's our own
fault for showing up

7
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,166
without a reservation like this.

8
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,750
There's nothing the front
desk manager can do for us.

9
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,500
At any rate, Akatsuki,

10
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,458
it's hilarious that
you're front desk manager.

11
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,958
Did you forget you're the one

12
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,333
who appointed me to this
position when you left?

13
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,250
Please wait just a moment, sir.

14
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,375
Heh!

15
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,416
Ah!

16
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,750
Hey, Ginji, it's been forever!

17
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,791
You traitor to Orio-ya.

18
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,125
[grunts]

19
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,083
[AOI] I guess he and Ginji
know each other?

20
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,458
[KASUGA]
Yeah.

21
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,791
Ginji used to work at Orio-ya
before coming here.

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,375
I didn't know that.

23
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,875
We regret having to
turn you away, sir.

24
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,041
But, unfortunately, our inn
is fully booked at this time.

25
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,250
It's been a while,
so I was looking forward to it.

26
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,458
What a shame.

27
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,583
Hatori.

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,000
It's out of their hands.

29
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,375
Reservations are a must
during the busy season.

30
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,583
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,375
I'm very sorry.

32
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,458
[HATORI] Are you sure there's
no way to accommodate us?

33
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,375
[AOI] I could let them
have the room I'm in.

34
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,458
[gasps]

35
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,291
It's not like
I really need it.

36
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,166
I can sleep in Moonflower.

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,000
I've already enjoyed everything
I've wanted to anyway.

38
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,750
Aoi, there's no need.

39
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,833
We got lucky, Mister Nobu!

40
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,750
Say hello to the sweet lady,
now, like a good doggie.

41
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,708
[barks]

42
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,333
[laughs]

43
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,375
Ginji.

44
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm glad to see you
looking so well.

45
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,708
But usually, the master
comes out to greet us.

46
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,208
Is he away at the moment?

47
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,583
Yes, he is.

48
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,375
And, uh, the bath caretaker?

49
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,791
Shizuna?

50
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,333
Never mind, forget it.

51
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,166
Hatori, let's go visit
the hot springs first.

52
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,541
Hmph!

53
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,833
Uh...

54
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,166
Looks like we've taken
on some unwelcome guests.

55
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,583
Damn right.

56
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,000
That's Hatori, a tengu,

57
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,250
and the front desk manager
at Orio-ya.

58
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,416
His cohort, Tokihiko, is the
chief bath caretaker there.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Ah, right.

60
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,916
[AKATSUKI]
Back to work, everybody!

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,250
[EMPLOYEES]
Yes, sir!

62
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,208
And I'm sleeping at work!

63
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,500
Now I'm here
and I can't sleep.

64
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,958
Guess I could make
myself useful.

65
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,375
[CHIBI crying]

66
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,750
Uh, what's the matter?

67
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,083
[SYSTEM]
You've got mail!

68
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
You've got mail!

69
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,750
[AOI]
Quit screaming!

70
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,583
I wonder if that means
I've got a message

71
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,583
from the master on this thing.

72
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,416
Is he already
in the apparent realm?

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,125
--[chiming]
--[AOI gasps]

74
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,291
[MASTER] They said you gave up
your room to the guests

75
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,666
from Orio-ya.

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,541
Yeah, it was probably
a good choice.

77
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,166
I wanted to cook
at Moonflower, anyway.

78
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,583
[MASTER] If you want me to bring
you something from here,

79
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,875
let me know.

80
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,041
What do I need
from that realm?

81
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,166
Huh.

82
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,833
I'll have to think about it.

83
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,666
[TOKIHIKO]
But why not, Shizuna?

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,875
After all this time!

85
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,541
Will you please
just let me go?

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,791
Excuse me,
what's going on here?

87
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,166
This is none of your
concern, don't interrupt, human.

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,083
I came to get Shizuna, and
that's between her and myself.

89
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,083
[gasps] But, that's--

90

Hear me out!

96
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,583
[SHIZUNA]
Tokihiko is a shiranui,

97
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,166
an <i>ayakashi</i> who possesses
the highest grade of fire

98
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,416
in this realm.

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,250
He's a great <i>yokai</i>
and my teacher,

100
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
who took me in and
looked after me.

101
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,291
So he's your mentor?
Career-wise?

102
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,750
That's right.

103
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,250
Now he wants me to come back
to Orio-ya and work there.

104
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,708
He says he never wanted me
to leave to begin with.

105
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,125
Huh. In that case,

106
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,083
are you planning to go
back there and work with him?

107
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,291
Oh, no, ma'am.

108
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,458
I have no intention
of leaving Tenjin-ya.

109
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,875
I want to work here.

110
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,166
I owe the master so much
for taking me in,

111
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,583
and I have my own apprentice
to think of, as well.

112
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,458
[AOI]
Ah, Kazune, right.

113
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,875
I get that Tokihiko
was your teacher,

114
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,625
but, um, still,

115
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,833
don't you hate him
for barging in

116
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,333
and putting you on the spot?

117
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,583
No. I could never hate him!

118
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,375
Sometimes he comes off
as serious

119
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,375
and a little extreme
in the way he expresses himself.

120
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:15,166
He's very overprotective
and persistent.

121
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,833
He misunderstands
things easily,

122
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,875
and then he gets
his feelings hurt.

123
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,291
If I'm perfectly honest,

124
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,041
he can be a gloomy pain
in the neck most of the time.

125
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,916
But I've always felt
close to him.

--[gasps]
--Huh?

127
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
No. Not like that.

128
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,583
Not like what?

129
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,416
After all.

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,708
I'm just a nure-onna with
no real redeeming qualities,

131
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,041
born in a poor, mountainous
part of the southern land.

132
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,166
But Tokihiko rescued me.

133
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,708
He brought me up strictly

134
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,833
but always cared for me well.

135
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,250
[SHIZUNA] I'm grateful
for his influence,

136
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,958
and I know he changed
my fate for the better.

137
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,083
[SHIZUNA] Tenjin-ya has
the best hot springs

138
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,416
in the hidden realm,

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
and in order to compete
with them,

140
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,875
Orio-ya spent
a great deal of money

141
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,375
to find new sources.

142
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,000
Motivated by the desire
to help my teacher,

143
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,583
I searched all over for unknown
thermal spring veins,

144
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,750
until one day,

145
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,541
I finally found a new source.

146
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,208
But it was in a
forbidden place, full of magic,

147
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,416
where we weren't supposed
to be digging.

No, Teacher!

152

[SHIZUNA] My teacher shielded me
from the demon,

153
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,083
and in doing so,
was injured

154
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,666
in a way that
scarred him for life.

155
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,208
That blue flame
at his forehead

156
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,708
is the visible manifestation

157
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,958
of his power continually
leaking from the scar.

158
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,583
Since I caused such a
great loss for Orio-ya,

159
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,291
they decided to terminate
my employment.

160

Master Tokihiko
defended me

to forgive myself.

[footsteps]

164
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,333
[SHIZUNA]
Then one day,

165
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,208
the master of Tenjin-ya
found me and took me in.

166
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,666
It's been a long time
since I enjoyed a hot meal

167
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,375
that someone prepared
just for me!

168
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,208
Oh, I almost forgot this.

169
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,250
Thanks for lending it to me.

170
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,666
[SHIZUNA]
You're welcome.

171
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,500
This is the first thing
my teacher ever gave to me

172
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,958
not long after I met him.

173
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,500
Hi, teacher!

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,666
[SHIZUNA]
While I was in training,

175
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,000
he used to tie my hair back
with this string,

176
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,333
so it's special to me.

177
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,625
I can tell how much you
adore Tokihiko,

178
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,541
so why don't you go back
to be with him?

179
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,791
I guess...

180
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,833
I don't quite feel
I've paid my penance yet.

181
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,625
But I think I will soon.

182
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,416
I've decided to work hard here
at Tenjin-ya until that day.

183
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,875
The master told me
something interesting.

184
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,166
He said that
a lot of the people

185
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
who come to this inn
regularly say

186
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,333
that your baths
are a major draw for them.

187
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,583
[gasps]

188
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,125
[AOI] People are so impressed
with your work

189
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,666
that they're raving about it.

190
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,166
Honestly, I'm a little
jealous of that!

191
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,166
[chuckles]

192
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,750
[AOI]
Here you go.

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,041
What's this?

194
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,208
[AOI]
It's a dessert called sorbet.

195
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,791
Red eggplants?

196
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,666
That's a new one!

197
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,958
Is that what you call tomatoes
in the hidden realm?

198
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,708
[SHIZUNA]
This is so tasty!

199
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,708
My teacher loves to grow
his own produce.

200
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,041
He especially likes tending
to his red eggplants.

201
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,041
I used to dislike vegetables,

202
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,708
but over time,
as I helped him cook,

203
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,375
I came to like them
more and more.

204
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,583
Makes sense.

205
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,416
--Ah, found you at last!
--[AOI] What's up?

206
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
Emergency senior staff meeting.

207
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,416
I bet it's about those guys
from Orio-ya.

208
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,750
Oh, you're right.
Thank you, Aoi.

209
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,916
I feel a lot better now,
for some reason.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,166
Happy to hear it!

211
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,666
--[KASUGA] C'mon, hurry!
--[SHIZUNA] I am!

212
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,208
That poor girl.

213
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,375
I understand what it's like
to have complicated feelings.

214
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,916
I bet Tokihiko's
got the wrong idea.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,708
He probably just thinks
that Shizuna's rejecting him,

216
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,875
but it's not like that at all.

217
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,791
My dear.

218
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,041
[SHIZUNA]
He looked thin to me.

219
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,291
Gaunt, even.

220
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,291
Maybe it's because
of his injury.

221
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,333
Still, I'm not ready.

222
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,458
I haven't earned
the right to go back.

223
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,041
Are you okay?
You look kind of sick.

[AOI]
There must be some way

229
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,833
I can help Shizuna
and Tokihiko.

230
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,125
I'm at a loss,
I don't know what to do.

You've got mail!

[AOI] "Have you decided
what you want from here?"

235
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,375
The master can be so kind.

236
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,000
I'd like to ask you to run
some errands for me.

237
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,916
[MASTER] I hear that
"running errands"

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,750
is one of the husband's duties
in the apparent realm.

239
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,750
[AOI] I want you to bring me
some chocolate, please.

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,583
[MASTER] Would you like me
to bring any particular brand?

241

semi-sweet, baking chocolate.

242
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,041
Oh, and I also
need dry yeast,

243
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,041
baking powder, and flour.

244
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,666
[MASTER]
Good, just leave it to me.

I look forward to trying
some of your bread.

246
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,583
[AOI] I wonder whether
the master approves of me

247
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,541
as a Tenjin-ya employee.

248
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,958
If he expected something
that I wasn't doing,

249
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,916
he would tell me,
wouldn't he?

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,041
I hope so.

251

good care of everyone

I'll do my very best running
errands for you tomorrow.

I know you will.

You have a good night,
too, Master.

258
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,041
I do cook with confidence.

259
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,000
I have no doubts there.

00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,375
[AOI]
I'm glad to have learned

261
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,833
how much Shizuna and Tokihiko
like tomatoes.

262
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,833
That knowledge could
prove very useful.

No, sir. It was just
a little experiment.

It's all right.

Yes, I did.

So that dog.

00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,791
Is he a staff member
at Orio-ya?

288
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,250
Well, he functions
first and foremost

as the inn's unofficial mascot.

290

He's been there ever since
Orio-ya's inception.

His official title is
"advertising manager,"

call him "Mister Nobu."

Yeah, in the apparent realm,

snacks made from <i>okara</i>
are very popular.

00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
I'm overprotective, serious,

322
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,416
and annoyingly
persistent, too.

323
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,375
Believe me.

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Um, sir,

pull yourself together.

327
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,833
Shizuna left this
hair tie behind

328
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
when she was asked to leave.

329
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,041
I've kept it safe
this entire time.

330

[TOKIHIKO] She won't come back
to work with me ever again,

331
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,208
or so it seems.

332
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,500
I suppose I had better
return this to her.

333
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,208
[TOKIHIKO] You and Shizuna
appear to be close,

334
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,708
if I'm not mistaken.

335
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,916
Please give her that,
if you don't mind.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,333

Ugh. What should I do?

338
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,958
Aoi, is the sorbet ready yet?

339
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,208
Wait a sec.

340
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,583
Isn't this the same string

341
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,083
that you returned
to Shizuna earlier today?

342
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,250
[AOI]
It's just like it.

343
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,250
But I guess it was a pair.

344
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,666
Meaning they're two identical
strings that go together.

345
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,833
[CHIBI]
I wouldn't have guessed that.

346
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,458
[AOI] But if I do give
this one to Shizuna,

347

not speak again.

348
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,708
Hey, Shizuna.

349

Oh, hello there!

Do you have a moment?

351
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,375
[SHIZUNA]
Huh? Yes.

352
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,666
[AOI] I made something
that I'd like you to have.

353
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,583
It's called tomato ketchup.

Imagine a condiment
that has all the flavor

362
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,583
of a tasty red eggplant!

363
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,500
I want to put it on everything!

364
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,625
[AOI] Yep, and you can make
sauces with it, too.

365
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
I have a lot,
so this jar's all yours.

366
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,500
Wow, thank you!

367
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,375
And if you wouldn't mind,
could you teach me

368
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,666
how to make things
with this ketchup stuff?

369

Be happy to!

370
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,041
You love tomatoes, don't you?

371
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,375
I do, very much!

372
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,458
Do you think it's partly

373
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,416
'cause they remind you
of your teacher?

[gasps]

375
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,958
[AOI] If I teach you to cook
with ketchup,

376
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,250
it'll be my first-time cooking
with a female friend.

377
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,500
[SHIZUNA]
That's surprising!

378
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,791
[AOI]
Yeah.

379
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,000
I didn't have many friends
before I came here.

380
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,750
[AOI]
Try it with some ketchup, too.

381
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,000
[GINJI]
Okay.

382
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,416
That's great!

383
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,750
It's a wonderful complement
to the beef-wrapped okra!

384
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,125
I agree!

385
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,750
And save room, 'cause
there's tomato sorbet, too.

Ginji.

387
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,708
You've known both
Tokihiko and Shizuna

388
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,291
for a long time,
haven't you--

389
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,291
back in the days
when you worked at Orio-ya?

390
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,791
That's right.

391
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,000
But it's not like we were
especially close, or anything.

392
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,416
Why do you want to know?

393
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, she might want
to go back and work there.

394
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,375
I know she misses
her teacher a whole lot.

395
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,708
[GINJI] But she can't
go back to Orio-ya.

396
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,416
Because she caused
such a serious injury?

397
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,708
I know she still has
regrets about all that,

398
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,750
even though Tokihiko
forgave her a long time ago.

399
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,625
No, she can't return
because she was fired.

400
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,500
This isn't just a problem

401
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,916
between teacher
and student anymore.

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
She has a very strong
sense of duty,

403
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,541
and I'm sure
she feels an obligation

404
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,416
to stay at Tenjin-ya
because the master took her in.

405
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,291
So, then what is
she supposed to do?

406
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,916
[GINJI]
She's trying her best.

407
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,166
Isn't that why she's been
avoiding Tokihiko

408
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,541
altogether while he's here?

409
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,000
You might be right, but, still,

410
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,291
I don't think that's
a long-term solution.

411
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,916
I'm sorry that I couldn't
be of more help.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,791
Even though it may be futile,

413
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,833
I could never just sit
back and do nothing.

414
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,333
Because I understand
how they both must be feeling.

00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,541
You should tie
your hair back

480
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,333
if you're going
to prepare food.

481
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,125
[gasps]

482
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,833
[SHIZUNA]
Yes, sir!

483
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,458
Thank you, teacher!

484
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,541
Of course.

485
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,583
This is adorable!

486
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,041
Looks like we're ready to begin.

487
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,166
It's time to wash your hands

488
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,208
and get started rolling
those meatballs!

489
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
[AOI] Once you've rolled
all the meat,

490
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,916
then we'll sear those
to perfection on the griddle!

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,833
[SHIZUNA]
Right!

492
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,458
[sizzling]

493
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,000
[TOKIHIKO]
Done.

494
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,625
Oh, wow!

495
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,083
It's perfect!

496
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm so glad!

497
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,750
Now, let's eat some!

498
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,916
Tasty.

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,250
I've never had this before,
and yet it tastes so familiar.

500
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,416
Yes.

501
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,416
One day, I'll have
paid for my mistakes,

502
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,083
and I'll be useful again.

503
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,708
Then I can come back to you.

504
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,708
Well, you'll always
have a place you can return to.

505
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,541
So, keep working hard,
and I'll wait for you.

506
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,833
That girl is even
sharper than I thought.

507
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,958
Hmm.

508
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,791
[CHIBI] I'm glad that
sweet nure-onna

509
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,666
and her teacher
patched things up!

510
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,000
Ah! But now a tengu
has appeared?

511
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,041
This is scary!

512
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,708
Will Moonflower get torn apart?
