[PRINCESS ISO] Listen carefully
to what I tell you, Aoi Tsubaki.

This is to be my
last instruction.

For the benefit of

Hi, Princess Iso!

I don't wanna study,
it's boring!

[AOI] What frustration
they must have felt,

leaving the future
in their hands.

would come to me here!

Perhaps even for centuries.

That may be yet another
way the curse manifested.

to worry about.

Your fighting power must
have been reduced!

All because I clipped your
fingernails! I'm sorry!

I'm all right, really.
No need to worry.

Yes. But... I...

What's wrong?

I'm sorry for all
of this, Master.

I hope you're not
frightened. Are you?

That's not what's going on.

...you just got injured,
trying to save me.

But it's about more
than all that.

you surprised me.

Then you just stopped.

[sneezes]

251
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,708
We should go back now.
This place is full of miasma.

00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,750
[AOI] Poor Princess Iso. I
wonder where her remains are.

253
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,000
Probably hidden deep
within this place.

254
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,041
Indeed, which is heartbreaking
to imagine,

255
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,166
knowing her as she once was.

256
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,625
You should've heard her witty
banter with Ougon-douji.

257
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,458
[AOI] I want so badly to make
the ceremony a success.

258
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,250
And I want to restore
the relationship

259
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,708
that Ginji and Ranmaru had
when they were children.

260
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,000
Consider this. If that happens,

261
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,500
Ginji may no longer wish
to return to Moonflower.

262
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,541
But, I don't think it's
good for the two of them

263
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,500
to continue to be at odds.

264
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,166
If they keep snarling
at each other,

265
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,291
there's no way the
ceremony will succeed.

266
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,708
If they make up, things'll
go more smoothly.

267
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,083
And, I've decided...

268
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,333
[MASTER]
Mm?

269
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,291
...I'll prepare the dishes
of ocean treasure.

270
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,666
[MASTER] Well, if that's what
you wish to do, so be it.

271
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,083
Aren't you gonna
tell me it's reckless?

272
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,416
As a matter of fact,

273
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,666
I think Tenjin-ya should
give her rival inn a hand

274
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,708
behind the scenes in
this year's ceremony.

What? Master!

00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,625
We have a history with Orio-ya.

Nonetheless,
what kind of a husband

278
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,875
wouldn't support his
wife in her ambitions?

279
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,500
[AOI]
It's bizarre.

280
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,708
To think that the ogre
who kidnapped me

281
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,750
has turned out to be the one
I can count on the most.

282
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,958
Thanks. Tenjin-ya'll help a lot.

283

[MASTER]
Mm-hm.

284
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,875
I'll go back and tell
the staff our plan.

285
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,166
[AOI] I've come so far from
where I began at Orio-ya,

286
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,083
and I owe a lot of
that to the master.

The mermaid scale?

Aoi, it was incredibly reckless
of you to go there!

289
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,958
You're soaking wet, too, here.

That Ranmaru...

291
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,125
He must have goaded
you into doing it.

292
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,958
Relax, I'm fine.

293
00:15:56,041 --> 00:16:00,041
As usual, I did have help, and
people who gave me advice.

294
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,000
Right, Missy. We can talk
about all of it later.

295
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,458
Go take a bath,
you're shivering!

296
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,583
Before that, I need to
report to Ranmaru!

297
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,916
Later! Bath! Right now!

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,625
I can't believe Ranmaru, either.

299
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,750
How could he think it's okay to
send you to a place like that?

300
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,208
I'm okay, really, I promise!

were so crazy, Aoi!

me... I could have died.

I'm scared just
thinking about it!

I don't care!

How dare you send a young girl
to such a dangerous place?!

What else are you going
to put her through?!

308

[HATORI] I can't accept it
this time, either.

309
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,750
This is beyond the pale.

310
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,583
What would you have done
if she had been hurt,

311
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,833
or even worse, killed?

312
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,250
Stop this fighting, all of you!
