1
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,291
[RAIJU]
Ranmaru.

2
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,250
Enlighten me.

3
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,250
You abducted Aoi Tsubaki,
did you not?

4
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,916
So why do you allow her
to do whatever she wishes?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,625
Mistress's orders. I must obey.

6
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,625
I was commanded not to
restrain Aoi's activities.

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,541
[RAIJU]
Mm... Well, I must say,

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,208
she is quite impressive,
she got the secret liquor

9
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,750
and the rainbow umbrella,
remarkable.

10
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,458
But still, you've yet to
find the mermaid scale

11
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,875
or Hourai's gem branch,
and then there's the puzzle

12
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,666
of the dishes made
of ocean treasure.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,333
Ginji will have no
trouble acquiring

14
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,041
the mermaid scale very soon.

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,375
Oh? He's doing that.

16
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,750
You sure that's wise?

17
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,666
Ginji's been having such
a rough time lately.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,416
[RANMARU] He will get it without
fail. You mustn't worry.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
[RAIJU chuckles]

20
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,500
[RAIJU chuckles]

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,458
[HATORI]
Ranmaru!

22
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,333
Good news! We got
the secret liquor!

23
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,333
[HATORI, AOI gasp]

24
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,916
He's gone?

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,083
[HIDEYOSHI]
Yeah. Master Ranmaru went out.

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,583
He had to take care of
some important business.

27
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,791
Right, this should do.

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,958
We'll keep it safe here
until the ceremony.

29
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,000
I really wanted to have my
triumphant moment with Ranmaru.

30
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,625
[flute plays]

31
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,250
Is that a flute?

32
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,750
I'm sure it's Master Raiju.

33
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,000
He's a thunder beast ayakashi.

34
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,375
He's also a powerful noble,

35
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,583
on the same level as
Mistress Ougon-douji.

36
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,208
[AOI]
Raiju...

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,458
Oh, do you know him?

38
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,708
No, I don't think so, but...

39
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,416
Honestly, I'm scared of
thunder and lightning.

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,625
So, Missy's afraid of
something after all?

41
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,250
[AOI growls]
Of course I am!

42
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,416
[laughs]

43
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,500
Well, at any rate. You should
stay away from him.

44
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,750
[AOI]
Huh?

45
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,625
[HATORI]
He's a twisted degenerate.

46
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,416
There's not a vice in this world
that he hasn't explored.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,208
He's what you might
call a "hedonist."

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
He lives only for the moment,

49
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,750
and will be ruthless and cruel
without a second thought.

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,333
But that music, it sounds
soulful and sensitive.

51
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,041
[flute continues]

52
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,125
The granddaughter of the
notorious Shiro Tsubaki,

53
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,083
and the fiancée of
Tenjin-ya's ogre-god master.

54
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:26,000
One can't help but be
a little bit intrigued.

55
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
Fascinated, even.

56
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,666
What? Aoi, jeez!

57
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,583
You just cooked a big meal
for the tengu earlier today,

58
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,833
and now you're cooking
another giant spread?

59
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,750
[AI] Mistress Aoi,
what is that stuff?

60
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,791
[AOI] I'm making
vinegar-seared mackerel sushi

61
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,041
and pickled plum
cheese salad rolls.

62
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,208
You just sounded like
you were casting a spell!

63
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,708
Are you cooking all of that
just for your dinner?

64
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,000
Course not.

65
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,708
I thought Ginji could use
a late-night meal,

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,750
since he's been working so hard.

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,500
[CHIBI]
Oh, the nine-tailed fox?

68
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,333
Now that you mention it, we
haven't seen him in a long time.

69
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,666
Yeah, he's been busy with the
preparations for the ceremony.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,083
Ai, would you mind
searing this for me?

71
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,708
[gasps] My pleasure!

72
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,916
[yelps]

73
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,750
[gasping]

74
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,791
[AOI] That's perfect. Thanks so
much. You did a great job!

75
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,625
[AI laughs]

76
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,791
[CHIBI]
Hey, Aoi!

77
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,083
I'd like to help you cook, too!

78
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,583
And from now on, I want
to be a useful follower!

79
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,291
Don't worry about that.

80
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,041
How 'bout you just eat this?

81
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:31,541
[gasping] Oh, wow!
It's cucumber!

82
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,583
Thank you, Aoi, you're so kind!

83
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,833
Nom!

84
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,458
[AOI]
I wonder. Is Ginji back yet?

85
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,416
[NOBU barks]

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,625
Well, I see your nose
is as good as ever!

87
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,250
[NOBU barking]

88
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,750
Okay, quiet down. I can share
some of this with you.

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,791
Huh?

90
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,375
Are you telling me to
follow you? Slow down!

91
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,041
[AOI panting]

92
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,875
[AOI] What's this about?
Where are we going?!

93
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,416
[NOBU barks]

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,666
[AOI]
Uh. Hey, wait!

95
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,208
[gasps] Oh, no. Ginji!

96
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,041
[GINJI grunts]
Aoi, please.

97
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,750
[AOI]
Oh, Ginji! What happened to you?

98
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,291
[GINJI] Stay where you are!
Don't come any closer.

99
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,166
[GINJI]
It isn't safe.

100
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,250
I'm covered with toxic
impurities right now.

101
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,875
[AOI gasps]
Impurities?

102
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,166
[GINJI]
I'm drawing on the sacred power

103
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,125
that's still left in the shrine.

104
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,541
It has the ability
to purify my body.

105
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,625
So please. Don't come nearer.

106
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,041
[GINJI groaning]

107
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,208
[AOI]
Ginji, no!

108
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,333
[GINJI] Does this mean you're
not afraid of me in this form?

109
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,375
No, not at all. I couldn't
be scared of you!

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,041
You're so beautiful like this.

111
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,041
The most gorgeous
creature I've ever seen.

112
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,666
[AOI] Now, Ginji, please
open your mouth.

113
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,125
[GINJI]
Yes, of course.

114
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,875
[AOI]
Uh.

115
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,208
How's that?

116
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,333
[GINJI gasping]

117
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,666
[gasping] Thank goodness!

118
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,791
[GINJI]
Amazing. Already back to normal?

119
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,916
I don't typically heal
nearly as quickly as this.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,083
Well, I'm glad.

121
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,166
You seemed to be
in so much pain.

122
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,041
But I've gotta say, you're
looking way too skinny.

123
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,125
I know.

124
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,666
I'll be perfectly honest--

125
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,833
eating's been low on
my list of priorities.

126
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,666
[AOI] You seem so sensible,
but when work is involved,

127
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,416
you're way too willing
to neglect your health.

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,875
It's not good for you.

129
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,125
You're right.

130
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,958
You always are, though.

131
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,500
Whelp. I came prepared!

132
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,916
[GINJI] It's vinegar-seared
mackerel sushi, isn't it?

133
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,208
[GINJI] As usual, your food
sends energy throughout

134
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,750
my whole body, and especially
because this is

135
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,708
one of my most favorite dishes.

136
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,791
That makes me so happy, and
for some reason reminds me

137
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,416
of the inari sushi you made
for me when we first met.

138
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,583
I remember being so impressed!

139
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,291
Food is the best thing for
bringing back memories.

140
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,416
You're right.

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,375
Now, I can't wait to
taste these rolls.

142
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,416
Mm? Wait, is this...?

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,083
[AOI laughs]
Are you surprised?

144
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,291
I put cheese in it.

145
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,708
[GINJI]
Oh, that makes sense.

146
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,375
You have cheese because
you kept the leftovers

147
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,083
from Mistress Yodoko's
meal, right?

148
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,791
[AOI]
I sure did!

149
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,333
I guess that means you heard
about the <i>monja,</i> too, then?

150
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,416
Of course I did!

151
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,583
Wow, these really are delicious.

152
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,375
Thanks, Ginji. I love cheese.

153
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,625
Maybe the rolls can
be a new menu item.

154
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,416
At Moonflower...

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,666
Uh.

156
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,583
Of course. Good idea.

157
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,291

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,916
[AOI, GINJI laugh]

161
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,875
[snores]

162
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,625
[AOI]
Hey, Ginji?

163
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:26,250
Why were you so weak when I
found you earlier tonight?

164
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,541
Listen, Aoi.

165
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,333
How much do you know
about things here?

166
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,750
With the ceremony?

167
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,625
And the awful curse that
oppresses the southern land?

168
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,000
Hatori explained
the gist of it to me.

169
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,666
Ayakashi have been staving
off natural disasters

170
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,541
for generations with
these ceremonies,

171
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,666
and an ayakashi comes up from
the ocean every hundred years.

172
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,125
He told me about the five items
needed for this year's ceremony.

173
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,541
You've been working hard to
get one of them, haven't you?

174
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,166
Yes. What I'm looking
for is hard to find.

175
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
The mermaid scale.

176
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,041
[AOI]
That one fascinates me.

177
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
[GINJI]
Mermaids are an incredibly rare,

178
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,041
sacred kind of ayakashi.

179
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,875
Many think they've totally
died out, and others believe

180
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,041
they've crossed the ocean
into the eternal realm.

181
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,291
[AOI gasps]
What?

182
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,916
Then, how are you supposed
to get the scale?

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,416
Some are rumored to be living in
the ruins of the dragon palace.

184
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,208
[AOI]
That's where you've been going.

185
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,458
[GINJI]
Yes. It was home

186
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,916
to most of the mermaids
during ancient times.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,208
But a formidable curse
that clings to ayakashi

188
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,416
has settled there,
among the ruins.

189
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,375
Its miasma weakens my kind,

190
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,583
even if we're only in
there for a short time.

191
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,083
And you went to such
a dangerous place?

192
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,458
For the past several
nights, but it's fine.

193
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,791
I've been healing my body

194
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,541
with the divine spiritual
presence in this shrine.

195
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,708
[AOI] Thank Heaven that you
were able to make it back.

196
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,291
[GINJI] Before Orio-ya was here,
the Hachiyo of the time

197
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,958
built this sanctuary and
used it as a base of sorts.

198
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,500
[AOI]
"Before Orio-ya."

199
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,833
You're saying it was created by
the Hachiyo before Ranmaru?

200
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,250
[GINJI] Yes. It was a woman,
as a matter of fact.

201
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,875
Her name was Princess Iso.

202
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,416
I'm impressed they allow
female Hachiyos.

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,250
--[thunk]
--[gasps]

204
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,958
[GINJI] She was a beautiful,
noble ayakashi.

205
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,541
Born to an iso-otoko
in the southern land.

206
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,000
She was also the
last known mermaid.

207
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,833
She had such miraculous power,
and in her forehead,

208
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,125
she held a bright
crystal of foresight.

209
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,375
I see.

210
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,500
So, Princess Iso,
could she see the future?

211
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,750
[GINJI] Yes, and, because she
could, she had the power

212
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,708
to guide others on the path
that was intended for them.

213
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,333
For that reason, she was called

214
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,791
the "Shrine Maiden of Guidance."

215
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
[AOI]
The Shrine Maiden of Guidance.

216
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,166
Another thing about her.

217
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,958
She was a loving mother.

218
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,000
I know, 'cause she raised
Ranmaru and me.

219
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,208
[gasps] She what?

220
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,500
[AOI]
You two are like siblings?

221
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
[GINJI]
Ranmaru and I didn't have anyone

222
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
to take care of us
when we were small.

223
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,500
But, then Princess Iso found us

224
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,791
and brought us back
with her to this shrine.

225
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,000
And here, she raised
us so that we could

226
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,583
one day become guardian beasts

227
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,416
and shoulder the responsibility
of the ceremony.

228
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,083
[GINJI] Princess Iso took us on
many journeys to far-off places,

229
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,041
where we collected all the
information we could

230
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,250
on the ayakashi from the sea.

231
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,833
And, we did our best
to learn how to make

232
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,000
the ceremony more effective.

233
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,291
What kind of ayakashi
come from the ocean?

234
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,208
One in particular, an
unidentifiable massive curse.

235
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,125
We have a name for it.
It's called Umi-bouzu.

236
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,208
[AOI]
"Umi-bouzu"?

237
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,166
[GINJI] He's a sea devil
who goes back and forth

238
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,458
between the hidden
and eternal realms.

239
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,291
I've heard that he's called
daidarabocchi in the latter.

240
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,041
To be fair, he's very gentle,

241
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,541
and I don't believe that he
ever intends to do harm.

242
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,625
He just brings tornadoes and
typhoons with him, right?

243
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,083
[GINJI]
Mm-hm.

244
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,000
[GINJI]
In our years with the Princess,

245
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,625
Ranmaru and I took great
pride in our missions

246
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,458
and came to deeply
love this land

247
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,458
that was clearly so dear
to Princess Iso's heart.

248
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,833
[GINJI] However, 300 years
ago, the ceremony failed.

249
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,083
And all because of
an ice-cold betrayal.

250
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,708
Princess Iso foresaw the coming
of an unavoidable disaster.

251
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,625
[RANMARU]
Please stop, Princess Iso!

252
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,583
[GINJI]
Don't go, I beg of you!

253
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,416
[PRINCESS ISO] I'm leaving
the rest to the two of you.

254
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,041
I must go.

255
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,625
[PRINCESS ISO]
Ranmaru. Ginji.

256
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,000
No matter what happens...

257
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,750
...I never want you boys
to forget that you're...

258
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,083
...my pride and joy.

259
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,000
Please, Princess Iso! No!

260
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,291
[GINJI]
Princess Iso shut herself away

261
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,041
inside ruins of
the dragon palace,

262
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:43,125
deep in the sea, in order to
draw the disaster to herself.

263
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,208
[GINJI cries]

264
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,833
[GINJI]
And it killed her.

265
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,083
The curse that Princess
Iso took upon herself

266
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,291
in order to protect
the southern land,

267
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,791
is what still haunts those
ruins deep in the ocean,

268
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,666
even to this very day.

269
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,708
[GINJI]
After that,

270
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,208
Ougon-douji appeared in this
land for the first time.

271
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,166
In those days,
Ougon-douji was still

272
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,250
the mistress innkeeper
at Tenjin-ya.

273
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,291
But she decided to build
a new inn on this land.

274
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,041
[AOI] So, that's how
Orio-ya came about.

275
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,500
[GINJI]
Yes. We thought that the growth

276
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,250
Orio-ya brought
would somehow protect

277
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,208
the southern land from the
curse, so we worked very hard.

278
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,625
We didn't want the Princess's
death to be in vain.

279
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,291
Can I ask you something?

280
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,458
If you cared so much, then, why
did you end up leaving Orio-ya?

281
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,250
[GINJI]
Because, before long,

282
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,166
Ranmaru and I began to disagree
about each other's methods.

283
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,875
As Princess Iso's successor,

284
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,166
Ranmaru ascended
as the new Hachiyo.

285
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,166
His mind became
clouded by his desire

286
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,791
to grow Orio-ya and
the southern land.

287
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,416
Shut your mouths and
obey my orders, or else!

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,083
All who oppose me
will be let go!

289
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,083
Buy out that "other"
inn, as I said!

290
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,875
By any means necessary!

291
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,250
Take down Tenjin-ya!

292
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,166
Orio-ya will be the foremost
inn of the hidden realm!

293
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,166
[GINJI]
It pained me.

294
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,500
I couldn't bear to see
Ranmaru like that anymore.

295
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,000
Around that time, Master
approached me and asked

296
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,041
if I would be interested in
coming to work at Tenjin-ya.

297
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,583
You're going to work for them?!

298
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,458
Ginji! How dare you betray me?!

299
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,958
It's not like that.

300
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,750
I just don't want to see you
turn into a ruthless tyrant!

301
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,291
All that I do is
with the intention

302
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,208
of carrying out
Princess Iso's wishes!

303
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,791
But there are other ways!
Better ones!

304
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,541
Are you going to abandon
our mission, as well?

305
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,375
I'll fulfill my promise.

306
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,458
I swear that I'll return for
the ceremony without fail.

307
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,125
You may count on that.

308
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,250
And now,

309
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,041
you've kept your word and come
back to complete the mission.

310
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,083
Yes. I have.

311
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,875
[AOI]
Hey, Ginji?

312
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,375
[GINJI]
Mm?

313
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,708
[AOI] Once the ceremony
has been completed,

314
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,208
will you come back to us?

315
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,416
To Tenjin-ya, and to Moonflower?

316
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,375
[AOI]
No. I can't ask that of him.

317
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
Aoi, what's wrong?

318
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,875
[AOI] Ginji! Is there
something I can do to help?

319
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,750
I'll do all I can
for the ceremony.

320
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,416
I see.

321
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,750
You know, you've already done
quite a bit for the ceremony.

322
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,750
Like, getting the rainbow
umbrella and tengu liquor.

323
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,625
But, look. You should
leave it at that.

324
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,833
Stay away from the matter
with the mermaid scale.

325
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,833
No matter what.

326
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,708
--But I--
--It's too dangerous!

327
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,875
And if something bad
happened to you,

328
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,875
I could never show my face
before the Master ever again.

329
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,250
Ginji!

330
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,916
We should head
back now. It's late.

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,916
[AOI]
Hold on, Ginji, please!

332
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,041
[NOBU barking]

333
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,958
What's the matter?

334
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,625
[GINJI gasps]
Ranmaru!

335
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,541
[RANMARU gasping]

336
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,750
[NOBU barks]

337
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,000
[GINJI]
Don't tell me.

338
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,750
You went to the ruins
of the dragon palace!

339
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,833
[RANMARU] I did.
Since you've been so useless,

340
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,791
I had to pick up
the slack somehow.

341
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,333
[GINJI]
Stop talking!

342
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,916
You know you're more vulnerable
to the impurities than I am.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,291
That was reckless!

344
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,958
[RANMARU groaning]

345
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,708
Is he okay?

346
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,583
Stay back! This stuff
can make you sick.

347
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,958
Yeah, but--

348
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,791
[RANMARU growls]

349
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,250
[roars]

350
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,166
Aoi! Hurry and get someone
from Orio-ya to come help me!

351
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,333
And after that,
do what you do best.

352
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,916
Make a dish with
as much nutrition

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
and spiritual power as possible!

354
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,208
I won't let you down!

355
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,666
[AOI gasping]

356
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,291
[AOI]
You're finally awake.

357
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,791
[RANMARU] Uh. Why are you
watching me sleep, human?

358
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,083
[AOI]
Shush. Drink this.

359
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,875
[RANMARU]
Why? What is it?

360
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,458
[AOI]
It's vegetable and fruit juice.

361
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,416
Full of vitamins and
minerals. Come on.

362
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,000
It'll help recover your
strength and spiritual power.

363
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,833
I'd never be foolish enough to
drink something you concocted.

364
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,750
How do I know you're
not trying to poison me?

365
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,458
You're rude. You do
know that, right?

366
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,250
And anyway, the joke
here's on you.

367
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,708
'Cause you already
drank a lot of it

368
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,708
when you were still unconscious.

369
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,750
[RANMARU exhales]
Where's Ginji?

370
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,541
He's been working
since you collapsed.

371
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,125
With Hideyoshi.

372
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,750
Those two have been
keeping Orio-ya afloat.

373
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,791
[RANMARU]
Tch.

374
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:39,208
Hey! Lie back down! You really
need to get more rest!

375
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,791
I don't have time for that.

376
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,250
I'll rest when I've found
the mermaid scale.

377
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,000
That's right, Miss Tsubaki.

378
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,958
You told me that you
wanted to do something

379
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
to help Ginji, didn't you?

380
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,958
Huh? You eavesdropped when
you were that sick? Why?

381
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,333
[RANMARU]
No, I've just got good ears.

382
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,875
You've got a bad mouth, though.

383
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,208
[RANMARU]
Heh. Well, then.

384
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,166
Would you be interested in
a task only you could do?

385
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,833
[AOI]
Depends on what it is.

386
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,041
Acquiring the mermaid scale.

387
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,833
The miasma in the dragon
palace poisons ayakashi,

388
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,791
but it's harmless to humans.

389
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,583
[gasps] Are you seriously asking
me to get the mermaid scale?

390
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,208
[RANMARU]
That's exactly what I ask.

391
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,583
And if you do procure it,
your precious Ginji will

392
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,166
no longer suffer from the
effects of the impurities.

393
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,500
So, then. Quite a novel
idea, don't you think?

394
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,458
Okay. I'll get the scale for
you.

395
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,916
[RANMARU grunts]

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,833
[AOI]
But only under one condition.

397
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,125
Heh! You? Imposing
conditions upon me?

398
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,375
Yeah.

399
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,291
When everything
is finished here,

400
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,625
you'll give Ginji back to us.

401
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,541
[gasps]

402
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,125
No matter what.

403
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,916
[sighs] It appears you don't
know when to give up.

404
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,208
And what if Ginji has
no desire to return?

405
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,041
Then I will give up.

406
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,166
I won't force him
to do anything.

407
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,416
But I don't think
I need to worry.

408
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,958
Heh. You don't, do you? Ha.

409
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,958
All right. I accept
the terms of your deal.

410
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,500
Thank you.

411
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:14,250
Well, then. I'll be back soon
with the mermaid scale. Hey.

412
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,375
[RANMARU]
What now? Do you have

413
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,041
more demands to make of me?

414
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,666
[AOI] No. These infamous
ruins of the dragon palace.

415
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Where are they, again?

416
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,000
[RANMARU]
Huh?

417
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,041
[AOI] Did I take on more
than I can handle?

418
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,208
[AOI]
Well, even if it's dangerous,

419
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,083
it's something I have to do.

420
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,000
[laughing] It tickles!

421
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,833
It tickles, Master! Stop!

422
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,000
Uh... What are you two doing?

423
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, Aoi, you're finally back.

424
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,625
Hi, we've missed you!

425
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
[AOI]
Wow, Master.

426
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,791
Please tell me you haven't
been here all day.

427
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,375
Don't you have things to do?

428
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,875
[MASTER] I wanted to
see you before I left.

429
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,916
Since you worked
so hard yesterday,

430
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,333
I was hoping to give you
a little reward, but...

431
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,250
[chuckles] That look on
your face makes me suspect

432
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,041
you've taken on another
foolhardy mission.

433
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,500
You can tell?

434
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,791
Cucumber! Cucumber!

435
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,208
So, it seems I was right.

436
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,750
You did take on a nearly
impossible task, as is your way.

437
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,458
Maybe, but I think it's
going to be okay.

438
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,125
And I don't really have
time to hesitate.

439
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,333
You're nervous
about going alone.

440
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,666
Right. I guess I'll
go with you, then.

441
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,166
[AOI]
Huh? What? But, are you sure?

442
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,291
Won't going down there
make you get sick?

443
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,208
I'm a very different
breed of ayakashi

444
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,333
than both Ranmaru and Ginji.

445
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,416
I'm not nearly as vulnerable
to the miasma in the ruins.

446
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,125
[AOI] A very different breed.
I guess that makes sense.

447
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,916
[MASTER]
Besides,

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,125
I'd go down there with you
even if it meant getting hurt.

449
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,625
Because that's just what
a good husband does.

450
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,291
He shares in his
wife's hardships.

451
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,875
Heh. Well, that's sweet.

452
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,791
[AOI]
The ruins of the dragon palace.

453
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,916
I wonder what we'll find there.

454
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,875
[CHIBI] I got distracted by
the sweet cucumbers again!

455
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,708
But I'm still not
going to give up!

456
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,833
I'm going to be a useful
follower for my Aoi!

457
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,666
I'll make her so proud of me!
