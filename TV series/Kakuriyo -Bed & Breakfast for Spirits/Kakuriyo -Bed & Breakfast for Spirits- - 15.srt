00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,958
So, that's it.

--...go!

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,708
Stop. There's no need
to be rude to her.

[chuckles]

7
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,916
Hideyoshi's a
shape-shifting monkey.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,083
Shortly after I left,

9
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,333
he was promoted to young
master of Orio-ya.

10
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,375
He sure acts like a monkey,
in a lot of ways.

[gasping]

12
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,875
[AOI] This is just like when
I first came to Tenjin-ya.

13
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,291
I am departing to the
northwestern land at this time.

14
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,041
Ranmaru, ensure that you carry
out the ceremony without fail.

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,250
Yes, you can count on it,
Mistress Ougon-douji.

00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,666
[AOI]
"Ceremony"?

[GINJI]
Aoi.

00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,958
Wait, what are they going to do?

00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,750
[screams]

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,791
[RANMARU] This room suits
you well, ogre bride.

23
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,500
Hey, you can't lock me in here!

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
It's false imprisonment!

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,750
Where I come from,
that is a crime!

26
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,375
Well, around here,
I make the laws.

27
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,208
This isn't a joke!
You better let me out right now!

28
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,208
You are such an annoying
little wench.

29
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,041
I never thought I'd feel sorry
for the master of Tenjin-ya.

'Scuse me?

We don't want you interfering
with our important event.

32
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,083
But if you'll make
yourself useful,

33
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,458
I'd be happy to let you out.

34
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,041
How dare you?!

35
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,416
How about this, you can test the
strength of your master's love?

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Heh. If he really cares for you,

37
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,708
then surely he'll come
to your rescue, won't he?

38
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,375

[ALL chuckle]

[AOI] They're testing
the master's love for me?

41
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,250
But if he comes to my aid,

42
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,916
it will cause trouble
for Tenjin-ya.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,083
Come to think of it, am I
already causing them problems?

44
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,208
You let go of her this instant!

45
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,083
[AOI]
I wonder if Ginji is okay...

46
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,333
[TAICHI]
Hey, lady!

47
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,208
Uh?

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,541
Want a late-night snack?

49
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,791
[AOI]
What?

50
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,500
Some food? Heh. Yeah!

51
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,416
Wait, it's not poisoned, is it?

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,166
If you're that worried,
I'll eat it!

53
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,958
No, I'll take my chances.

54
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,541
Thank you for the food.

55
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,000
Stock made from kelp and dried
bonito, and I smell yuzu!

56
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,000
Is the fish flounder?

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,750
[AOI] It's very mild,
and the texture's lovely!

58
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,833
The rice tastes fantastic, too!

59
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,083
And now for the squid <i>shumai.</i>

60
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,541
I love the consistency
and the sweetness!

[TAICHI]
Isn't it good?

00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
That's my most favorite dish.

63
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,208
All the chefs at Orio-ya
make such delicious stuff.

64
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,291
The seafood here is awesome.

65
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,583
We can't beat the eastern
land as far as quantity,

66
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,708
but the quality of ours
is every bit as great!

[AOI]
You sure seem knowledgeable.

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,541
Master Ranmaru told me
that I need to learn

69
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,666
all about the southern land if I
want to continue working here.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,291
He even taught me about
all of this stuff himself!

71
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,291
[AOI] For what it's worth, this
boy seems to adore Ranmaru.

72
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,708
What's your name, by the way?

73
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:12,083
Uh? Oh, I'm Taichi,
and I am a night-sparrow.

Thanks a lot, Taichi.

So is this a guest room or what?

bathe and get in bed.

00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,208
from my loneliness and hunger
all those years ago?

00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,625
Could it really have been Ginji?

00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,666
[AOI]
Did I just... fall asleep?

88
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,875
[AOI] I wonder if Ginji expected
all of this to happen.

00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,666
I hope he's not somewhere
getting bullied mercilessly

by Ranmaru right now.

That's it.
I'm getting out of here.

92
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,333
Aw. Guess I ate too
much last night.

93
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,166
Speaking of eating,
where's Chibi?

Where have you been?

97
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,875
That's a key!

98
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,250
Does it open this lock?

99
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,166

doing out of your room?!

Well... You see...

your quarters, dumb human!

Pretending to be
a delicate flower.

115

Humans are much weaker
than <i>ayakashi.</i>

116
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,500
I don't buy that I'm the first
one that you've ever met.

117
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,541
No, I met Shiro, sadly.

118
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,833
He taught me that humans
are evil, and very sneaky.

119
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,583
You're stubborn,
and refuse to die,

no matter how hard
we try to kill you.

We're not all like that.

measure for most of us.

Oh, you're okay.

Yeah, how 'bout you?

128
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,458
This awful brute
didn't do anything

to rough you up, did he?

130
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,916
How rude. Tell me, have you
come to a decision yet

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,458
about next month's
fireworks event, Ginji?

132

I've decided to accept.

133
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,083
You can rest assured
that the event will be

134
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,125
a resounding success.
In fact, that's the sole reason

135
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,958
I've agreed to come
back to this place.

136
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,083
I intend to hold you to that.

137
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,541
And remember, you can't run
from this land after all.

138
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,541
Its curse will never
stop following you.

139
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,791
I apologize. I feel so terrible

140
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,916
for getting you wrapped
up in this situation.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,166
It's okay.

142
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,750
I'm to blame for chasing
after you the way I did.

143
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,666
But I was scared you'd never
come back to Tenjin-ya.

144
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,958
[GINJI]
Ranmaru did that?

145
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,541
Yeah. No big deal.

146
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,041
You know, Ginji,
you really are a gentleman.

147
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,750
The girls say you're the last
good catch at Tenjin-ya.

"Last good catch"?

149
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,791
What an odd way to put it.

150
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,458
[HATORI]
Hey, Missy! There you are!

151
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,708
Oh, Hatori!

152

Be careful, he's a womanizer,

you throw him back.

Believe me, I know.

You certainly had a bit
of misfortune yesterday.

tough time too, didn't you?

00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,791
You got that right.

I bet you knew what would
happen from the start.

[laughs] Well, can't say.

160
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,583
Wow, look at that view.

161
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,458
You're terrible at
deflecting, you know.

162
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,833
[HATORI]
What? Yeah, true. But, still.

163
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,333
Why don't we just try to think
positively about the future,

164
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,625
Ginji? The crucial moment is
fast approaching, good buddy.

165
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,291
I know. But thanks for
the reminder, friend.

166
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,166
So, we're good, then!

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,250
I'll do whatever I can to
make sure you get back

168
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,666
to Tenjin-ya, never fear.

169
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,500
Hatori, you're being incredibly
reassuring, what's up?

170
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,791
[HATORI] I'm all about
customer service here!

171
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,125
I'm not the same Hatori who was
in vacation mode at your inn.

172
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,458
[laughs]

173
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,333
[BOTH laugh sheepishly]

174
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,583
[HATORI]
Oh, breakfast!

175
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,291
You wanna go eat in the
employee dining hall?

176
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,208
I know Missy here
wants to try our food.

177
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,583
Heck yes!

178
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,500
[AOI] I can't wait to
taste this breakfast!

179
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,208
[HIDEYOSHI] Aoi Tsubaki!
We have you surrounded!

180
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,666
Wait one second, Hideyoshi.

181
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,375
You've got Ginji and
me surrounded, too.

182
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,916
[HIDEYOSHI] Well, you also
reek of Tenjin-ya,

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,291
so you're our enemies!

184
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,875
[AOI] Come on! We have a
right to eat breakfast, too!

185
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,416
[HIDEYOSHI]
How dare you make that claim?!

186
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,625
You're just a parasite!

187
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,541
[AOI] You're the ones
who brought me here!

188
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,208
Aoi Tsubaki, you are going back

189
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,583
to the basement
confinement room!

190
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,291
Why can't you let me
eat breakfast first,

191
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,166
at the very least?

192
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,333
Let her go!

193
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,625
[MATSUBA]
Hey! Isn't the bath open yet?

194
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,708
[EMPLOYEE 15C]
Not again.

195
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,000
[EMPLOYEE 15D]
That guy gets up too early.

196
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
Crap! My old man! Gotta go!

197
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,583
Master Matsuba!

198
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,666
[MATSUBA]
Mm? Oh, it's you!

199
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,041
[laughs]

200
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:14,875
Uh?

201
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:15,958
[EMPLOYEE 15E]
Uh...

202
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,875
Hey you! What the hell?!

203
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,000
Why are you manhandling my Aoi?!

204
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,333
Explain yourself!

205
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,250
Take your hands off her,
scoundrel! You ape!

206
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,291
No way.

207
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,125
This wench is a Tenjin-ya spy!

208
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,750
Do not speak of her
that way, cretin!

209
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,708
That lovely girl is my Aoi!

210
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,625
[MATSUBA yelling]

211
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,208
Lady Aoi! Please intervene,
I beg of you!

212
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,833
Of course.

213
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,166
--Please. Master Matsuba!
--Huh?

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,625
[AOI]
Stop destroying things.

215
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,208
You have to think
of the other guests.

216
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm an early riser, and I don't
like to wait for my bath,

217
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,291
and these idiots were
treating you badly.

218
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,041
That's no excuse for all this.

219
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,166
Don't you remember what
you did to Tenjin-ya?

220
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
I don't wanna wait
for the fireworks.

221
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,250
I'm going back to
Mount Shumon right away.

222
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,333
[EMPLOYEES gasping]

223
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,125
Please don't be rash,
Master Matsuba.

224
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,541
You'll put us in a bind!

225
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,791
He's right, Old-man, you can't
just do stuff like that!

226
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,125
Uh. Big mistake.

227
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,375
He's gonna murder me!

228
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,458
Hatori! You stupid
little bastard,

229
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,250
how dare you open
your insolent mouth?!

230
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,416
[TENGU] Better run,
or it's over for you!

231
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,666
--[MATSUBA] Hold it!
--[HATORI] No way!

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,125
What's all this about?

233
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,916
[MATSUBA] Don't run!
You'll get tired eventually!

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,541
I just wonder if those two
are ever gonna get along.

235
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,083
Master Matsuba!
I think you're overreacting!

236
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,958
[MATSUBA] Hatori! Aren't you
Tenjin-ya's nine-tailed fox?

237
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,291
How dare you judge my
reaction, you idiot!

238
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,458
I have a right to pummel
my good-for-nothing son

239
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,958
with my own hands if I want to!

240
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,166
Of course! That's not
a problem, sir, feel free!

241
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,666
[HATORI]
Are you kidding me?!

242
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,750
I just thought you should know
the morning bath is ready!

243
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,250
I'm sure that a nice soak while
taking in the ocean view

244
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,750
will cure what ails you!

245
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,625
We'd be happy to bring
breakfast to your room

246
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,916
after you've had your bath.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,083
I won't be needing breakfast
or a bath, thanks.

248
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,375
What if we asked Aoi to
prepare a very special meal

249
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,583
just for you, then?

250
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,083
--[MATSUBA] Hm?
--[AOI] Huh?!

251
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,958
A breakfast prepared just
for me by my dear Aoi? Mm!

252
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,958
This is her first time
cooking with seafood

253
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:03,958
from the southern land,

254
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,708
and I know she's
excited about it.

255
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,500
And I bet you're thrilled
to be the first one

256
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,083
to try her new dishes, too!

257
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,958
As a matter of fact,
I'm jealous.

258
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,041
Well, that doesn't
sound too bad at all!

259
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,333
How 'bout it Aoi, will you
make some food for me?

260
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,875
[AOI]
Uh...

261
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,000
[HATORI]
Uh!

262
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,958
If that's what you really want,
I would be happy to cook

263
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,416
a seafood breakfast
for you, Master Matsuba!

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,166
Oh, I'm glad to
hear it, my dear!

265
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,708
Been looking forward
to your food again!

266
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,500
Now, I think an open-air
bath is in order.

267
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,750
Ginji... What do you
think you're doing?

268
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,375
If Matsuba leaves,
it will put Orio-ya in a bind,

269
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,750
isn't that right?

270
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,458
If you can think of some other
way to keep him here

271
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,708
besides Aoi's cooking,
I'd be happy to hear it.

272
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,625
I guess you've got a point.

273
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,375
But don't think I'll let you
loose in our main kitchens.

274
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,916
Find somewhere else to cook.

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,875
You don't have to tell me,
I'm already brainstorming.

276
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,333
Hey, monkey! Let's go!

277
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,541
Thank goodness. Looks like
I narrowly escaped death.

278
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,333
I'm sorry that I
volunteered your services

279
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,916
without consulting
with you first.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,416
Hey, did they lock you in the
confinement room last night?

281
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,750
Yeah, although, to be honest,

282
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,791
that place is incredibly
comfortable.

283
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,500
More importantly, we need to
find a kitchen and ingredients

284
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,458
for Matsuba's breakfast fast,
or this won't work.

285
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,750
That won't be a problem.
I've figured it out!

286
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,958
[AOI]
Where are we going, Ginji?

287
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,083
[GINJI]
To Orio-ya's old building.

288
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,291
[AOI]
Oh, yeah?

289
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,333
Yep, and here we are!

290
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,541
Come on in!

291
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,166
[laughs]

292
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,958
[GINJI] It's not as up-to-date
as the kitchen at Moonflower,

293
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,958
but it'll serve our
purpose for now.

294
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,125
Although we will have to
draw our water from outside.

295
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,541
So, things at Moonflower are

296
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,625
state-of-the-art for the
hidden realm, aren't they?

297
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,833
[GINJI] Yep. We'll need to give
this place a thorough cleaning

298
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,625
later, but for now, let's focus
on Master Matsuba's breakfast.

299
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,791
If his food isn't ready
by the time he's finished

300
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,750
his morning bath,
we'll be in trouble!

301
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,250
I don't know, he's got a
soft spot for you, Aoi,

302
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,916
so he might be more patient.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,291
[GINJI]
Uh!

304
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,625
I had a feeling you two
might be cookin' back here.

305
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,833
Hey, Hatori.

306
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,875
I brought some gifts.
Just a few supplies.

307
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,375
[AOI] Cookware!
And clean kitchen towels?

308
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,791
How nice!

309
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,791
Did you get all this from
the employee dining hall?

310
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,583
Yeah, I'm friends with
the ladies who work there.

311
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,333
Though, I gotta admit,
it's not their best stuff.

312
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,916
[HATORI] The leftovers
from the main kitchen

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,041
are what get sent over to
the employee dining hall,

314
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,291
and these are the leftovers
from those leftovers,

315
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
but you get what
you get, you know?

316
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,625
[GINJI]
So, Aoi, do you think you can

317
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,791
make something with this?

318
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,916
Yep. Sure!

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,583
If you need anything
else, let me know.

320
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,875
I can fly over the main
kitchen and sneak in.

321
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,791
Don't you have your own
work to do, though?

322
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,375
That's none of your concern.

323
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,375
And, after all, this whole
situation was caused

324
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,250
by my old man's selfishness.

325
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,500
Then, can you track down
a few eggs for me?

326
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,833
And some garlic, too.

327
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,000
We also need a little ice
from the icicle woman.

328
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,166
Right. Just leave it to me!

329
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,541
All right. Aoi.

330
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,583
I'm curious to hear what
you're planning to make.

331
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,583
Well, since it's breakfast,

332
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,708
I'm gonna make eggs,
and something with these.

333

[AOI laughs]
We may not be at Moonflower,

334
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,375
but we've still found
ourselves in a kitchen.

335
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,875
[GINJI]
True.

336
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,083
I wonder what's going to happen
to Moonflower, though.

337
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,291
[AOI]
Worst case...

338
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,041
...if I end up stuck here,

339
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,666
and I can't go back to
Tenjin-ya for a while,

340
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,291
is that the end?

341
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,791
Do you think Moonflower
will be okay without me?

342
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,916
Please don't worry.

343
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,875
I'll try to figure something
out so that you can

344
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,291
go back to Tenjin-ya, and
Moonflower, before you know it.

[footsteps]

346
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,708
I found you some eggs!

347
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,916
That's great!

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,583
[GINJI] I'm amazed,
who gave them to you?

349
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,416
I borrowed them right from
Orio-ya's chicken coop.

350
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,208
Don'tcha just love me?

351
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,208
Whoa, that look is
colder than this ice.

352
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,416
I'm chilled to the bone.

353
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,458
[MATSUBA]
I've been waiting, Aoi!

354
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,583
[AOI] Thank you for your
patience, Master Matsuba.

355
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,416
Here you have a sautéed octopus

356
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,958
and bitter gourd
breakfast scramble,

357
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
and miso soup with shellfish!

358
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,708
Let me see.

359
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,250
[slurping]

360
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,041
Mm, tasty!

361
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,250
[MATSUBA] I adore the aroma
of garlic and dried bonito.

362
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,166
The texture's great!
Might get addicted to it!

363
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,791
I think it works with
octopus instead of pork,

364
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,791
and the mildness of
the eggs and tofu

365
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,375
tones down the bitterness of
the gourd, while complementing

366
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,791
the best parts of the of the
octopus's flavor profile.

367
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,250
So good!

368
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,250
By the way, Aoi, I'm surprised
to find you at Orio-ya,

369
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,750
what are you doing here?
Are you on vacation?

370
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,625
No, it's nothing like that.
I was brought-- Uh!

371
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,750
[AOI] Wait, if I tell him
that they kidnapped me,

372
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,666
he'll freak out.

373
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,583
I'm just helping out with things
over here for a little while.

374
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,000
They've got a big event coming
up, so they need me.

375
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,958
[MATSUBA] Oh, you must be
referring to the fireworks.

376
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,958
But I heard that Tenjin-ya
and Orio-ya don't get along.

377
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,166
So, I guess they do work
together sometimes.

378
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,041
Are you staying here
for a while, too?

379
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,833
[MATSUBA]
Yes, I was invited as one of the

380
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,833
guests of honor
for the fireworks.

381
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,875
I get bored quite easily these
days at Mount Shumon.

382
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,708
If you'll be around,
I might elect

383
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,541
to extend my stay
a little bit longer.

384

scrumptious breakfast!

Well, if you'll excuse me...

Looks like Master
Matsuba's breakfast

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,375
[RANMARU]
Aoi Tsubaki.

468
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,333
From this day forward,
I command you to cook

469
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,500
one meal per day
for Master Matsuba.

470
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,333
[gasps]

471
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,333
Ranmaru! She can't!

472
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,458
Orio-ya has received
a specific request

473
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,875
from Master Matsuba himself.

474
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,791
[gasping]

475
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,500
--You give that back to me!
--Stop it!

476
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,083
I'll be keeping this
for now. Rose quartz.

477
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,750
Looks expensive.

478
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,166
I'm assuming your
master gave you this.

479
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
If you try to run away,

480
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,958
I will toss this thing into
the middle of the ocean.

481
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,041
What, you can't do that!

482
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,791
How dare you drag her into this!

483
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,083
Come now!

484
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,250
You have your own mission
to worry about here.

485
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,958
Obtain what you
promised, or else.

486
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,916
Only those who produce results
can make demands of me.

487
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,916
The ceremony...

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,875
Fireworks.

489
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,583
[AOI] There's something going
on at Orio-ya, but what is it?

490
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,875
[AOI] No matter what the answer
is, or what happens here,

491
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,833
I have to do my best for
Master Matsuba, or I'm lost.

492
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,750
[CHIBI] Hmm, this shady inn
is definitely hiding something.

493
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,750
--[barking]
--What?! Is it really that?!

494
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,250
This is more serious
than I thought!

495
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,166
