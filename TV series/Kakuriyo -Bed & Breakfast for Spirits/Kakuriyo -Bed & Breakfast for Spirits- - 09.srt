[MASTER] This amulet
led me to your location

165
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,625
in the market storeroom.

166
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,833
This thing? That's how
you were able to save me?

167
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,708
The ogre fire
is like a familiar.

168
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,458
I can find it anywhere,

169
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,666
but this particular flame
will soon die.

170
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,875
Ah, I found it.

171
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,583
Here, Aoi. Eat this.

172
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,041
Do you always keep
<i>dorayaki</i> in your clothes?

173
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,750
As for you, Chief Chef...

174
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,375
You said you'd be
willing to quit

175
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,458
in order to
settle this matter.

176
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,083
But my ogre bride has
expressed her discontentment

177
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,458
with that solution,

178
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,833
and she is terrifying.

179
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,916
I cannot go against
the wishes of my future wife,

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,166
so all of you
must remain in my employ

181
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,958
for the foreseeable future.

182
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,083
Alas, you must
accept your fate.

183
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,625
A harsh one,
though it may be.

184
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,833
Yes, Master. I understand.

185
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,875
I'll happily serve
your ogre-bride

186
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,625
the full-course
Tenjin-ya meal, on the house!

187
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,166
What? For free?

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,458
Of course.

189
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,375
[laughing] You're a shrewd one!

190
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,958
Aoi, you take some time
to recuperate from this ordeal.

191
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,166
Leave the Royal
Anniversary to me.

192
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,833
I'll take care of it.
You should rest.

193
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,750
No way.

194
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,375
You can spoil me later.

195
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,583
Right now, I want to make sure
they have the perfect meal.

196
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,250
[gasps]

197
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,458
At this point,

198
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,791
there's not enough time
to serve the dishes

199
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,666
I had originally planned to,

200
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,875
but I'll have to
make it work anyway.

201
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,208
If I can't,

202
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,166
then do I even deserve
to run my own restaurant?

203
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,250
When is the Royal
Couple arriving?

204
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,291
We're expecting
them at 6:30.

205
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,458
That gives you
about four hours.

206
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,083
That's not enough time
for beef stew.

207
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,166
Mmm...

208
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,666
Honestly, I think
your usual cooking

209
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,291
is impressive enough, Aoi.

210
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,125
[AOI]
Huh? Do you really think so?

211
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,916
I've seen how you can improvise,

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,333
and you cook quickly,

213
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,583
even working with the
ingredients available to you.

214
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,583
Your food's never been anything
less than delicious.

215
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,500
The bento you made for me
was simply spectacular.

216
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,666
I swear the meat
melted in my mouth.

217
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,041
Are you serious?

218
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,833
--Hey, Aoi!
--[AOI] Huh?

219
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,625
Make the stewed
pork belly?

220
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,875
But I don't have
any more pork belly.

221
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,625
You're welcome to use
what we have in the kitchen.

222
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,541
[AOI]
Really?

223
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,333
Yes, it's the least I could do.

224
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,958
You're free to use
anything of ours,

225
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,250
don't even bother asking.

226
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,083
Thanks, Chief Chef!
I appreciate it!

227
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
I had better get back
to Moonflower.

228
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,333
Oh! Don't you worry!

229
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,041
I haven't forgotten
about you three just yet!

230
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,208
[DARUMAS gasp]

231
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,541
[AOI] You hurry up
and climb the mountain

232
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,791
out back right away!

233
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,208
And bring me some hot
spring eggs and ramune!

234
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
[DARUMAS]
Ah! Yes, ma'am!

235
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,166
Thanks, Ginji.

236
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,125
For all those nice things
you said back there.

237
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,541
It really meant a lot.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,375
Well, the whole mess

239
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,375
was all my fault
to begin with.

240
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,833
I should have been
more cautious.

241
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,125
I can imagine
how scary it was,

242
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,916
trapped in such
a small, dark, cold, place.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
And you were hungry, too.

244
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,958
It sounds just like--

245
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,916
[gasps]

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,875
What, Ginji?

247
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,416
When you get back
to Moonflower,

248
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,791
don't you dare start before
you eat a little something.

249
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,208
It'll be a while
before we get the pork belly,

250
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,500
so, there's time to take
care of yourself first.

251
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,250
Welcome back, Aoi!

252
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,958
Did O-Ryo leave already?

253
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,458
She had to go to work.

254
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,291
Huh?

255
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,916
[KASUGA] Oh! O-Ryo made
those before she left.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She told me she just reheated
some leftover rice

257
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,666
that you had frozen.

258
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,625
This <i>kamaboko</i> is from the
souvenir shop here at Tenjin-ya.

259
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,083
I had them give me the ones
that were about to expire.

260
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,333
You guys. Wow.

261
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,875
Whelp, I'm headed to work!

262
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,250
[GINJI] I know they're just
hoping for a reward,

263
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,833
but it's still nice
that they help you for free.

264

Not much time left.

[AOI groans]
I'm hot.

271

They're walking up now.

Welcome to Moonflower.

We hope you found it easily.

275
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,875
Thank you, we enjoyed the walk.

276
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,791
We appreciate all of this.

277
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,333
I know we didn't
give much notice.

278
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,291
So, we're all
the more grateful.

279
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,708
And we're grateful
that you chose

280
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,500
to celebrate at Moonflower.

281
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,666
Your anniversary
is very special.

282

We're so glad you're
spending it with us.

Yes. Um...

Well then,

289
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,666
please allow me
to show you to your table.

290
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,041
Lovely! Just delightful!

291
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,166
This is a nice "hole-in-the-wall
place," right, darling?

292
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,666
[laughs] I agree, my love.

Thank you very much.

Uh, this is cucumber

and okra in plum-miso
mayonnaise.

296
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,291
Oh! Mayonnaise
is a sauce made of--

297
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,500
Wow. Nui, did you hear that?

298
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,458
She said it's dressed
in mayonnaise!

299
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,416
I haven't eaten that in ages!

300
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
You mean you've had it?

301
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,333
I just assumed
that you hadn't.

302
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,833
Yes, but, well, it was rare

303
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,666
when I was in the
apparent realm.

304
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,708
Of course,
that was in wartime.

305
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,250
It was like gold.

306
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,416
Well these days,
it's quite affordable.

307
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
But, since it's still hard
to get in the hidden realm,

308
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,333
I whipped up this batch.

00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,958
[AOI]
I knew it.

326
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,625
Um, Madam?

327
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,750
[RITSUKO]
The taste brings back memories.

328
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,208
I never imagined

329
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,958
that I'd have stewed
pork belly in the hidden realm.

330
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,583
I'm so overwhelmed.

331
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,625
[crying softly]

332
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,708
[gasps]

333
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,333
Oh, my love.

334
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,875
Is it a dish from your hometown
in the apparent realm?

335
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,000
[gasps]

336
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm sorry to startle you
like that, dear.

337
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,041
Mm-mm.

338
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,375
[RITSUKO]
It was all very delicious.

339
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,166
The pork belly
tastes like home.

340
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,875
I come from a town
called Nagasaki.

341
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,833
To think that, even at my age,

342
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,916
a flavor still has the power
to make me feel homesick.

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
[AOI]
I have to wonder.

344
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,958
Did the master
suggest that dish

345
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,166
because he knew
it was special to her?

346
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,500
Perfect. Every bit.

347
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,541
Yes, it is, indeed.

348
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,416
Pardon, but could I trouble
you for some white rice?

349
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,166
[AOI]
Of course!

350
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,500
[water boiling]

351
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,166
This just keeps
getting better!

352
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,000
I think it's about time
for seconds.

353
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,583
[NUINOIN] My stomach says no,
but my taste buds say yes!

354
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,333
All right.
Time to prepare dessert.

355
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,375
[BOTH gasp]

356
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,666
[AOI] And for the
final dish of the evening,

357
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,875
I've prepared
a fruit salad.

358
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,416
It's so pretty!

359
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Almost looks like jewelry!

360
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,083
Don't you agree, Nui?

361
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,625
[NUINOIN]
Yes, it does!

362
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,125
I wonder what this one is.

363
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,041
[BOTH laughing]

364
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,250
[sighs]

365
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,041
[MASTER] Aoi worked
a little too hard today.

366
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,333
I'm very sorry, sir.

367
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,666
The fault is all mine.

368
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,166
I should have watched
her more closely.

369
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,083
You've been repeating
that same line a lot today,

370
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,708
haven't you?

371
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,708
I keep forcing you to look
after this reckless girl,

372
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,958
so, I share
the responsibility.

373
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,833
Don't worry about it too much.

374
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,458
Raise your head, dear Ginji.

375
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,083
Are you sure you don't
blame me for her state?

376
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,791
I can bear it, sir.

377
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,750
Bear what?

378
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,250
[GINJI] A stricter punishment.
I deserve it.

379
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,875
Don't tell me you question
my authority on the matter.

380
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,125
[GINJI]
No! Not at all.

381
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,625
Well, when Byakuya returns,
he'll have his say.

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,291
[MASTER]
He might agree with you

383
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,750
that I've been too lenient,
so be prepared.

384
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,250
He may suggest a salary cut.

385
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,750
And I will respectfully
accept it.

386
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,625
You know, she's an
amazing young woman.

387
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,041
To say that Master Nuinoin
and Mistress Reetsko

388
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,916
enjoyed her cooking
is an understatement.

389
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,375
They were so grateful,
the lady even wept over it.

390
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,875
[MASTER] What do you think
about Aoi's abduction?

391
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,416
We know the daruma
were involved,

392
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,000
they admitted as much,

393
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,750
but were they the only ones?

394
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,708
No.

395
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,208
The paralysis
technique was used.

396
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,666
And spiriting away, as well.

397
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,333
I find it hard to believe,
honestly,

398
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,875
that the daruma
could have mastered

399
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,833
such advanced practices.

400
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,875
[MASTER]
If you're calling them advanced,

401
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,416
then whoever used them must be
powerful <i>ayakashi,</i> indeed.

402
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,083
[GINJI]
I wonder if the assassin

403
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,875
who attacked Aoi
in the courtyard

404
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,000
could also have been connected
to her abduction somehow.

405
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,583
I believe the likelihood
of that is quite high.

406
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,541
Was it an employee?
Or someone above me?

407
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,541
Perhaps a Hachiyo,
or someone higher?

408
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,916
[MASTER]
Or could it be, Orio-ya?

409
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,041
[GINJI gasps]

410
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,416
[AOI groans]
Where am I?

411
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,041
Oh, Aoi. I'm so glad
that you're awake!

412
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,125
Ginji, hi.

413
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,000
[screams]

414
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,375
Did I miss the Royal Dinner?

415
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,458
Or do something
even worse than that?

416
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,833
Please tell me
I didn't pass out

417
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,166
before serving their dessert!

418
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,000
[GINJI] Aoi, please, calm down
and take a breath!

419
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,625
Everything went perfectly
with the anniversary dinner.

420
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,458
Oh, that's right.
I collapsed at the end.

421
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,291
They loved it.

422
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,250
Mistress Ritsuko
was especially impressed.

423
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,250
You passed out
just after they left.

424
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,500
They had no idea
anything was wrong.

425
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,375
Huh?

426
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,833
Oh, good. It seems
your fever has broken.

427
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,000
[stomach growling]

428
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,458
Not again. Sheesh.

429
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,458
Heh. I'm hungry, too.

430
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,666
I'll be waiting
for you out front.

431
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,833
[door closes]

Oh, hi.

436
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,291
I didn't know
you were in there.

437
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
Aoi, you sure toss
and turn a lot.

438
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,041
You almost crushed me
a dozen times.

439
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,500
While you were out
with a fever,

440
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,750
the fox had a hard time

441
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,333
trying to get you
back on the futon.

442
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,916
It was hilarious.

443
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,375
You were sleeping
for a long time.

444
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,041
I'm super hungry now.

445
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,291
There were some cucumbers
left in the fridge, right?

446
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,333
You could have helped
yourself to those.

447
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
I waited for you
to wake up,

448
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,041
so you could feed me.

449
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,500
[gasps]

450
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh no.

451
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,083
I'll make you
something right away.

452
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
Om, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom, nom.

453
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,166
Did you buy all of
this fancy stuff

454
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,291
at the foreign
delicacy market?

455
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,541
[AOI]
I did.

456
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,916
Ingredients for making
beef stew, some flour,

457
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
and spices for making curry.

458
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,958
You'll make
good use of it all.

459
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,916
You can just serve it
in the restaurant.

460
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,750
I guess this means
I'll have to come up

461
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,708
with some new menu items, huh?

462
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
By the way,

463
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,375
who do you think
that girl could have been?

464
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,375
What girl?

465
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,875
The zashiki-warashi.

466
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,166
The one who came in here
the other day.

467
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,750
[AOI] I saw her in the harbor
town in the eastern land.

468
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,041
I wandered off after her,

469
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,500
like I was lured away
against my will.

470
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,125
[AOI] A very young girl
with blonde hair.

[gasps]

472
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,208
She was blonde?
A zashiki-warashi?

--What is it?
--[GINJI gasps]

474
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,541
It's just what you're
describing is rare.

475
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,083
Zashiki-warashi
aren't usually blonde.

476
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,583
[CHIBI]
You've worked so hard, Aoi!

477
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,916
What? Now it's time
to have our reward?

478
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,041
Delicious food? Yay!
