164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,291
But, it isn't enough.
Anything else on the menu?

165
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,750
Chicken and potato stew,

166
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,916
and stir-fried miso eggplant.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,916
Great. Bring both.

168
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,833
So, then. What's your name?

169
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm Aoi. Aoi Tsubaki.

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Tsubaki?

171
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,750
[AOI]
Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,041
Are you, perhaps,

173
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,458
the daughter
of one Shiro Tsubaki?

174
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,791
Uh...

175
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,083
Close, but no.

176
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,416
I'm Shiro Tsubaki's
granddaughter.

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,333
I see! His granddaughter?

178
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,375
Why, do you know my grandpa?

179
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,166
I do, indeed.

180
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,416
Quite well.

181
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
We go way back. Hmm...

182
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,541
[MATSUBA laughing]

183
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,291
What's so funny, sir?

184
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,083
My name is Matsuba.

185
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,125
Master Matsuba.

186
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,291
Master Matsuba.

187
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,125
[MATSUBA]
Aoi Tsubaki!

188
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,083
You're a great cook!

189
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,916
I've grown quite weary
of the food here at Tenjin-ya,

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,250
so this is lucky.

191
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,750
You've grown weary of it?

192
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,000
[MATSUBA] That chief chef
is stubborn as hell.

193
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,000
Serves the same dishes
every time we come here.

194
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,750
No matter how good
they might be,

195
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,458
you get tired of them.

196
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,916
I just suggested
that he mix things up a bit.

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,916
That's when he flew
off the handle.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,333
So, you're who started
the big fight, then.

199
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,625
[MATSUBA grunts]

200
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,250
[MATSUBA]
Hmm...

201
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,666
[AOI]
Hmm?

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,125
[MATSUBA] Aoi, you remind me
quite a bit of Shiro.

203
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,958
Really? I don't feel like

204
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,166
I resemble him very much at all.

205
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,041
Your face, your energy,

206
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,958
but more than those,
his spiritual power.

207
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,333
--[AOI] Spiritual power?
--Heh.

208
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,875
[MATSUBA] Shiro was very wild,
for a human,

209
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,958
and he came to the hidden realm
of his own accord.

210
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,833
He was well-liked
by scores of <i>ayakashi.</i>

211
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,333
But still, far more
wanted him dead

212
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,500
and wanted to kill him
themselves.

213
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,500
[laughing]

214
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,041
That sure sounds
like Grandpa!

215
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,875
[MATSUBA]
You know, Aoi?

216
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,791
I owe my very life
to your grandfather.

217
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,041
Huh?

218
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,541
It all happened around
60 years back, or so.

219
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,916
[MATSUBA]
I had gotten too drunk,

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,875
like I do, and I fell
into the Daikanro River,

221
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,750
which runs through
the hidden realm.

222
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,625
Shiro jumped right
into the river,

223
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,291
and saved me
from a watery grave.

224
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,958
He was still a young man then.

225
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,291
In fact, he was still young
enough to be called a boy.

226
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,250
Wow. It was lucky that
he happened to be there.

227
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,666
Indeed. He had been
fishing on the shore.

228
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,500
By the way,
fishing in the Daikanro River

229
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,083
has been strictly prohibited
since ancient times.

230
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,708
Hmm... Well, that's
my Grandpa for you.

231
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,500
Although, he did jump in
the river to save a stranger.

232
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,291
So, then he had
a hidden generous side?

233
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,416
[MATSUBA] No, no, no.
The first thing he did

234
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,000
was bug me for a reward
for saving my life.

235
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,583
[AOI chuckles nervously]

236
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,291
[AOI] So what did you give him
in exchange for saving you?

237
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,416
Oh, well,

238
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,625
I didn't have anything on me

239
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,166
at the time
that would've sufficed,

240
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,833
so I gave him
a verbal IOU for a fan.

241
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,875
Why a fan?

242
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,750
[MATSUBA]
It's a tengu treasure.

243
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,250
I see.

244
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,250
[MATSUBA] But, I suppose he may
have forgotten my promise,

245
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,333
because he never did accept
his reward, that rascal.

246
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,958
Heh. Everything you've said
is so typical of Grandpa.

247
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,583
He really was
quite free-spirited.

248
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,208
A charming,
unreliable scoundrel.

249
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,875
An irresponsible human

250
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,083
who lived
for the present moment.

251
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,708
Yep, he sure did.

252
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,666
He left everything
in life to chance.

253
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,166
That's right.

254
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,041
I was always
especially fond of Shiro.

255
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,750
Most other <i>ayakashi</i> said,

256
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,708
"He's a lowlife,
he's even worse than <i>ayakashi</i> !"

257
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,541
We're a self-loathing bunch.

258
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,541
But he was amusing
and exhilarating to be around.

259
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,333
A lowlife,
even worse than <i>ayakashi</i> ?

260
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,958
You know?
I'd have to agree with them.

261
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,000
[MATSUBA]
And you'd know!

262
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,458
[AOI]
Grandpa taught me a lot, though.

263
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,583
Yeah?

264
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,791
How to cook, for starters.

265
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,000
[MATSUBA]
He did?

266
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,333
I guess what he liked

267
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,375
and what <i>ayakashi</i> like
are similar.

268
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,041
For food, at least.

269
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,291
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

270
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,416
[AOI]
Why?

271
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,666
He always used to complain

272
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,291
that the food
in the hidden realm

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,750
was too bland for him
to even stomach.

274
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,208
What?

275
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,000
[MATSUBA] Well, I suppose
his taste could have changed

276
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,250
as he got older. That happens.

277
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,041
So, then,
how's Shiro doing now?

278
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,916
Uh...

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,541
[MATSUBA]
Is he well?

280
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,875
[AOI]
Mmm...

281
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,333
[MATSUBA]
Hmm?

282
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,875
[AOI]
He passed away.

283
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,375
[MATSUBA sighs]

284
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,208
He had lived a long life,

285
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,916
but he died after
he fell down the stairs.

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,458
Death can surprise you, huh?

287
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,375
My word.

288
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,833
I'm going to miss him
a great deal.

289
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,791
[gasps]

290
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,791
I still can't believe how very
fragile you humans are,

291
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,833
that you can't even
live 100 years.

292
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,541
Uh...

293
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,583
[MATSUBA]
Thank you for the food.

294
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,291
[AOI]
Grandpa. You were incredible.

295
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,250
You made it to the hidden
realm on your own.

296
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,375
So wild and free-spirited.

297
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,708
It wasn't very nice
to offer your granddaughter

298
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,166
as collateral
for your debt, though.

299
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,916
For my last meal,

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,375
I hope I can eat
your cooking, Aoi.

[AOI]
Sadly,

302
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,791
your last supper
was awful hospital food.

303
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,041
I wish that I could
have cooked for him.

304
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,375
Just one more good meal.

305
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,166
[AOI]
This place is so relaxing.

306
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
So calm and quiet.

00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,708
The ambiance is lovely.

308
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,041
It's too bad.

309

to the tengu elder, yes?

That's one of our

The master arranged
an excursion on it last night,

337
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,250
as an apology
for the commotion,

the staff handled it.

[MATSUBA] I had a little
too much to drink,

made matters a bit worse.

So, like an old,
bumbling idiot,

344
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,500
I fell right off
the side of the vessel.

you took care of me

on the ground,

to cook me a meal.

For that, I became
quite fond of you.

And so, sweet Aoi,

352
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,291
I would like you
to take this gift.

Is this thing
really that valuable?

This is the tengu's
most treasured fan,

360
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,458
that I told you
about last night.

361

By rights, it belonged to Shiro.

You sure about this?

Judging by the reaction
in the room,

365
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,083
that fan's incredibly precious.

that you pay off

[MATSUBA] No, the least

If you do mean
to take on Shiro's debts,

to give that fan to him.

00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,625
I do wanna open
my own restaurant

485
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,166
in the annex building.

486
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,875
I think there are
a lot of people

487
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,583
who would wanna eat my food.

488
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,791
Maybe you should
give them that chance.

489
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,041
I just wanna repay
my grandfather's debt on my own.

490
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,875
Please let me.

491
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,833

00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,500
Wow! No way! We're flying!

494
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,916
This is the hidden realm?

495
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,458
[MASTER] It's not going
to be an easy task.

496
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,000
A human has never run
a restaurant for <i>ayakashi</i>

497
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,000
in the hidden realm before.

498
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,458
I'm determined to work hard.

499
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,375
Please let me do it.

500
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,458
Very well, then.

501
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,541
You can give it a try.

502
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,083
Thanks!

503
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,750

What? Aoi?

504
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,750
Are you starting your own
restaurant in the hidden realm?

505
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,541
You can't give cucumber pieces
to anyone else but me,

506
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,708
you got that?
