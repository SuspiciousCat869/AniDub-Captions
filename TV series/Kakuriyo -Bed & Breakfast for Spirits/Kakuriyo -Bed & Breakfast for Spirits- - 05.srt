00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,416
[AOI]
I'll leave the food in case

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,125
you change your mind
and decide to eat.

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,416
I'm going to see Suzuran.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,625
[AKATSUKI] No!
You stay away from Suzuran!

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,958
See that?

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,958
Your spiritual power won't ever
come back if you don't eat.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,875
[AKATSUKI]
I can't stand to look at you!

8
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,750
Your face is so much like
Shiro's that it makes me sick.

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,375
Every bit as smug and cocky.

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,166
You're a filthy human,
exactly like your grandfather!

11
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:17,125
[shamisen music]

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,791
[AOI]
Hi, Suzuran!

13
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,875
It's me, Aoi!

14
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,458
Oh...

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,625
[giggles]

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,500
[AOI]
Well, I hope you enjoy it!

17
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,166
Oh, this looks so beautiful!

18
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,791
I hear you've taken it
upon yourself

19
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,583
to try nursing my fool
of a brother back to health.

20
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,875
I have, as a matter of fact.

21
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,583
He's gonna be okay,

22
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,333
if I convince him
to eat and rest.

23
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,291
Thanks for taking care
of Akatsuki.

24
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,291
This ice cream is delicious.

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,375
When I was in the hidden realm,

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,041
Shiro used to bring me
some every once in a while.

27
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,833
He knew that it was my favorite.

28
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,500
If you don't mind my asking,
where did you meet him?

29
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,416
In the apparent realm.

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,166
He was such a kind man.

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,666
He helped my brother and me
more than we might even realize.

32
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,708
Seriously?

33
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,333
Without a doubt.

34
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,000
The Humans had killed
the rest of our family,

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,208
so Akatsuki and
I wandered Japan.

36
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:25,625
We were desperate
to find a safe place to live.

37
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,125
My brother never
forgave humankind,

38
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,708
so he would attack them to
increase his spiritual power.

39
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,041
Though, I suppose,

40
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,625
he was doing it
to protect me, as well.

41
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,250
[SUZURAN]
And then, one day,

42
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,250
Shiro came into our lives.

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,750
[SUZURAN] He seemed to
appear out of the blue.

44
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,000
And, amazingly,
he beat my brother,

45
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,083
who had become
a very powerful <i>yokai.</i>

46
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,500
[SUZURAN] Then he took us
both home with him,

47
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,500
and cooked us a fantastic meal.

48
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,666
That's how he became
part of our lives.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,958
I see.

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,208
So, Grandpa was always

51
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,958
compassionate toward
<i>ayakashi</i> , then.

52
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,958
By the way,
what did he cook for you?

53
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,666
Dumplings! Why?

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,958
I have a great idea.

55
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,458
Grandpa's dumpling
recipe is unmatched.

56
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,291

[grunting]

59
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,250
[AKATSUKI]
Stop!

60
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,291
What are you feeding her?

61
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,291
[groans]

62
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,208
Shiro made us dumplings.

63
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,416
They're amazing,
you should have some!

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,375
[groans]

65
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,041
[SHIRO chuckles]

66
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,333
[SUZURAN]
Shiro said we could stay.

67
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,041
I wanted to,
but Akatsuki took convincing.

68
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,500
[SUZURAN] Thanks so much for
letting us live here with you.

69
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,708
Brother, come sign your name
on the contract!

70
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,000
[AKATSUKI]
I refuse to trust a human!

71
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,125
[SUZURAN] At the time,
we were still very young

72
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,500
and didn't have much
experience with work.

73
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
But, he called us
domestic slaves.

74
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,458
He gave us chores,

75
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,166
and let us remain by his side.

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,000
Slaves? But, that's... awful!

77
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,166
I hope Grandpa didn't do

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,083
anything terrible
to either of you.

79
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,166
[giggling]

80
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,708
I promise he did nothing worse

81
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,291
than assigning us
simple household duties.

82
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,583
[SUZURAN]
Every once in a while,

83
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,166
when my brother would cook...

84
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,000
[SUZURAN]
...Shiro would scold him.

85
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,708
He didn't like how Brother
seasoned the food.

86
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,958
When you fight,
winning's the only goal.

87
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,708
You must focus on nothing else.

88
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,791
[groans]

89
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
We should eat now.

90
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,416
[AKATSUKI sighs]

91
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,625
[SUZURAN] Shiro may have
been a bit too hard

92
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,208
on my brother sometimes.

93
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,333
But, on the other hand,

94
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,750
I think Shiro nearly
spoiled me rotten.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,041
[SUZURAN laughs]

96
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,166
[SUZURAN]
Shiro, look! It's wonderful!

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,500
--Akatsuki signed his name!
--Hey, what's wrong with you?!

--[SUZURAN giggles]
--That's rude! Please, Suzuran!

99
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,625
[SUZURAN]
It was nice.

100
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,458
That was the first time
we'd known peace in ages.

101
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,208
Since the day we left home.

102
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,208
I hoped it would last forever.

103
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,125
[SUZURAN]
Of course, nothing does.

104
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,208
--Huh? What's wrong?
--Huh?

105
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,458
[SUZURAN]
That's when he told us.

106
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,000
We could no longer
stay with him,

107
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,125
and had to go live
in the hidden realm.

108
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,250
But, why?! Explain yourself!

109
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,250
I can't do it!

110
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,750
I won't!

111
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,375
[crying]

112
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,791
[SHIRO]
The apparent realm is too harsh.

113
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,708
It's unkind here.

114
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,541
You must go.

115
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,166
[SUZURAN]
The Master Innkeeper arranged

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,333
our passage to the hidden realm.

117
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,791
That's how we met him.

118
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,250
[SUZURAN]
When I first arrived,

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,666
I worked here
as a room attendant.

120
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,083
[AOI]
Really?

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,666
And then I heard a rumor,

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,000
that Shiro liked
to visit the capital.

123
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,416
So I quit,
and began training hard

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,166
to become the number one
geisha in Youto.

125
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,708
But, it seemed that
as soon as I felt

126
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,291
I had truly mastered my craft,

127
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,250
Shiro suddenly stopped
coming to see me,

128
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,750
and I had no idea why.

129
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,916
I do. Probably because
that's when

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,958
he had to start
taking care of me.

131
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,083
Before he took us in,

132
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,250
Shiro had always lived
by himself.

133
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,375
That was the main reason
I felt so strongly

134
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,375
that I needed
to be by his side.

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,541
But then I heard he was caring
for his granddaughter.

136
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,583
[SUZURAN sighs]

137
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,125
[SUZURAN]
And I felt so relieved.

138
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,750
I knew he wasn't alone.

139
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,583
He had his family around him.

140
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,208
[AOI] Suzuran, are you going
back to the apparent realm?

141
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,000
[SUZURAN] Yes. I always
planned to return some day.

142
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,666
[AOI]
But, Grandpa's gone now.

143
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,750
You know that, right?

144
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,250
Humans are ephemeral.

145
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,583
Even someone as strong as Shiro
doesn't stay for long.

146
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,125
The breath of life
is so fleeting.

147
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,625
If he has a grave somewhere,
that is the place I want to be.

148
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,166
I would like to spend the rest
of my days near him,

149
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,458
in the realm where
we lived together.

150
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,916
[AOI]
What about Akatsuki?

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,250
Shouldn't you at least
try to make up before you go?

152
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,083
That would be quite futile.

153
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,958
My brother and I
are both stubborn.

154
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,166
I truly hope that
he can get over it.

155
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,875
[AOI] If those two went
their separate ways

156
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
without reconciling,

157
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,166
it would break my heart.

you haven't poisoned it?!

163
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,041
[AOI] You'll find out
in a few minutes!

164
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,458
[AKATSUKI]
I refuse! I will not drink

165
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,333
that disgusting concoction!

166
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,583
[AOI] You had your chance
to eat tasty food!

167
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,250
[AKATSUKI muffled gurgling]

[panting]

170
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,458
Suzuran is leaving to go
to the apparent realm soon.

171
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,041
[AKATSUKI] Thank you for
telling me what I already know.

172
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,375
[AOI] You're gonna regret it
if you don't say goodbye.

173
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,458
When my grandpa died,
it was so sudden.

174
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,416
I didn't get closure.

175
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,708
He was here one day,
then he was dead.

176
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,916
But, you have that chance
with Suzuran!

177
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,958
[growling]

178
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,875
Why does he still have
so much power over her?

179
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,750
He abandoned both of us!

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,708
So you'd abandon her, too?

181
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,750
It's not gonna be
an easy journey for her,

182
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,000
and her brother
should see her off!

183
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,083
You would regret
not supporting her!

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
[gasps]

185
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,500
[grumbles]

186
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,458
Heh.

187
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,250
Well, okay! Whaddaya say
we cook together then?

188
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,541
Huh?

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,125
[GINJI]
Hi, there!

190
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,708
Good morning to you.

191
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,541
I brought everything
on your list.

192
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,708
Oh, thank you, Ginji!

193
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,083
You have no idea how much
I appreciate that.

194
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,583
You're welcome,
it was no trouble at all.

195
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,791
So, you're making
a batch of Shiro's dumplings?

196
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,375
Smells so good!

197
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,458
Yeah, but this batch is reserved
for Akatsuki and Suzuran.

198
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,208
I see. Got it!

199
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,708
[AOI]
Uh...

200
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,000
I wasn't sure you'd show up!

201
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,208
If I didn't,
you would get on my case.

202
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,958
[AOI]
Now hurry, and put that on.

203
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,875
You can't order me around!

204
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,458
Those slices of dough
look way too thick.

205
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,375
Oh, yeah, you're right.

206
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,375
Next, we need
to flatten them a bit.

207
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,375
[AKATSUKI grunting]

208
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,166
Hey there, calm down!

209
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,041
I need you to
mince this, please.

210
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,208
And mince it I shall!

211
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,708
--[AKATSUKI yells]
--[AOI groans]

212
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,708
Whoa, stop it, that's enough!

213
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,500
What's wrong?
Shiro always told me

214
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,000
that speed is what matters
most when you're mincing.

215
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,000
He was probably just
joking with you.

216
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,166
[AKATSUKI grunts]

217
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,291
Curse that man!

218
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,958
Not too bad at all. 'Kay!

219
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,291
And next, it's time
to fill the dumplings!

220
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,791
[AOI]
Oh, you're left-handed!

221
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,375
You're doing great!

222
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,625
This is not easy.

223
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,041
[sighs]

224
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,375
It takes practice and time.

225
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,708
You'll get it.

226
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,458
I wasn't so great when I
started cooking, either.

227
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,833
But, I learned.

228
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
I used to make dumplings
with Grandpa

229
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,000
the same way
we are right now.

230
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,416
[AKATSUKI]
Shiro hated all the flavors

231
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,375
that we <i>ayakashi</i> like.

232
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,333
He preferred bold,
savory profiles.

233
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,125
[gasps]

234
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,666
He used to complain
all the time about my cooking.

235
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,625
Said it was too bland or sweet.

236
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,750
But he always told me
the exact opposite.

237
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,166
He would say
that plain flavors

238
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,416
and foods with a hint of
sweetness were the best.

239
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,958
That makes sense.

240
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,625
I bet Shiro was tryin'
to protect you from <i>ayakashi.</i>

241
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,708
Are you saying
he intentionally lied to me

242
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,458
about his taste
so that I would get good

243
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,708
at making food
that <i>ayakashi</i> prefer?

244
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,833
Yeah, but I guess
we'll never know.

245
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,875
[AOI sighs]

246
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,416
[AOI] If he wanted
to protect me,

247
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,375
he should've taught me
how to do exorcisms.

248
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,875
That would've been way
more helpful than cooking.

249
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,041
[AKATSUKI] Yeah, but then you
wouldn't have been such a catch

250
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,833
for that master innkeeper,

251
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,916
and Shiro couldn't have
used you as debt collateral.

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,291
[AOI]
Right.

253
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,375
[AKATSUKI] Your grandfather
ran up that giant bill

254
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,125
not very long after I started
working here as a trainee.

255
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,375
He showed up one day
and started running amuck,

256
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,500
eating and drinking
as much as he wanted.

257
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,250
And he broke this pot that was,
like, a national treasure.

258
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,125
[AOI]
Why am I not surprised?

259
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,666
I've never felt so humiliated.

260
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,916
On top of all that,
he offered his granddaughter

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to the master as insurance
for the debt,

262
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,000
like it was the easiest thing
in the world for him to do.

263
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,625
I couldn't believe
the master accepted.

264
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,666
Fantastic!

265
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,750
Well?

266
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,958
[AKATSUKI]
They taste just the same

267
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,541
as they did the day
Shiro saved us.

268
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,500
He fed these to Suzuran and me.

269
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,208
[AKATSUKI] You should bring
some up to Suzuran now,

270
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,208
but don't dare tell her
I made them with you.

271
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,208
What? Come back,
earth spider!

272
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,625
From now on, please
don't call me that anymore.

273
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,833
I do have a name.

274
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,750
I know. You told me
not to say it, remember?

275
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,583
I now grant you permission.

276
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,166
Call me Akatsuki.

277
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,916
I guess I can let him
off the hook

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,583
with helping me clean up.

279
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,250
[SUZURAN]
Brings back memories.

280
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,083
They taste exactly
like Shiro's did.

281
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,625
That flavor, it's perfect.

282
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,708
But more than that,

283
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,750
these dumplings symbolize
a time in my life

284
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,041
when I was the happiest
that I've ever been.

285
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,000
[SUZURAN]
May I ask you,

286
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,000
did my brother help you
make these?

287
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,750
[AOI]
What? How could you tell?

288
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,791
The direction of the folds.

289
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
Akatsuki is left-handed.

290
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,000
There's no fooling you!

291
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,500
He told me not to tell you
he made them, though.

292
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,708
[SUZURAN giggles]
He's the most stubborn man

293
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,166
that I've ever known.

294
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,208
Are you positive you
wanna leave things

295
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,458
with him like this?

296
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,750
I understand how strongly
my brother feels

297
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,750
about me going
to the apparent realm.

298
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,791
So, the fact that
he helped make this dish

299
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,958
so I could remember
Shiro's cooking,

300
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,125
it reminds me
how much he loves me.

301
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,041
That's the only goodbye I need.

302
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,125
And you're okay with being
so far away from him?

303
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,000
[SUZURAN] We are both
grown up now, after all.

304
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,500
He has his own place
in the world

305
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,875
and own dreams to follow,

306
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,166
and I respect him for the pride
he takes in his work

307
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,083
as the front desk manager
here at Tenjin-ya.

308
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,833
Having siblings seems nice.

309
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,416
Even though, from what
I've witnessed,

310
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,250
you do spend lot of your time
worrying about each other.

311
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,541
You know,
it just occurred to me.

312
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,125
You're a bit like
a younger sister

313
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,416
to Akatsuki and myself,
in a way.

314
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
[AOI]
Huh?

315
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,166
Because all three
of us were raised

316
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,916
by the same person,
weren't we?

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,375
That makes us sort of
like a family.

318
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,041

Wait, you want me

You come from

so you know it well.

she wants to be.

keep myself safe from <i>ayakashi.</i>

you leave it here

you to remain

right about that.
