Her fever made her collapse.

00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,708
And, to be perfectly frank,

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,083
everyone around here
pretty much hates O-Ryo,

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,958
so no one else
would look after her.

What about
all her hangers-on?

They just kissed up to her

00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,666
'cause she's the young hostess,

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,375
but they don't really like her.

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,916
She's got more enemies
than friends.

11
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,333
That's terrible.

12
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,875
Makes me sad.

might have time to nurse her.

She's burning up!

I think I remember
hearing from somebody

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,791
that Miss O-Ryo
gets sick easily.

17

Sorry, I should really
be getting back to work.

So, you only recently became
the young hostess, right?

68
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,500
You've been talking
to Kasuga, huh?

69
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,708
I have, and I've been wondering.

70
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,916
Why's this job so great that
you'd make enemies to get it?

71
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,000
[O-RYO] I wanted the master
to notice me.

72
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,958
To think I'm special.

73
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,583
I needed him to be
proud of my success,

74
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,875
so he would see my value.

75

But do you really believe
the young hostess position

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,958
carries that much weight
with the master?

Not the position, per se.

[AOI] I did get permission
to open a restaurant here,

87
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,250
but whether he recognizes
my worth

88
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,708
or not still depends
on how hard I work at that.

89
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,500
Why would you even want
to take care of me like this?

I don't know.

91
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,416
I guess because
Kasuga asked me.

You are such an odd girl.

93
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,250
Normally, if someone you
hate is at a weak point,

94
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,083
you take advantage of it.

Hmph. That'd be too much work.

like the master that much?

kill me for him?

[AOI]
Hm?

104
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,541
I was born
in the northern land,

105
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,625
which is just west
of the northeast land,

where we're sitting now.

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,041
When I was a child,
my family was poor,

108
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,833
so they sent me to a nearby town
to work as a live-in maid.

109
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,541
I was a lowly country girl
with no manners,

110
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,750
so the mistress spent
the majority of her time

111
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,250
punishing me.

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,958
Even so, that was better
than the hunger pangs

As fate would have it,

120
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
I broke an expensive plate that
the mistress had brought back

121
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,958

to give the master as a gift.

122

[O-RYO]
When the mistress got angry

123
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,583
and began
to beat me mercilessly...

[O-RYO] ...the ogre-god master
stepped in to help me.

He treated my wounds,

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,083
and then he made
all the necessary arrangements

127
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,625
so I could leave
the mistress's charge

and come to work as a room
attendant here at Tenjin-ya.

Right.

131

So then the master
has a kind side

that he keeps a secret.

You probably don't know this,

134

that the master has saved.

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,666
[thunder rumbles]

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,291
[AOI]
Mommy! Please come home soon!

161
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,416
[AOI cries]

162
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,500
[AOI]
I'm so hungry, Mommy. Please...

163
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,958
Where did you go?

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,666
[AOI]
All right, then.

165
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,541
[gasps]

166
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,333
[AOI]
What is this?

167
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,833
[gasps]

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,125
[AOI]
It's the bowl from Youto!

169
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,333
This pink bowl
strikes your fancy?

170
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,541
I'll buy it for you.

171
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,916
What? No, it's okay!

172
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,250
[AOI]
Is this from the master?

173
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,375
[AOI]
That reminds me.

174
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,375
I wonder how Suzuran is doing.

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,916
[footsteps]

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,125
[AOI sighing, panting]

177
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,583
[TAKE] Mistress Suzuran's room
is right this way.

178
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,541
[AKATSUKI]
Like hell you are!

179
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,000
[crowd chattering]

180
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,333
What is going on in there?

181
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,833
[AOI]
A giant spider fight?

182
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,958
[AKATSUKI]
Open your eyes, Suzuran!

183
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:25,833
[SUZURAN]
Leave me alone!

184
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,291
I can do as I please!

185
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,208
[AKATSUKI grunting]
You're being ridiculous!

186
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,750
[SUZURAN]
Shut up! You're ridiculous!

187
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,000
You're a fool, Brother!

188
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,708
Hold on, you mean
those spiders are--

189
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,458
[TAKE] Mistress Suzuran
and the manager

190
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,166
are having a siblings' brawl.

191
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,208
[screams]

192
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,125
[AKATSUKI]
Shiro is dead!

193
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,250
Why would you still want to go
to the Apparent Realm?

194
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,500
[SUZURAN]
Why wouldn't I?

195
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,125
I've been working hard for years

196
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,833
to save up enough money
to go back!

197
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,916
It's where all my best memories
of Shiro were made!

198
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,875
Suzuran wins this round.

199
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,208
[AKATSUKI screams]

200
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,291
[MASTER]
Uh?

201
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,791
Aoi, I'm glad you like the bowl,

202
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,541
but I don't think it makes
a very good helmet.

203
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,333
It had never occurred to me
to wear it as a helmet,

204
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,208
and yet, here we are.

205
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,375
[laughs]

206
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,541
[MASTER] You're an amusing
young lady, you know that?

207
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,250
Have you warmed up
enough yet, Aoi?

208
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,541
[AOI sighs]

209
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,208
Yes, thanks.

210
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,625
[MASTER]
I'll make us some tea,

211
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,833
but feel free to have some of
those <i>daifuku</i> while you wait.

212
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,208
I've been wondering
about Akatsuki and Suzuran.

213
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,500
What on earth made them get into

214
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,958
that knock-down-drag-out
fight today?

215
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,708
[MASTER] You're aware that
Akatsuki and Suzuran

216
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,958
are <i>ayakashi</i> from the
Apparent Realm, yes?

217
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,333
[AOI]
Mm-hmm.

218
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,750
[MASTER]
Well, you see,

219
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,083
about 40 years ago,

220
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,458
when Shiro was traveling
between the Apparent Realm

221
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,291
and the hidden one...

222
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
...there was a disturbance

223
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,625
involving a wandering
spider <i>ayakashi</i>

224
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,458
that was attacking humans.

225
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,541
It was trying to find shelter
in the apparent realm.

226
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:34,000
That spider <i>ayakashi</i> was
none other than Akatsuki.

227
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,666
[MASTER] Then, Shiro,
who was traveling aimlessly

228
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,750
between the two worlds,

229
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,000
suddenly appeared
before the spider,

230
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,333
who got more than
he bargained for.

231
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,208
[MASTER] After that, the story
is that Shiro took

232
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,416
in the siblings
and cared for them.

233
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,875
But that doesn't make sense.

234
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,416
Then why would Akatsuki
hate my grandpa?

235
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,791
[MASTER]
I'm not sure.

236
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,166
I can't speak for him.

237
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,208
But he says he never wants
to serve a guy

238
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,750
like that ever again.

239
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,750
Well, I can't say
that surprises me.

240
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,166
Even now, Suzuran feels
an intense loyalty to Shiro

241
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,333
and claims to be forever
in his debt.

242
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,041
[AOI]
I can see that.

243
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,750
[MASTER] I took the two of them
back to the hidden realm with me

244
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,166
at your grandfather's request.

245
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,083
[MASTER] That's when Akatsuki
started working at Tenjin-ya,

246
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,416
and Suzuran began her training
in the capital

247
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,000
to become a geisha.

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,208
[MASTER]
Shiro often visited the capital,

249
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,958
where he could see Suzuran dance

250
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,333
and listen to her play
the shamisen.

251
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,041
But, according to Suzuran.

252
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,791
When Shiro passed, he hadn't
been to see her in ten years.

253
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,791
[AOI]
Ten years?

254
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,500
Do you think she's really going
back to the Apparent Realm?

255
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,541
It would appear that she's
determined to do as much.

256
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,125
But doesn't she care
that Akatsuki's so against it?

257
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,666
[MASTER]
Suzuran is no longer a child.

258
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,500
She's going there with money
that she earned on her own.

259
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,500
So how can he stop her?

260
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,291
You're right, he might not
be able to stop her.

261
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,083
[AOI] But the Apparent Realm
is rough for <i>ayakashi.</i>

262
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,625
The ones I see are always hungry
and never seem to be at peace,

263
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,000
so it makes sense
that he would be worried.

264
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,291
[MASTER]
By the way.

265
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,291
I heard you're taking care
of O-Ryo.

266
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
[AOI]
Yeah, she's got a little fever.

267
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,875
She took some medicine,

268
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,375
so she just needs to rest
another day or two.

269
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,166
Thank you for the tea.

270
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,083
Are you seriously planning
to take away O-Ryo's title?

271
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,000
And does that upset you?

272
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,291
You're like a father to her,

273
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,666
so she feels
a deep affection for you.

274
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,625
That's why she was
jealous of me.

275
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,083
She didn't know how to
handle it,

276
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,083
and because of that,
she made some mistakes.

277
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,000
[MASTER]
I am not O-Ryo's father.

278
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,833
She must decide whether
she wants to be

279
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,125
an independent young hostess
or someone who relies on me.

280
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,083
She cannot be both,
and she should know that.

281
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, I understand.

282
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,666
To think that you're caring
for an <i>ayakashi</i>

283
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,166
who meant you harm.

284
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
Shiro was never one to do
what I expected him to, either.

285
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,333
Well, speaking of which,

286
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,625
you bought me
the cut glass bowl,

287
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,750
even though I specifically
asked you not to.

288
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,333
[MASTER]
What, you don't like it?

289
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,291
No, I didn't say that.

290
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,750
I knew it.

291
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,208
I love it, actually. [giggles]

292
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,166
I like when you smile.

293
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,750
[AOI]
Hey. What's your favorite food,

294
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,916
and no jokes
about human entrails!

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
What if that's
really my favorite?

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,166
I wanna make a "thank you"
dish, but I won't cook people!

297
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,541
I have a strict policy

298
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,250
of not revealing my favorite
food without just cause.

299
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,125
I wouldn't want anyone
to use it against me.

300
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,583
What? That's ridiculous!

301
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,958
[MASTER chuckling]

302
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,625
[MASTER] Well, you must be
getting tired now.

303
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,583
You should go back and get
some much-needed sleep.

304
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,291
O-Ryo is using my quarters
in the annex.

305
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,666
Is there somewhere else
I could stay?

306
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,666
[MASTER] Would you like
to sleep in my room?

307
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,791
I can have another pillow
brought in, my lovely bride.

308
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,125
Nope, I'll pass!

309
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
I'd rather camp out in an alley,
thank you, sir.

310
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
Yes, well,
your restaurant journey

311
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,666
starts tomorrow,
so work hard.

312
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,250
Or the alley, it is.

313
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,291
Hey, Master, I have a teensy
little favor to ask you.

314
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,625
A rare occurrence, what is it?

315
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,833
[AOI]
That matcha.

316
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,750
Do you think I could
have some of it?

317
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,541
I'd like to make a
matcha-flavored tofu ice cream.

318
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,208
[AOI]
All right!

319
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,250
This is awesome,
thank you so much Master!

320
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,416
[AOI giggling]

321
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,916
I never would have
guessed that,

322
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,333
of all the gifts I bestowed,
this would be her favorite.

323
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,541
[AOI giggling]

324
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,625
Uh...

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,791
Hey, what room is Suzuran
staying in right now?

326
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,666
She's in temporary quarters.

327
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,375
Repairs on the Large
Camellia Room

328
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,416
should be completed
by tomorrow.

329
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,791
I see.

330
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,333
Do you wish to go back
to the Apparent Realm?

331
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,041
Are you still attached to it,
like Suzuran?

332
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,208
I'm human.

333
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,041
So, yes, I am attached.

334
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,750
It's natural that I'd want
to go back someday.

335
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,000
But, why?

336
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,916
Well, why wouldn't I?

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,291
With Shiro dead and gone,

338
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,041
it isn't as though you have
family there any longer.

339
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,625
[scoffs] Sensitivity isn't
your strong suit.

340
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,416
I'm still a student, after all.

341
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,291
I want to go back
and finish school.

342
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,000
I just figured I should gauge
your feelings on the matter.

343
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,125
[scoffs]

344
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,750
[groans] I slept funny.

345
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,583
Oh, nice, her fever's broken!

346
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,041
[AOI yawning]

347
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:00,916
[gasps]

348
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,750
[AOI]
Oh my goodness!

349
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,375
Are you Akatsuki?

350
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,875
[AKATSUKI shudders]
Don't speak my name.

351
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,291
Don't even talk to me!

352
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,375
Have you been sitting out here
since yesterday?

353
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,750
[AKATSUKI] Back off!
Just leave me alone, will ya?

354
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,833
Hey!

355
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,500
The earth spider manager
isn't as tough

356
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,000
as I thought he would be.

357
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,375
I mean, his little sister
beat him up.

358
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,041
[AKATSUKI]
Stop! How dare you, human?

359
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,875
Let me go at once! I'll eat you!

360
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,958
[AOI]
Oh, calm down, or I'll eat you!

361
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,750
I'll cook with soy sauce
and sugar

362
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,375
and make a tasty <i>tsukudani</i>
with steamed rice!

363
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,416
Or how 'bout I just

364
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,875
deep fry you
and eat you legs first,

365
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,625
like a nice soft-shell crab?

366
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,500
[AKATSUKI gasps]

367
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,791
[AOI]
Okay, let's see.

368
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,750
"There are three main treatments
for injured earth spiders.

369
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,208
Treatment one, leave them
to heal on their own.

370
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,541
Treatment two,
administer spiritual power.

371
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,583
Treatment three, administer
foods with high concentrations

372
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,208
of spiritual power." All right.

373
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,333
Hey, earth spiders
just eat, like,

374
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,750
bugs and stuff, don't they?

375
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,000
[AKATSUKI]
Like hell we eat bugs!

376
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
I'm starving here!

377
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,583
Aoi, make me something
to eat, would ya?

378
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,958
[AOI]
Whoa, why are you acting like

379
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,041
we're friends all the sudden?

380
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,291
What do you want?

381
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,000
Something cold, like your soul?

382
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,541
Don't be rude.

383
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,708
I'm not sick anymore, so I don't
have to stick to ice cream.

384
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,041
What I'm craving is
a bowl of <i>oyakodon.</i>

385
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,916
And I mean a giant bowl!

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,250
Okay, but don't blame me
if you gain weight.

387
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,000
[O-RYO] I don't even care
anymore, just give me food!

388
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,750
And, not just any food,

389
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,666
I want <i>oyakodon</i> , in case you
didn't hear me the first time!

390
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,750
Oh, yeah.

391
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,291
Do you want some, too,
earth spider?

392
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,500
[AKATSUKI]
Who'd eat a meal made

393
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,791
by Shiro Tsubaki's
granddaughter?

394
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,500
Huh? Wait.

395
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,791
Akatsuki, that's you?

396
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,666
[O-RYO]
Look, don't be daft.

397
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,666
Aoi's cooking has
a special component

398
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,416
that can restore
spiritual power.

399
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,625
You should just eat it,

400
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,791
or you might not get
your full strength back.

401
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,000
[AKATSUKI]
Shut up, snow woman.

402
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,791
You got demoted
for being "daft,"

403
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,958
so don't talk to me like
you're still the young hostess.

404
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,833
Wow, so sorry to care about your
healing, Attitude-tsuki.

405
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,791
[mixing]

406
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,083
I can't believe my cooking
really has that kind of power.

407
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,791
Well, it means you're truly
Shiro's granddaughter.

408
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,458
No doubt about that.

409
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,875
[AKATSUKI scoffs]

410
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,625
I still don't understand
what you mean.

411
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,333
How does my cooking
have spiritual power?

412
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,375
Is it the same way food
restores stamina in humans?

413
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,875
Oh, but more importantly,
how does it taste?

414
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Well, to be honest with you,

415
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,333
I would say this dish
isn't half bad.

416
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,750
Thank you for the food.

417
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,291
Well, now it's time for me
to go back to bed.

418
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,166
Huh? Miss O-Ryo, succumbing
to her despair?

419
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,125
[O-RYO] I'm not the young
hostess anymore, so, yes.

420
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,875
I'm just a snow woman
who's confined to her quarters.

421
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,916
Which means, heh, I can to do

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,500
whatever I want today,
as long as I stay in my room!

423
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:12,833
[chuckles]

424
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,375
[CHIBI sighing] That ice cream
sure looks delicious.

425
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,791
I'm hungry.
Can I have some, too?

426
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,875
And when do I get to see
my sweet Miss Aoi?
