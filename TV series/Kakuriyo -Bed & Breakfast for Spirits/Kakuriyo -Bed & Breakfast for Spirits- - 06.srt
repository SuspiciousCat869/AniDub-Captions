00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,125
Aoi, please.

162
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,625
Give me some cucumbers
right away.

163
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,500
Must binge now.

164
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,666
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom...

165
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,416
[SASUKE]
Thank you, that was delicious.

166
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,833
I'm so full I could
almost burst!

167
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,125
[AOI] I'm so glad!
Well, come by any time!

168
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,708
I'm always happy to feed you,

169
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,000
a growing young man
needs to be nourished!

170
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,625
You're kind,
but I'm not young in the least.

171
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,958
Especially in your terms.

172
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,666
I'm many decades
older than you.

173
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,583
[AOI]
Huh?

174
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,041
I'm the same age
as Master Shiro.

175
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,666
No way, you're super cute
for your age!

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,166
If you can believe it,
I've been working in Tenjin-ya

177
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,458
ever since the day I was born,

178
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,708
which was more than
80 years ago.

179
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,458
[AOI]
Eighty years ago?

180
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,958
Indeed, but still.

181
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,250
I went through a rebellious
period in my younger years.

182
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,625
[gasps]

183
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,125
[SASUKE] Master Shiro was always
one of my main champions.

184
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,750
[AOI]
Grandpa was?

185
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,500
We used to sneak into
the kitchen and help ourselves.

186
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,041
We'd play pranks on the guests,
and peek into the women's bath!

187
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,583
Uh! That last one
was Shiro's pastime.

188
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,000
I never participated.

189
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,125
Yeah, sure you didn't.

190
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,791
Master Shiro and I
would start trouble

191
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,500
and get scolded
for it all the time!

192
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,625
And, yet,

193
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,666
I admired your grandfather.

194
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,458
He was a mentor to me.

195
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,666
He was brave.

196
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,166
Afraid of no <i>ayakashi,</i>
and so strong,

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,833
he could wrestle them
all to the ground!

198
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,291
He argued well enough
to silence anyone!

199
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:13,166
Your grandfather
certainly was a real man!

200
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,333
He loved to show off
how fast he could run,

201
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,708
like a thundering river.

202
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,791
He put all us kamaitachi
to shame.

203
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,833
[SASUKE]
Mistress Aoi.

204
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,958
Huh?

205
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,208
I must say,

206
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,458
you resemble your
grandfather a great deal.

207
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,125
It's uncanny.

208
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,750
Yeah, that's what they say.

209
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,625
[AOI sighs]

210
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,000
[SASUKE] We'll be sure to
tighten up security around here,

211
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,833
so you can rest assured
that you're safe.

--'Night.
--I apprecia-- Uh!

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
Typical kamaitachi.

214
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,750
Just in case
of some unforeseen emergency,

215
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,291
I should get in a little
practice swinging my fan.

216
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,625
[MASTER]
An assassin?

217
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,375
Who was the culprit?

218
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,250
[SASUKE] The others went
in pursuit of him,

219
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,083
but I was told that
they acted carelessly

220
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,083
and let him slip away.

221
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,250
It appears that he's
highly skilled.

222
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,041
Is Aoi safe?

223
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,375
Yes.

224
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,958
She treated my wounds
and fed me delicious food.

225
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,583
Ah, of course.

226
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,166
That sounds like her.

227
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,250
You must remain
vigilant and continue

228
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,250
to guard Aoi and Moonflower.

[AOI] So, this is
the Ginten district, then?

241
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,250
I've been wanting to check
it out ever since I saw it

from way up in the sky!

too far away from us!

Don't worry!

She really terrifies
me, that girl.

[OSONO]
The master's recent engagement

257
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,375
has been quite the hot
topic of discussion

258
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,625
around here
in the women's club.

259
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,916
I heard that all the girls

who wanted a chance
with the master

261

were so disappointed

262

that they stayed in their beds
for three whole days.

263

You're such a trouble maker,
Miss Ogre Bride.

That's a lot of ogre masks.

The master innkeeper

He's popular,
so ogre masks are too.

[ROKUSUKE sniffs]
I know that smell.

This is Master Rokusuke

They sell us fruit and
vegetables at wholesale prices.

We get our produce
from his farm?

be your young wife,

Indeed, I'm impressed.

I sensed the

00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,916
from our cucumbers.

Huh? Sensed cucumbers?

She appeared to be a human,
so I just put it together.

Master Rokusuke you saw.

For your safety, remain
with me when we're out.

Aoi feels bad enough,
so, let's move past it!

321
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,125
And the chicken tempura plates
are going to get cold.

322
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,958
--[AOI] Let's eat!
--[GINJI] Yes, let's eat!

323
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,458
This chicken's so good!
Such a light flavor!

324
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,208
Yes, this area is well
known for its tempura.

325
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,875
Do you know
how to make tempura?

326
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,333
We could add some dishes
to the Moonflower menu.

327
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,291
I do, and I'll consider that!

328
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,458
By the way,

329
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,416
why did you switch
to your childlike form?

330
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,291
[GINJI]
What?

331
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,458
[chuckles]

332
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,083
Why? Is that bad?

333
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,000
Ginji uses his
shapeshifting skills

334
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,166
to get close to people

335
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,375
and sometimes
to take advantage of them.

336
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,458
Heh.

337
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,875
When he wants me
to pay for his meals,

338
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,250
he always conveniently
chooses this form.

339
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,416
[AOI]
Great strategy.

340
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,583
[GINJI]
Well... Heh, heh...

341
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,333
You two really crack me up.

342
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,916
You seem to have such
a friendly relationship.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that because you've been
working together so long?

344
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,333
Actually, I haven't been
employed at Tenjin-ya

345
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,916
for very long.

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,500
I believe it's only been
about 50 years or so.

347
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,416
Fifty years is a lot!

348
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,375
Ginji was working
for our top competitor

349
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,666
before he came
to join my staff,

350
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,500
but then I swooped in
and poached him away.

351
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,708
[AOI]
Is that true?

352
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,708
Well, that's not
the whole story.

353
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,291
Ah. What a tasty meal!

354
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,791
Jeez, do these
stairs ever end?

355
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,541
[GINJI] It's great to exercise
after dinner!

356
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,958
This particular
Ogre Gate Iwato Shrine

357
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,041
brings divine favor
for matchmaking.

358
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,125
Now is the perfect time
for you to visit it.

359
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,625
What? I don't understand.

360
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,333
[GINJI] This shrine's
matchmaking benefits businesses.

361
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,541
It shines good fortune

362
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,291
on professional networks
and associations.

363
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,833
That makes sense.

364
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,625
[MASTER] Aoi, good business
is about much more

365
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,500
than simply turning a profit.

366
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,291
That's only one small part.

367
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,000
You must make yourself
indispensable to clients.

368
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,250
Create deep relationships

369
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,083
and bring value
to every encounter.

370
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,708
That's important.

371
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,125
Interesting. I like that.

372
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,083
I hope Moonflower
brings great joy

373
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,041
to everyone who
comes to eat there.

374
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,125
[AOI]
Me, too!

375
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,958
[AOI gasping]

376
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,500
[AOI] I've encountered
all kinds of <i>ayakashi,</i>

377
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,375
especially since I came
to the hidden realm.

378
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,041
I know I'll be meeting so many
more in the days still to come.

379
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,583
I want <i>ayakashi</i>
to enjoy Moonflower,

380
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,625
and to feel happy every time
they come through its doors.

381
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,625
[AOI]
Welcome, everyone!

382
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,500
I want to thank each of you
for being here tonight!

383
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,750
Because of you
Moonflower's open now,

384
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,333
and I hope you enjoy
celebrating with us!

385
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
[MATSUBA]
Well, my friends. Here's to Aoi,

386
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,541
and to Moonflower's success.

387
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,458
May its prosperity never end!

388
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,458
Cheers!

389
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,791
[ALL]
Cheers!

390
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,750
[AOI laughing]

391
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,083
[indistinct chatter]

392
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,375
[MATSUBA]
No, I'll never leave!

393
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:16,208
You can get along without me!
I wanna stay with Aoi! Stop it!

394
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,083
You can always come back
and eat here again!

395
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,000
[MATSUBA]
...you put me down!

396
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,041
[sighs] I'm beat!

397
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,500
[GINJI]
Well, Aoi...

398
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,333
Huh?

399
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,875
I would call that a success!

400
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
[cutlery clattering]

401
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,166
[MATSUBA] Aoi's food is
the best I've ever tasted!

402
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,458
[AOI]
I agree.

403
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,375
I'm so glad they
enjoyed themselves.

404
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,708
They'll be back, right?

405
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,625
I would love to have
some regulars.

406
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,125
I've just gotta
keep working hard.

407
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,416
[GINJI]
Yes.

408
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,250
[rain pouring]

409
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,833
[CHIBI]
It's been a whole week now.

410
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,166
And nobody's come here to eat!

411
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,958
[AOI]
You don't have to rub it in.

412
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,041
Should we turn this
into a cucumber stand?

413
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,500
[CHIBI]
Aw, yeah! A cucumber stand?

414
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,750
I'm all for that!

415
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,666
We'll change the name!

416
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,958
Hurry and make a new sign!

417
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,916
[GINJI]
Aoi! We've got a major problem!

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,708
We've just been summoned,

419
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,791
by the head
of the accounting office.

420
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,916
Uh?

421
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:43,583
[steady tapping]

422
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,125
Um. Hi.

423
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,000
[tap]

424
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,333
[BYAKUYA]
Yes, how do you do?

425
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,875
I'm the chief of accounting
here at Tenjin-ya.

426
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,416
I'm in charge of this
establishment's finances.

427
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,750
My name is Byakuya.

428
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,833
So...

429
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,208
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

430
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,916
[CHIBI squeals]

431
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,541
Aoi had to go see
a scary-looking man!

432
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,833
What's gonna happen?

433
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,083
Is Moonflower gonna
be forced to close?

434
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,875
Aoi, you've gotta
do something!
