[AOI]
Uh.

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,750
There you are!

3
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,500
What happened?

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,875
You just hang in there,
and we'll take care of you!

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,166
Ginji!

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,166
[GINJI panting]

7
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,625
Poor fox man.

8
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,083
Oh, Ginji. I feel terrible.

9
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,291
I didn't even notice
you were sick.

10
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,791
I'm so sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

11
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,375
[panting]

12
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,500
Mm?

13
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,500
Oh, it's you, Aoi.

14
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,416
Ginji!

15
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,750
[GINJI]
I'm okay, don't worry.

16
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,500
Easy! Don't try to get up.

17
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,166
Just wait right here.

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,333
Chibi, look after
Ginji for a bit.

19
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Sure, boss, ya got it!

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,666
[chopping]

21
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,583
[AOI]
He's gonna be okay.

22
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,208
O-Ryo and Akatsuki both got
well, so I know Ginji will, too.

23
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,208
I hope so, at least.

24
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,833
Aoi, look!

25
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,166
I think fox man might be
feeling a little better!

26
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,875
I'm so glad.

27
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,625
You're back already?

28
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,333
Yeah. I'm sorry you're sick.

29
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,166
Please don't be.

30
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,916
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,541
I never meant to cause
you such anxiety.

32
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,416
But, honestly,
I'm feeling much better.

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,791
You sure?

34
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,791
What's it mean that
you're still in child form?

35
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,291
I'm not up to 100%,

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,583
but I slept a little,
so I'm refreshed.

37
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,375
[AOI]
I made you this.

38
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,250
Eating will help.

39
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,625
Uh?

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,125
It's a cold soup.

41
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,708
A dish local to
the Miyazaki area.

42
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,166
That's cucumber!

43
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,416
Yeah, you're right.

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,833
Here, a little
something for you, too.

45
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,250
Aoi, you're so nice!

46
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,458
It smells pretty delicious.

47
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,750
Thanks very much.

48
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,458
The flavor is sort of familiar
and comforting to me,

49
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,000
and I can really sense
your caring spiritual power

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,000
as I eat it.

51
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,291
I can't believe
you can feel that.

52
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,500
This is wonderful.

53
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,125
Are you sure you like it?

54
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,291
I'm positive.

55
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,500
It tastes delightful,

56
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,250
but the most impressive
quality of your food

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,041
is the power that you're
able to infuse into it.

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,958
I feel all better now.

59
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,291
Thanks to your great cooking,

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm already back at 100%.

61
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,375
[AOI sighs]
I'm relieved.

62
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:33,666
Aoi, there's no reason
to cry over me.

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,833
[gasps]

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,958
[AOI]
That touch...

65
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,583
[AOI]
It's gentle and cool.

66
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,500
Pale, thin fingers.

67
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,833
Somehow, I know
the feel of them.

68
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,708
It's not very often
that you cry.

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm not sure I've
witnessed it before.

70
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,916
[AOI] Uh, well, seeing you
sick made me feel helpless,

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,333
but it was more than that.

72
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,750
When I thought about something
bad happening to you,

73
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,958
I just broke down.

74
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Please forgive me.

75
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,916
I'm so happy you're better.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,250
I don't like to see the ones
I care about in pain.

77
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,750
Apologies. I feel terrible.

78
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,291
I wouldn't ever want
to cause you to suffer.

79
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,708
No, don't say that!

80
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,750
You do so much to
keep me from suffering,

81
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,291
like helping at Moonflower!

82
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,208
I've been able to stay afloat,

83
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,500
and that's all because
of your support.

84
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
No, not mine.

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,958
I could never have
done it alone!

86
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,833
I know for a fact that all
the employees at Tenjin-ya

87
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,000
trust and depend on
you, every day!

88
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,250
[GINJI]
No.

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,000
Wha...?

90
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,666
I worked for Orio-ya,

91
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,791
which happens to be this inn's
main rival, remember?

92
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,333
Sometimes I worry that the
staff here doesn't trust me

93
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,000
because of that.

94
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,333
That couldn't be
further from the truth!

95
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,541
[GINJI sighs]

96
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,166
[AOI] I don't know
all the circumstances

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,500
of the rivalry between
the two inns,

98
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,958
but I do know I
can depend on you.

99
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,541
I trust you implicitly,
and I really need you, Ginji!

100
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,583
That means a lot.

101
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,333
Are you... my senior, then?
Or my boss?

102
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,041
Or maybe my teacher?

103
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,500
None of those is right.

104
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,958
But, what are you to me?

105
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,125
I do know that you're
always there to guide me,

106
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,083
it seems, no matter what.

107
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,125
Nonetheless.
I admire you more than

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,041
pretty much anyone
I've ever met, Ginji.

109
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,166
Heh. I wish I could put
this more eloquently,

110
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,125
but you're a phenomenal person.

111
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,375
Huh? I don't quite see
what's so special about me

112
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,958
saying how I feel about you.

113
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,625
Means a lot to me,
and I do love Moonflower.

114
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,166
I cherish the place that you
and I have built from scratch.

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,208
Because we did it together.

116
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,708
I love it, too.

117
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,291
And one of the main reasons
I do is that you're with me.

118
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,083
You're there to share the work.

119
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,333
Oh, Aoi.

120
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,333
Thank you for just
being who you are.

121
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,166
[gasps]

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,916
Thanks for being
you, too, Ginji,

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,208
and for always supporting me.

124
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,916
Oh, I forgot.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The master will be coming back
to Tenjin-ya later tonight.

126
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,333
That's right. I'm glad he's
finally returning home.

127
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,875
You look happy, Aoi.

128
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,750
I am.

129
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,208
I'm excited because I asked him

130
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,541
to run a bunch of
errands for me.

131
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,750
Sending him on missions?

132
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,166
All right. Back to work.
Gotta get ready for Master.

133
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,083
But you were
just unconscious.

134
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:22,958
It's fine.

135
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,208
I'm all better, thanks to you.

136
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,500
[AOI] I hope my food
gives him energy.

137
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,625
And restores his strength, too,

138
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,916
even if it's only
for a little while.

139
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,500
[CUSTOMER 13A] Thank you, Miss.
What a delicious meal!

140
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,333
[AOI] Thanks, I appreciate
your business, sir!

141
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,375
[AOI gasps]
That's the master's ship!

142
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,166
[HATORI laughs] You haven't
changed one bit, Master!

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,250
[AOI]
Is that Hatori?

144
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,666
[MASTER]
If you miss Tenjin-ya that much,

145
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,125
why not come back to work here?

146
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,166
We'd be happy to welcome
you with open arms.

147
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,083
[HATORI]
Heh! You're such a flatterer.

148
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,166
Akatsuki's the front desk
manager here now.

149
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,083
So, there's no longer
a place for me.

150
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,208
[AOI]
Huh.

151
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,458
Oh, are they playing
a game of Go?

152
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,791
[MASTER]
How are things at Orio-ya?

153
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,875
[HATORI] Hm. The main objective
at that place is to work hard

154
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,750
to surpass Tenjin-ya,
or at least catch up.

155
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,291
Everybody there seems
especially tense.

156
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,833
[HATORI]
So, to answer you about Ginji--

157
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,041
[AOI gasping]

158
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,125
[MASTER gasps]

[HATORI gasps]

160
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,458
[AOI]
Uh...

00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,250
[MASTER]
Uh.

00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,208
That's quite an entrance.

164
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
I never imagined that you'd
crash through the door

165
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,916
like a bull, Missy!

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My love has continually
displayed a knack

167
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,125
for taking <i>ayakashi</i> by surprise.

168
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,000
After all, she is an ogre bride.

169
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,541
Uh, what?!

170
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,291
I only here came to deliver
the bento that I promised you.

171
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,000
But if you keep making fun of
me, I might just eat it myself.

172
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,000
[gasps] I wasn't making
fun of you at all, Aoi.

173
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,500
A bento handmade and
delivered by his beloved wife?

174
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,500
Huh?

175
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah, that's how
it works with us.

176
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,666
--Huh?
--[HATORI laughs]

177
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,500
[HATORI]
Right, friends,

178
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,000
I guess I should head
back to my room now.

179
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,500
Uh, I do apologize for
interrupting your board game.

180
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Nah, I was losing.

181
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,541
But thanks.

182
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,041
U-Uh...

183
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,500
Master.

184
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,500
Let's not forget to finish
our discussion from before.

185
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,958
[MASTER]
Right. I'll remember.

186
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,250
See ya later.

187
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,333
You too, Missy.

188
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,583
So, Aoi...

189
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,500
I ran every single errand
that you asked of me.

190
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,750
[AOI]
Hm?

191
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,291
[gasps] Oh, thank you!

192
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,500
I fulfilled my duty
perfectly, didn't I?

193
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,708
Obtaining the dry yeast
was even more of a feat

194
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,416
than I had imagined it would be.

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,541
But I know that the bread
you'll bake with it will make

196
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,166
the adventure worthwhile,
to say the very least.

197
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,125
--[AOI gasps]
--Uh?

198
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,666
Actually, Ginji helped, too.

199
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,791
Aoi, look!

200
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,041
I found something
in the hidden realm

201
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,583
that could be a great
dry yeast substitute!

202
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,708
This is for saké.

203
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,291
Around here we call
it yeast starter!

204
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,916
So I can bake bread
anytime that I want to now--

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,083
Uh?

206
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,625
[MASTER exhales]

207
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,875
Uh, but dry yeast is
really the preferred way

208
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,083
to make authentic bread.

209
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,625
So, it will be the best
thing to use. 'Kay?

210
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,958
Ah, is that true?

211
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,000
Then I guess I've earned
the right to eat this.

212
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,791
Oh, right! Here ya go.

213
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,458
Ah!

214
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,833
This omelet tastes just right.

215
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,833
It's not too sweet or too salty.

216
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,708
You brought out the flavor
of the egg perfectly.

217
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,666
Once again, I am impressed.

218
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,583
I'm glad to hear that, Master.

219
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,791
How was the apparent
realm, anyway?

220
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,000
The same as always.

221
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,208
Oh, but I did get
to see Suzuran.

222
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,958
Huh?! I hope that
she's doing all right!

00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,166
[inaudible]

224
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes, she's doing well.

225
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,666
She appeared to be quite happy.

226
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,333
I was amused to
find Shiro's grave

227
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,708
completely covered
in her spider webs.

228
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,875
Heh. I see.

229
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,916
This is spectacular,
and I'm honored to eat it.

230
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,333
Oh, that's right.

231
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,750
I heard that you got Shizuran
and Tokihiko to reconcile.

232
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,166
Huh? I wouldn't go that far.

233
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,541
I don't deserve all the credit.

234
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,708
I wanted to do whatever I could
to make sure they were happy.

235
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,875
Because I am officially on staff
at Tenjin-ya, after all.

236

Your food seems to
bring out the best

in every <i>ayakashi</i> who eats it.

238
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,000
I'd be willing to bet that's
what finally got those two

239
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,833
to be open and honest
about their feelings.

dear husband, naturally.

244

Just so you know, a little
nagging by my lovely bride

245
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,875
never bothers me.

Ugh. There you go again,

I look forward to the curry.

I did get all the spices
you requested of me,

just so you know.

By the way, something
called "pancakes"

I gave those rolls you so
generously shared with me

to the tube kittens, and now,

Oh, I'm sorry.

They're weak <i>ayakashi</i> ,
so they're manageable,

become spoiled.
