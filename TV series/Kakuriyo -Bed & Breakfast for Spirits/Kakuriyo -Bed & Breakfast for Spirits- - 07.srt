00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,291
Uh!

167
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,625
Uh, what's wrong?

168
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,750
It just occurred to me

169
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,041
that I've never seen your face
from this angle before.

170
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,625
[gasps]

171
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,958
[AOI]
But,

172
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,833
I don't have the kind of face
that's worth staring at.

173
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,041
I'm grateful, Aoi.

174
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,583
[AOI]
You're very welcome.

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,041
[MASTER]
Shall we eat the eggs now?

176
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,125
[AOI]
Huh?

177
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,208
They're getting cold.

178
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,041
[MASTER]
Ah, I found it.

179
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,416
[AOI]
What is that?

180
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,333
I hope you like ramune.

181
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,791
Yeah! I didn't know
you had it here.

182
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
We use spring water.

183
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,666
It's naturally carbonated,
bottled at the source.

184
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,875
It's been popular here
for centuries.

185
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,666
Shall we see how the hot
spring eggs turned out today?

186
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
[tapping, egg cracks]

187
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,500
[AOI laughs]

188
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,666
[MASTER] Sprinkle a little bit
of salt on them.

189
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,166
I don't think I've ever had

190
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,375
ramune and hot spring eggs
together before. I can't wait!

191
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,250
[MASTER] That combination is
a summer treat in this area.

192
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,166
It won't be summer
for a few more weeks, though.

193
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,583
Ah!

194
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,166
Well, that's delicious!

195
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
Yes, indeed.

196
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,166
The flavors complement
each other perfectly!

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,208
[MASTER chuckles]

198
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,750
[MASTER]
I'm glad you enjoy it.

199
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,125
If you'd like to serve that
combination at Moonflower,

200
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,458
feel free to take
as much of both as you need.

201
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,166
Really? That's too kind.

202
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,583
Thank you!

203
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,750
[giggles]

204
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,333
Do you come up here often

205
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,666
to eat hot spring eggs
and drink ramune?

206
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,083
Yes, I do.

207
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,125
I consider this place
my own little private retreat.

208
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,666
Sometimes, when I want
to be alone,

209
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,666
I come up here
and get lost in the clouds.

210
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,166
That sounds nice.

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,666
I apologize
if I intruded on you.

212
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,458
No, it's all right.

213
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,583
Although I must say,

214
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,416
I was quite surprised by it.

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,750
[AOI]
Huh?

216
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,708
I didn't think
that you wanted...

217
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,291
Uh...

218
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,166
Never mind.

219
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,833
[grunts]

220
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,208
I relish these rare moments
when you and I get to be alone.

221
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,416
Uh...

222
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,541
I bet the kamaitchi
are out there somewhere,

223
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,291
keeping a sharp eye on us.

224
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,416
I don't think you can
really say that we're alone.

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,791
[MASTER]
I guess that's true.

226
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,041
Aoi...

227
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,541
How is Moonflower doing?

228
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,083
[AOI] Mmm...
Things are kind of rough.

229
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,958
Right now, at least.

230
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,625
[AOI]
But, I'm not giving up.

231
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,916
I'll keep trying.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm sure there are things
I can do to improve.

233
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,083
Wonderful.

234
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,083
Just don't push yourself
too hard.

235
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,250
You haven't been getting
much sleep, have you?

236
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,666
[AOI]
Huh?

237
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,750
I look out late at night,

238
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,000
and see your lights
are still on,

239
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,416
and you get up before the sun.

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,375
[AOI gasps]

241
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,041
[AOI]
You spy on me?

242
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,166
[MASTER]
Aoi...

243
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,625
I think Moonflower's secret
weapon could be its location.

244
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,250
Once you get the opportunity,

245
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,375
it could become
like a hidden gem.

246
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,666
Your food is delicious,
without question.

247
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,916
So, trust yourself and don't
feel pressure to rush success.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,791
Take it one step at a time.

249
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,375
That helps, a lot.

250
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,541
Oh, you're so kind.

251
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,791
I've gotta say, you truly
are an extraordinary ogre.

252
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,625
Oh, am I the kind of ogre whom
you might consider marrying?

253
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,583
Never mind, I take back
everything I just said.

254
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,125
Right, no pressure,
take it one step a time.

255
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,083
No rush.

256
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,750
I will make that bento!

257
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,333
I wonder why he feels like
eating is such a hassle.

258
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,083
He uses his hands to write,
which means...

259
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,916
[humming]

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,041
Ah- ha, got it!

261
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,625
And finished.

262
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,375
This bento should allow him to
eat and write at the same time!

263
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,708
Mmm, I'll keep this in mind,

264
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,583
and do my best
for the whole week!

265
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,125
[O-RYO giggles]

Huh? That mask is--!

[AYAKASHI] Uh, oh, right,
sorry about that!

270
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,541
Hello there. I'm Hakkabou!

271
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,791
I'm a <i>yokai</i> called a nyudo-bozu.

272
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,291
You're what?

273
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,791
Now, then.
I'm leaving tomorrow,

274
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,708
so I wanted to say
thanks before I go.

275
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,083
Oh...

276
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,958
I apologize for dropping by
like this unannounced.

277
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,375
Oh, that doesn't
bother me at all!

278
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,541
I'm happy to meet you,

279
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,958
although I thought
nyudo-bozu were giant.

280
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,500
Indeed. We have giant
and human forms,

281
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,916
but this is how I feel
most like myself, yep.

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,250
Interesting!

283
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,416
Well, every single
bento you made me

284
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,583
this past week
was delicious. [sigh]

285
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,291
And it was so lovely
to be able to eat them

286
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,583
while I was writing,
as well, yep?

287
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,458
I'm glad.

288
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,291
I really hoped that they'd work.

289
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,166
Uh--

290
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,166
[HAKKABOU] Uh, Is there
something wrong with this mask?

291
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,708
No, I just haven't seen another
one like that in this area.

292
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,791
[HAKKABOU] Ah, well,
I did purchase this one

293
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,875
in the southern land, yep.

294
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,166
Then, that makes sense.

295
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,250
I'm happy to give you
this one, if you like.

296
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,375
Oh, no! It's fine.

297
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,583
[AOI]
The southern land.

298
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,041
[HAKKABOU]
Wow!

299
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,500
This dish looks phenomenal!

300
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,458
[AOI] Can't wait to hear
what you think.

301
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,916
--It tastes spectacular!
--[AOI giggles]

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,458
Well, thank you.

303
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,333
I had no idea Tenjin-ya boasted

304
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,166
such a highly-skilled
human chef!

305
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,416
That's good news
worth spreading! Yep!

306
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,583
I only just started
working here.

307
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,375
And, what about yourself?

308
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,916
Been coming here long?

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,208
Yes. I've been visiting
Tenjin-ya since I was little.

310
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,791
As a matter of fact, I based
one of the main characters

311
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,500
in my first novel
on the Master Innkeeper!

312
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,666
Huh?

313
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,250
I wouldn't be who I am
without Tenjin-ya.

314
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,583
That's why I return here
whenever I get stuck

315
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,208
and require a little
extra inspiration, yep.

316
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,708
I get that!

317
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:30,791
[HAKKABOU]
But this time,

318
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,208
I even met a new friend.
What a bonus!

319
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,291
If you don't mind,

320
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,625
could you please
tell me your name,

327
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,250
What's wrong?

328
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,416
Nothing's wrong,
everything is right!

329
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,291
You're the grandchild
of Shiro Tsubaki,

330
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,166
and you're also
the innkeeper's future wife!

331
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,250
Huh? Okay?

332
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,708
At one point in time,

333
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,083
Shiro Tsubaki was the basis
for a great many villains

who appeared
in my popular novels!

335
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,833
One could even say
he was an anti-hero!

336
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,333
Really?

337
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,000
His granddaughter
is the ogre-bride?

338
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,083
To think, you will be wife
to his arch-rival,

339
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,208
the master of Tenjin-ya!

340
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,541
I'm on fire! It's fascinating!
What serendipity!

341
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,875
For real?

342
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,333
There is no time to waste!

343
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,000
Blank pages await me!

Jeez, it's really noisy!

350
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm not quite sure.

351
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,625
Sorry.

352
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,416
[AOI] Don't rush,
one step at a time.

353
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,125
Now, back to work!

354
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,041
Well, looks like
the number of customers

355
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,416
hasn't gone up at all.

356
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,458
I know.

357
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,916
Tenjin-ya employees
are all we get.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,458
[AOI]
Like, O-Ryo, and O-Ryo,

359
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,791
and sometimes O-Ryo!

360
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,541
I wonder if sprucing up the menu

361
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,166
with a new item would help.

362
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,125
We need more dessert
on the menu,

363
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,416
and <i>ayakashi</i> love azuki beans
cooked with a little sugar.

364
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,291
Azuki beans, huh?

365
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,375
Great idea!

366
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,166
You always have such
a positive attitude, Aoi!

367
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,458
Negativity will do us no good!

368
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,583
Focusing on the work is key!

369
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,250
Master told me to let go
of pressure, trust myself,

370
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,166
and keep at it,
one step at a time.

371
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,666
That is good advice.

372
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,166
Hmm...

373
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,625
I should make
something with azuki

374
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,041
that's not in the hidden realm.

375
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,208
I got it! This dish.

376
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,500
It's called cream <i>anmitsu</i> ,

377
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,750
and it's from
the apparent realm.

378
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,166
It's made by mixing
fresh cream

379
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
with bean paste
and a little sugar!

380
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,541
That does sound like
a perfect combination!

381
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
But, can you get heavy cream
in the hidden realm?

382
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,833
Yes!

383
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,291
We can negotiate with
the dairy supplier for it!

384
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,083
Great, will you do that part?

385
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,750
I would be happy to!

So good!

All right, I think this is done.

00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,958
Good afternoon.

394
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,250
Did you get lost?

395
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,458
I can smell azuki beans.

396
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,708
[AOI]
Huh?

397
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,500
That is the sweet smell
of boiled azuki beans.

398
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,500
You can have some,
if you're hungry.

399
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,750
Yes, I want azuki beans.

What's this?

402
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,000
[AOI]
It's called azuki milk gelatin.

403
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,541
It's my first time making it,

404
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
so I can't promise
it'll be any good.

405
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,750
This dish isn't <i>yokan</i> ,

406
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,583
and I'm not familiar
with this gelatin, either.

407
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,791
It's quite yummy.

408
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,291
I'm so glad!

409
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,333
We don't have flavors like
this in the hidden realm.

410
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,458
Tell me, who might you be?

411
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,416
No one special, really.

412
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,041
I'm a human who was brought
to this realm by an ogre.

413
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,541
An ogre?

414
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,791
But, why?

415
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,208
[AOI]
Hmm...

416
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,750
Basically, my grandpa made
me collateral in his debt

417
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,208
and couldn't pay it.

418
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,041
Collateral?

419
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,625
I was told the debt
would be canceled

420
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,125
if I married the ogre.

421
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,583
But, I don't want to.

422
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,541
I asked to work off
the debt instead.

423
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,458
Why don't you want
to marry him?

424
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,875
You're referring to the master
innkeeper of Tenjin-ya, right?

425
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,708
Do you dislike him somehow?

426
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,250
Oh, no, it's not so much that.

427
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,375
He's not bad. I like him.

428
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,625
I just don't like to let
other people control my life.

429
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,958
Now, to top it all off,
the restaurant's failing.

430
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
But there's plenty I can do
to change that,

431
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,333
so I'll keep fighting.

432
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,833
Until I've tried every avenue,
I'm not going to give up.

433
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,791
Mmm...

434
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,416
Is there something on my face?

435
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,916
There's not.

436
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,166
Take this.

437
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,833
I want you to have it,
as a token of my thanks.

438
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,916
What?

439
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,291
You sure you wanna give it away?

440
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll come visit you again,

441
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,375

[jingling]

443
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,291
Hold on. Where did she go?

444
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,708
[AOI]
Was she here?

445
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,708
Or did I imagine it?

446
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,125
Aoi!

447
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,208
I put in the order for heavy
cream with the dairy supplier!

448
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,500
You did?

449
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,250
So now, we'll be able
to have whipped cream,

450
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,583
and ice cream, and put butter
on everything, too!

451
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,458
Oh, yeah?

452
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,583
Well, that's good.

453
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,416
Aoi, is something the matter?

454
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,666
That girl who came in,

455
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,083
she might have been
a zashiki-warashi.

456
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,333
Really? Why would she come here?

457
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,000
Well she gave you
her <i>temari</i> ball,

458
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,791
which means she
really liked your food.

459
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,333
Zashiki-warashi come to the aid
of business owners

460
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,791
who pray for
increased prosperity.

461
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,125
A zashiki-warashi, huh?

462
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
I thought their hair
was jet black.

463
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,625
Ooh, I know!

464
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll garnish the dish
with gold leaves,

465
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,750
so it sparkles
like her hair!

466
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,125
I'll call it...

bento you made for me.

487
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,708
"I'll stop by Moonflower
sometime soon to visit.

488
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,208
I so look forward to eating
more of your delicious food

489
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,583
from the apparent realm."

490
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,625
Oh wow, these people
read this and came here.

491
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,333
All thanks to Hakkabou!

492
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,416
Not so fast.
I was the one who suggested

493
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
that you make him the bento
in the first place.

494
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,208
Don't you forget that part!

495
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,125
Thank you, come again!

496
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,208
[BYAKUYA]
Keep up the good work.

497
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,875
Next month and for
the foreseeable future.

498
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,708
This is such a relief!

499
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,791
Is that all you needed
to discuss with us?

500
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,583
No, I haven't broached
the main subject yet.

501
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,125
A certain person
read that column,

502
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,625
and sent us a request.

503
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,833
It's straight from
the Imperial Court.

504
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,916
Wait, what? The Imperial Court?

505
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,833
From the Royal Family?

506
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,958
Indeed.

507
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,750
I would like you to cook
a special meal

508
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,833
for Master Nuinoin and his wife
on their anniversary.

509
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,083
Hold on a minute.

510
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,708
The Royal Family?

511
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,583
You want me to cook
for those fancy <i>ayakashi</i> ?

512
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,333
Yes, Mistress Ritsuko

513
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,083
is originally from
the apparent realm, actually.

514
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,500
[gasps]

515
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,750
[BYAKUYA] She heard about
Moonflower's reputation,

516
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,583
and she requested your cooking.

517
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,166
I assume it's because
she feels nostalgic at times

518
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,375
for the food from
the realm of her birth.

519
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,583
So, Aoi, will you
accept this job?

520
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,583
Yes, I accept.

521
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,208
I'll do it,
and I'll give it my best!

522
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,291
[CHIBI] Moonflower sure has
livened up a lot ever since

523
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,875
the zashiki-warashi
and nyudo-bozu came!

524
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,458
Aoi! Roll up your sleeves,

525
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,125
and do your best again
for your royal guests!
