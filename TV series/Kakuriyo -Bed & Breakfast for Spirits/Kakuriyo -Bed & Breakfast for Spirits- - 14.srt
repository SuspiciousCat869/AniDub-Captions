We have come to retrieve

Well, don't just stand there.

Ranmaru here's no joke.

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,000
He's called the "dog god,"
because he's a <i>komainu.</i>

00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,500
On top of that, he's also the

"Dog god"? "Lead manager"?

Then is he like the equivalent
to our master?

00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,125
Well yeah, officially he is,
but there's one key difference.

Unlike here,
there's someone higher up

than him at Orio-ya.

Are you serious?
That little girl?

She's also Tenjin-ya's founder.

Tenjin-ya in the hands

00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,583
of the master, and created
Orio-ya in the southern land.

What do you plan to do?

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,125
Are you going back now?

321
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,875
Actually, I can't
return on my own.

322
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,500
Someone from the hidden
realm has to bring me.

323
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,250
I hope you're hungry
for curry, Master.

324
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,583
I can make it as spicy or
as sweet as you want it.

325
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,916
I do like the curry from
the apparent realm,

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,541
mainly because it's what you
humans call "comfort food."

327
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,833
Thank you.

328
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,458
I'm glad you feel that way.
I would miss you.

329
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,791
This particular Ogre
Gate Iwato Shrine

330
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,583
brings divine favor
for matchmaking.

331
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,916
So now is the perfect time
for you to visit it.

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,750
[GINJI] This shrine's
matchmaking benefits businesses.

333
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,958
It shines good fortune

334
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,666
on professional networks
and associations.

335
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,541
That makes sense.

336
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,708
[MASTER] Aoi, good business
is about much more than

337
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:59,250
simply turning a profit.
That's only one small part.

338
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,708
You must make yourself
indispensable to clients.

339
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,875
Create deep relationships and
bring value to every encounter.

340
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,625
That's important.

341
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,000
Interesting.

342
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,916
I like that.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,833
I hope Moonflower
brings great joy

344
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,250
to everyone who
comes to eat there.

345
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,541

[AOI]
Somewhere along the way,

348
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,541
Tenjin-ya became an
important place to me.

349
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,416
It's where my friends are,
and where I belong.

Does it taste good?

00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,375
Yeah. It's so yummy.

354
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:42,458
[AOI] When I was a child,
an <i>ayakashi</i> saved my life.

355
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:47,083
I've always wanted to see that

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,333
[AOI]
Ginji.

357
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,708
Was it you who saved
me back then?

00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,166
Please, tell me.

359
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,000
I have to ask him.

00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,000
I have to find out.

You're with us now, you're safe.

That savage woman
can't take you again.

[RANMARU]
Well, well.

370
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,375
It seems a pathetic human
girl has boarded our ship

371
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,875
without permission.
What will we do?

372
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,375
Is the lowly thing
scared of me? [laughs]

373
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,958
I guess it's not surprising.

374
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,125
Mistress Ougon-Douji's spiriting
away technique is so refined

375
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,666
that even Tenjin-ya's
master couldn't stop it!

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,458
I'm talking to you, woman.

378
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,875
If we are to take you back
to Orio-ya with us,

379
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,083
we'll be hard pressed
to find a use for you.

380
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,083
But since you're Shiro
Tsubaki's granddaughter

381
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,458
and the ogre god's bride,

382
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,208
we may be able to hang you
up as a display piece.

[RANMARU]
Ginji. Heh.

[GINJI]
Aoi is the master's fiancée.

I will not allow you to treat
her with such disrespect.

You "won't allow" me?

Just who exactly do you
think you're talking to?

394

Your old master
no longer matters.

You aren't working for Tenjin-ya
