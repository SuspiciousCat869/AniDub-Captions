and I don't have
many supplies left.

00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,666
What will I do about
Master Matsuba?

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,333
Not to mention
my dinner tonight...

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,500
If only I could go out
and do a little shopping,

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,750
but I don't have
the money for that!

Uh! This is terrible!

Well, Master or no.

It's time to get to work.

Heh, heh! The miso is
smelling fantastic!

00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,416
I guess things worked
out okay for tonight!

join me for dinner?!

Oh, he isn't out here.

And I'm still full of delicious

Cucumbers? Where on earth
did you get those?

What happened to his devotion?

I haven't had a meal
by myself in a while.

Just what do you two think
you're doing in here?

Uh. Nothing.

We're not trying to keep
the place clean and ready

for when Aoi gets back

Nice try, Young Hostess.

I'm so restless.

00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,875
I wonder what's
going on at Orio-ya.

I hope Aoi is all right.

you just leave your posts?

Uh, we're very sorry.

We just felt like we
had to do something.

To get it ready
for Aoi's return.

I hate to be pessimistic, but we
can't guarantee she will return.

We do apologize, sir.

But I have no doubt that Aoi
will be here very soon!

Yes! I truly believe the master

will bring her home
to us without fail!

And if she can't cook
right away when he does,

it'll be a problem for business!

you are all responsible for
keeping things running here.

would it matter that you've kept

this place clean if
Tenjin-ya goes under?

161
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,541
I will wear them, since you were
kind enough to bring them.

162
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,125
I'm glad.

163
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,291
So, this is when you leave.

164
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,000
What? You won't let me stay?

165
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,416
Truly an ogre bride.

166
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,083
Well, you're a fish
peddler, so there!

167
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,125
But that's beside the point.
I have to change-- get out!

168
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,458
But what happens if I run
into any Orio-ya employees?

169
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,250
I'm not sure that my
disguise would work

170
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,458
on the executive staff.

171
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,500
[AOI] Oh, fine, then turn
around and stay that way.

172
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,250
Or I could help you.

173
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,625
[AOI] How's everyone
doing at Tenjin-ya?

174
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,375
Are they okay?

175
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,458
[MASTER] A few of them were
upset that Orio-ya deceived us,

176
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,000
but other than that,
there've been no problems.

177
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,125
We had a staff meeting,
and it was decided that I

178
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,208
should be the one to come
to the southern land.

179
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,375
[AOI]
Because, out of everyone,

180
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,666
you had the most
free time, am I right?

181
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,083
You are, though I'm not worried,

182
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,666
with Tenjin-ya in
Byakuya's care.

183
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,791
[AOI]
Mm. I see.

184
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,958
Okay, done.

185
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,125
[MASTER] Oh. That kimono
suits you very well.

186
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,458
You look like a
blushing newlywed.

187
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm starting to get
a crystal-clear picture

188
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,458
of what your tastes are.

189
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,291
[MASTER chuckles]

190
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,333
I had better get going now.
I have to make deliveries

191
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,041
to both the kitchen
and dining hall.

192
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,416
Okay.

193
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,791
I guess I can
walk you out, then.

194
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,625
[gasps]

195
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,458
Is something the matter?

196
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,125
Your ankle's swollen.

197
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,208
It's not bad.

198
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,625
I'm sure it'll be better soon.

199
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,041
[MASTER] You shouldn't be
putting weight on it, Aoi.

200
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,833
[AOI]
Thanks, Master.

201
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,250
Aoi. You only have
to say the word

202
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,125
and I'll help you escape
from this place.

203
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,000
I refuse to leave here
without taking Ginji with me.

204
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,500
It's all or nothing.

205
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,750
I'm worried.

206
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,416
I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

207
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,000
I hope he's getting enough to
eat, and able to sleep at night.

208
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,208
But, most of all, I hope
that the employees here

209
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,208
aren't bullying him and
calling him a traitor.

210
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,708
Who knew Ginji warranted
so much attention.

211
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,791
[AOI]
That's rude.

212
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,875
Ginji is an Orio-ya
employee now.

213
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,833
[AOI] You're even colder
than I thought.

214
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,875
I was under the impression that
you two were close friends.

215
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,500
Or is there something else?

216
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,750
Some hidden reason you can't

217
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,708
bring him back with
us to Tenjin-ya?

218
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,458
[MASTER]
It's... complex.

219
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,875
Also, what's the big deal
with this fireworks event?

220
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,833
It's all anyone talks about, and
it feels so unsettling somehow.

221
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,416
Ginji's stuck here
for the time being.

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,333
He agreed to do
something at Orio-ya,

223
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,708
and he must go through with it.

224
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,541
It's related to
the fireworks event

225
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,958
that the hotel is
preparing to host.

226
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,666
But the mood is too intense
for such a common thing.

227
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,125
It isn't common.

228
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,708
It holds special significance
in the southern land.

229
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,833
Once every century,
during the fireworks,

230
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,958
Orio-ya carries out a
ritualistic ceremony.

231
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,333
Ceremony?

232
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,708
[AOI] All of this is starting
to make more sense.

233
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,458
Ensure that you carry out
the ceremony without fail.

234
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,708
No matter the cost, they must
complete the full observance,

235
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,333
because the southern land
bears an ancient curse.

236
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,458
Is there anything that I
could do to help them?

237
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,333
You've already started doing it.

238
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,333
[AOI] You mean by stopping
Master Matsuba from leaving?

239
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,833
I see.

240
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,291
Well, then. I certainly can't
go back to Tenjin-ya now.

241
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,750
As for Ginji,

242
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,750
I'm sure he never wanted to
drag you into this mess,

243
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,291
and yet, Orio-ya is having
such a hard time preparing

244
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,041
for the fireworks that they were
forced to ask for your help.

245
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,583
Why is it that much
work for them?

246
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,000
It would be hard for anyone,

247
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
because they have to
gather several items

248
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,583
for the ceremony that are
essentially national treasures.

249
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,875
[AOI]
Like, relics or something?

250
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,666
[AOI gasps]

251
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,958
I'm glad that you're
an early riser.

252
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,666
It means we can have
more of these

253
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,291
secret morning meetings
while you're here.

254
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,166
Will you pass by
on your way back?

255
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,791
Yes, I will, but there will be a
watchman on patrol at that time.

256
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,208
Then I'll hang a
bucket full of ice

257
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,541
from that pine tree out front,

258
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,583
so make sure you check it
when you come by again.

259
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,291
There might be a treat.

260
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,333
I want to say thank you
for dressing my ankle,

261
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,291
so I'll make you a bento
with mackerel cooked in miso.

262
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,833
This is a first for me! A bento
delivered in a bucket of ice.

263
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,125
I can't tell you how much
I'm looking forward to that.

264
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,166
It even makes being a fish
peddler worthwhile.

265
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,750
Oh, yeah?

266
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,625
Well, now I'm going to make sure
that mackerel is frozen solid.

267
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,708
[laughs] Fine, do your worst.

268
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,250
You forget that,
with my ogre fire,

269
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,958
I'm able to reheat pretty
much anything.

270
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,208
Which reminds me.

271
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,083
Aoi, may I see your pendant?

272
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,750
What? Of course, here.

273
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,083
What did you do to it?

274
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,583
Heh. I'll be seeing
you around, Aoi.

275
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,833
Thanks for stopping by, Master.

276
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,833
I've actually missed you.

277
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,375
[MATSUBA] So this is what
fried oyster tastes like?

278
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,875
It's incredible, Aoi!
How could anything be so good!

279
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,041
Wow! Seconds, please! Seconds!

280
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,458
Of course. Right away.

281
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,958
[MATSUBA]
And keep 'em comin'. I'm hungry!

282
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,708
[AOI]
The oysters the master brought

283
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,625
were an even bigger hit
than I thought they'd be.

284
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,583
[laughs] She's really doing
a stellar job, huh?

285
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,750
[barks]

286
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,333
I'm so relieved that
Master Matsuba

287
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,083
enjoyed his meal again today.

288
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,208
[KAI]
Hey, lady.

289
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,875
[MEI]
Aoi Tsubaki.

290
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,458
Uh? Who's there?

291
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,625
[BOTH]
We're right behind you.

292
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,791
[AOI gasps]

293
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,625
[KAI]
I'm Kai, a black crane.

294
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,416
[MEI]
And I'm Mei, a white crane.

295
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,583
[AOI]
Are you twins?

296
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, we are.

297
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,708
We work as chefs
here at Orio-ya.

298
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,583
[BOTH]
Yay!

299
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,125
Do you need something from me?

300
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,583
[BOTH]
Yes, we do.

301
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,083
We've ended up in a little
bit of a predicament.

302
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,875
We'd be really grateful if you
would help us out of it.

303
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,083
Orio-ya employees want my help?

304
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,541
Sounds suspicious!

305
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,208
Whoa, hold on a second!

306
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,833
It's nothing like that, really.

307
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,041
Just listen.

308
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,916
We're incredibly curious
about your cooking.

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,708
Tokihiko suggested that we ask
you to help us with this.

310
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,625
He trusts you.

311
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,083
What? Tokihiko said that?

312
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,083
Yodoko's a rain woman.

313
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,666
Yeah, and when she
loses her temper,

314
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,125
she likes to make it storm,
which isn't good.

315
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,166
Because of the fireworks
event that's coming up,

316
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,083
we've been appeasing her, but...

317
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,083
[BOTH] Now she's saying she's
getting tired of Orio-ya's food.

318
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,458
We're in an awful bind.

319
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,958
If she makes it rain because
of us, we're dead meat!

320
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,333
Ranmaru will probably throw us
into the middle of the ocean!

321
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,416
[AOI]
He sounds like a Yakuza boss.

322
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,958
So, what is it that
you want from me?

323
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,041
The lady tells us she
wants to eat interesting,

324
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,208
fun food that she's
never tasted before.

325
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,083
But we don't have any clue
what to cook for her!

326
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,958
[BOTH] So, we want you
to teach us about food

327
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,208
from the apparent realm.

328
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,833
But... Are you sure you
won't get in trouble?

329
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,791
Everyone at Orio-ya hates
my guts, don't they?

330
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,416
[BOTH]
No, not us.

331
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,791
We only started working
here a year ago.

332
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,416
We have no stake in the rivalry
between your inn and Orio-ya.

333
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,833
[BOTH]
Right?

334
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,541
[sighs] Okay, then let's
start thinking of solutions

335
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,791
to your problem together.

336
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,416
[BOTH]
She'll help, yay!

337
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,583
[AOI] But before we do,
can I ask a question?

338
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
[BOTH]
Sure, what?

339
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,958
I ate some squid <i>shumai</i> on
the day I was brought here.

340
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,333
And I have been wondering
about it ever since then.

341
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,958
I guess you guys are the chefs
who made it for me, right?

342
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,666
[BOTH]
Yeah, that was us.

343
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,000
I hope you're not gonna ask
us how to make it though.

344
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,083
'Cause we can't tell you
our trade secrets.

345
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,541
We promised Ranmaru we
wouldn't give that away.

346
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,916
No, of course not.

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,916
I just want to eat it again.
It was very delicious.

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,291
[BOTH]
What?

349
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,625
[AOI]
I beg you! Make me some more!

350
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,958
[BOTH]
Hm...

351
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,000
Huh?

352
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,166
[KAI, MEI]
Bring it in. Fist bump.

353
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,250
[AOI]
Mm...

354
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,291
[KAI, MEI]
Yay!

355
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,833
[AOI] Hmm. Does that
mean we have a deal?

356
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,875
[MITSUNARI]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

357
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,625
I specifically asked you to
bring me the weekly Youto,

358
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,916
and yet you deliver this?
That's the wrong one!

359
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,666
Oh, my apologies, mistress.

360
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,541
Ugh. Really. You're useless.

361
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,875
You hear me, Mitsunari?

362
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,541
--Useless!
--[MITSUNARI] Sorry!

363
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,166
You're right, she's harsh.

364
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,458
Yeah, I told you so.
She's scary.

365
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,458
She has a short fuse and
will kick you for nothing.

366
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,166
[MEI] That attendant
gets assigned to her

367
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,625
because he loves the abuse.

368
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,875
[AOI]
A spoiled rich girl, huh?

369
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,375
Do I spy those two tsuru-douji
chefs hiding in the shadows?

370
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,625
[KAI, MEI]
She saw us!

371
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,833
[YODOKO] And who is that
girl you have with you?

372
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,791
I've never seen her before.

373
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,083
[KAI] Uh, she's going to be
cooking your meals with us

374
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,333
this evening, so we
brought her to meet you.

375
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,333
Her name's Aoi Tsubaki.

376
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,791
Hello, ma'am.

377
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,416
[YODOKO]
Aoi Tsubaki?

378
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,000
Are you the granddaughter of one
Shiro Tsubaki, by any chance?

379
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:24,875
I am.

380
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,250
And you married Tenjin-ya's

381
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,166
master innkeeper
recently, did you not?

382
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,166
No, ma'am, that is just a rumor.

383
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,625
[YODOKO] Your restaurant,
is that also a rumor?

384
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,250
Actually, that part's true.

385
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,291
As I recall, you serve apparent
realm Japanese food,

386
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,291
and Hakkabou's reports indicate
that he likes to eat there.

387
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,625
So, you're the famous Aoi, then.

388
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,000
I sincerely hope to live up
to Hakkabou's claims

389
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,708
about my skills when I cook
for you tonight, Madam Yodoko.

390
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,083
[BOTH]
Indeed.

391
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,875
I'm so looking forward to it.
Now, you may leave.

392
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
[KAI sighs]
I was freaking out.

393
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
[MEI] I thought she was
gonna yell at us again.

394
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,000
You guys threw me under
the bus. Not cool.

395
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,416
It's a good thing you're cute.

396
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,958
Now, then, tell me what kind
of flavors Yodoko likes.

397
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,458
[BOTH]
What?

398
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,333
She prefers really bold foods.

399
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,000
For an ayakashi,
she likes it hot and spicy.

400
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,583
[AOI]
Anything she doesn't eat?

401
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,666
For sure, but she's
totally fickle. Like...

402
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,041
...two days ago,
she hated deep-fried tofu.

403
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,125
Two days before that,
it was duck meat...

404
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,958
But there seems to be a pattern.

405
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,375
What she dislikes doesn't
change for two days.

406
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
[AOI]
Then what was it yesterday?

407
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,583
[BOTH]
Um, <i>Natto</i> .

408
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,708
Then what I'm thinking
of might just work.

409
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,583
How about we make
her <i>monjayaki</i> ?

410
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
What? <i>Monjayaki</i> ?

411
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,916
Yep. She can participate
in the cooking

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,375
and have a little fun, right?

413
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,125
But that's more of a snack
food than a meal, isn't it?

414
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,500
It is, but, because of that, she
probably hasn't had it before.

415
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,541
We'll bring out an iron plate
for her to grill it on, too.

416
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,708
Also, there're so many wonderful
varieties of seafood out here,

417
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,250
and I wanna cook with them
all, in any way I can!

418
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,625
Interesting.

419
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,041
It might work.

420
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,375
[ALL]
Yay!

421
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,041
[ALL laugh]

422
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,791
Even though it is
considered junk food,

423
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,500
we're gonna make it
kind of healthy!

424
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,458
For seafood, we'll use squid,
shrimp, and clams.

425
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,416
Let's throw in some okra, too!

426
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,166
We'll make classic pork <i>monja</i> ,

427
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,500
and everyone's favorite,
mentai-mochi-mochi-monja!

428
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,916
[KAI, MEI]
All right!

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,041
If you need <i>mentaiko</i> ,
we've got that!

430
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,708
That's a specialty
of the southern land,

431
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,750
so we can get ahold
of it easily.

432
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,291
Oh, do you have cheese?

433
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,083
I still have yet to
see it anywhere

434
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,291
since I first came to
the hidden realm.

435
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,750
They have it in
the northern land,

436
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,916
since dairy farming is
so widespread there.

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,791
But, even so, it isn't
a very common food

438
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,375
in any of the other parts of
the hidden realm either.

439
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,375
Oh, that means we'd have a
hard time finding it, right?

440
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,125
[BOTH] Shouldn't be
too hard. In fact...

441
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,791
...I'm pretty sure
specialty cheese

442
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,875
is still offered on
the room service menu.

443
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,875
Premium packages offer
in-room dining.

444
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,250
We'll go ask the employees
there for some.

445
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,375
What? Are you sure that's okay?

446
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,375
[BOTH]
Yep. Just leave it to us!

447
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,666
Finally.

448
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,208
Now. Time to taste.

449
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,541
I'm proud to present my favorite
junk food: the potato chip!

450
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,083
They're best fresh
from the fryer!

451
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,833
Gotta crush 'em up to
add them to the <i>monja</i> mix.

452
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,791
What're you doing
in here, lady?

453
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,208
You're cooking something
really scary.

454
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,083
There's nothing scary here.

455
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,458
These are potato chips.
You wanna try?

456
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,833
What? Are you sure it's okay
for me to eat this stuff?

457
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,541
Yes, of course!

458
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,166
Whoa! So good! Oh, man! Yummy!

459
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,250
Hey, Lady, can you make
these again sometime?

460
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,125
I've gotta share them
with my siblings!

461
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
Oh, you have siblings?

462
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
Yep, sure do!

463
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,500
I have an older brother and some
younger brothers and sisters!

464
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,708
We all live together
down by the harbor.

465
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,916
We're poor, so we can't
afford to live inland,

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,125
'cause it's a whole
lot nicer up there.

467
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,083
[AOI] Did something happen
to your parents?

468
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,833
[TAICHI] They went away
somewhere a long time ago.

469
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,208
But then Master Ranmaru
hired me to work here.

470
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,041
My older brother is a sailor
on one of Orio-ya's airships.

471
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,083
So, the two of us are able to
support our younger siblings.

472
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,791
That's admirable, especially
considering how young you are.

473
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,000
It's common for children
to work in the southern land,

474
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,291
since this area's so poor.
But thanks, lady.

475
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,083
[AOI] Come to think of it,
Shizuna said the same thing.

476
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,875
The southern land
is growing fast, though,

477
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,833
and a lot of that is
thanks to Orio-ya.

478
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,291
But Ranmaru says we still
don't have a lot of things

479
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,208
that are common in other
hidden realm lands.

480
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,958
'Kay, gotta go,
thanks for the food!

481
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,083
[AOI] Ranmaru may be
a brute, but it's clear

482
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,125
that he cares a great deal
about the southern land.

483
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,250
[AOI] Once I get
the cheese, that's it!

484
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,875
[BOTH]
Thanks for waiting!

485
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,458
[AOI] Wow! That cheese
looks delicious!

486
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,125
[TOKIHIKO]
I'd like to help you cook, too.

487
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,625
If that's all right?

488
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,958
[AOI]
Thanks, Tokihiko!

489
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,500
I apologize for making you
help with this, truly.

490
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,833
You've been so kind.

491
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,958
Hatori and I have been
protesting to Ranmaru

492
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,916
about the way he's
mistreated you.

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,291
I've been surprised and a
bit bewildered by it all,

494
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,083
to be honest, but, it's fine!

495
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,625
My current focus is making a
<i>monjayaki</i> for Mistress Yodoko.

496
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,791
Your ability to adapt
never ceases to amaze me.

497
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,291
I heard you were in need
of an iron hot plate?

498
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,125
I can take care of
heating it up for you.

499
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,208
Thanks so much!

500
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,708
[BOTH]
That's a shiranui for you!

501
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,541
Okay! Looks like we've got
all the ingredients now!

502
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
Ready? Let's do this!

503
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,500
[BOTH]
Yay!

504
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,000
[AOI] Soldiers.
Let's head into battle!

505
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,000
[CHIBI] It appears that Aoi
found more underlings to train!

506
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,541
And Aoi's underlings
are my underlings!

507
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,625
Hey, you twins!

508
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,000
Bring me some more
cucumbers at once!
