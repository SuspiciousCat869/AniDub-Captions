320
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,000
Because I ran.

321
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,083
I ran away from the fate
of the southern land,

322
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,708
forcing everything
into your hands.

323
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,041
Your leaving was
a turning point.

324
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,041
The southern lands benefitted
from you going away.

325
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,041
What?

326
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,916
[RANMARU]
As a result, Aoi Tsubaki

327
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,708
and the master of Tenjin-ya
took action, so...

328
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,250
Ranmaru.

329
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,541
[RANMARU grunts]

330
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,791
[footsteps]

331
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,666
[RANMARU] At any rate, I
never expected the umi-bouzu

332
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,541
to be such a lonely creature.

333
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
You're right. We just assumed

334
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,083
that he would intentionally
bring calamity to this land,

335
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,416
without considering
any other possibility.

336
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,666
But the truth was
the complete opposite.

337
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,333
That dark place in the farthest
corner of the ocean opens

338
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,166
once every hundred years,
and the impurities that cause

339
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,750
disaster escape from it
when that happens.

340
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,375
[RANMARU]
But, if the ceremony succeeds,

341
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,541
the umi-bouzu is imbued with
the energy to push it back,

342
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,250
and that's what
keeps catastrophe

343
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,166
from befalling this land.

344
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,541
It never even crossed my mind
that that could be the case.

345
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,583
I suppose we'll have to credit
Miss Tsubaki for that.

346
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,541
The very basis of the ceremony
will have to change now.

347
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,041
It'll become a warm reception

348
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,083
to show our appreciation
to the umi-bouzu.

349
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,250
That sounds great.

350
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,333
Now, Ginji.
Time for you to go back.

351
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,708
Your home is somewhere
else now, isn't it?

352
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,250
Right!

353
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,583
[KAI, MEI]
Goodbye, Miss Tsubaki.

354
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,833
Can we see you again?

355
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,833
And cook together again someday?

356
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,208
Of course we can.

357
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,041
I want to eat more
yummy cucumbers

358
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,375
from the southern land!

359
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,083
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
be able to come back

360
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,500
again real soon.

361
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,208
Having your cooperation
really was such a great help.

362
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,125
We've had the most incredible
sales since Orio-ya opened.

363
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,666
Yes, it was very
beneficial to us, too.

364
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,500
Though I'd have to admit,
I never thought I'd see

365
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,625
Tenjin-ya and Orio-ya
collaborate.

366
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,125
For sure. It's been
kind of a strange time.

367
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,916
Ha! All work and no play,

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,833
even during tearful
goodbyes, Akatsuki?

369
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,958
You're really no fun.

[AKATSUKI grunts]

371
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,875
But you've become a
fine front desk manager.

372
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,375
Yeah, well, I'm still not
a match for you yet.

373
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,625
Ha, ha!

374
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,083
After watching you work,

375
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,625
I couldn't help but be in awe
of your job performance.

376
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:44,500
[laughs] Follow my example and
keep trying hard, Nene!

377

I may surpass you pretty soon.

What's that?

379
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,666
Doing business together
was quite a success.

380
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,708
And also very enlightening.

381
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,833
I'd definitely want us
to do this again,

382
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,791
for the next ceremony.

These are the tomatoes I managed
to grow in that field.

I would love it if you
took some home with you.
