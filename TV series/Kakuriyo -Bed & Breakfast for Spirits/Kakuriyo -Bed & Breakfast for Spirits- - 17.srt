Pardon us, Madam.

[YODOKO]
You're late!

00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,875
[ALL gasp]

4
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,916
I'm starving in here, don't you
know I don't have all day?

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,208
[AOI] Our most sincere
apologies, ma'am.

6
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,833
We've made <i>monjayaki</i> for
you in the Konishki room.

7
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,916
[YODOKO grunts]

8
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,666
What is this?

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,666
It's the iron plate we'll
use to cook the <i>monja.</i>

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,916
Wait, <i>monja</i> ?

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,791
But, isn't that a food
that only commoners eat?

12
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,833
Well, you did request
an "interesting" dish,

13
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,250
so we thought you might like it.

14
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,333
It's an apparent-realm-style
<i>monjayaki</i>

15
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,375
made with sumptuous,
seafood ingredients,

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,791
--and we figured it might be
--"Apparent-realm-style"?

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,583
exciting for you to participate
in the cooking yourself.

18
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,250
I have to make it myself?

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,625
Sounds like a hassle.

20
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,833
[AOI]
I'll cook the first one.

21
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,125
Pay close attention
to how I do it.

22
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,583
Now, for the most exciting part.

23
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,458
[gasps] I've never seen this
way of cooking before.

24
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,166
[AOI] We form a ring like this
to keep the sauce inside.

25
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,333
Once the batter thickens,
you mix it with the other

26
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,208
ingredients,
then you stir-fry it.

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,541
Next, spread it into
a thin layer, like so.

28
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,375
And then eat it with this,
starting from the edge.

29
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,958
Pick it up, using a
scraping motion.

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,000
This stuff looks
half-cooked to me.

31
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,125
No, that's just how <i>monja</i> is.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,541
[MITSUNARI]
Uh...

33
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,166
[YODOKO]
Uh! Oh no!

34
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,750
The outer wall is breached!

35
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,958
That happens all the time,
no need to panic.

36
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,583
Huh?

37
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,250
There you go, now grill it
like this for a bit.

38
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
Why does it look darker
than the first one?

39
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,833
If the heat's too high,
I'll adjust it.

40
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,291
No, it's miso pork <i>monja</i> ,
the sauce makes it darker.

41
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,958
The salt-flavored, seafood
<i>monja</i> has a lighter base.

42
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,458
It smells fantastic!

43
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,666

It looks delicious.

44
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,916
Go ahead, Miss.

45
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,000
I simply adore this flavor!

46
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,291
Interesting!

47
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,541
We nailed it! Success achieved!

You must try this dish!

50
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,375
Thank you so much for offering,
Miss. I'd be happy to!

51
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,458
This is delicious!
Like nothing I've tasted!

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,541
It's a triple threat of fluffy,
soft, and crispy, too!

53
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,125
[BOTH]
Uh...

54
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,875
So good.

55
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,375
I get the impression
that you like

56
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,416
the <i>mentai</i> mochi
cheese <i>monja,</i> too.

57
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,291
Yes, this one's
incredibly tasty,

58
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,583
just like the rest of them.

59
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,875
But I like the cheese
best of all!

60
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,000
And I...

61
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,583
All right, you guys
have some too.

[MEI, KAI]
Yes, please, thanks!

63
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,333
I'll take you up on that.

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,291
It sure has an ayakashi-friendly
flavor, to it.

65
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,958
Yeah. The spiciness of the
<i>mentaiko</i> blends in so well.

66
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,875
Adding cheese to the
recipe was a great idea!

[YODOKO]
What do you two think?

68
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,208
It's yummy!

69
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
You're a surprisingly
good cook, Miss!

70
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,166
I want to get an iron
plate for my house,

71
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,208
then I can make this dish

72
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,083
whenever I have
a craving for it.

73
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,791
Now that you know how
to cook it, you can,

74
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,166
as long as you have
the ingredients!

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,708
Here, I'll give you the recipe.

76
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,416
Hold on, aren't you a chef?

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,625
Is it wise for you to give away
your recipes to other people?

78
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, Moonflower isn't
a <i>monjayaki</i> restaurant,

00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,833
so, it's all yours!

I gave you permission to serve a
meal to the guest in the room.

satisfied with her meal tonight.

Wait. This involves me, too!

You're an outsider, so shut up.

clean this place up!

Hey, there, Missy.

103
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,916
Uh?

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,666
I heard that you helped the twin
cranes out of a little jam.

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,583
Yeah. I've been wondering
if Ranmaru was hard on them.

106
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,958
If they get punished,
I'll feel so bad.

107
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,583
Tokihiko and Mistress Yodoko
put in a good word for them,

108
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,208
so, they're not gonna be
punished, after all.

109
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,708
Mistress Yodoko did?

110
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,958
[HATORI] Plus, she accepted
an important request from us

111
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,041
related to the fireworks event.

112
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,333
Ranmaru only cares
about results.

113
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm so relieved.
I was beside myself.

114
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,041
Those twins are amazing.

115
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,916
To let their pride go and ask
a stranger to help them out?

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,916
But you do deserve the
majority of the credit here.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,166
And to think.

118
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,250
You did it out of the
goodness of your heart.

119
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,916
Cooking is the only way that
I can get close to ayakashi.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,791
So, if I see an opportunity,
I never pass it up.

121
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,541
[HATORI] Missy, do you know
anything about our ceremony?

122
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,916
[AOI]
Not very much.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,166
But I do know that it
takes place in secret,

124
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,875
once a century, during
the fireworks event.

125
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,833
[HATORI]
Yes. That's true.

126
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
Ranmaru and Ginji warned me

127
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,083
not to tell you what
I'm about to share.

128
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,750
And yet... I don't think
Mistress Ougon-Douji would

129
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,583
bring you to Orio-ya unless
she had an ulterior motive.

130
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,125
[AOI]
Mm?

131
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,791
After hearing how you handled
things with Mistress Yodoko,

132
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,416
I'm convinced now.

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,541
Ougon-Douji wants you here.
You'll be an important asset.

134
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,000
Tell me about the ceremony.

135
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,833
[HATORI]
Aoi, what exactly do you know

136
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,250
about the southern land?

137
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,625
I know that you have warm
weather and nice beaches.

138
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,083
It's more rural than other
hidden realm lands.

139
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,041
That's all.

140
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,291
[HATORI]
For its entire history,

141
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,000
this land's been plagued
by natural disasters.

142
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,958
Typhoons, tornadoes, tsunamis.

143
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,375
So, despite the nice weather
and abundant resources,

144
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,541
development has
never taken hold here.

145
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,833
It always ends up in ruins.

146
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,458
And, what's more,

147
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,041
there's a curse that
rises up from the sea.

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,708
[AOI]
That's right...

149
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,041
The southern land bears
an ancient curse.

150
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,291
[HATORI] There is an ayakashi
who seems to be connected to it.

151
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,333
Who brings such horrors
to these poor people.

152
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,166
[HATORI] One of the southern
land's past Hachiyos

153
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,750
came up with a plan
to hold a party

154
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,791
in honor of that ayakashi,
to try and calm him down.

155
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,166
And that became the ceremony.

156
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
[HATORI]
The plan was a great success.

157
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,166
And, as the story goes,
the southern land

158
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,625
became remarkably calm
for many years after that.

159
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,333
And then, the Hachiyo
built a shrine

160
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,041
specifically to hold
the ceremonies.

161
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,458
He established a system

162
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,458
to perform the ceremonies
once every hundred years.

163
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,833
I believe that was about
a thousand years ago now.

164
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,125
That long?

165
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,083
Yes, ma'am. But it
can't be carried out

166
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,625
unless we gather several
very valuable items.

167
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,125
The master said that they're
essentially national treasures.

168
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,916
He's right, and, to
make matters worse,

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,833
we never know the date
or the required items

170
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,583
until right before
it's about to start.

171
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,666
Finding all that in time must be
really hard for you guys to do.

172
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,500
Yes, in fact, 300 years ago,
they didn't get everything

173
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,500
that they needed, and
the ceremony failed.

174
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,000
And of course, as they feared,

175
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,166
the surging natural disasters
couldn't be stopped.

176
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,375
Legend has it that
the Hachiyo died.

177
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,291
Every land has its own fair
share of natural disasters,

178
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,083
that's just a normal
part of life.

179
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,708
But if our ceremony goes awry,

180
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,291
the extent of the damage
here would be catastrophic.

181
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,500
The Hachiyo bears such
a huge responsibility.

182
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,166
[HATORI] Word is, after the
previous Hachiyo passed,

183
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,625
Mistress Ougon-douji was the
acting one for a while, but--

184
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,416
Now Ranamaru has the job?

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,791
Yeah. And because
he was employed

186
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,583
by the previous Hachiyo,

187
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,333
he has the power to
conduct the ceremony.

188
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,416
Ginji does, too.

189
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,208
Ginji? Why?

190
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,500
In a certain sense of the word,

191
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,291
Ranmaru and he are
basically brothers.

192
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,041
At a Shinto shrine, you often
see "God's messengers,"

193
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,875
the komainu and the fox, right?

194
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,833
They're like mystical guardian
beasts who protect the shrine,

195
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,291
and they usually come in pairs.

196
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,291
That's the reason we
had to take Ginji away

197
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,583
from Tenjin-ya and
bring him here.

198
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,750
Because the items needed
for the coming ceremony

199
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,958
had been identified.

200
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,250
So, Ginji and the others,

201
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,250
they're out gathering
those items as we speak.

202
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,583
That's where he's been.

203
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,708
Yes, exactly.

204
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,208
Can you tell me what
those things are?

205
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:49,125
I would love to do that, Missy,
but if I tell you much more,

206
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,291
then I'll probably get fired.

207
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,791
Uh!

208
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,875
Hmph. But, I suppose
I did come here

209
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
because I felt like
I had a revelation,

210
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,333
and I was compelled to tell you
everything that I already have.

211
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,291
There are five things that
we have to find, and...

212
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,125
...the first one is
a rainbow umbrella.

213
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,500
This item belongs
to Mistress Yodoko,

214
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,791
but because you stepped in
and saved her stay with us,

215
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,333
she's going to allow
us to borrow it.

216
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,375
She literally accepted
because you gave her

217
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,458
the recipe for <i>monjayaki.</i>

218
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,333
Just because of the recipe?

219
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,250
And that leaves the
remaining four items.

220
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,625
Tengu's secret liquor.

221
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,250
Okay...

222
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,041
[HATORI]
A Mermaid's scale.

223
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,875
A Mermaid?!

224
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,833
[HATORI]
Hourai's gem branch.

225
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,625
And special dishes
prepared for the party,

226
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,375
made from ocean treasure.

227
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,666
[gasps]

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,750
As for tengu's liquor,

229
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,041
I'll have to ask my old man
to let me have some.

230
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you think that Master
Matsuba would do that?

231
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,208
Well, that stuff is the prized
jewel of Mt. Shumon's tengu.

232
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,083
He'll take persuading.

233
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,375
Besides, I was disowned

234
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,125
because of that damn
liquor in the first place.

235
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,458
[sighs]

236
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,333
[HATORI]
So, I think that you'll be able

237
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,833
to go back to Tenjin-ya soon.

238
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,833
What? You mean before
the ceremony takes place?

239
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,708
I'm working with
Ginji and Tokihiko.

240
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,875
We're trying to negotiate
with Ranmaru.

241
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,166
We'll make the ceremony
a success, no matter what.

242
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,958
But how?

243
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,125
[HATORI]
Unless, of course,

244
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,250
you'd prefer to stay
here and help us.

245
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,291
Hey Hatori, I have a
small favor to ask of you.

246
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,625
[HATORI]
Hm?

247
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,541
Can you bring me some
chicken wing bones?

248
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,000
May I ask what for?

249
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,083
I'm going to put them in
Master Matsuba's meal tomorrow.

250
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,458
Think you can handle that?

251
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,125
Yeah! I'll get those bones
for you right away!

252
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,166
I'll ask the twins first,
and if they don't have 'em,

253
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,375
there is the chicken coop, too.

254
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,500
[AOI]
Hey, Hatori.

255
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,833
Uh?

256
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,458
Thanks so much, for sharing
all of that with me.

257
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,375
[gasps, laughs]

258
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,583
Of course, I wanted you
to know the full story.

259
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,750
You're a good girl, Missy.
Genuinely kind.

260
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
[CHIBI] Is your ankle
still hurting, Aoi?

261
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,041
No, I think it's all better.

262
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,833
The medication that the master
brought me is amazing. Wow!

263
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,416
[BOTH inhale, exhale]

264
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,458
I sure could get used to this
little pine grove by the ocean!

265
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
I could, too!

266
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,833
That reminds me, when you
run off, where do you go?

267
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,291
You've been disappearing a lot.

268
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,458
I swim in the surf
with my new friends!

269
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,750
I've met a whole bunch
of coral and clownfish!

270
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,541
So we go on treasure hunting
adventures together!

271
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,291
You could get swept out to sea!

272
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,583
I'm an expert swimmer, watch!

273
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,708
--Wahoo!
--[AOI] Hey!

274
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,416
--What will we find today?
--Come back!

275
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,166
The smell of eggplants on the
grill is truly irresistible!

276
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,791
[MASTER]
Yes, it's an amazing aroma.

277
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,583
Huh?

278
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,083
Oh Master, it's you!

279
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,500
Ow, hot!

280
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,875
What is this?

281
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,166
[AOI]
A light chicken soup.

282
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,458
It's made from vinegar,
soy sauce, and sugar.

283
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,541
It'll be done as soon
as the sugar cooks off.

284
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,416
I didn't see your cart
by the door today,

285
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,208
so I just assumed
you weren't coming.

286
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,041
That's because I parked it
in the pine grove instead.

287
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,250
Aoi. There's a special
place nearby

288
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,166
that I'd love to show you.

289
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,375
Oh, really, what kind
of place would that be?

290
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,708
It's a harbor.

291
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,750
A small fishing port, just
beyond the pine grove.

292
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,375
But I really shouldn't
take the risk

293
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,958
of leaving the old building.

294
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,333
The kid who's watching
me will be here soon.

295
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,541
If Ranmaru finds out
that I left this place,

296
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,541
he'll throw the hair ornament
into the middle of the ocean.

297
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,041
[MASTER]
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

298
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,125
[gasps]

299
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,291
Hey!

300
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,750
Ah, here it is.

301
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,083
[gasps]

302
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,125
Your spiritual power has
been fostering this flame

303
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,708
for quite a while now. So,
it's become your follower.

304
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,166
My follower?

305
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,625
[MASTER] Then, I poured my
own power into it yesterday.

306
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,041
That caused it to awaken.

307
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
Now, you try giving
it a command.

308
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,041
Try ordering it to transform
into Aoi Tsubaki.

309
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,583
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Master.

310
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,500
Just do it and you'll
see what happens.

311
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,375
Transform into Aoi Tsubaki now.

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
[gasps]

313
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,666
Huh?!

314
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,458
Although, this ayakashi, is an
unstable ogre fire creation.

315
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,291
There are some who
become powerful enough

316
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,041
to transform into humans.

317
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,250
[AOI]
Mm...

318
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,041
[MASTER] Master Tokihiko,
who is a shiranui,

319
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,333
became a formidable yokai
through a similar process.

320
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,500
Master! Oh, my Master!

321
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,208
Hey! You let go of him now!

322
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,916
[laughs] Isn't this exciting,
Aoi, now there are two of you!

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,416
Ugh, what are you acting
so pleased about?

324
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,625
Ah! Hello, Mistress Aoi!

325
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,166
What...?

326
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,291
She's rather like a newborn
baby, if you think about it.

327
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,000
I guess we had better
give her a name.

328
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,916
You seriously want to give
this green thing a name?

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,250
Of course I do.

330
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,166
She's the very first fruit
of our love, isn't she?

331
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,541
--[AOI] Huh?!
--I know! How about Ai?

332
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,416
You just took the "oh"
sound out of Aoi.

333
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,666
Yes, but isn't it cute.
Suits her!

334
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,708
Well, I suppose it's fine.

335
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,708
And how do you feel about that?

336
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,875
I love it!
Thank you for my name.

337
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,750
Hey, do something,
would you, please?

338
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,041
Just treat her like you
would our child.

339
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,250
After all, she loves you
like you're her mother.

340
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,291
Ah, my lovely chicken soup!

341
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,250
Once you deliver that
to Master Matsuba,

342
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,916
we can leave Ai here
while we step out.

343
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,875
Hey, I'm not going to faint

344
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,583
and then wake up back
at Tenjin-ya, am I?

345
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,875
The truth is, I would
prefer to have you home,

346
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,916
but I know you won't
come back without Ginji.

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,958
Uh.

348
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,916
So, to make sure you're safe,

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
I'm content to come
check on you.

350
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,500
I sort of enjoy pretending
to be a fish peddler!

351
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,875
[AOI]
Is that an old shrine?

352
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,416
The one Hatori mentioned?

353
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,458
That was used the time
the ceremony failed?

354
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,708
[MASTER]
Aoi.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,875
I put my own spiritual power
into that straw hat.

356
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,041
As long as you're wearing it,
Orio-ya staff won't notice you.

357
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,333
You can relax a little
and enjoy the market.

358
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,583
[AOI]
Master, look at these!

359
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,708
They're beautiful! These
dried shrimp are huge!

360
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,583
She never has trouble
enjoying herself.

361
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
What?!

362
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,041
And... Chili paste with yuzu?

363
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,875
Now that's a rare sight, indeed.

364
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,125
It's a lot more difficult

365
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,333
to come by in the land
of the ogre gate.

366
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,541
I'm sorry to pressure you
into buying all this for me.

367
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,083
[MASTER] If you let me
taste what you cook

368
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,166
with these ingredients,
pressure me all you want.

369
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,916
[STORE OWNER 17A] Hold it
right there, you little brat!

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,458
Someone stop that thief!

371
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,166
[MASTER] This land has
abundant resources,

372
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,875
but it's also plagued
by disasters.

373
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,291
Hatori told me all about that.

374
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,208
[MASTER] It's incredibly hard
to get a stable job here.

375
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,500
The coastal areas are
especially dangerous,

376
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,208
so the only people who
choose to live here

377
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,791
are fishermen and
Orio-ya employees.

378
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,416
Scores of crooked businessmen
come here to make a quick buck,

379
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,958
then they desert the place.

380
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,041
You can see the orphans and
abandoned children everywhere.

381
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,333
[AOI]
Like Taichi and his siblings...

382
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,208
I had no idea.

383
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,583
Oh! Look, it's
Jinpachi the newbie!

384
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,833
[FISH PEDDLER 17B]
And he's with a woman!

385
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,458
Yes, she's my new wife.

386
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,125
Oh, yeah? Well,
lucky you, Jinpachi!

387
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,541
Jinpachi? Why did he
call you that?

388
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,041
It's an alias.

389
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,666
[AKAMA MASTER laughs] So,
you're the famous ogre bride?

390
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,041
Uh, yeah, that's me!

391
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,791
[MASTER] Akama Seafood has
always been very good to us.

392
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,458
They used to be a
well-established inn.

393
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,166
You can tell her
'bout that later.

394
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,625
We've got fresh yellow tail,

395
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,333
let me make you both
some <i>atsumeshi</i> !

396
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,875
Yellowtail <i>atsumeshi</i> ?!

397
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,375
[AKAMA MASTER] I'll be in
the kitchen for a bit,

398
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,916
but you two just make
yourselves right at home.

399
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Come on, Aoi.

400
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,375
[AOI]
U-Uh...

401
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,125
[gasps]

402
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,291
[AOI]
Hi, there, friend!

403
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,250
Uh? Oh, Mistress Aoi!

404
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,166
I've missed you!

405
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,583
I'm glad to see you
looking so well, Mistress!

406
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,250
When I decided to come
to the southern land,

407
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,166
I asked Sasuke to come with me.

408
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
He's helping out at
Akama seafood, too.

409
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,708
[AOI]
How wonderful.

410
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,916
Master, we must leave this
place and take Mistress Aoi

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,416
straight back to safety at
Tenjin-ya without delay.

412
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,250
[AOI]
What?

413
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,791
No, Sasuke.

414
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,166
My ogre bride refuses to return
to Tenjin-ya without Ginji.

415
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,458
Really?

416
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,541
Look, I only need a little
bit more time here.

417
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,541
But we're speaking about
the treacherous Orio-ya!

418
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,583
Huh...

419
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,750
The food!

420
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,541
[AOI]
Wow, yellowtail <i>atsumeshi</i> !

421
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,291
Marinated sashimi bowl?

422
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,333
I heard that it's a
staff meal for fishermen

423
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,375
in the apparent realm.

424
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,333
Don't be shy, now,
please try it!

425
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,583
I have no doubt that
this is gonna be good!

426
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,333
Thanks for the food!

427
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,791
It's sweet!

428
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,666
The marinade really
brings out the flavor

429
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,333
of the rich, fatty yellowtail!

430
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,041
I poured some tea in
it to make <i>chazuke,</i>

431
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,291
and it's delicious
that way, too!

432
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,375
Yeah, I bet it is!
I just wish I could serve

433
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,958
something like this
at Moonflower!

434
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,333
[MASTER]
You'll be so inspired

435
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,458
to create new dishes
when you get back!

436
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,666
[AOI]
You're right!

437
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,416
Is your ankle feeling
completely healed, Aoi?

438
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,208
Yeah, it's kind of amazing.

439
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,083
The medicine in this
realm works so well!

440
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,166
Heh. Our bath caretakers
developed that

441
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,583
exceptional remedy under the
guiding hand of their chief.

442
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,125
Now I remember.

443
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,833
The medicinal bath water
Shizuna told me about.

444
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,250
Hey, Master?

445
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,708
Look at this.
A rainbow clam shell.

446
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,458
How sweet! And pretty.

447
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,916
[MASTER] This is an
exceptionally rare shell.

448
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,041
You can only find them
in the southern land.

449
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,875
Legend has it that they
travel through the sea

450
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,500
all the way from
the eternal realm.

451
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,625
Eternal?

452
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,916
It's a far-away place,

453
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,375
different from the hidden
and apparent realms.

454
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,875
The southern land is as close
to it as one can possibly get.

455
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,916
Take a look there,
across the water.

456
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,291
What?

457
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,875
[MASTER] That landmass
is called Jouno Island.

458
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,833
The general public is
strictly forbidden

459
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,333
from entering that place.

460
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,166
Can you guess why that is?

461
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,416
It's because that's where the
fireworks ceremony happens.

462
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,750
I want to know more
about the eternal realm.

463
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,791
[MASTER]
It's a strange, foreign kingdom.

464
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,958
In some eras it was ruled by
humans, in others by ayakashi.

465
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,208
[AOI]
Whoa.

466
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,041
[MASTER] I do wish I could take
you home with me right now,

467
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,791
but I cannot disrespect
your request

468
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,583
to remain here at Orio-ya.

469
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,750
And I appreciate that.

470
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,250
I'll stay, too, and support your
ambition from behind the scenes.

471
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,875
What do you mean by "ambition"?

473
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,333
These shells have great
beauty, but no power.

474
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,333
You could wear it as an amulet,

475
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,875
though I'm not sure you need
pretty little trinkets like this

476
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,916
to console you.

[gasps]

478
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,125
What's the matter?

479
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,666
[AOI] That form of yours,
it really isn't fair.

480
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,291
This, either.

481
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,458
Not fair, why?

482
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,708
Look it just isn't fair, okay?

483
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,250
Still...

[AOI]
Oh, no, Master, is that--?

486
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,833
Yes, it's Orio-ya.

487
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,416
[AOI gasping]

[CHIBI]
Oh, wow!

489
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,875
Tenjin-ya's green
kamaitachi is here, too?

490
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,500
So, he wants to form an
alliance with me after all!

491
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,291
Huh? He doesn't? I am upset!
