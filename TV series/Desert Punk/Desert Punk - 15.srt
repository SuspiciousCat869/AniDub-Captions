1
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,250
So what do you
two guys want from me?

2
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,875
Where's that little
wart of yours?

3
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,125
You know, your apprentice?

4
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,250
I figured that she'd be
stuck to you as usual.

5
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,583
This isn't a job, Akio.

6
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,833
It's a meeting, so the
girl's on her own today.

7
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,250
And what about Haru?

8
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,916
I didn't think any one of
you guys could take a leak

9
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,208
without the other
two spotting for him.

10
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:27,958
What?!

11
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,833
Haru's got a date today.

12
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,333
Well... where did he
meet this mystery man?

13
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,458
Watch your mouth!

14
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,458
I'm really impressed
with you Punk.

15
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,875
You actually showed up unarmed
just like we agreed we would.

16
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,791
I didn't need to
bring my gun. I trust you.

17
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,625
That's still one hell of a
leap of faith, if you ask me...

18
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,958
I thought you stayed
armed no matter what.

19
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,583
But you're my friends... right?

20
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,166
Listen... If you see
any of them make a move

21
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,791
for me or pull a gun,
you start shooting.

22
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,291
What a bunch of
crappy childhood friends.

23
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:10,125
He can't even trust
them to not kill him.

24
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,458
That's Haru.

25
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,708
I'm glad my
friends don't hate me...

26
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,625
Course I don't really
have any friends.

27
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,625
We figured that you owe us.

28
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,416
How's that?

29
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,958
We saved your life, Punk.

30
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,083
You got me there.

31
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,416
But if you've come
asking for money,

32
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I am way short
on funds these days.

33
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,416
No, we need you in on a job.

34
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,958
A job? No kidding.

35
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,958
Why didn't you just hire me

36
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,375
through Mugenya
like anyone else?

37
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,750
Cause it's not ours...

38
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,625
Natsuko asked us to
find you and hire you for it.

39
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,500
What...?

40
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,166
Natsuko's coming back home?

41
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,166
He's moving in for the kill!

42
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,916
Here we go!

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Idiot.

44
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,791
And... That's why
I'm always armed.

45
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,125
You broke your word!

46
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,291
So did you.
Now, fill me in on Natsuko.

47
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,416
When's she getting here?

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,250
Soon.

49
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,458
Hold on... Isn't she working

50
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,375
at that Oasis Government office?

51
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,458
Yeah.

52
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,625
So this is a freaking
government job?

53
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,458
Farts if I know.
Why don't you ask her.

54
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,583
Fine... But I don't
do government jobs.

55
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,708
Speaking of...

56
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,916
Fuyo! Akio! Haru!

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,333
I missed you guys,
how've you been.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,375
Whoa! You've exploded
into quite a woman!

59
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,375
Kanta?

60
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,833
And your boobs are way bigger

61
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,375
than the mosquito
bites they used to be!

62
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,291
You haven't changed!

63
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,708
So... Fill me in
on this job chicky.

64
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,500
Well, it's at the
government's request...

65
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,083
and it's worth a lot of cash.

66
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,958
Yes...! One government job

67
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,166
and you're pretty
much set, for life!

68
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Sweet!

69
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,208
For real...? Great!

70
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,625
This is straight panties.

71
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,958
Not to mention security

72
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,583
and a thick wallet look
real good to the chicks...

73
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,375
Damn, I haven't
been laid in years.

74
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,625
Someone out there
somewhere is in trouble today

75
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,291
Waiting somewhere for
someone to show them the way

76
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,291
That's the time that you and me

77
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,500
will show them
that we are hardcore

78
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,208
Help them out
or kick their butts,

79
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,416
whatever we are hired for--

80
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,958
The West Oasis
Mercenary Association,

81
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:40,625
We are your heroes,
We are your salvation!

82
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,958
This thing is a
hunk of steely cool.

83
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,458
It belongs to the government.

84
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,833
Of course it's cool.

85
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,583
It looks like it
could do some damage.

86
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,500
Just be sure you're
not in the way

87
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,875
when it does,
got that butt-munchkin?

88
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,708
Whatever. I'm just
thrilled that a chic

89
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,083
is the captain of
this whole thing.

90
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
Natsuko is my kind of woman.

91
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,166
Nothing like a crap in the
morning to clean the ol' pipes.

92
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,458
Tube connected and locked!

93
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,791
Roger that! Open the valve!

94
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,750
Oh, that is just disgusting.
You hear that noise?

95
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,083
I can't believe this crap.

96
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,916
I guess I just
expected a little more.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,083
But this is the government.

98
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,291
What's the matter, master?

99
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,666
I thought the
government might give us

100
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,791
something cool to do.

101
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,125
You know with a
little responsibility.

102
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,583
But it turns out
they're just using us

103
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,208
to haul last night's lasagna.

104
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,833
Don't think of it like that.

105
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,416
Didn't Natsuko say this
job was extremely important

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,166
to food distribution in
the West Oasis district?

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,458
Something like that.

108
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,458
Still, the only crap
I like smelling is my own.

109
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,750
Stop! You're not allowed
to use those toilets!

110
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,333
But I really have
to go! I'm cramping!

111
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,250
Those toilets are for Oasis
government officials only!

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,958
Get your damn hand off me!

113
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,666
Captain it's you!

114
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,958
Oh, crap.

115
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,541
We need the fertilizer
to grow our food.

116
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,041
That's how we stay alive...

117
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,625
Without recycling
the settler's shit,

118
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,250
we wouldn't have
it for the crops.

119
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,625
Then we'd have no food.

120
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,833
Without him we don't eat,

121
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,416
so you let the man
crap wherever he wants.

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,791
Are we clear?

123
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,416
I'm sorry captain!
I'll do whatever you say!

124
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,708
Just don't dock my pay!
I'm sorry!

125
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,166
It's okay, old timer...

126
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,875
You can take care of business
in any toilet you want.

127
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,583
Oh, holy mahogany,
here it comes!

128
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,333
That kicked ass!

129
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,791
Did you see how
she brought that lackey

130
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,291
to his knees without
even raising a fist?!

131
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,625
Yeah well she used to
be a crybaby... shut up.

132
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,208
We don't have time to
jerk around. Let's go.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
I don't know about you,

134
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,666
but it sounds like she
kicked that crybaby problem.

135
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,708
She's joking.

136
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,125
Natsuko always
loved a good laugh.

137
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,000
She used to always joke
like that when we were kids.

138
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,333
Really. I swear... I know.

139
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,708
You're totally convincing.

140
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,583
We have to hit the next
watering hole by sundown.

141
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,791
Let's get this rig on the move.

142
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,041
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,416
Our sister's ordering
those soldiers around.

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,458
She totally got that from me!

145
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,958
That's her job now, doof.

146
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,583
She's the captain.
Don't you pay attention?

147
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,083
Here's to our kid sister!

148
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,916
From the bottom of the world
to the top of the military!

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,333
Today, she commands
both--the Oasis soldiers

150
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,500
and the Machinegun Brothers!

151
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,583
Ah, it's good times for all.

152
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,875
Uh, what did you say?

153
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,208
We couldn't hear you.

154
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,500
I said it looked like you
were having a good time.

155
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,916
Hell yes!

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,125
We don't get picked up

157
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,333
for the good jobs
like this one too often.

158
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,708
Yeah... I didn't figure anyone

159
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,625
with a brain would have
taken this stinkin' job...

160
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,333
unless of course they
were somehow related

161
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,125
to Captain Panties up there.

162
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,916
What did you say...?

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,791
And you better think
before you answer!

164
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,916
I'm saying that
we're hauling shit...!

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,458
No one's gonna try to steal it!

166
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,250
You think this assignment is
given to a captain worth a piss?

167
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,750
Or do you think
they'd dump it off

168
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,291
on the lowest bitch
on the totem pole?

169
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,250
So if you dudes work
for the lowest bitch,

170
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,750
I guess that would just make
you the diseased horse flies

171
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,958
buzzing around the shit!

172
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,833
Keep laughing!

173
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:09,791
Ass!

174
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,250
Dance monkeys!

175
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,625
Uh, hey... sis

176
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,958
We were just, uh, introducing
ourselves to the soldiers.

177
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,166
You know, thought it'd be best

178
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,916
to know each
others names and all.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,083
We get to our posts right away.

180
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,458
The load is
completely on deck...

181
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,208
We'll be departing at once.

182
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,416
Ma'am.

183
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,458
You--

184
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,583
That's for
embarrassing our sister!

185
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,083
Sorry, bro...
I just... I lost it.

186
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,375
Well, find it and stick it back
in that empty canyon of a head.

187
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,375
Akio, you dumb--

188
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,125
Enough. We got work to do.

189
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,833
Any bodyguards?

190
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,208
Besides the soldiers, there
were about five mercenaries.

191
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,750
Then they haven't
caught wind of us yet.

192
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,333
If they had, they'd have way

193
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,958
more than five mercs
and some soldiers.

194
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,916
It may have
looked like only five.

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,750
But Desert Punk
is among those men.

196
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,333
Not the demon of the desert?!

197
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,875
The very same. And if you
think he's just one man...

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,541
You haven't seen anything yet.

199
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,791
Master, what did
that soldier mean

200
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,291
when he said that
no one would bother

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,291
to steal anything off this rig?

202
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,500
Shit is shit.
But it's valuable for us.

203
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,958
The trick is that you
need tons of the stuff,

204
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,500
much more than
this truck can haul,'

205
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,791
if's it to be useful
or worth anything.

206
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
So no matter what you
gotta go through to get it,

207
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,750
you'd have a hard
time getting paid?

208
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,458
Someone wanting to
steal one truck of shit

209
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,208
would have to be
hardcore badass enough

210
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,458
to steal hundreds.

211
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,083
So the rigs cross the desert one

212
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,166
at a time to cut down on theft.

213
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,333
What the crap was that?

214
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,791
Road's blocked.

215
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,375
Those rocks out there
are blocking the road.

216
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,458
I'm aware. Why don't you
guys go check that out?

217
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,291
Aye-Aye Cap'n!

218
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,833
Keep your eyes peeled!

219
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,541
What do you think it is?

220
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,625
A trap set up by
the sand pirates

221
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,708
to kilo us all... dumbass

222
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,541
Well? Can we make it through?

223
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,708
Not without a load of dynamite.

224
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,041
I doubt we can go around either.

225
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,666
The sand would get too deep
and the tires would sink.

226
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,583
We'd have no traction.

227
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,875
Hey...! What?

228
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,250
The radio's jammed.
I can't raise anyone.

229
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,333
We're under attack!!

230
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,875
A trap...

231
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:27,000
Man, that stings! I guess
that means I'm still alive.

232
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,750
No! Fuyo!

233
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,750
Get up, man! What do we do?!

234
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,041
His ribs are broken.

235
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,250
I hope he's not
bleeding internally.

236
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,875
We gotta get back to the rig!

237
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,208
I can guarantee
you that won't happen.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,166
Miss me?

239
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,416
I couldn't miss the stink.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,291
You know you should
really consider wiping.

241
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,833
You haven't changed either.

242
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,791
Predictable as ever.

243
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,958
I believe you and
I have somewhat

244
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,041
of a score to settle,
Desert Punk.

245
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,458
What do you say we
pick up where we left off?

246
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,458
You can have everything!

247
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,666
Please, just don't
search my cavity!

248
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,916
I know what you
guys do to people!

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,041
Man, Haru is such a vag.

250
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,375
To think that Rain Spider,

251
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,708
the number one collector
in the South Oasis...

252
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,791
Would stoop to the level
of the common thief?!

253
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,708
I wouldn't have to
if it wasn't for you!

254
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,958
What?

255
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,333
You mean that you
screw up out in the field

256
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,708
and you blame it
all on me? Grow up.

257
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,083
Enough.

258
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,083
You're dead before the
smoke clears on this scene.

259
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:42,291
Look at it this way--You
die, you become a legend.

260
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,416
He's had those weapons
stored up for this operation.

261
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,916
That means he's well prepared.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,583
Which pretty much means
I'm dead in the water.

263
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,375
I catch your drift.

264
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,166
You're here to take ownership
of the West Oasis rig.

265
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, looks like he's
trying to set these guys up.

266
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,500
Could be funny.

267
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,875
You geniuses have any
idea what this rig is hauling?

268
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
I hope you know
what you're getting into.

269
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,833
Is it not hauling shit?

270
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,291
You mean you
came after this load

271
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,333
knowing full well
what it contained?

272
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,250
Of course, I did.

273
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,208
Uh... Oh...kay...

274
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,583
It was a bold move.
I give you that.

275
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,750
Yes. I know.

276
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,916
What's going on?
You two can get kinda weird--

277
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,500
He's frozen
completely stone solid.

278
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,958
I've never seen him
look so tense before.

279
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,375
Oh no.

280
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
If we were attacked
by people who knew

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,916
about the shit, then they'd
have to be hardcore badasses,

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,208
just like master said.
Oh, we're screwed.

283
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,958
Damn! They've got
gunners on board!

284
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,416
Pick up your feet Haru!

285
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,208
I'm trying!

286
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,041
Jump, Kosuna!

287
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,750
They have a decisive commander.

288
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
I admire that about them.

289
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,750
Too bad Desert Punk got away.

290
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,958
No worries. The operation
went according to plan.

291
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:20,875
Natsuko--

292
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,166
I mean, Captain...

293
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,958
Can we stop at a
town with a doctor?

294
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,958
Fuyo looks like he's
doing worse by the second.

295
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,250
He could be a mess inside

296
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,083
and we'd never know
without a doctor's help.

297
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,416
Sorry, but we can't...

298
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,583
We're going straight
to West Oasis...

299
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,708
Wait--

300
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,000
Our first priority
is to get the truck

301
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,583
and its contents
safely to the Oasis.

302
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,125
But our brother?!

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,333
You should listen to
your Captain, Akio...

304
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,958
If we lose this truck we lose
everything, including our rep.

305
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,541
The best thing to do
in this situation

306
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,208
is keep moving so
they can't hit you.

307
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,000
But...

308
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:51,958
How's my box?

309
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,916
The signal is fried, even though

310
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,625
it's not that strong
a jamming frequency.

311
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,500
But the area it covers is huge.

312
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,041
I didn't think
they could do that.

313
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,916
Oh, no.

314
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,500
We're all gonna die!

315
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,541
They're crawling
all over the rig!

316
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,375
Master, what are we gonna do?!

317
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
Stay on the ground!

318
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,833
Akio!

319
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,500
Clean these goons
off the other side!

320
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,000
Cool!

321
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,458
Shut this door and
lock it behind you.

322
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,000
But--

323
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,291
That's an order!

324
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,125
If they take control
of this rig, we are dead!

325
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,333
Yes, ma'am!

326
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,625
I'll flank them
to the other side.

327
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,125
You just keep them pinned down.

328
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,416
Don't order me around!

329
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Just move your ass!

330
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,083
All the big guns are useless

331
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,416
with these guys
all over the rig.

332
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,875
We'd just blow ourselves away.

333
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,791
Gotta find something else.

334
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,958
What do we do?
We can't even see 'em!

335
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,125
Either of you notice
your captain's, gone?

336
00:17:59,208 --> 00:17:59,666
What?!

337
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,083
Where is she?!

338
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,250
That coward!

339
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,666
She's locked herself
in the control room!

340
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,125
Captain my ass!
Freakin' desert woman.

341
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:07,958
You idiot!

342
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,333
You'll get yourself killed!

343
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,916
That's why all of the
shots are over our heads.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,291
The morons can't even see us!

345
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,083
They're shooting blind!

346
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,625
Time for Kosuna
to save the day...

347
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,125
Out here it doesn't matter
if you're a woman

348
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,208
or from the desert.

349
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,958
When you're good, you're good.

350
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,291
What the crap?

351
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,666
This wasn't here before...
Knock knock.

352
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,375
Who's there?

353
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,750
Cut it out!

354
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,958
That was close.

355
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,916
I knew it. I just knew it.

356
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,708
She's the baddest chic
in the Kanto Desert!

357
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,500
I hope it hurts when
you hit the ground!

358
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,416
Goon H, does coffee
make you poo?

359
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,416
You know something
Goon G... It does.

360
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,708
I really hurt...

361
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,750
The back of the rig is secure.
How's the front?

362
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,250
Taken care of, ma'am.

363
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,125
Double check and
make sure we're clear.

364
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,750
Aye Aye, Captain.

365
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,625
What you did
was really stupid...

366
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,000
You could've been killed.
Don't do it again.

367
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, no... I won't...

368
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,916
That being said...
I have to say thank you...

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,750
Without your distraction,
I would have never

370
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,416
have had the chance to jump down
and take those fellas out...

371
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,708
You really saved the day.

372
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,625
Thanks! I'm happy
that I could help!

373
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,416
So... What was that about?

374
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,541
That's right...! Natsuko
just thanked me for my help.

375
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,208
What for?

376
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,583
I distracted them--

377
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,208
Then she jumped in
and put the smack down!

378
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,291
Huh?

379
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,791
Oh, yeah... It was...
Like Stryker...!

380
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,708
Remember all of his cool Kenpo?

381
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,708
She moved just like he did!

382
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,666
He okay?

383
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,083
I think so. He's sleeping now...

384
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,666
That soldier over there
gave him a shot of morphine.

385
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,458
Yeah...

386
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,500
This sucks.

387
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,541
It'll be morning before we
can get these parts repaired.

388
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,625
It'd be easier if we
could radio for help.

389
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,666
Yes it would Captain obvious.

390
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
I just wish we knew

391
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,875
where they were sending
their jamming signal from.

392
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,458
Did you hear what
that kid was saying?

393
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,958
About the captain using Kenpo?

394
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,125
Yeah, which means she underwent
special ops training...

395
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,041
But I don't know who'd let
a desert person into that.

396
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,500
I'm starting to think

397
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,375
this mission isn't
about hauling shit.

398
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,875
It might be a cover.

399
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,375
Why not...?

400
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,916
With a Kenpo captain and a
handful of mercs on our side,'

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,166
I'd believe anything
at this point.

402
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,083
What's the deal Punk?

403
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,250
You're never this serious
around the ol' campfire.

404
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,250
It's our happy fun mantime.

405
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,125
There's a lot about
this mission I don't like...

406
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,375
That includes our
enemy and our leader.

407
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,833
You got something you want
to say about my sister?

408
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,166
Take it easy...

409
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,375
You mean you haven't
noticed anything about her?

410
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,500
No I haven't.

411
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,125
These guys were too well armed

412
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,583
and too well prepared to be out

413
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,208
for stealing a
simple truckload of shit.

414
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,083
I can't put my finger on
what they're really after.

415
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,625
I agree.

416
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,125
Something stinks and its not
just the truck or Haru's shorts.

417
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,750
But how's our sister involved.

418
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,666
I'm not positive that she is...

419
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,458
But today she was
an awesome captain,

420
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,208
and no leader that good
would be put in charge of this.

421
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,333
I think... She's lying to us.

422
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,041
So captain... is that right?

423
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,291
Uh... Hi, sis.

424
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,291
Now... You gonna try
and shut me up?

425
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,625
Silence me forever.

426
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,958
Or... do you just wanna
pick up where I left off?

427
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,166
Yo! I gotta say that Natsuko
has filled out rather well!

428
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,916
I love Natsuko. She's amazing!

429
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,625
Yeah, an amazing rack
of lambies on her!

430
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,125
Boobies, boobies, boobies!

431
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,500
Is that all you can think about!

432
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,375
What else is there?!

433
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,583
This is so dumb.

434
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,250
The next episode is
called "A Load Of..."

435
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,125
Shit! I forgot my box.
