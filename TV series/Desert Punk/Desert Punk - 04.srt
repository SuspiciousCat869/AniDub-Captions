1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,375
An up-to-date
personalized rocket winch!

16
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,333
And an ultramodern ultralight
life continuum air module!

17
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,541
A brand spankin new
reishiki helmet layered

18
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,250
with a high-carbon composite
and aramid fiber cover!

19
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,541
A reinforced
heavy-duty aramid cape!

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,250
And of course reflective
aramid pants and leggings!

21
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,791
My recently repaired,
lucky, trusty,

22
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,958
sand resistant shotgun
with a back-bored barrel

23
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,708
and extended magazine tube
that holds an extra shell!

24
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,208
I am Desert Punk... Revived!

25
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,458
With nearly all
brand new equipment!

26
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,666
Batteries sold separately,
side affects

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,208
may include nausea,
diarrhea and even death!

28
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,375
And last but not least,

29
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,291
we have the creme de la crème...

30
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,875
Ta-da! The M40-A1 sniper rifle!

31
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,000
Complete with a 24 inch
heavyweight barrel

32
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,958
and rugged laminated stock.

33
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,416
Perfectly set for the
long eye relief scope

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,666
and a controlled
round push fed chamber

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,250
for super quick action!

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,291
The perfect squeeze!

37
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,708
It's like a beautiful woman
and it's finally mine!

38
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,291
All mine! My darling M40-A1!

39
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,166
I love you...

40
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,208
I really banked on my last job.

41
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,375
Walked away with a
big bag full of yen.

42
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,750
In the end, though, the treasure

43
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,541
and those awesome
boobs both slipped

44
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,750
through my fingers.

45
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,333
Actually, I wish those boobs

46
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,708
had slipped through
my fingers more.

47
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,083
That woulda been cool.

48
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,375
But instead,
I have my new partner.

49
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,250
My sweet M40. I think
I'll call her Alice.

50
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,208
Now, what's it gonna be today?

51
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,916
Where's my target practice?

52
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,125
What was that? That a bug?

53
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,625
Crap, who the hell was that?!

54
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,208
The distance is
about eighteen hundred.

55
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,166
He's a pretty decent shot.

56
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,791
I guess we know

57
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
who we're popping
your cherry with.

58
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,041
Wait. Where'd he go? Seriously--

59
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,750
Don't think you're
lucky, Desert Punk.

60
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,250
I hit everything I'm aiming for.

61
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,458
What?

62
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,750
My first shot got your helmet.

63
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,916
The second shot got your rifle.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,166
You earn a gun like that.

65
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,833
No kid like you
deserves an M40-A1.

66
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,958
I paid cash for this gun!

67
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,375
You're the greatest mercenary
in the Kanto Desert.

68
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,958
I wanted to see if you
live up to your reputation.

69
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,666
I have a name, like you.

70
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,166
But the only name
I want the desert

71
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,500
to know is defined
by my actions.

72
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,083
I am The Shimmer Sniper.

73
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,125
And I challenge you,
Desert Punk, to a duel.

74
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,791
What the crap are
you talking about?!

75
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,000
You're rambling
like a crazy person!

76
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,208
Why do you want to fight me?!

77
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,875
Are you nuts? Screw loose?

78
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,958
Momma didn't hug
you enough? What?

79
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,166
He shot her!

80
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,416
I've busted my ass

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
and broken my body to
save up for this gun.

82
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,875
She was finally mine. Alice...

83
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,666
So this guy is looking
for a little notoriety?

84
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,666
Gain some prestige
in the merc community

85
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,791
by taking out the
big boy on the block.

86
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,750
He knows I'm the
best shot in the desert.

87
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,958
As if he can knock me
off my throne. No way.

88
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,375
I accept his challenge.

89
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,083
Wherever he feels like
hiding, I'll find him

90
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,000
and beat some sense into
that shimmering head of his.

91
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,625
Jerkass!

92
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
The first shot was
from over there...

93
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,250
The second shot was from here.

94
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
They're still fresh.

95
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,708
That's weird.

96
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,708
He was the one challenging me...

97
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,458
But he's walking away
in a straight line.

98
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,166
Northeast...

99
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,833
There you are.

100
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,875
That was close.

101
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,625
He was walking in front of me!

102
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,791
How did he double back so
fast as to get a clean shot?

103
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,541
And the speed of those rounds.

104
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,000
That's an automatic rifle.
Man, it figures!

105
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,291
It's like there's two
of this guy out there.

106
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,583
Come on. Take the bait.

107
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,750
Just show me where you are.

108
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,833
Bingo! Gotcha pal!

109
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,916
If my Alice wasn't
all busted up,

110
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,125
he'd be dead right now. Dammit.

111
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,250
I'll just get in close enough,

112
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
he won't know what hit him.

113
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,125
He just fell.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is the Demon of the Desert

115
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,083
we're talking about here.

116
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,041
A simple fall won't kill him.

117
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,250
I'll wait until dark.

118
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,916
Well, at least
I lived... I guess.

119
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,833
He's nothing but
a rookie sniper.

120
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,791
No veteran would feel the
need to prove something,

121
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,875
so I doubt his
equipment is any good.

122
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,958
He can draw out his
enemy as well as I can.

123
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,291
I thought this was a game
of who-finds-who first,

124
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,333
but he always knows where I am.

125
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,458
How does he move so fast?

126
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,583
Drop it!

127
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,833
Don't make a move!

128
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,416
What?

129
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,375
You're just a little girl!

130
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,208
A freakin' kid?!

131
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,291
No way!

132
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,500
Thanks mister!

133
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,125
You totally saved my life...

134
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,541
I've been lost out here alone,

135
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,125
wandering around
for like two days!

136
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,291
Obviously, I haven't
eaten anything either.

137
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,000
So, thanks for the food.

138
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,208
No sweat.

139
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,791
Those things are like
a thousand yen each.

140
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,708
But the water is... free.

141
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,750
Don't worry about it...

142
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,250
No price is too high if
it means I'm still alive...

143
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,458
You know?

144
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Here you go.

145
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,125
Don't mention it.

146
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,583
Wow...! I'm so glad I ran
into a person like you...

147
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
The last guy I passed
wouldn't even look at me,

148
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,500
even though I was dying.

149
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,708
Course, I don't know if
I would've wanted his help.

150
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,041
He was carrying a rifle

151
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,291
that was longer
than my entire body.

152
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,958
Wait. Say that again!

153
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,750
You saw a guy with a rifle?

154
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
Where was he?
Where did you last see him?!

155
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,250
Damn...

156
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,833
Kid, if you don't wanna die,

157
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,416
you might wanna duck and cover!

158
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm perfectly safe...

159
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,875
He'd never think of landing
one of those bullets near me.

160
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,291
Huh?!

161
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,041
Wait a second!

162
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,500
That's my damn pack!
What're you doing--

163
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,458
I gotta go... see ya!

164
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,541
Wait you tiny little--

165
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,083
I got it! Those footsteps...!

166
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,250
That freakin kid has
been prancing around

167
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,333
faking the Shimmer
Sniper's footsteps!

168
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,583
Well crap.

169
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,666
It's a living hell.

170
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,500
She took all my batteries
and all my water.

171
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,791
I have to ration everything

172
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,000
if I'm going to
make it through this.

173
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,666
Even turn off the air
conditioning in my helmet.

174
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,791
Although I don't know how
long I can keep this up.

175
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,583
Geez this is hot.

176
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,583
He hasn't moved
an inch down there,

177
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,750
has he, teacher?

178
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,541
No he hasn't.

179
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,375
By the way stealing his bag

180
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,375
was a brilliant move, Kosuna.

181
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,500
Now we wait.

182
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,916
So, if you take out
this Desert Punk,

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,083
then you'll get all famous

184
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,958
and start getting
bunches of jobs, right?

185
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,375
Something like that.

186
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,458
His skills gained him his fame.

187
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,250
It'll only be fitting when
my bullet takes him out.

188
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,250
He's the complete
opposite of you.

189
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,666
Well, teacher.

190
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,875
You're the best sniper there is,

191
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,541
but your problem is
that you're too nice

192
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,375
and you have a
crappy business sense.

193
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,833
He's the opposite of that,
all's I'm saying.

194
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,916
I forget how honest
kids can be sometimes.

195
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,083
Right on!

196
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,125
He's got all sorts
of food, gadgets,

197
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,375
and cool stuff in this knapsack.

198
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,500
Don't touch anything.

199
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,750
It could be wired.

200
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,958
Yeah.

201
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,750
What the... huh?

202
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:53,166
I'm gonna melt if
I stay here any longer.

203
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,791
Man, I never wanted to do this.

204
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,583
This sucks!

205
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,125
But what's a contingency plan

206
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
if you don't use it?

207
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,333
It's time to make
your move, Desert Punk.

208
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,708
There!

209
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,750
Now!

210
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,583
Hold onto your asses!

211
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,750
There you are!

212
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,041
Uh... Teacher?

213
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,500
Kosuna, are you hurt?

214
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,333
No, I'm cool.

215
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,833
What is it?

216
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,833
There's like a
dozen Desert Punks!

217
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,666
This is impossible!

218
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,250
Try this!

219
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:07,666
What the--

220
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,166
Cripes. It was a balloon

221
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,916
Are all of them balloons?

222
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,375
Not a chance.

223
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,375
If I know Desert Punk,
he's mixed in here somewhere.

224
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,708
Like here!

225
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,166
Dammit!

226
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
Maybe this one!

227
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,166
Son of a bitch!

228
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,750
One balloon...

229
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:37,666
Two balloons...
Three balloons...

230
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,666
These dozen balloon
disguises I bought.

231
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,041
My awesome rainbow
colored smoke bomb.

232
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,125
They were well worth the money

233
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,125
even though they
are mostly gone now.

234
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,458
The Great Kanto Desert
is a wretched place,

235
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,500
but I didn't think anyone would

236
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,166
actually try to steal from me.

237
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,583
Using my smarts,
I planted that bomb anyway.

238
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,416
Insurance is pretty sweet...

239
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,083
I never actually thought
I'd have to use it, though.

240
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,875
Who gives a crap?!

241
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,500
You take me for
this much of an idiot?

242
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,125
Actually, yes.

243
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,208
I've forged my way through

244
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,125
this desert hell
a hundred times over.

245
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,958
I always take
whatever the situation

246
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,708
is in front of me
as a challenge.

247
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,958
Now, you don't actually think

248
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,333
that someone who's
earned the name

249
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,500
"Demon of the Desert"
would bend over

250
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,458
and take it from a two-bit,
one-trick pony like you, do you?

251
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,166
Probably another damn balloon--

252
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,833
That... was not a balloon.

253
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,541
Teacher, no!

254
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,375
You said that you
aimed at my rifle.

255
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,500
That's what gave you
away as an amateur.

256
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,583
I would have never
given you a chance.

257
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,958
The second you were in my sights

258
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,291
I would have popped you off.

259
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,541
No warnings. No chit-chat.

260
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,583
My... My teacher...

261
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,833
He actually lost...

262
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,708
Please... Don't hurt me...

263
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,916
Help me...!
I'm too young to die!

264
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,166
Are... Are you serious?

265
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,458
Crap!

266
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,083
This the only thing you
have that's worth anything?

267
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,416
This Dragunov?!

268
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,833
It's a piece of crap gun

269
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,250
that wouldn't
even pay for repairs

270
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,625
on my M40 if I hocked it.

271
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,750
There's no sweetness
to this victory.

272
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,791
Mister!

273
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,208
Hey, Mister!

274
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,791
Don't call me Mister.
I work for a living.

275
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,916
Now you can keep following me,

276
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,958
but I'm going to
keep ignoring you.

277
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,666
I'm going to tail
you until you agree

278
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,083
to make me your
apprentice! Got it?

279
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,708
Seeing your face
brings back bad memories.

280
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,458
I can't trust you.

281
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,166
Being at the top
of the food chain

282
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,958
has made Desert Punk a target

283
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,583
for those trying
to prove themselves.

284
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,333
Like he doesn't already
have enough to deal with.

285
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,958
Please!

286
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,333
I want to be the strongest
girl in the desert,

287
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,166
and I won't rest until I am!

288
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,916
You know... you need a hobby.

289
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,750
Just tell me what I need
to do to make it happen!

290
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,958
I'll even cook your dinners!

291
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,708
No. I already have
prepackaged meals.

292
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,166
I'll even do your laundry!

293
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,875
Can you get that out?

294
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:05,916
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

295
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

296
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,875
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

297
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,125
It's actually a cape.

298
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:19,833
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

299
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,250
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

300
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,333
His heart is black.

301
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:29,125
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

302
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

303
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,625
<i>He's on the run again</i>

304
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,625
On the run again.

305
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,500
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

306
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,625
He's got a job.

307
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,416
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

308
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,750
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

309
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,625
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

310
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,625
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

311
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:06,208
<i>It's what you do</i>

312
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,083
Yo. What's up?

313
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,208
I'm Desert Punk and I wanna know

314
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,750
what you thought
of today's knockers.

315
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,000
Wait, there weren't any, huh?

316
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,333
No, you sicko.

317
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,291
Boobs are what blond girls
have instead of brains.

318
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,958
Forget about tits.
What about me?

319
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,041
Next time on a very
special Desert Punk,

320
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,583
"The Price of Water!"

321
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,250
Miss it,
and we'll hunt you down.
