1
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,208
Goodbye, Kanta.

2
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,666
This may be the last,
time you and I ever lock eyes.

3
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,875
Come here and gimme some of
that before you go... aggeggh...

4
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,666
I guess I should be thankful

5
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,958
that they're not
going to execute me...

6
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,250
Of course, compared
to years in prison,

7
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,791
a day in the electric chair
might not be so bad.

8
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not putting any of
the blame for this on you...

9
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,833
You've always tried to keep
me safe. You're so sweet...

10
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,750
It was a good effort.

11
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,708
But now I'm off to jail.

12
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,875
I told you to be
a man and win me over

13
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,375
with your charm and dignity.

14
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,750
I said I'd be your slave.

15
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,041
I'd do whatever you wanted.

16
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,583
And here when I'm ready...

17
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,875
You get me sent to jail...

18
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,416
For a little corporate
espionage, dumb-ass.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,291
Say goodbye to these
roller-coaster rockets

20
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,875
cause you'll never have them.

21
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Hope you have a
nice and lonely life!

22
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:57,375
Nooo!!

23
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,750
I was supposed to take
that left at Albuquerque.

24
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,875
Master. Would you
get over it already?

25
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,750
You've been pouting
like this for a week now

26
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,833
and it's really starting
to get under my skin.

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,541
Face the facts. Junko is toast.

28
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,791
Good riddance.

29
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,416
She's in the slammer
for corporate espionage,

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,125
so she's gone for a long time.

31
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,791
That's if she's not dead already

32
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,958
from the inhumane conditions
and constant torturing.

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,791
Uh?

34
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,833
You've been acting like a
frantic little idiot for days...

35
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,625
You digging those
foxholes not only

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,291
wastes time and energy,
it pisses me off.

37
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,833
Lay off of me...!
I've been really bored.

38
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,125
We don't know if those tanks
are gonna come back for us...

39
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,708
Junko may have ratted us out

40
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,291
and if that's the case
I want to be prepared.

41
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,125
You're stupid.

42
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,125
If the government
really wanted to capture us,

43
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,208
no defense we could dream
up would ever be enough...

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,916
We could never win
that battle by ourselves.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,291
My contract was stamped

46
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,666
with a government seal
and issued by Mugenya.

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,333
It should have been
binding in this region,

48
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,708
but they ripped it up like
a brothel sign-in sheet.

49
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,791
Watching them
destroy my contract

50
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,458
without an explanation
is all the proof I need

51
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,708
to see where I stand out here.

52
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,375
Our existence in this
desert is meaningless.

53
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,958
We're like poo in a monkey's paw

54
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,833
being thrown around the desert
at the government's discretion.

55
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,791
They can't be all bad.

56
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
They still supply a
lot people with food

57
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,041
and the fuel they
need for generators.

58
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,625
Anyway, it's not gonna do me
any good whining about it now.

59
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,250
But if I ever see those
colostomy bags again,

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,291
I'm gonna give them
a piece of my mind.

61
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,458
Huh?

62
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,333
I didn't know there was

63
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,583
a Chinoike artifact
investigative unit.

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,625
Yes, and I'm the Captain. Ikeda.

65
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,875
So what's your job?

66
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,791
Just wandering around,
searching for artifacts?

67
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,208
Well, yes, most of the time,
but right now...

68
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
I'm searching for
a missing person.

69
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,083
I thought all the
artifacts worth anything

70
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,250
had already been
dug up and cashed in.

71
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
The ones that are worth
something have been,

72
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,250
but there are still plenty
of finds with academic value.

73
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,958
So who is this person you
want us to find for you?

74
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,500
Is it a business partner?
Someone you have to kill?

75
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,958
The man who
broke your back door.

76
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:19,166
Very funny but no. This person
is with the military.

77
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,166
Military? You mean he's with
the West Oasis Government?

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,625
Yes that's right.

79
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,458
Our investigations can take
us to dangerous territory,

80
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,708
so we always have armed
security as an escort.

81
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,333
We were excavating
a deserted village

82
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,875
when we came under attack.

83
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,791
Many of my men were
killed in the process.

84
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,875
I tried, but I never
got a good look at who...

85
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,208
Get down!

86
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,416
Fuyo?!

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,333
Uh, what's going on?

88
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,500
Are we alive?

89
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,166
Punk! What are you doing here?!

90
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,875
Not these dudes again.

91
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,833
I sure as hell didn't
come out here for the view.

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,791
I'm on a job.
What are you guys doing?

93
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,583
I thought you were
taking some time off.

94
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,625
Keep it together.

95
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:09,041
It's Natsuko... she's...
she's gone missing.

96
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,458
Bummer.

97
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,083
It happened during
a covert operation,

98
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,416
so according to the authorities,

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,083
she isn't officially
considered missing.

100
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,333
And since it's not official,

101
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,875
the bastards refuse to
send out a search party.

102
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,166
That is something.

103
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,458
A freaky coincidence
considering my client here

104
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,625
is searching for a
missing person as well.

105
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,333
Ikeda these guys
are the brothers

106
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,750
of Sergeant Kawaguchi, the same
Sergeant you're looking for.

107
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,875
Really?

108
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,708
No way!

109
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,916
The way I see it...

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,416
Since we're all looking
for the same chick,

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,708
we'll cover more ground
and do it faster

112
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,041
if we work as a team?

113
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,458
Whattya say?

114
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,041
Come here you little bastard,
bring it in to poppi!

115
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,291
So I take it you three were
conducting your search in

116
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,583
and around this city?

117
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,083
Yeah.

118
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,708
Then you were working off
some pretty crappy intelligence.

119
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,083
What the hell you
trying to say huh?

120
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,666
It's, it's just that...

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,791
You're looking for her
in the wrong place.

122
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,958
Sergeant Kawaguchi
wasn't abducted in the city.

123
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,833
She was taken down below.

124
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,750
Below?!

125
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,833
Oh that's nice.

126
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,166
A hidden door!

127
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,333
Aw, dark smelly holes scare me.

128
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,458
This hidden entrance
is so top secret

129
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,958
that not even the upper echelons

130
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,541
of the government know about it.

131
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,416
If any of you leaked the
whereabouts of this place--

132
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,666
Blah, blah, secrets!

133
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,708
Enough with lecturing!
Now, lead the way, Ike!

134
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,375
I just pooed in my suit!

135
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,791
Don't just stand there.
Let's follow him.

136
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,208
Wait for me!

137
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,416
We're coming Natsuko!

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,083
You sure I shouldn't stay behind
and keep an eye on things.

139
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,208
Shut up.

140
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
Sawada. Their heat
signature has disappeared.

141
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,000
We are unable
to continue tracking.

142
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,208
What?

143
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,375
There's no way those
men could just vanish.

144
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,625
You mindless fools!

145
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,458
Humans cannot and
do not disappear!

146
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,666
They either have a device
to cloak their heat signature

147
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,041
or they're beyond the
range of your sensors.

148
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,333
Understood.

149
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,875
We have learned now.

150
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,083
We're going after them.

151
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,666
Wow!

152
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,000
Freaky! What is this place?

153
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,041
I can't believe something
this ginormous

154
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,250
is underneath the ruins.

155
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,500
Incredible isn't it?

156
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,750
We're three hundred
meters below the surface

157
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,958
and the best part is

158
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,916
that the government
has no idea it exists.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,083
What you are looking at is

160
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,666
the legendary Underground City
of the Dark Ages.

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,916
No shit.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,875
This place is the whale's balls!

163
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,791
There's tons of
metals and plastics,

164
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,083
even materials
I've never seen before.

165
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,708
I gotta figure a way to
haul all of this outta here.

166
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,416
Hell there's enough
of a fortune here

167
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,791
for me to afford a
harem of slutty women

168
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,875
in every village
across the desert.

169
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,333
And you're only
seeing one percent of it.

170
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,875
All of the other
ruined sites have

171
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,708
been picked clean
of their good stuff.

172
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,125
Yeah wait until everyone
else in the desert

173
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,750
hears about this place.

174
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,833
Master, take a look at this.

175
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,291
What is it?

176
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,541
It's a rock.

177
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,916
Look closer.

178
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,791
December fifteenth,
three thousand twenty six.

179
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,333
Those are survivors' notes.

180
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,500
Those who became separated

181
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,875
from their loved ones
would leave notes

182
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,583
to let the others know
that they were safe.

183
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,416
You can find them
all over the place.

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,916
Parents looking for their kids.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,416
Lovers praying
for a safe reunion.

186
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,375
And some just asking why.

187
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:45,875
Check it out.

188
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,541
This is soot from a fire.

189
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,333
You'll notice the ceiling
is covered in burn marks.

190
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,708
It appears that
this entire tunnel

191
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,166
was engulfed in
flames at one point.

192
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,625
I wonder what could
have happened down here.

193
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,041
Whatever it was a lot of people
lost their lives in this tunnel.

194
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,875
I read this cool
book recently...

195
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,291
It said that in the Dark Ages
there was a civilization

196
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,000
capable of sending
people to the stars...

197
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,416
Something really horrible
must have happened

198
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,041
to cause the extinction of
such an advanced society.

199
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,333
I wonder if the
guy who wrote this

200
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,708
was ever able to
reunite with his family.

201
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,125
Kosuna, it doesn't matter.

202
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,166
It happened, like,
a million years ago.

203
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,541
Wait for me!

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've seen one of
these things before...

205
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,416
It was in that same book...
What was it called?

206
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,125
A train!

207
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,708
Heeeey!!

208
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,666
Bouncy! Bouncy!

209
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:48,916
Wow.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,291
This is so cool!

211
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,125
Backward, forward, backward,
forward, backward...

212
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,166
This thing looks like
a form of transportation

213
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,833
that was obviously
designed for long-haul travel.

214
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,000
So the Underground
City must be huge.

215
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,833
For many years now
I've been researching

216
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,041
the Dark Ages
and its hidden cities.

217
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,750
And with all the data
I've compiled it seems

218
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,416
very likely that these
underground channels

219
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
span the entire Kanto Desert.

220
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,500
That would make this one tunnel

221
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,333
over a thousand
miles long, right?

222
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,666
Correct, though many large
portions of it have caved in.

223
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,791
Toward the end of the Dark Ages,

224
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,291
people started to
take refuge underground

225
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,833
to escape an unknown danger.

226
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,250
Yeah that's a
comforting thought.

227
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,250
So they moved down
here to be safer?

228
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,083
From what? I see they
did a great job of dying.

229
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,375
Alright Smarty McThinks-a-lot.

230
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,375
We gotta get our
game on and find Natsuko.

231
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,375
Just follow me.

232
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,708
Mister Desert Punk sir...

233
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,083
Have you ever been
inside the West Oasis?

234
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,291
No, but when I was a kid
my father tried to get us in.

235
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,541
And that sucked...

236
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,583
We were turned away when
we got to the entrance.

237
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,333
It looked then kinda
like it does now.

238
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:55,208
The front gates were so enormous
they actually frightened me.

239
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,625
The place was so huge it made
me want to puke my lungs out.

240
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,958
Then there were those shanty
towns just outside the gate.

241
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,916
They looked so pathetic
against the oasis walls.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,083
That's the place formed

243
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,500
by the workers who
built the Oasis, right?

244
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,208
They live like that and they
still work for the government?

245
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,958
Yeah. That's
Central Watering Station.

246
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,208
It's where all the mindless
government lackeys live.

247
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,541
It's a real poop market.

248
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,500
That poop market happens
to be my hometown.

249
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,208
Oh It's lovely.

250
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,291
Whatever it doesn't
matter where I'm from.

251
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,375
Tell me, do you happen to
know what's inside the Oasis?

252
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,791
Well from the rumors
I've heard over the years...

253
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,166
it's some kinda
huge underground city.

254
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,416
Underground?

255
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,791
It's a sprawling
subterranean complex,

256
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,291
enormous even by
government standards.

257
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,958
Our leaders operate
out of an ancient

258
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,875
buried facility submerged
three thousand meters

259
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,458
below the surface.

260
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,750
Its size is so vast that they
only utilize half of the space.

261
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,875
Most of the unused portions

262
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,416
are still unexplored
even to this day.

263
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,625
Isn't that amazing?

264
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,875
Yeah, no... Just thinking about

265
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,125
such a place gives me
an itchel on my satchel.

266
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,791
There was an incident that
happened about ten years ago.

267
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,791
In the deepest regions
of the West Oasis

268
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,000
a surveying
technician became lost.

269
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,500
The area he was in
was an elaborate maze.

270
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,458
Once he got turned around,
there was no hope for him.

271
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,875
Then one week later...
the surveyor was found.

272
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,958
He was discovered
over fifty miles away

273
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,875
from where he had
originally become lost.

274
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,375
Wait a minute.

275
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,375
He was found at
the same entrance

276
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,208
we just used to get down here.

277
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,333
Inddeed Mister Desert Punk.

278
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,083
You pick up on these
things rather quickly.

279
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,500
What you're saying
is that we're sitting

280
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,791
on the back porch
of the West Oasis.

281
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,083
What?

282
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,333
I came to this
area ten years ago

283
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,583
to begin my research
on the ruins.

284
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,625
Before he succumbed
to his dementia,

285
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,791
that surveyor told me
about the existence

286
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,375
of this underground city.

287
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,833
You mean the poor surveyor died?

288
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,583
Yes.

289
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,458
Due to the shock of
being lost in the dark

290
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,500
for a week with
no water or food,

291
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,833
his health was beyond
the limits of medicine.

292
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,833
We held a service for
him once he passed

293
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,166
and buried him
here in the tunnel.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,833
Hold on now... you never
sent the body to his family?

295
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,500
Um, no we didn't. Why?

296
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,041
If news of the surveyor's death

297
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,083
went public then everyone would
know about your discovery.

298
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,625
Dick!

299
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,000
You set us up...!

300
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,416
You conniving,
bottom-feeding jack-hole...!

301
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,041
What in the hell have
you gotten us into?!

302
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,291
What are you getting
all bent outta shape for?

303
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
Try opening your eyes, Fuyo ...!

304
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,916
We've been wandering
around a back entrance

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,166
even the government
doesn't know about...

306
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,541
That makes us terrorists!

307
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:59,000
He's dragged us into his twisted
anti-government movement!

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
Even though I work
for the government

309
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,875
and live in that shanty
town as you call it...

310
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,625
my personal and political
beliefs do lie elsewhere.

311
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,541
You hate the government
and you're my sister's enemy!

312
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,041
Which makes you my enemy!

313
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,375
Spill it, you troll!

314
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,208
Were your terrorist
friends responsible

315
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,666
for Natsuko's disappearance?

316
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,416
No! Not exactly!

317
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
Hey...! Give back my rifle!

318
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,166
What are you doing??!

319
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,083
Please no!

320
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,041
Come out come out
wherever you are!

321
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,041
How was he able to see us?

322
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,333
We're over six
hundred meters away!

323
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,666
Situation report.
Minor damage confirmed.

324
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,083
We have been fired upon

325
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,833
and have yet to receive
instructions for this situation.

326
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,416
Awaiting new orders.

327
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,791
Come on!

328
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,958
Do I have to spell out
every little thing for you?!

329
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,125
Since following them
has obviously failed,

330
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,833
it's time we show some force.

331
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,625
Now go capture one of them

332
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,625
so we can get some information!

333
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,291
That's your order!

334
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,458
Not so fast!

335
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,958
Where'd they come from?

336
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,875
I can't allow
anyone to leave here

337
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,750
with information
about this place.

338
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,166
Shoot them.

339
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,208
What the...!

340
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,166
Whoa. Looks like we have

341
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,625
more company than I expected.
It's a full on battle!

342
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,958
I wonder who a...

343
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,250
We've been following
you my brothers.

344
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,916
Natsuko!

345
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,750
It's true.

346
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,166
We heard that
you'd been abducted

347
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,458
so we came all the way
here to rescue you.

348
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,541
You're not hurt, are you sis?

349
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,083
Your sister's just fine.

350
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,458
This was a crock of
shit from the get-go.

351
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,416
I got your number now.

352
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
To think that all this
time I thought you

353
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,458
were just some worker bee
for the government...

354
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,458
Talk about biting the
hand that feeds you!

355
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,166
You're a rebel with
the rest of these guys!

356
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,125
A no good terrorist!

357
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,583
Well, I was born and
raised in the desert.

358
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,333
Listen up.

359
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,333
I don't care if you
have to slaughter

360
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,208
every single one
of their soldiers.

361
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,041
This is your time to show
them what you're capable of!

362
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,166
Use the combat skills I've
taught you and blow them away!

363
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,750
Affirmative.

364
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,333
Oh no!

365
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,333
Whatever you do make sure

366
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,041
you capture their
commander alive!

367
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,375
I need to find out how
he's connected to this.

368
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,000
What are these things?!

369
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,708
Question sir.

370
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,875
How do we differentiate

371
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,375
between the commander
and his soldiers?

372
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,375
You actually need me to give
you instructions on that...?!

373
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,833
He's the cowardly guy
in the back giving all

374
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,291
the friggin' orders!

375
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,000
Just get your programmed
butts out there

376
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,791
and capture them all!

377
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,708
What's with this elaborate
and long-winded effort

378
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,333
to try and recruit me
into your alliance?

379
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,375
I can see how you'd
want me in your group

380
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,291
with my super reputation...

381
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,333
I have the ability to chew up
my enemy and spit 'em out!

382
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,208
But help me understand
why you chose

383
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,375
to show me this tunnel,
your big secret,

384
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,583
before you knew
if I'd join or not...?

385
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,208
What the hell were you thinking?

386
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,541
It wasn't my decision.

387
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,875
Say what?

388
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,083
I don't trust you one bit Kanta,

389
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,416
and I don't want you
to have anything

390
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,958
to do with our alliance.

391
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,541
Someone else insisted
on you coming here.

392
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,708
Oh really.

393
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,833
What does he gain
by showing me this...?

394
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,875
And who is this nutjob?

395
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,625
You'll find out soon...

396
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,458
I want to make something
very clear to you Kanta...

397
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,875
My fellow soldiers
and I are not here

398
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,750
for our own personal gain...

399
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,833
Our objective is to make the
desert a better place to live.

400
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,541
If the desert inhabitants
united and helped each other,

401
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,125
we could create a
world where the weak

402
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,875
and poor can live without fear.

403
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,041
We wish to create
such a society,

404
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,875
and we can do it with your help.

405
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,000
Uh oh. Wrong note.

406
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,416
That's just the kind of
thing he hates... Oh well.

407
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,583
Himuro, Himuro, answer me...!

408
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,416
Shusaki what is happening
to the right flank?!

409
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Stryker, sir. The entire
second unit has been...

410
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,583
Capture them all.
Capture them all.

411
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,791
Capture them all.

412
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,000
This isn't good...
Damn government army.

413
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,000
Why did I even bother with them?

414
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,666
Sergeant Kawaguchi.
We're retreating.

415
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,083
Roger that Stryker...

416
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,625
I have Desert Punk
detained and ready.

417
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,208
Where'd he go?

418
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,708
Master. Are you just
going to ditch Natsuko?

419
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,458
Idiot...! We owe nothing
to the government

420
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,791
nor to Natsuko's
little rebel faction...

421
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
Screw'em to the walls I say!

422
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,875
A solid point
but not very polite.

423
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,041
Yar.

424
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,000
Ahh... Wait!

425
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,875
Those things look familiar!

426
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,375
Usually have to hide those!

427
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,583
Inconceivable!

428
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,666
How the hell could he
have fallen for that?!

429
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,541
Sametsu, what's your status?
Come in! Come in!

430
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,916
Damage is minor.

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,708
I will continue advancing
the attack at once.

432
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,916
He has some thick armor on him,

433
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,958
but he seems like
a real dumbass.

434
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,208
So do you.

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,625
Natsuko, what are you doing?!

436
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,500
I would prefer that he walk
himself out of this tunnel...

437
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,708
but your friend here
can not be trusted.

438
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,708
I guess you're right.

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,250
Hey this is the coolest dude
in the Desert, Stryker!

440
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,875
We're gathered here today
to remember Desert Punk's...

441
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,208
Cram it! I'm not dead yet!

442
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,958
Ahh, bummer.

443
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,541
Master becomes a shooting star

444
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,041
in the next episode,
"A Raw Deal".

445
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,541
Miss it and I'll spank you!

446
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,625
You know I like that.
