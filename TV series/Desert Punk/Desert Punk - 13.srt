1
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,500
Yet another scorching
day in the hell-hole

2
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,500
they call the
Great Kanto Desert.

3
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,708
Having just finished a job,
Desert Punk and Kosuna

4
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,791
are making the arduous trek,
that's all too familiar.

5
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,875
What a drag.

6
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,375
Look Master. Over there.
You see them?

7
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,375
More victims of nature.

8
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,791
You think that could
have been their dad?

9
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,416
That or their owner.

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,250
Wa... water.

11
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,500
Well, let's keep moving.

12
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,291
What? Hold on.

13
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,500
Aren't we going to help them?

14
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,291
They're just little kids!

15
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,041
Listen stupid.

16
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,875
Thanks to that magnetic
storm back there

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,250
we're not much better
off than those kids.

18
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,583
So if you have a
death wish feel free

19
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,458
to rush over there
and save their lives.

20
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,083
Just don't go looking
for help from me.

21
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,500
Got it?!

22
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,958
I'm so thirsty.

23
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,750
Try not to talk Shiji...
You gotta save your energy.

24
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,958
I can't believe
you found that town

25
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,041
without even opening a compass.

26
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,208
What did I tell you kiddo?

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,291
You can't beat my
instincts and you definitely

28
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,958
can't survive in the
desert with just machines.

29
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,208
You're not foolin' me.

30
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,250
I know there's a
good guy in there somewhere.

31
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,375
What?

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,791
As soon as we saw
the town you turned

33
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,208
around and we've been
retracing our steps ever since.

34
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,833
You're gonna save
those kids aren't ya?

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,291
Hell yeah I am.

36
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,541
Kids that age can fetch a
pretty price on the market.

37
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,166
What were you expecting?

38
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,875
Saving them out of the
kindness of my heart? Get real.

39
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,333
I'll get a fat reward for
those kids if they're missing.

40
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,375
And if not, then I'll sell
them to the highest bidder.

41
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,375
Did you get dropped
on your head as a child?

42
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,041
The only way to survive
in this business is

43
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,958
to be ruthless and cunning.

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,500
Well, you've got that nailed.

45
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,875
A man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

46
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,416
He wasn't here when
we passed before.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,583
He just looks
a little dehydrated.

48
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,958
Check this guy out.
He's freaking ripped.

49
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,333
You can say that again.
And he's cute too.

50
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,333
I'm a dude. I didn't notice.

51
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,458
Are you going to sell him too?

52
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,458
Yup. How those kids looking?

53
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,958
I guess they're good.
They're not dead.

54
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,666
Wake up ya schmuck...!
You want to die out here?

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,916
Drink some water.

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,916
Pull the reigns pal.
Don't get too excited...

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,583
You'll get a drink
once you sign this.

58
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,583
You saved us.

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,958
Thank me later.

60
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,833
I'm gonna need you to go
ahead and pay me now though.

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,125
The cost for saving your
life is a million yen.

62
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,041
Does it look like I have
that kind of money on me?

63
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,708
Then, I guess
you'll just owe me.

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,750
You were gonna sell those
little brats weren't you?

65
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,791
Well guess what?

66
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,333
Now that money's
going in my pocket.

67
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,208
I'd never sell a child!

68
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,166
I got turned around
a couple of days ago

69
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,416
during a powerful
magnetic storm,

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,083
and I've been lost ever since.

71
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,208
But when...

72
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,375
When I ran across these two...

73
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,083
I knew I had to do something
quick... or they'd die.

74
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,625
What is it?

75
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,833
Are you telling me
that you wanted

76
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,625
to save their lives
without a single thought

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,708
of personal gain for yourself?

78
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,166
I guess I did...
Is that a problem?

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,458
It's wrong in every way, Smiley!

80
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,625
In the desert you can
only think about yourself!

81
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,166
It's survival!

82
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,708
This must be your first time
stranded out here like this.

83
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,083
Geez... You're, a cynic.

84
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,208
No I'm a realist!

85
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,166
Hopeless. So what about them...?

86
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,583
They got cash, food?

87
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
They don't have anything.

88
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,208
We'll just have to sell them.

89
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,625
You won't!

90
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,416
I think I will.

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,458
Whatever they're worth
to you I'll work it off.

92
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,875
I'll do whatever it
takes to keep them safe!

93
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,000
If that's what you
want stupid, I'm game.

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,416
I'm always impressed by your
shrewd business sense, Master.

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,916
Getting him to sign off
on the I-O-U form... Smooth.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,166
And now that I have

97
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,083
his autograph I officially
own his sorry ass.

98
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,791
Don't even try to run
cause I'll hunt you down.

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,041
Don't worry, I won't.

100
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,791
I actually take pride
in keeping my word.

101
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,000
Whatever.

102
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,041
Here.

103
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,750
Oh I...

104
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,833
It's okay... I don't
have much of an appetite.

105
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,458
You know, I just realized
I don't know your names.

106
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:46,541
My name is Asari...
This is Shiji.

107
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,083
Well it's a pleasure to
meet you... I'm Stryker.

108
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,125
No daddy please!!

109
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm sorry Tsumiko!
We need the money!

110
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,291
I promise I'll
come back for you!

111
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,166
My baby! My baby!

112
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,083
Norio!

113
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:10,958
Here's your money.

114
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,791
No please! Don't take my daddy!

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,041
The good ole' human bazaar.

116
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,583
This is disgusting.

117
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,583
Better get used to
it because you're up

118
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,500
next on the auction block.

119
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,666
Well well.

120
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,875
Huh?

121
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,916
That is a strapping
young lad if I may say.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
He's an impressive
specimen, isn't he?

123
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,708
Now check out the
guns on this guy!

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,541
And look at these
pearly whites...!

125
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,833
With teeth this
perfect you'd want

126
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,041
to buy him just to
chew your food for you!

127
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,083
Ooh then tell me your price sir.

128
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,208
One and a half million yen.

129
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,958
Now that's a deal!

130
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:44,916
Are you nuts?

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
Get lost!

132
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,583
We specialize in
pretty young females.

133
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,625
That was harder than
I thought it'd be.

134
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,041
Duh!

135
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,541
Maybe we should
consider lowering the price.

136
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,291
No I want one and
a half million yen

137
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,916
and I won't settle for
anything less! Non-negotiable!

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,541
Damn you!

139
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,958
What are you laughing at?!

140
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,083
Do you know how lonely
my wallet is because of you?!

141
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,958
Look at you! These are people!

142
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,916
Is making money
that important to you?!

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,916
Yeah!

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,041
And you're willing to stomp all

145
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,791
over the weak and
poor just to get it?

146
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,541
Without even blinking!

147
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,458
Who are you anyway...?

148
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,208
And what planet are you from?

149
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
Sacrificing yourself
just to save those kids,

150
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,333
giving them your food.

151
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,583
Why would you do
something like that?

152
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,916
I guess I can't help it...
It's just a part of my nature.

153
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,166
I just realized that you
remind me of something.

154
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,333
Yeah it's all coming
back to me now.

155
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,083
A long time ago this
desert was occupied

156
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
with a thriving population.

157
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,750
They all believed
in helping each other

158
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,041
with the idea that it would make

159
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,166
everyone's lives
better, happier.

160
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,666
They built their
entire society around

161
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,750
that concept and the result...

162
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,500
Well, just take a
look around you now.

163
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,333
Those people came
together with the belief

164
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
that their way of life
was strong enough

165
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,875
to fight off any uncertainty,

166
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,750
and they couldn't
have been more wrong.

167
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,333
I can see it in
your eyes that you

168
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,791
know exactly why their
way of life failed.

169
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,166
It does you no good
denying the truth.

170
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,666
And listening to you spout
off your idealistic beliefs...

171
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,875
It really makes me want to puke.

172
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,166
Master over there!

173
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,208
Stop running you brats!

174
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
Get, those, thieves!

175
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,916
Golly this looks like
its gonna be a lot of fun.

176
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,791
Stay here...

177
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,208
You don't stand a chance
against those numbers.

178
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,875
It's for the best if you just
let nature run it's course.

179
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,875
No...! Shiji!

180
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,958
Where do you think you're going?

181
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,000
Shiji!

182
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,333
You shouldn't
have run little girl.

183
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,833
Let her go!

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,458
Help!

185
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,500
Wait Stryker...

186
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,708
You're not gonna have any
effect on those guys unarmed...

187
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,000
It would be a total waste if
you were to get hurt right now.

188
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,375
All I ask is that you
let me do this one thing...

189
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,458
I can't allow my saviors
to be put in harms way.

190
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,291
After all these years
I don't need some mercenary

191
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,750
to tell me what I already know.

192
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,541
I realize what I'm doing is
futile but it won't stop me.

193
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,541
That's why I've been
ridiculed everywhere I go.

194
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:45,125
That's why I have no job,
no money, no wife.

195
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,250
But still it won't stop me
from doing what's right.

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,916
Wow he just flipped
on the intense switch...

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,125
You gotta admit,
that was just rad.

198
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,125
Those eyes.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,375
I know now...

200
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,333
What do you think you're doing?!

201
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,416
Let the children go.

202
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,625
He wants the kids!

203
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,875
I know very well...

204
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,625
It saddens me but,
I can't, I can't help myself.

205
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,791
This is the only way
I know how to live.

206
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,916
There is no other path.

207
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,291
This is what I was born to do.

208
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,291
Wow, that guy's got
some moves on him...

209
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,041
Who would have thought
he'd be that strong?

210
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,750
It might be a good idea

211
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,541
if we watch what
we say from now on.

212
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,791
I don't want to get beat up.

213
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,083
Shut up.

214
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,958
You're gonna pay for this!

215
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,833
I think he punched a gland.

216
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,166
You saved us!

217
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,708
With that impressive display.

218
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,083
Your selling price
just went up ten-fold.

219
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,083
You were awesome.

220
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,458
Don't even think
of coming closer...

221
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,333
Now... You were a
soldier weren't you, eh?

222
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,666
Huh?

223
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,916
And I'm not talking about
a simple foot soldier.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,291
I'm thinking you were

225
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,750
with an elite force
secretly operating out here.

226
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,583
I happened to see
them one night...

227
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
in the darkest part
of the desert.

228
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,875
A band of robbers famous

229
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,041
for their fighting
abilities were decimated

230
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,000
in a matter of seconds
by a group of armed men

231
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,625
I had never seen before,

232
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,541
and I've seen
everything in this desert.

233
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,833
These men were trained
by the best in the world.

234
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,375
They were on a level
above everyone else.

235
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,291
Their movements
were flawless, graceful.

236
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,166
No wasted motion in
attacking their target.

237
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,333
They left no trace behind
and disappeared like the wind.

238
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,875
They all used a
special technique.

239
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,291
Now that I think of it,

240
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,875
it's the same technique
you just used on those men.

241
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,750
It's called kenpo,
in martial arts.

242
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,375
What's that, chief?

243
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,500
I've heard it's an ancient
fighting technique,

244
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,875
employed by assassins, passed
down since before the Dark Ages.

245
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,458
It's no surprise that you
don't know about it kid.

246
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,958
It became obsolete
many years ago.

247
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,958
I had heard rumors that
it was still in practice

248
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,625
in the oasis and I guess this
proves they were correct...

249
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,666
but in a secret army.

250
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,625
It's hard to believe until you
see it with your own eyes.

251
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm starting to
understand now...

252
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,208
Many of the Oasis Army
troops are born

253
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,708
and raised in
the oasis territory.

254
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,333
You're one of them aren't you?

255
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,583
No way!

256
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,166
You're from the oasis?

257
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,625
And here I was thinking
you were just some naïve boy.

258
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,000
So tell me Stryker.

259
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,500
What's an elite Oasis Army
solider like yourself

260
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,208
doing in the
armpit of the desert?

261
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,458
What do you know,
you're not an idiot.

262
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,666
Pretty knowledgeable
about our history, too.

263
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,750
I guess you could say I'm
somewhat of a history fanatic.

264
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,000
You see...

265
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,791
I'm not as adaptable as you
mercenaries tend to be.

266
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,833
How dare you! You're gonna pay!

267
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,708
He must be friends with
those guys you trashed.

268
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,833
What do we do?

269
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,208
Lucky day!

270
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:34,083
Go get him Stryker...!
Show them what you got!

271
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,875
But Master isn't that

272
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,375
the opposite of
what you said earlier?

273
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,416
Stryker... You're the only
one who can protect those kids.

274
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,291
Alright... everything I was told

275
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,583
to believe since
I was a child...

276
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,500
was nothing but
a bunch of lies...

277
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,416
I don't believe
in anything anymore.

278
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I'll make you hurt
for what you done!

279
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,666
That's why I'm here,
doing what I do.

280
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,416
I'm here to find my
ultimate purpose in life.

281
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,958
Wow.

282
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,333
You know, this martial arts
thing is pretty sweet.

283
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,291
Maybe I should
look into the... ehh?

284
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,083
He's mine.

285
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,625
I found him first.

286
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,166
Excellent work my friend!

287
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,500
I see. So now we're friends huh?

288
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,541
I'm gonna be rich.

289
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,000
You're wasting your time.

290
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,125
Stop worrying over
something so worthless.

291
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,666
What are you talking about?

292
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,208
You should only do the
things you believe in

293
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,750
and want to do.

294
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,000
What is this? After you have
cut down every single thing

295
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,125
I've said or done since we met?

296
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,708
I never said not to
do what you want.

297
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,791
I just said
I hated what you did.

298
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,875
I don't know what
happened with you but...

299
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,416
if you remain hesitant forever,

300
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,958
this desert will
eventually eat you alive.

301
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,375
You should be free to
live the life you want.

302
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes! I hear a
million five hundred!

303
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,291
Any more takers?

304
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,625
A million six hundred!

305
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,041
I hear a million six!

306
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,708
Million eight anyone?
Million eight? Anyone over here?

307
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,041
Put me down for a million eight!

308
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,625
Million eight to
the man in the hat!

309
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,583
Looks like that show you
put on shot your price up.

310
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,375
Well it's a good
thing those guys

311
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,208
were watching the fight earlier.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,916
Yeah.

313
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,916
Sure you're okay
with this Stryker?

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,708
It's out of my hands...

315
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,458
A promise is a promise right?

316
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,458
Can I ask...?

317
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,916
What is it...?

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
You said before that you
live to protect the weak

319
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,500
and the poor just like

320
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,500
you helped those two
little girls earlier...

321
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,291
So do you really intend to
protect those kids forever

322
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,583
like you're their
father or something?

323
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,458
That's a tough one.

324
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,625
What happens when you're gone?

325
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,333
I mean those little girls
will probably end up dying.

326
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,375
But then...

327
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,083
If Master were
to save those girls

328
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
and sell them to one
of the people out there,

329
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,833
then at least they would be
fed and somewhat protected.

330
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,541
Sure their lives will be hard
and without many freedoms,

331
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,625
but at least they'll have a
chance to grow stronger

332
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,166
and maybe make something
of themselves one day.

333
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,333
Otherwise they'd be another
set of corpses in the desert.

334
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,541
What do you think Master?
Am I wrong?

335
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,583
I would love to
answer your question

336
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,416
but that would require
me to think, so I won't.

337
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,833
Stryker, all you're really doing

338
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,458
is just satisfying your
own ego and spoiling the weak.

339
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
By protecting them
you're not allowing

340
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,541
those kids to gain their
own set of defenses,

341
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,500
making it harder for them
to survive on their own.

342
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,791
You know I'm right...

343
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,083
I almost let myself fall

344
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,375
into the trap of
babying those kids but,

345
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,250
luckily I was saved by
your words of wisdom Master.

346
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,333
Yeah, well I don't know
about words of wisdom.

347
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,333
I was just calling his bluff.

348
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,416
Kosuna our friend
here is an idealist.

349
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,208
That means he'll fight
for what he believes in

350
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,333
even if the odds are
stacked to the ceiling.

351
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,666
Stryker...

352
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,458
So this is the
Great Kanto Desert.

353
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,125
Yeah.

354
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,958
I will continue to look for my
purpose, no matter the cost.

355
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,500
There are people in this
land who want to be strong

356
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,125
but for whatever reason cannot.

357
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,708
Then there are those who die

358
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,208
before they even get the chance
to show what they're made of.

359
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,458
I'm pretty sure my life's
work will be in helping

360
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,875
those people find
their own paths.

361
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,375
At least that's what I hope.

362
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,875
Screw it! I'll pay 2 million!

363
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,958
Yes! I just heard 2 million!

364
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:37,958
Who wants to take it up higher?!

365
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,208
Two point two anyone?

366
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,000
You know, I wonder what
happened to those kids.

367
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,166
Don't move Desert Punk...

368
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,500
Unless you want to get shot.

369
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,208
What is this?
We haven't done anything.

370
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,208
Shut up! I'll hear your
story at the station!

371
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,541
What's the charge?

372
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,541
Fraud, theft, and murder.

373
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,708
What?

374
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,416
Also...

375
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,166
Unnecessary violence
against members

376
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,125
of the Number Three Watering
Hole Farmers Association.

377
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,166
Say what... I had
nothing to do with that!

378
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,208
This sucks.

379
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,708
Bunch of crybaby farmers.

380
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,500
They're farmers...
Those guys were farmers?

381
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,083
Who would have thought

382
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,583
those little girls were
thieves wanted by the police?

383
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,000
They act like orphaned children

384
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,583
and fool travelers
into helping them.

385
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,083
Then they steal their food,
water and money.

386
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,875
The little punks.

387
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,791
And we were completely
taken in by them.

388
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,708
No wonder Mr. Wholesome
here was fooled by them.

389
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,208
Now the constable thinks
we're part of the kid's gang.

390
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,500
He probably thinks
that because Stryker

391
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,625
beat up the farmers that
were trying to catch the kids.

392
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,625
For the next three days
the trio was investigated,

393
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,333
and when the authorities
didn't hear answers

394
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,458
to their liking,
they resorted to torture.

395
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,625
Which can be quite unpleasant.

396
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,666
Have you ever been subjected
to torture? Nasty stuff.

397
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,958
However...

398
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,666
When the authorities caught
wind of Stryker's identity,

399
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,166
all disciplinary action ceased.

400
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,833
The apologetic men
acquitted the three

401
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,791
of all charges,
and set them free.

402
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,083
I'm still having a
hard time believing it.

403
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,625
Those children having to resort

404
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,000
to a life of crime just to
survive to the next day...

405
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,416
It's heartbreaking.

406
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,125
This desert is...
truly a nightmare.

407
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,791
You know this whole
thing is your fault

408
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,000
just because you wanted to
be a hero and save everyone.

409
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,250
What??

410
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,500
It's great and all
that we were released

411
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,791
but the money those kids stole

412
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,666
and the damages against
the farmers association.

413
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,916
Remember that?

414
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,583
I have to pay for all
of it. Every last dime.

415
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,916
Well that's part of the
responsibility of owning me.

416
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,500
No matter what I do
I can't escape debt.

417
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,416
And it's all because of
you and your stupid ego.

418
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,375
Yet even though
you've done this to me,

419
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,666
it was because of you that
we were released from jail.

420
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,916
It's making me so confused.

421
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,541
I want to hate you so bad!

422
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,208
What are you talking about...?

423
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,083
You're in debt because
of your own selfish greed.

424
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Yo!

425
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,625
How'd it go?

426
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,083
Well, it went great.

427
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,625
You mean... you sold
him for two million?

428
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,791
No five hundred thousand.

429
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,958
Huh? What made
you lower the price?

430
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,791
Two million would have
only covered a fraction

431
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,291
of what I owe.

432
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,208
Ah, so you decided
to forget the debt

433
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,291
and do something
more mischievous.

434
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,750
Know what I did?

435
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,083
No you didn't!

436
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,916
You sold him to the gay guy?!

437
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,875
I wish you could have
seen the look on his face!

438
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,375
How can you sleep at night with
the things you do to people?

439
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,125
The funniest part
is I told the guy

440
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,541
that Stryker likes him
back but he's really shy,

441
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,458
so he just has to
romance him a bit.

442
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,041
Isn't that brilliant?

443
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,333
Now that's low.

444
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,666
Later, on the
walk out of town...

445
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,708
Hey Master. Check it out!

446
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,166
Huh?

447
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,000
It's those kids again.
Looks like they're back at it.

448
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,500
Should we capture them?

449
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,041
Eh, leave them alone.

450
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,375
What?

451
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,666
They already duped us
once did you forget that.

452
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,583
I think they're perfectly
capable out here on their own.

453
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,083
That's true.

454
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,625
Only in a place like
the Great Kanto Desert

455
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:41,416
can an infant be
your enemy. Weird.

456
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,666
Stryker here!

457
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,500
Next episode I'll be helping
out more of my fellow man.

458
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,916
Hey get out of here!

459
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,791
Even I've never tried to
steal the previews! Geeze!

460
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,125
How do you like your new owner?!

461
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,750
He's friendly.

462
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,500
Next time it's
"Kosuna: Fully Automatic!"

463
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,125
Don't miss it.
