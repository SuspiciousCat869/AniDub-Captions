1
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,833
Hey, everybody!

2
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,958
As you know, I'm only fourteen
but I'm working everyday

3
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,333
to be Kanto Desert's
number one power babe!

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,833
I've got crazy skills!

5
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,958
Whenever there's trouble,

6
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,666
I'll go into super-fly
mercenary mode!

7
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,291
I'll blow everyone away and
I won't take any prisoners!

8
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,416
Ta-da!

9
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,000
What the hell is this?!

10
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,541
What'dya mean boss?

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,458
It's a freakin' pit you moron!

12
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,583
Hold up! This place is
rigged so watch your step!

13
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,375
Now that I think about it...

14
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,125
What am I doing here?

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,583
Am I just wasting my time being
Desert Punk's number two?

16
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,041
I want to become a
powerful mega-babe,

17
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,166
but it sure doesn't seem like

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,291
I'm getting any
closer to my goal.

19
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,500
Sometimes, I just don't know...

20
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,416
They're on the move!

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,041
Heading south fast...!

22
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:09,416
Hello...! Kosuna,
do you copy? Come in!

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,916
Oh... what?!

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,458
Don't just sit there!

25
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,458
Go gather up those balloons
right now, you copy?

26
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,958
Roger that!

27
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Who is this creep?
He's freakin nuts!

28
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,583
Cool your jets!
I think we lost him...

29
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey bitches...

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,250
Hey where'd he go?!

31
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,583
How in the hell did he do that?!

32
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,458
Who cares let's get outta here!

33
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,333
 Help!

34
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,458
Hey, he took his pants!

35
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,458
Why'd he take his pants?

36
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,708
What did he do to you?

37
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,708
It's like high school
all over again!!

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,875
I'm getting outta here...

39
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,166
I don't want him
taking my pants off.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,458
Wait...! Wait for me!

41
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,625
Why did I get up this morning?!

42
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,500
Yay, there's another one.

43
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,208
Only two balloons to go.

44
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,833
Who am I kidding?

45
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,541
This is a total
waste of my time.

46
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,916
I'll never get to be a
power babe doing this crap.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,125
I need to strut my stuff and
show this desert who's boss.

48
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,333
You're mine now you damn fool!

49
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,791
Oh no, how could
I have been so stupid?!

50
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,791
Who knew this guy had
a knack for tricks.

51
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
Say your prayers Desert Punk...

52
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,416
This will be your final
resting place ... Fire!

53
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Hurry! We, gotta
find that sniper now!

54
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,083
Whoa, that was close!

55
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,208
Thanks for saving me,
whoever you are!

56
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,458
It was me! Kanto's
number one power babe!

57
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,250
If you want to live
another day you'll take

58
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,500
my advice and get out
of my desert! Pronto!

59
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,875
Kosuna...?

60
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,583
I can't believe it,
you're Kanto's most beautiful

61
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,916
and dangerous power-babe ever,
can I get your autograph!

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,416
We love you Kosuna!

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,791
You're the greatest
power-babe ever!

64
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,000
We're not worthy!
We're not worthy!

65
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,958
You saved my life Kosuna,
I owe you one big time.

66
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,708
It's obvious you don't need me
telling you what to do anymore.

67
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,625
You truly are the
greatest mercenary ever.

68
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,458
She's almost
better than pudding.

69
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,500
Hip, hip, hooray!

70
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,333
Maybe someday...

71
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,625
For now I guess I'm stuck here
dealing with these jerk-weeds.

72
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,541
Who you calling a jerk-weed?!

73
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,333
Balloons and a shovel...

74
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,708
So, you're the one setting
all these freakin' traps...!

75
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,666
It's pay back time!

76
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,875
I'm gonna beat you till
the white meat shows!!

77
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,625
Bullet proof...! Oh crud!

78
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,083
That all you got?!

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,083
Help!

80
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,583
Damn!

81
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,083
Look at him--dumb
meathead should have

82
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,416
headed back to camp and spared
himself some busted chops.

83
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,375
Master...

84
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,666
You know you set
yourself up for that one?

85
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,500
I know the guy jumped you

86
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,291
but he wasn't even armed
and he still stuck it to you.

87
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,916
Now, what would you have
done if I hadn't come along?

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,458
I don't know...

89
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,041
You're really going to
have to pick up your game

90
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,666
if you want to survive
out here, young lady.

91
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,875
I'm sorry, sir.

92
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,166
The fact is you should be able

93
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,458
to handle a job like
this on your own.

94
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,750
I've got better things to do.

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,375
There's no way I can
protect you all the time.

96
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay...

97
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,208
You're always off in la-la land

98
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,708
when you should be
doing your job.

99
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,250
That's your problem,
your delusions of grandeur.

100
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,125
Get over it!

101
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,958
Yeah, guess you're right.

102
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,833
You're turning out to be
more pain than you're worth.

103
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,791
I paid too much for
an AK for it to jam up!

104
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,500
You, think it's busted?

105
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,166
It's the sand that
clogs up these fully-autos.

106
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,333
Maybe the old man can fix it.

107
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,916
Do you think I'm dumb?!

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,541
Don't try and scam me
you damn scumbag...

109
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,708
I know you broke
the gun yourself.

110
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,041
But, I didn't break it...

111
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,166
Shut up...! If it's
giving you so much trouble

112
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,208
maybe you should
just carry a knife...

113
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,375
Get the hell out of my shop...!

114
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,583
Before I put a
few rounds in you!

115
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,125
Slow down!

116
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,125
Hey--

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,166
Business as usual, huh Igara.

118
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,916
Look, my favorite shit-head...
I see you're still alive.

119
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,250
Yeah, thanks to you, pal.

120
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,041
What can I do you for?

121
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,000
We need to fix the brat here
up with a new piece. Pronto.

122
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,750
How do you do sir?

123
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,541
My name's Kosuna, I work for
Desert Punk--I'm his apprentice.

124
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,791
It's an honor...

125
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,416
We were on a job
a day or two ago

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,916
and some happy jack gave
her a run for her money.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,291
She claims her gun
wasn't powerful enough

128
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,375
to stop the guy--I don't know.

129
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,083
I shot the guy like
five times in the chest

130
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,583
and he still didn't go down!

131
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,083
If I had blasted him
with a more powerful gun,

132
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,666
he would have been toast.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,750
It's not about getting your
self into a gunfight out there.

134
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,041
Anybody can do
something as easy as that.

135
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,041
The trick to it all
is not being spotted.

136
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,708
I know and I agree
but still if only I had--

137
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,625
I just have to...

138
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,875
I have to be able to get
myself out of my own mess...

139
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,041
You understand.

140
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,250
Ohh...

141
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,666
You know... you've been doing

142
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,375
an awful lot of your own
thinking here lately...

143
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,500
A real mercenary
doesn't need to think!

144
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,041
What do you know?!

145
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,958
All you care about are giant
cans and a nice piece of ass!

146
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,000
Follow me...
I've got just the thing.

147
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,250
How 'bout this one?

148
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,000
No good?

149
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,500
You know what I really want?

150
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,541
A 308 caliber assault rifle
and a big 357 magnum pistol.

151
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,166
Pipe down...
That stuff ain't cheap.

152
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,000
I know you think I'm
just a stupid little kid...

153
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,958
but I know what
I'm talking about.

154
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,375
Why can't you just trust
me for once and hook me up?

155
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,375
I need power...

156
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,500
Something that will knock 'em

157
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,708
to the freakin' ground
when I shoot it.

158
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,916
Okay... You have to
show me something first...

159
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,333
You have to prove to me...

160
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,583
that you're tough enough to
carry a bigger weapon got it?

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,833
Okay, fine.

162
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,625
I'll shoot any gun you've got!

163
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
Very well then...

164
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,375
Great! How about the 223?

165
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,791
Or do you want me to take
a stab at the 308 first?

166
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,666
Go dig some holes for awhile?

167
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,458
The shovels are over there.

168
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll get right on it.

169
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,791
I came to get a gun...

170
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,166
Why am I digging stupid holes?

171
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,791
Are you sure?

172
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,833
Don't you think you
should use the biggest one?

173
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,458
I see what he's up to.

174
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,750
This shovel's heavy...

175
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,291
My shoulder
muscles are burning...!

176
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,791
I know what he's trying to do...

177
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,416
Trying to teach me
to see my own limitations...

178
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
So, I'll choose a gun
that's best for my size.

179
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,375
You're such a cutie pie!

180
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,416
Screw that old fart!
I'll show him.

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,416
He thinks I'll
give up, but I won't.

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,541
He wants to teach me a
lesson? I'll give him one.

183
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,750
I need a gun with
power--I want that 308.

184
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,583
I need a weapon that
will rock the house!

185
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,333
So, sounds like those amateurs
are still at it, aren't they?

186
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,750
Yeah, up north in Skeleton City.

187
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,375
That was Kaplan
and Tanshon right...?

188
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,458
They're so worthless, you
shouldn't even waste your time.

189
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,541
I know, but I couldn't resist.

190
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,041
The job came down from
Mugenya and I had to take it.

191
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,916
It'll be over as soon as
the bodyguard gets out

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,166
of the hospital though.

193
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,791
Moron caught appendicitis.

194
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,208
Is that what I think it is?

195
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,041
You're good kid...
Most wouldn't notice.

196
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,916
So, it is then!

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,250
That's right...

198
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,291
At first glance it looks
like any other M2 clone...

199
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,458
but this one is an original.

200
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,583
I'm sure you already
know that the guns

201
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,500
we have here in the Kanto
are all replicas of old guns

202
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,500
discovered from the Dark Ages.

203
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,625
The originals excavated
from Skeleton City

204
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,250
have long since been confiscated

205
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,583
by the Oasis government
and hidden away.

206
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,041
Every now and then, after
they've taken them apart,

207
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,166
studied them and drawn up plans
to manufacture the replicas,

208
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,083
you'll see 'em out
on the black market.

209
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,708
I guess even the government
has people who can't be trusted.

210
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,125
They say, somewhere
out in the desert,

211
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,750
somewhere very secret,
deep beneath the sand,

212
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,166
there are government storerooms
filled with original weaponry.

213
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,541
Course it's very well guarded.

214
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,125
I hear it's a treasure
trove of all kinds of stuff.

215
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,833
Yeah, I've never seen it,

216
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,375
only heard rumors about it,

217
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,583
but I hear there's stuff there
they can't even figure out.

218
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,750
The technology
was just ahead of us.

219
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,666
Things from the
Super Technology era

220
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,583
that basically brought
about the Dark Ages.

221
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,375
So, what do you think of it?

222
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,208
It's totally different
than the knockoffs

223
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,750
being sold around town.
Don't you think?

224
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,625
Sounds good, huh?

225
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,875
The steel is a
vastly superior quality

226
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,333
than anything you
see these days.

227
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,333
From the materials to the
engineering to the accuracy...

228
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,375
everything's first class.

229
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,666
So, who does this
beauty belong to...?

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,375
Must be a millionaire or someone

231
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,625
with really good
government connections...

232
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,291
It had to have cost a fortune.

233
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,625
That looks familiar.

234
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,041
I've seen that retarded
chicken scratch before.

235
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,791
Desert Punk slacking off.
Imagine that.

236
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,375
Why do you always
have to be so annoying?

237
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,708
I don't think it's just
me that annoys you.

238
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,666
I think it's the fact
that the big, bad Desert Punk

239
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,458
got played by that run around.

240
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,250
What's her name? Junko?

241
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,333
Am I right Desert Puke?

242
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,458
And what about you,
Stain Spider?

243
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,500
All that work with
the Inumeiwa rock?

244
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,875
That's working out pretty
good for you isn't it?

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,666
Anyway, how's that
gun I asked you

246
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,416
to have a look at coming along?

247
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
I've been pretty busy lately so,

248
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,125
I guess I could really
use a couple more days.

249
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,250
That's okay...

250
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,833
I want it in tip-top
shape so you take

251
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,333
whatever time you need,
just not too long, all right?

252
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,166
Hey, loser!

253
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,333
What?

254
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,791
You seem to be doing pretty well

255
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,250
for yourself these
days lame Spider...

256
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,625
Are collections
that profitable now?

257
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm not collecting anymore.

258
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,166
Huh?

259
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,208
Igara, I will be back.

260
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,916
Good, you can pay for the door
when you pick up your gun.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,583
Of course. I intend to.

262
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,125
Wait?!

263
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,875
Take my advice punk--

264
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,166
You won't find money stuffed
in a poor man's mattress.

265
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,250
You know where you
find real treasure?

266
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,166
Where?

267
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,416
On the battlefield.

268
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,625
I don't know how he's doing it,

269
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,875
but that guy does seem to
have a good source of cash-flow.

270
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,625
What a duncebucket ...

271
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,333
I can't believe
that guy's giving up

272
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,916
on his collections business.
What's he thinking?

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,375
You're one to talk...

274
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,666
What are you gonna do,

275
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,208
be a damn mercenary
for the rest of your life?

276
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,416
I think you may be giving me

277
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,291
a little more credit
than I deserve.

278
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,291
You're probably right.

279
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,541
Well, let's get goin'.

280
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,166
I'm sure she's had enough.

281
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,833
Wake up...! You're not dead yet!

282
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,458
Wa-water...

283
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,625
Here you go.

284
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,208
Thank, you!

285
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,208
Slow down...
You don't wanna cramp up.

286
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,541
What?

287
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,416
Look here--

288
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,583
Here it is... the one
you wanted, right?

289
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,916
The 308 caliber
fully automatic, FN line...

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,916
It's a bit heavier
than the G3 model

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
but in the desert there's
nothing more deadly.

292
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,583
This sucker's heavy.

293
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,083
I can do it!

294
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,500
100 meters on her first try.

295
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,375
This is... unbelievable.

296
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,708
Amazing...

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,541
It's almost too much for me.

298
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,500
My shoulder's killing me.

299
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,791
It's way too heavy

300
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,416
and the recoil is pounding
the crap out of me.

301
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,583
I don't know that I could

302
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,250
handle this for a
long time in a battle.

303
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,458
The AK recoils even worse...

304
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,791
It's too light for
it's power... So, then...

305
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
Which one do you want
to try out next...?..

306
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,750
If you like, I've got an M4
or a 64 you could test out...

307
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:33,041
I guess it was too
much for me after all...

308
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,125
If I were to walk through
the hot desert with this...

309
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,291
plus the weight of extra ammo...

310
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,708
I'd be exhausted.

311
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,416
I couldn't do anything else

312
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,291
and that wouldn't
be good for anybody.

313
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,791
A gun is a tool...

314
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,750
And all tools can either
help you or hurt you...

315
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,416
just because you
have a powerful tool

316
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,875
doesn't make you
a powerful person...

317
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,750
Just look at him.

318
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,875
You mean me?

319
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,791
I've been around for 55 years

320
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,875
and I've never known such
a low despicable person.

321
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,541
I can hear you!

322
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,875
He's a cheap, cowardly,

323
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,333
spiteful bottom feeder,
and for some reason

324
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,375
he seems to think he's
better than everyone else.

325
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,833
Okay now wait, you don't
really mean that do you?

326
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,791
However...

327
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,083
However, what really
makes me so angry

328
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,000
at this piece of crap punk
is the way he runs around

329
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,791
the Great Kanto Desert
like a renegade...

330
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,875
with nothing more
than a beat up,

331
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,541
hand-me-down scatter-gun
he got from his dad.

332
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,708
He's had a
308 caliber rifle, rocket

333
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,000
and grenade launchers, even
a hovercraft over the years.

334
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,166
But he still wanders around

335
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
with that old shotgun
and nothing more.

336
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,625
Living carefree from day to
day like nothing else mattered.

337
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,958
It just goes to show
you just how unscrupulous

338
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,166
and self-centered he's
been all these years...

339
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,208
no more than a filthy coward.

340
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,666
I'm just trying to make a
living Igara, jeez back off.

341
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,625
See what a sniveling fool he is?

342
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,125
Yes... And, I think
he's very tough.

343
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,958
So, you think he's
a tough guy, huh?

344
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,916
That's when I realized
what I really wanted

345
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,208
and it wasn't a big monster gun.

346
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,416
I finally got a glimpse
of who I wanted to be,

347
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,125
what I wanted to be.

348
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:38,791
Tough and smart...
just like him. Wow...

349
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,958
That's sweet!

350
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,041
You like it?

351
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,333
It's perfect, just right for me.

352
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,000
Hold on, let me
adjust it a little more.

353
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Hey great!

354
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:53,958
Yo!

355
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,375
Yes, Master?

356
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,750
That little 9mm
machine gun has less power

357
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,958
but it's still going to take
some time to get used to it.

358
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,958
Oh, yeah... I know...
I'll figure it out quickly.

359
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,333
Okay, we'll see about that.

360
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,291
Just great! This must
mean that the old man

361
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,083
thinks she's got what it takes
to handle a weapon like that.

362
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,083
She's gonna get a
big head over this.

363
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,750
I just want to be very
clear about something.

364
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,583
A hot woman with a
nice set of milk missiles

365
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,583
doesn't need a big gun
to get ahead in the world.

366
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's get out of here!

367
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,416
Where the hell did he go?!

368
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,416
Run, just run!

369
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,083
It's a trap!

370
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,291
Another pit!

371
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,750
Watch out!

372
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:49,958
Missed him.

373
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,458
He disappeared!

374
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,541
Kosuna, I've taken care of
the enemy in Sector 11 South...

375
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,666
Get ready in Sector 8 North,
I'll be sending them that way!

376
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,916
Look sharp, okay?

377
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,458
Got it!

378
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,291
The sand is hot!
It's burning things!

379
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,000
Man I haven't shot
a single bullet all day...

380
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,125
Crap! I gotta get
to work in Sector 8!

381
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,625
I need to stop daydreaming

382
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,583
and focus on the task at hand.

383
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,666
Even if I'm only
digging holes all day,

384
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm still in training to be
Kanto's number one power-babe.

385
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,458
I know what I want to be

386
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,333
and I have to
work at it everyday.

387
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,083
But I have to remember
what Igara taught me:

388
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,875
a wise person
understands his limitations

389
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,166
and doesn't try and soar

390
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,958
farther than his wings
will take him... or her.

391
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,875
Kosuna here, the soon to be mega
power-babe of the Kanto Desert!

392
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,500
Don't listen to her
she's still an amateur.

393
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,875
Everyone's gonna make out

394
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,791
on the next episode,
One-eared Dogs and Idiot Frogs.

395
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:27,041
No! The real next episode
is "The Girl Next Door"!

396
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,125
Hey did notice the
new theme song?
