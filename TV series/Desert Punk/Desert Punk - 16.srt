1
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,875
Nice shootin' Captain...

2
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,625
So it was pulling
the trigger that got you

3
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,791
to the top so quickly.

4
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,166
It took more than
you could ever know...

5
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,083
Now quit being a
smartass and tell me.

6
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,458
What makes you
think you can go over

7
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,583
my head and
interrogate prisoners?

8
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,875
Sorry, master.
I had to tell her...

9
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,583
I didn't think you'd actually
do something like that...

10
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,708
not to mention
your techniques...

11
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,791
Partially naked
torture is weird.

12
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,541
Yeah, but it worked...

13
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
I couldn't understand
what the enemy wanted

14
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,583
so I had to ask him...

15
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,125
and the prisoners
spilled the beans...

16
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,875
They were ordered
to steal the rig...

17
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,625
And the load which means they
wanted this shit after all.

18
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,875
That says to me there's
something bigger behind this.

19
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,208
Something you've kept hidden...

20
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,958
Now, tell me, what are
we really transporting?

21
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,500
I gave you every bit of
information that I could...

22
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,833
And you agreed to the
contract with no questions.

23
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,125
Hoho...

24
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,166
I knew you'd pull out your
red tape at some point ...

25
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,125
Miss Mindless Military.

26
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,625
Where do you think you're going?

27
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,125
To do my job...

28
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,791
And don't think I'm walking
outta this until I get paid.

29
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,583
Move your feet Kosuna.

30
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,041
Yeah, okay!

31
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,291
Natsuko?

32
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,041
It's not that I believe
Kanta or anything like that...

33
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,750
But... If you have anything
that you want to tell us,

34
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,875
we're your brothers.

35
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,500
We can't do your job for you,

36
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,541
but we can help out our sister.

37
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,625
I'm only saying that,
I mean, you know,

38
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,083
you have to do your thing.

39
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,625
And we want to help you do it.

40
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,875
That's all. I just wanna
say that we're here for you.

41
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Whatever you need, you know?

42
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,000
You're good brothers.

43
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,375
Roger that.

44
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,375
Target is stationary.

45
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,958
All men have
reached their posts.

46
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,375
We're waiting for orders.

47
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,166
Good. We'll move in after
the rig has been repaired.

48
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,166
Until then,
maintain surveillance.

49
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,958
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:12,375
Now, we watch the paint dry.

51
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,916
Hold up. What are you doing?

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,125
I thought everyone
was at their posts?

53
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,916
Aren't you a little
short to be a goon?

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,583
I have no comeback for that.

55
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
What the hell?!

56
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,833
Dammit, Desert Punk,
you're supposed

57
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,333
to be on the rig
with the others!!

58
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,750
You should've planned better!

59
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,791
But you got so confidant
you got yourself hogtied!

60
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,708
Taking the
prisoner's desert suits

61
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,166
was a genius move, master.

62
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,333
Now what, do we kill him?

63
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
Kill me?!

64
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,916
You don't even know what
I'm doing out here...!

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,708
And you took a government job!

66
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,791
Which side are you on anyway?!

67
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,375
I work for me and myself alone.

68
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,541
And in doing so, I just happened

69
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,666
to find something
pretty interesting.

70
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,750
Let me see. I put it
right here. Uh, Yeah!

71
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,083
What the hell is in that thing?

72
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,625
Looky what I found in the
first aid kit on the rig.

73
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,375
It's that government drug!

74
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,000
Their experimental truth serum!

75
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,500
Don't you know what
that can do to people?!

76
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,291
Yeah. It's lethal
in the wrong dosage,

77
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
but we're just
gonna have to wing it.

78
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,666
No. Just ask me the
questions! I'll answer!

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,166
I knew you'd see it
my way Stain Spider.

80
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,791
Kosuna, go find their
jamming device and destroy it.

81
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,791
You got it!

82
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,041
Down to business.

83
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll shoot you through
the gut if you tell me

84
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,208
this is about hijacking shit.
What's the target?

85
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,958
Have you ever heard
about something called D9?

86
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,416
Sure. That's
the demarcation line

87
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,208
between the East and West Oasis.

88
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,958
It's the no-government zone with
Skeleton City in the middle.

89
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,291
Recently, a new
discovery was made there.

90
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,083
Something that's
been kept very secret.

91
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,666
A routine excavation team there
was slaughtered by bandits.

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,666
And the bandits got
their hands on the goods.

93
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,333
Right. A battalion from
the South Oasis pursued them.

94
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,458
They chased them all the way

95
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,000
to Watering Hole #40
in the West Oasis.

96
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,833
Then they just gave up.

97
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,666
Watering Hole #40?!

98
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,958
That's the first
shit-loading stop we made

99
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,083
after me and the
guys were hired.

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,500
All of this is conjecture.

101
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,041
But what we understand
is that they uncovered a WMD,

102
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,916
or weapon of mass destruction.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,833
It's so powerful
that our current trend

104
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:16,541
of bacterial warfare is like
a toothpick to the WMD's forest.

105
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,083
A weapon straight
outta the Dark Ages.

106
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,583
Could this WMD have been

107
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
what the Guardian
was protecting?

108
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,291
Of course, it's just a rumor.

109
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,458
So you're a big chicken.

110
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,541
That's why you're
hanging in the back,

111
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,958
letting your goons
do the dirty work.

112
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,166
Yeah.

113
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,500
I didn't think he'd cut
me straight on that one.

114
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,708
Say I believe you.
Who hired you for this job?

115
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,125
Who's your meal ticket, huh?

116
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,875
Actually, I'll let you keep
your mouth shut this time.

117
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,291
I have a theory.

118
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,458
The South Oasis Government
found the WMD first.

119
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,000
Then the West Oasis sent
in their boys dressed up

120
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,666
as bandits to steal it.

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,166
Am I close? In the ballpark...
Something?

122
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,166
Something's odd, Mr. Spider.

123
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,750
The jamming signal has stopped.

124
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,833
Its battery is fully charged,
but signal isn't registering.

125
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll check on it myself.

126
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,333
Just keep watch on the rig.

127
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,208
Yeah, roger that.

128
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,916
Master! I found
that jamming device

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,666
and smashed the
merciful crap out if it.

130
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,083
And check this out.

131
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,375
All the freaking guns that
got stolen this afternoon.

132
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
Whoa, nelly crapinstack!

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,625
Mine! Oh, my sweet baby!

134
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,083
I've missed you so much!

135
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
Those bad men didn't
hurt you did they?!

136
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,250
You son-of-a--

137
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:51,708
No you don't!

138
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,875
I thought he was unarmed!

139
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,541
How did he get that flash bomb?

140
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,958
I don't know.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,416
This fight ain't
even close to over.

142
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,791
Ma'am! They've got blinders!

143
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,750
We won't be able
to see them coming.

144
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,125
We're under attack...!
Get ready!

145
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,166
They're popping outta
the sand like beetles!

146
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,583
Why isn't Punk up here!

147
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,416
The little runt's
probably shining his helmet.

148
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,833
Can anyone hear me?

149
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,541
Kanta?

150
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,333
Where did you go?

151
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,708
I'm at our enemy's base...

152
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,083
Which is empty right
now cause their all over

153
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,583
by you guys shooting at you.

154
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,750
We took out
their jamming device.

155
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,083
I think this is
about the right time

156
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,708
to call in our reinforcements.

157
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,375
Regardless of your opinion,
I don't take orders from you.

158
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
Do what you want but
you'll be deader than disco.

159
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
Master, shouldn't
we go help the others?

160
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,166
You saw how those
goons operated last time.

161
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
I don't think our guys have
anything to sweat about.

162
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,500
Uh... okay.

163
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
Don't get me wrong.
I'm gonna finish this job.

164
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,583
I've already put
a few things in place

165
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,583
to make sure that happens.

166
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,791
What?

167
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,000
You don't still
think that I keep you

168
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
in the loop on
everything do you?

169
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,416
Well-- no.

170
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,250
Mr. Spider.

171
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
We searched the whole thing and
couldn't find what you wanted.

172
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,375
It could be inside
the storage tank.

173
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,541
We've done all
that we were asked.

174
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,791
We'll confirm retrieval as
soon as everything quiets down.

175
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,625
Until then, we move on.

176
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,250
Yeah, about that.

177
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,041
We're crammed in
back here like cattle.

178
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,166
Maybe there's something
you can do about that.

179
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,625
I don't think so.

180
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,083
Desert Punk stole our vehicles,

181
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,416
so we don't have much of
a choice but to use this.

182
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,541
I suppose we could always
throw these three overboard.

183
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,500
Yeah try it...

184
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,833
And watch me pop
your stones off.

185
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,541
Holding us hostage
won't do anything.

186
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,208
We'll find out about
that soon enough.

187
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,833
We've got a dust cloud
on the horizon!

188
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,166
I can make out a large
fleet of fighting vehicles.

189
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,458
Probably West Oasis
reinforcements.

190
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,000
Our young female captain
called in for backup.

191
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,458
Lucky for us, nothing
they've got can hold up

192
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,500
to what we have
on board--the WMD.

193
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,458
No matter how close they get,
they'll never open fire.

194
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,250
The only thing they
can do is chase us

195
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,416
like a dog chases his tail.

196
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,750
They're absolutely screwed.

197
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,750
Screwed! Screwed! Screwed!

198
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,875
There's something
blocking our route.

199
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,250
I think it's our stolen truck.

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,916
It's what?!

201
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,791
Desert Punk...

202
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,291
Just one man with one gun

203
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,958
and he thinks he can
take this baby down?

204
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,125
Never picked him
for the kind of guy

205
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,708
to lay his life on the line

206
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,916
when there's no
chance of success.

207
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,708
And why does he always
show up at the wrong time?

208
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,708
Don't stop this
rig for anything!

209
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,208
Turn the forward guns
on the truck and fire!

210
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,875
Blow that thing into next week!!

211
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,250
Yes, sir!

212
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,958
What's that?

213
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,291
It kinda sounds
like my machinegun.

214
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,541
What's up?

215
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,791
Desert Punk's blocked
our path with the truck.

216
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,041
No way... I thought
he bailed on us.

217
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,500
Master?

218
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,541
Yeah?

219
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,833
How can you detonate
an explosive set

220
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,125
on the bottom of the rig?

221
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,458
I just can.

222
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,041
Did you forget? There's
a freakin' WMD on the rig!

223
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,541
What if that goes off when
you set off your explosive?!

224
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,000
Then I guess we'll all
die today. I'm kidding.

225
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,125
I calculated the explosive
power to be large enough

226
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
only to destroy
the electrical wiring.

227
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,416
It'll slow them to a stop.

228
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,708
Now put your shoulder to
the stock and start shooting!

229
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,500
What's going through

230
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,583
that twisted little head
of yours, Desert Punk...?

231
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,333
Stop toying with that
truck and destroy it!

232
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,250
I rule!

233
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,833
Did you see that
master! One shot!

234
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,000
You all right?

235
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,125
Uh, Master?

236
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,250
That imbecile!
We're all gonna die!

237
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,041
I think I broke my arm.

238
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,083
It's the... same.

239
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,916
It's happening all over again.

240
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:55,916
The disappointment
I felt. The hopelessness.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,708
And all of it is
because of my weakness.

242
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,875
That's why I studied so hard.

243
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,458
I had to dedicate
myself to becoming strong.

244
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,875
I had endured enough of
the pain life had to offer.

245
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,875
I sacrificed my youth,
my life. I did my best.

246
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,083
Would you hurry up?

247
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,458
The shit makes it all slick.

248
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,875
Here's a couple!

249
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,750
Thanks, bro!

250
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,958
I'm gonna break your neck!

251
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,875
Spin him around! I got him!

252
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,000
You guys are hopeless.

253
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,916
Get outta that
ass curry and help us!

254
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,083
I was gonna...
Tell me what to do.

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,666
Got one!

256
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Don't fire your guns!

257
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,541
The chambers are filled with
methane and they'll explode.

258
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,000
His line is clogged
and he's suffocating!

259
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,750
We all gotta take off our
helmets or we're gonna die!

260
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,750
Well I guess we all
got used to the smell.

261
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,291
I don't notice anything.

262
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,875
Don't know 'bout you,

263
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,875
but I'm of the kick 'em while
they're down school of fighting.

264
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,791
Here have a
mouthful of crapioca!

265
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,083
What a sickeningly
foul disaster.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,208
Who's that?

267
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,000
If I can go back with a woman

268
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,750
from the West Oasis government,
it will prove their crime.

269
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
On your feet, little lady.

270
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,833
You won't win.

271
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,333
We'll see.

272
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,458
Oh, look at that...

273
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,583
I love a woman with balls.

274
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,083
Fuyo!

275
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:21,958
My sister... is not
going anywhere with you.

276
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,291
Egads, look at that!

277
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,166
It's the West Oasis Armada!

278
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,208
It seems I am outnumbered.

279
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,750
Gotta run!

280
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,750
He got away...

281
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,125
Fuyo!

282
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,000
Where'd he get you?
Are you okay?

283
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,916
Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,125
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:04,750
I was just... I was
just completely useless.

286
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
Why was I so determined?

287
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,166
Why did I feel compelled to
be so much more than myself?

288
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,166
I knew that I hated
Kanta when we were young.

289
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,333
He was such a bully.

290
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,083
I thought I was the only one

291
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,750
who'd survive in this world
to be stronger than him.

292
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,458
I didn't want to be
a burden on anyone,

293
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,541
and I didn't want
to be left behind.

294
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,041
I sought to be self sufficient,

295
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
but I was so
indecisive along the way.

296
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,541
I feel like such a fool.

297
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,833
Kanta!

298
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,500
You prick...! You've
been hiding in the shit?

299
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,125
This was all your fault!

300
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,083
Yeah...! Not to mention
you made our sister cry!

301
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,625
Jerk!

302
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,208
How exactly did I do that?

303
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,958
By destroying her rig!

304
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,416
That felt great!

305
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,166
Uh... I thought the two
of them were friends.

306
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,875
Like all the way back
to childhood and stuff.

307
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,291
Not a chance!

308
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,208
When we were kids,
Kanta put us all

309
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,375
through hell with the
crap he'd make us do.

310
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,583
But then one day...

311
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,541
We stole some candy
and Haru got caught.

312
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,583
Stop it.

313
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,958
Stop making my brothers
do bad things with you.

314
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,625
I don't make them do anything.

315
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,916
Those three doofuses want
to hang around with me.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,875
If we get into a little trouble
here and there, who cares?

317
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,125
It's fun and it
kills a lot of time.

318
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,500
What would I do with my time
if I wasn't messing around?

319
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm a kid last time I checked.

320
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,208
What...? He traded
time with you guys

321
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,375
for rubbing all
over Natsuko's boobs?!

322
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,791
And our poor
little sister agreed.

323
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,791
It's not like
she didn't like it.

324
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,666
He took away her innocence.

325
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,208
What did you do?!

326
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,791
Nothing happened.

327
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,875
That's not to say I didn't
give it the old college try.

328
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,041
You disgust me.

329
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
When we found out
what was going on,

330
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,666
we beat Kanta senseless
to make him stop.

331
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,500
To get us back he set
off a homemade bomb

332
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,166
in our outhouse--right when
Natsuko was on the toilet.

333
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,166
She changed after that,

334
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,000
although none of
us could blame her.

335
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,916
Our helpful, sweet
little sister disappeared.

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,458
She was replaced with this girl

337
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,333
who was studying all the time,
always glued to her desk.

338
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,208
Determined to
make herself bigger

339
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,833
and stronger than
she ever was before.

340
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,875
All of this is because I'm a
girl and you see me as weak...!

341
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,625
Well, I'll show you Kanta!
I'll show you what weak is!

342
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,916
That's just awful.

343
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,625
You don't have any proof
that I set that bomb!

344
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,791
You're sneaking away.
That's proof enough for me.

345
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,541
I don't need to listen
to such accusations!

346
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,166
Back then we were
all rotten kids!

347
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,625
Right? High five for old times!

348
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,208
Roger.

349
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,416
Natsuko here.

350
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,125
The mission is
complete, captain.

351
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,416
The chicken is in the hen house.

352
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,916
Affirmative.

353
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,666
We were attacked, but we managed
to fight most of them off.

354
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,208
We lost the rig, though.

355
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,875
No need to worry about that.

356
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,958
What are my next orders, sir?

357
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,250
Return to base. Your work
is done. Excellent job.

358
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,750
Over and out.

359
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,791
You mean this whole operation
was one big red herring?

360
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,416
Just some BS
distraction technique...

361
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
Throw the bad guys
off the real trail?

362
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,875
For real...?!

363
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,333
That's why I ended up
swimming in farmer shit?!

364
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,791
That's right!

365
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,250
Whenever you're around,

366
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,958
I always seem get
covered in shit...

367
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,791
Now its your turn.

368
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,875
I don't know what
it is you learned

369
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,958
when you were busy snooping
around like you always do...

370
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:58,416
But I suggest you
forget about it.

371
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,500
And since you failed in
the mission I hired you for,

372
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm cutting your fee in half.

373
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,208
She really crammed it
in your ass on that one.

374
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,958
And so, the strongest
and most terrible weapon

375
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,958
of mass destruction
ever known to mankind

376
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,458
was quietly put into
development and research

377
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,041
with both the
South and West Oasis.

378
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,541
Of course, that's only if
you believe all of the rumors

379
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,625
you hear out in the
Great Kanto Desert.

380
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,416
And most of them
really are, total crap.

381
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,208
These corrupt governments
haven't heard the last of me.

382
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,416
They think I'm a pawn'

383
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
in their underhanded
chess game, fine.

384
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,000
They'll see the
pawn take their king.

385
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,875
Yo, Desert Punk here!
So about Natsuko--

386
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,125
I can't believe
what you did to her!

387
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,791
I'm sure she laughs
about it now, you know?

388
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,166
She's got a sense of humor.

389
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,583
You set off a bomb in my toilet!

390
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,208
Trust me you needed
the excitement!

391
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,625
She was a really boring kid!

392
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,833
Whatever. Next episode
"Perv in Pursuit." How fitting.
