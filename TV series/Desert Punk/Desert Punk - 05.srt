1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,083
Is that the village?

16
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,125
Yeah. That's our target...

17
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,666
Reclaimed Village Number 21...

18
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,375
Should be a
quick smash and grab.

19
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,583
Won't take long.

20
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,583
I can't imagine
living in this dump.

21
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,041
I can't imagine living in
any of these settlements.

22
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,625
They all look like crap.

23
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,958
But once they hit a water
table things will change.

24
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,458
You know how the saying goes.

25
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,916
"An oasis with
water is paradise."

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,291
If we have just one village
with water in our territory,

27
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,416
we'll be able to
live out the rest

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,750
of our lives in
the lap of luxury.

29
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,833
That's if these
morons strike water.

30
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:25,958
Let's come back...

31
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,958
Is our little weasel
still holding up?

32
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,583
Yeah. And when the day comes,

33
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,875
this crap-hole town turned
goldmine will be ours.

34
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,375
They're coming!

35
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,458
In the Great Kanto Desert,

36
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,333
Settlement 21 is a
well-digging village.

37
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,708
Poverty-stricken,
simple people built

38
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,916
this village in the
hopes of hitting it rich

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,458
by discovering a viable
and sustainable water supply.

40
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,458
In a desert. Good luck.

41
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,958
Geez, that was a long ride.

42
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
Is that me? I smell like cheese.

43
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,041
Okay...

44
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,000
I had heard stories before
I left but these people

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,000
are uglier than a
chorus line of rhino asses.

46
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,375
Anyone know where
I can get a shower?

47
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,333
This is soil from the well.

48
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,166
It feels damp.

49
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,375
Yes. It seems the deeper

50
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,208
we drill the more
saturated the soil gets.

51
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,791
That makes sense.

52
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,208
We also ran some tests

53
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,500
and there were no toxic
chemicals found in the soil.

54
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,375
Congratulations you did it ...

55
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,625
This is a huge
development for you...

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,875
People and money will
come pouring in now...

57
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,416
You can kiss this
skid row goodbye.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,125
You really think so?

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,041
All right I'll take the job...

60
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,583
You can pay me later...

61
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,875
Once you guys hit water
my one time fee will be...

62
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,125
One Million yen.

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,458
Once the water starts
flowing one million

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,500
will seem like
pocket change to you...

65
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,583
Isn't that right?

66
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,958
Well, uh...

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,208
So we agree!

68
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,458
Why don't we discuss the
details over some water?

69
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,416
Let's see, we got
four large men wrapped

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,208
up tight inside of some
towels and carrying long

71
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,416
as well as short
ranged weapons...

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,958
Yeah... looks like we're dealing

73
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,833
with the Edo River Gang.

74
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,291
So just who are they?

75
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,750
You know, your run of
the mill gang of thieves...

76
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,375
In the Kanto area they're
no better than average.

77
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,416
You seem to be very
sure of yourself.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,375
Well I cross-referenced
the information

79
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,000
you gave me with my
bad guy files I keep...

80
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,166
they're the only ones
that match the description.

81
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,958
You keep bad guy files?

82
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,166
I have to be prepared
for just about anything.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,666
Uh...? What do
you mean anything?

84
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,083
Oh man...!

85
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,666
This tastes like
stomach bile, gross.

86
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,583
He just drank a
whole glass of water.

87
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,125
That's as much as
I've had in a whole week.

88
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,250
He said it tastes like bile.

89
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,708
If I drank a glass of water

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,875
that fast I'd throw up.

91
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,250
So what do you think?

92
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,916
Can you, take care
of our problem...?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,375
Do we have a deal here?

94
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,500
A deal?

95
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,166
Of course I can take
care of your problem...

96
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,333
I'm only known in these parts...

97
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,458
as the Desert Demon.

98
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,208
Come on everybody drink up!

99
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,958
It's on the Sheik! His treat!

100
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,791
You guys need
to loosen up a bit!

101
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,208
You can drink all you want.

102
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,958
I'm here to protect the village

103
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,458
and you'll have
so much water soon

104
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,958
you won't know what
to do with it all.

105
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,625
Now let's party!

106
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
The Desert Demon!

107
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,916
We've heard so many
stories about you

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,083
here in this desolate
little village...

109
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,125
Your amazing razor-sharp brain,

110
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,583
and quick decisiveness!

111
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,416
Utilizing your
superior technique

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,166
you solve problems with ease!

113
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,541
You're a super mercenary
Mr. Desert Punk!

114
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,958
The ultimate... I am honored.

115
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,041
You're a funny guy...

116
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,458
What's your name there, pal?

117
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
Wano, I'll do
anything for praise...

118
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,666
Allow me to serve

119
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,875
as your right hand
man while you stay here.

120
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,250
Compared to outdoors
the temperature

121
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,958
in this room feels
like we're in an ice box.

122
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,625
And we have all
the water we want.

123
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,875
Damn right.

124
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,000
Not to mention this is
the sturdiest building

125
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,583
in the whole village.

126
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,625
Look out!

127
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,458
What happened?!

128
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,916
We need some help over here!

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,666
Get it off my leg!

130
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,708
Hey sweet cheeks!

131
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,916
There's a party
in my pants honey!

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,166
Everybody's coming baby!

133
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,583
Uhh! Get a sack!

134
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,541
Yeah, get lost fugly!

135
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,166
Mommy my throat
feels like it's on fire.

136
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,875
I'm so thirsty.

137
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,416
I'm sorry baby...

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,041
But there's nothing
I can do right now...

139
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,833
The man who is here to
save us drank all our rations.

140
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,000
Our food supply! What happened?

141
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,750
Don't you realize how much water

142
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,375
he's drunk today alone...?

143
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,541
An entire day's worth
for the whole village!

144
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,958
I know, I know...

145
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,166
but my hands are tied...

146
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,583
We have to give the
man what he wants.

147
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,791
What happens if he
drains our entire supply

148
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,541
and the well turns up dry?

149
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,666
And what about
that suck ass Wano?

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,333
He seems to have
forgotten that we saved him

151
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,750
from certain death
just cause he's been

152
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,791
brown nosing that Desert Punk!

153
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,791
Are you positive that kid

154
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,625
can protect us from
those thieves, Shiek?

155
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,750
What if he's full of crap?

156
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,583
There's no doubt in my mind...

157
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,000
He came highly recommended

158
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,416
by the Chairman of
the Handyman Guild.

159
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,708
Please be patient
with me on this.

160
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,625
It won't be much longer
before our efforts bear fruit.

161
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,083
You're just going
to have to trust me.

162
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,958
What are you doing with
that map of the village?

163
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,500
There's not much to it.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,916
Wait I know!

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,125
You're planning your strategy

166
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
for when those thieves
arrive, aren't you?

167
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,666
I guess you could say that.

168
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,208
So what are
you planning to do?

169
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,375
Are you going to set up

170
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,500
an elaborate trap
for them to fall into?

171
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,875
The question is what direction

172
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,083
they will be coming from.

173
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,708
I know their
objective is the well.

174
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,291
They don't know
that we know about

175
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,208
their planned attack, or that
I'm here to defend against it.

176
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,291
And that is the best weapon
we can use against them.

177
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,875
Interesting...

178
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,375
When you consider
all of that stuff...

179
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,166
our best option
is to ambush them.

180
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,625
Where?

181
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,083
Here.

182
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,916
Ahh... That's great.

183
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,916
Well, I gotta go to bed...

184
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,833
Check you later.

185
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,125
I hate him.

186
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,208
Good evening, Desert Punk.

187
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,625
Well what do we have here?

188
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,833
They're not as big as Junko's,

189
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,083
but they have a
great shape to them.

190
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,500
Perky and quirky!
They're exquisite!

191
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,625
After all it's the shape,
not the size that counts.

192
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,791
Who am I kidding?

193
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,291
Bigger is always better!

194
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,625
No matter how nice the shape,

195
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,958
small zoombas just won't do!

196
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,916
Wait a minute!

197
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,333
When you think
about it, size is shape!

198
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,291
So that means I don't
have to give up either one!

199
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,875
Brilliant! I freaking
love boobs! Love 'em!

200
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,083
But are boobs everything?

201
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,000
No, the face must be nice too.

202
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,708
No matter how
juicy the rack is,

203
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,291
an ugly face will
just ruin it for sure.

204
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,041
Woah, look how bouncy these are!

205
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,208
Big ole tatas and
a face to look at.

206
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,291
Gotta get me some
of that yum-yum!

207
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,500
Sex!

208
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,250
Where you going...
so late at night?

209
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,250
I can't believe there's such

210
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,125
a smokin' piece in this village!

211
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,250
They should have brought
you to me sooner!

212
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,791
My name is Mariko.

213
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,333
I'm in charge of the
Settlement 21 Youth Corps...

214
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,666
I've been wanting
to have a chat with you.

215
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,375
My father the Shiek
seems to trust you...

216
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,541
but the rest of us here

217
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,041
have some serious
doubts about you.

218
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,291
What sort of doubts?

219
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,916
I think we need
to have a test to see

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,541
if you're really good enough
to protect this village.

221
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,708
Are you satisfied now

222
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,000
or should I beat the
crap out of you too?

223
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,375
You're strong.

224
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:45,958
Why wouldn't I be?

225
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,208
Plus your men
didn't stand a chance

226
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,208
because they
haven't eaten in days.

227
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,125
Let me make this clear...

228
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,125
With my reputation
as the best handyman

229
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,583
in the Desert on the
line I have a standard...

230
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,875
I follow through
on all my jobs...

231
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,375
But when someone does this to
me I tend to lose interest...

232
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,500
so prove to me that
you want me to help you.

233
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,250
Prove to you?

234
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,708
Let me do you!

235
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,375
Uh... All right.

236
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,666
But that offer stands only

237
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,333
if you successfully
protect this village...

238
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,708
And then you can
have your way with me.

239
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,041
And that's the only way.

240
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,666
If it means that we can
live a decent life here,

241
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,791
then Ill make that sacrifice.

242
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,375
That's the reason why

243
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,375
we've worked ourselves
nearly to death,

244
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,166
crawling around in the dirt,
and baking in the desert sun.

245
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,125
Don't worry baby, Ill be gentle.

246
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,208
Nice!

247
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,541
Desert Punk and
Wano took to trying

248
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,416
to have fun wherever
and whenever they could,

249
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,208
playing grab ass
just to pass the time,

250
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,083
but time was running out.

251
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,083
Then one day the
water the villagers

252
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,250
had long awaited came
surging up from the well.

253
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,083
With the water supply they

254
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,916
have dreamed of
gushing from the well

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,375
in extraordinary amounts,
the villagers celebrated

256
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,750
like they never had before.

257
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,291
And then, just as
everyone had figured,

258
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,833
the thieves arrived.

259
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,333
So the village idiots
hired Desert Punk.

260
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,250
This is gonna be a cinch.

261
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,041
Time to collect boys...

262
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,416
Lets cash in on that goldmine

263
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
and steal the rep from
that loser Desert Punk.

264
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
I don't know about you guys

265
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,583
but I'm not so sure
it was a good idea

266
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,958
to place all of us at
the front of the village.

267
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,166
Maybe but the women and children

268
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,708
were sent to
the Rationing Office,

269
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,166
so there's no one else to help.

270
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,791
I've heard the Edo River Gang

271
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,166
approach their victims disguised
as innocent travelers,

272
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,583
then once they're inside all
hell breaks loose.

273
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,416
Desert Punk said they'll come
from the East.

274
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
That's where we're facing, so we
can't miss them.

275
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,083
Where the hell
is that Desert Punk?

276
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,958
I thought he was
supposed to protect us!

277
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,416
He said he was going to do

278
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,916
some reconnaissance and left
with that bootlicker Wano.

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,625
You sure it's a good idea to
leave them alone?

280
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,833
We don't have to
worry about that side.

281
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,083
Why's that?

282
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,125
Because the enemy won't
be coming from the East.

283
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,333
They'll approach from there,
Skeleton City in the South.

284
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,625
You serious?

285
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,375
Of course I'm serious.

286
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,166
I'm the biggest bad ass...

287
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,458
in this entire forsaken
scum hole of a desert.

288
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,166
What are you talking about?

289
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,333
Hey Mariko! Honey!

290
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,041
What's wrong...?

291
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,625
Did you come looking for me
'cause you got lonely?

292
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,791
Or could it be because you can't

293
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,500
wait to get naked
with me, baby...?

294
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,583
My hasty little nympho, you're
so impatient it's adorable...

295
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,666
Oh sure, protecting the village
can come later...

296
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,916
but now I'll bury my face in
your sweet tatas...

297
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,250
I came over here to make
sure you weren't slacking off!

298
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,375
Well, I wasn't.

299
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,583
And what's the use
of putting everyone

300
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,750
on the East
side when they won't

301
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,208
be coming from
that direction?

302
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,791
You've left more than
seventy-five percent

303
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,958
of the city wide open!

304
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,208
Uhh...

305
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,791
you'll know why I
did that when you give me

306
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,291
a chance to explain
myself, Knokerbot.

307
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,500
This guy is a spy
for the Edo River Gang.

308
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,500
Wait no! Not the satchel!

309
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,583
Ah, I hope that hurts!

310
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,958
Anyone with an
ounce of brain matter

311
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,250
could have seen you
for the snitch you are!

312
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,791
I give... Okay... I'm a rat.

313
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,166
I had suspected there
was a leak somewhere in town.

314
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,791
But I never would have thought
it would be you Wano...

315
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,375
And to think we saved your life.

316
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,625
Pull your head out of your ass.

317
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,166
Maybe that's asking too much.

318
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,416
Dammit why didn't you let us

319
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
know sooner that he was a spy?

320
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,750
You amateurs.

321
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,250
If information was being leaked
to the enemy,

322
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,000
I figured I would work
that into our advantage.

323
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,666
What do I have
spell it out for you?

324
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,875
The villagers on the east side
are just a bait n switch.

325
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,125
Those jackasses will attack

326
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,708
from the south side and
victory will be mine.

327
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,916
So... you...

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,958
you were walking
around last night

329
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,500
in order to lay a trap for them?

330
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,041
Precisely.

331
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,458
Wait hold on...

332
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,125
You did all those terrible
things in order

333
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,833
to blind the spy to
your real strategy?

334
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,041
To convince him
of the wrong thing?

335
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,250
Heh?

336
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,041
Oh look at that face!

337
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,416
Those lovely eyes are begging me
to love them.

338
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,125
There's no doubt about it.

339
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,458
But I'm afraid of those eyes.

340
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,000
Hell I'm not ready to
settle down with one girl.

341
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,375
I can't even consider
spending the rest of

342
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,250
my life with just one
set of jugs to play with.

343
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,416
Wait.

344
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,000
I should probably just
do her once and that's it.

345
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,125
No need to lead her on.

346
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,208
And if I like it,
I'll bang her again.

347
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:30,750
So it's true?

348
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,416
I really got it right?

349
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,333
Don't worry, kitty cat.

350
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,208
This battle is already
ninety-nine percent won.

351
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,250
Your village will
be safe and prosper

352
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,125
into the future.
Can you dig me, baby?

353
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:50,916
What the crap?

354
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,666
That's the east side, isn't it?

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,250
Looks like the
attack has started!

356
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,750
Whoops.

357
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,750
Let go you fricking tool!

358
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,041
Wasn't the enemy
supposed to attack

359
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,708
from the South side
and not the East?

360
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,666
Uh, did I say that?

361
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,791
Oh Desert Punk! Please save us!

362
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,166
Where the hell were you...?!

363
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
You dumb bastard!

364
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,333
Yeah what about you?

365
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
Why didn't you
send the signal sooner?

366
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,875
The enemy... They came so fast.

367
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
There was no time to signal you.

368
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,833
You bunch of stupid, ugly,

369
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,125
good for nothing,
redneck, pole smoke--

370
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,750
You said they came on fast?

371
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,750
Damn it!

372
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,791
I guess this means
we're gonna have

373
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,958
ourselves an old
fashioned shootout!

374
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,125
Man this will suck the sweat

375
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,250
from the back of a monkey sack!

376
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,000
Rockets! No wonder
they were so quick!

377
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,291
Crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap!

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,041
Just as we thought!

379
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,875
You really think we
wouldn't see through that?

380
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,916
This ain't our
square dance bitch!

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,625
Here's a little present for ya!

382
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,583
Kiss your balls goodbye!

383
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,500
I... just crapped myself!

384
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,250
Mommy.

385
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,958
Time for your shotgun Kolonic.

386
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,166
He's blinded our
spotter capabilities!

387
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,916
Crap, I can't see a thing!

388
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,375
That hurt.

389
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
Don't let that
scrawny prick get away!

390
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,166
After him!

391
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,583
They never found him.

392
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,166
Desert Punk had
vanished among the flames.

393
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,250
You are no longer the
leader of this village.

394
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,958
If you could just
sign this document.

395
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,041
It places all profits
and full ownership

396
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,333
of the village in our name.

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
This also means
that this one here

398
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,916
will become my pleasure slave.

399
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,500
Help!

400
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,875
The well!

401
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,208
What's the matter with the well?

402
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,833
It's, Desert Punk.
I can't believe it, he--

403
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:49,291
That, can't, be... My well!

404
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,625
What do we got there boss?

405
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,541
He's got it wired
with a crapload of C4.

406
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,125
Damn. We can't touch
it without setting it off!

407
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,166
The Edo River Chumps!

408
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,791
Glad to see you could make it!

409
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:12,833
You're all in for one hell

410
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,166
of an interesting show today!

411
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,958
That bucket contains more than
just a drum of C4.

412
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,208
I've placed a highly potent

413
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,333
and very dangerous poison

414
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,791
in the bottom of that bucket.

415
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,000
What?!

416
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,250
And here in my hand is

417
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,250
the triggering device to
make the damn thing go boom.

418
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,750
If it goes off,
the poison will ruin

419
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,916
the water table and
you can say goodbye

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,958
to your precious well.

421
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,583
You're dead you
giggly ass freak!

422
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,333
The contract I agreed to said

423
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,625
that I would
protect the village,

424
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,166
but it never mentioned anything

425
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,958
about protecting that
well, did it Sheik...?

426
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,291
And I'm pretty sure
that with the well gone,

427
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,291
this quaint little
village will have absolutely

428
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,833
no value to the Edo River Gang.

429
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,500
It's a foolproof plan!

430
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,916
You're insane.

431
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,416
I'll do whatever
it takes to stop you

432
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,416
from getting
your way. Dumbasses.

433
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,458
Please... You gotta help us!

434
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,625
Save the well...

435
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,041
We'll listen to
anything you have to say!

436
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,791
It's all we have!

437
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,583
Stop that stupid idiot

438
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,333
from destroying the
well and our village!

439
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:30,208
Spread his carcass
across the desert!

440
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:04,916
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

441
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

442
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,875
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

443
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,125
It's actually a cape.

444
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:18,833
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

445
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,250
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

446
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,333
His heart is black.

447
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

448
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:33,083
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

449
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,625
<i>He's on the run again</i>

450
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,625
On the run again.

451
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

452
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
He's got a job.

453
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

454
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,750
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

455
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,625
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

456
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,625
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

457
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,208
<i>It's what you do</i>

458
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,333
Yo! I'm Desert Punk
and I just pissed off

459
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,666
this whole village!

460
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,125
Speaking of, wasn't Mariko
stacked like pancakes?

461
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,541
Yeah, I'd like to
dowse 'em with maple syrup

462
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,583
and get my face stuck to 'em.

463
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,791
Hey, that's my daughter ya know.

464
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,250
She knows who her daddy is!

465
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,541
Next on Desert Punk,
"Wandering Lust!" Uhh!

466
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,250
Don't miss it!
