1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,708
The Great Kanto Desert.

16
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,666
A barren, hellish wasteland
where endless winds

17
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,458
pitch a splintery
sand into the air.

18
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,750
It's an arid stretch that can
kill in a moments notice.

19
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,041
Any human without
the proper equipment

20
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,208
and supplies that
is unfortunate enough

21
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,583
to be stuck out here will
be dead in a matter of days.

22
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,416
The relentless powers of
the soaring desert heat

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,458
wear out your strength,
and every drop of moisture

24
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,541
in your body depletes
with each breath.

25
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,125
Before you know it,
you have no perspiration

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,083
to keep you cool, not
like it would make much

27
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,041
of a difference out here.

28
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,916
Eventually you find
yourself hallucinating

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,333
then losing consciousness just

30
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,500
before your life is
engulfed by the sands.

31
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,750
The only thing that can
save your is desert gear.

32
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,625
But Desert Punk
and the sellout Wano

33
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,500
had only the bare essentials.

34
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,375
With the odds
stacked against them,

35
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,791
their struggle to survive
hell on earth had begun.

36
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,708
What...?

37
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,791
You're planning on
destroying the well

38
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,000
and releasing poison
into the water?!

39
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,208
Yes.

40
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,875
If I do that the Edo
River Gang will probably

41
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,500
leave your village alone,
just like you asked.

42
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,333
What do you think that's funny?

43
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,166
Have you lost your mind?!
If you do this...

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,958
You can forget our
little deal we had!

45
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,583
You mean we're not gonna do it?

46
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,041
I wouldn't even vomit on you,

47
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,000
even though your
probably in to that!

48
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,541
You may get rid of the thieves

49
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,041
but what good will it do if
the well is destroyed too...?

50
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,250
I swear Desert Punk if you push

51
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,750
that button I will
not give it up to you.

52
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,916
That's not fair!

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,041
You'd be breaking our agreement!

54
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,750
I never signed a piece of paper

55
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
so I don't mind breaking it!

56
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,750
You bitch.

57
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,000
What did he mean "do it"?

58
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,541
What could she give up?

59
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,541
Mariko what on earth
are you talking about?

60
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,083
What exactly were you
going to give up to him?

61
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,833
Uh, sir, I think she was
going to give him the sex.

62
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,375
Over my dead body!

63
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,208
I won't let that
scumbag touch her!

64
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,916
Father!

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh no! The Shiek has collapsed!

66
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,583
What are you going to
do now, Desert Punk?

67
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,291
If you blow the well
you don't get laid.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,750
Mariko's a beautiful piece...

69
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,833
Can you really pass that up?

70
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,583
All right. I'll give
you my conditions.

71
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,750
Conditions?

72
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,333
If I demanded
you leave this town

73
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,083
or I'll blow up the well,
you wouldn't leave would you?

74
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,416
Of course not!

75
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,166
Stubborn pricks.

76
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,666
Then I propose a
challenge against

77
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,041
all four of you
for this village.

78
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,416
We can take him.

79
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,458
I should warn you
that the explosives

80
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,000
I used are made from
unstable Nitroglycerin,

81
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,500
so even if I win they're
going to be a pain to remove.

82
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,000
Shut your yam
cannon you desert dookie.

83
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,333
I don't think you can handle it.

84
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,875
Last time you ran home to Momma

85
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,916
with your pants full of shit!

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,583
Bastard. Okay, let's do this!

87
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,208
Bring it on suckers!

88
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,625
Is that bomb real, maybe
he's yanking our chains?

89
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,500
Knowing that guy
I wouldn't put it past him.

90
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,208
Here we go!

91
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,125
Release hook lock!
Reel in. And fire!

92
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,708
Damn!

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,041
You son of a bitch!

94
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,125
Let's hope they get rid
of that guy once and for all.

95
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,541
But if they kill Desert
Punk this whole village

96
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,916
will be run by the thieves.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,125
Man, that really sucks.

98
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
In a perfect world
all five of them

99
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,375
will take each other
out at the same time.

100
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,750
A perfect world?

101
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,750
Hopefully when this is over

102
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,541
things will go back to normal.

103
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,583
Knowing our luck
another band of thieves

104
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,208
will come along in
ten minutes or so.

105
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,708
I have to give him credit.

106
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,666
Even though he's
clinically insane,

107
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,125
he is luring them into an
advantageous position,

108
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,708
just like he had planned.

109
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,500
Help me.

110
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,416
What do you think?

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,958
It's no good.

112
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey! That jerk off is trying
to draw us into Skeleton City.

113
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,333
What do we do?

114
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,833
Knowing him he's probably
luring us into a trap.

115
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not too worried.

116
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,166
As long as we keep him close

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,833
he won't be able to do anything.

118
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,291
He'd be caught
in his own attack.

119
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,833
Plus I plan on smoking his ass

120
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,625
before he gets the chance!

121
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,708
We lost him!

122
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,833
Let's keep moving.

123
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,916
He couldn't have gone far.

124
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,791
Like fish in a barrell

125
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,583
My thrusters stopped!

126
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,625
Damn!

127
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,083
Looks like we got him.

128
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,791
Let's finish this quick.

129
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,291
Oh, so You can't defeat us

130
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,416
so you're going to
destroy the well anyways?

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,625
You don't know when
to give up do you?

132
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,375
If you give us the
triggering device,

133
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,791
we'll let you walk.
What do you say?

134
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,333
I say no one's
walking outta here.

135
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,666
You stubborn fool!

136
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,041
The trigger wasn't
even connected

137
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,708
to the explosives at the well.

138
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,333
It was linked to a trap
here in Skeleton City.

139
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,750
Didn't see that coming, did you?

140
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,375
Oh, and heads up!

141
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,041
You almost
got yourself killed...

142
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,875
to draw us into
your little trap!

143
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,916
You're suicidal!

144
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,625
Cram it!

145
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,583
I couldn't shake you off my tail

146
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,958
so I was forced to do this!

147
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,791
You think I want
to die with you?!

148
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,500
Why don't you come down here

149
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,291
and fight me like a man!

150
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,250
Go to hell and enjoy your trip!

151
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,375
You're the one
who's going to die!

152
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,458
My brand new face plate!

153
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,916
Ahh! He broke mine too!

154
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,250
And I'm about to
break yours next!

155
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,500
Coming in Superfly style.

156
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,541
Hope you like the taste of feet!

157
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,083
I don't believe it!
Desert Punk won!

158
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,500
Our village is saved!

159
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,625
Someone patch
these four goons up.

160
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
If I hand them over
to the authorities alive

161
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,291
they'll be worth a pretty penny.

162
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,541
The explosives.

163
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,916
The dynamite at the well...

164
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,708
If I remember
your exact wording...

165
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,458
I believe you said
'Stop that stupid idiot

166
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,166
from destroying the
well and our lives.'

167
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,583
The explosives are C4 covers
wrapped around bricks.

168
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,083
And the poison is
only sand colored with ink.

169
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,833
That is a relief.

170
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,041
What did he just say?

171
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,750
It's not a bomb, it's just sand.

172
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,916
I can't believe it!

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,375
We'll have all the
water we'll ever need!

174
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
You're all despicable.

175
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,625
Just dirty, cowardly weaklings.

176
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,333
Pathetic followers.

177
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,416
You all make me sick!

178
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,458
Mariko...

179
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,541
How are you feeling... big boy?

180
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,791
Oh Mariko!

181
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,166
Oh Mariko thank you.

182
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,291
You nursed me back to health,

183
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,416
all by yourself, didn't you...?

184
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,083
And may I say that you look...

185
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,500
just absolutely delicious.

186
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,458
You sure you're not an angel?

187
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,250
I haven't forgotten
about my promise.

188
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,666
Neither have I!

189
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,083
I've been waiting a
long time for this!

190
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:07,625
Damn, baby...
You lookin' good.

191
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,250
Please take me.

192
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,875
Gross, would you get
your hands off me?

193
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,291
Whoa dude, you're a lot
uglier than I remember!

194
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,500
Come on stop playing around.

195
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,250
What the crap Wano!

196
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,125
At least you still know my name.

197
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,000
Where the hell are we?

198
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,208
What am I doing out here?

199
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,541
Well you did such a good job

200
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,916
taking out the Edo River
Gang that there was no use

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,750
for us anymore,
so they threw us out.

202
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,291
What? What is that
suppose to mean?!

203
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,000
You know they really hated you.

204
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
I saved their freakin village.

205
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,166
If things had gone differently,

206
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,500
I could have had a chance to run

207
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,791
that whole village
in another year.

208
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,416
Explain to me.
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,208
I couldn't stay in the
village either thanks

210
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,208
to your big mouth
calling me out as a spy.

211
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,791
I figured you owed
me some payback

212
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,541
for that so I decided
to follow you out of town.

213
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,791
Come on, you think I'd believe

214
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,041
anything a runt like you says?

215
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,125
It's the truth.

216
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm in no position
to lie to you.

217
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,708
Wait a minute.

218
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,750
Is this all the food
and water we have?

219
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:13,666
Please tell me you brought

220
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,416
at least one thing useful to us.

221
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,416
Like what exactly?

222
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,458
Dumb ass!

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,250
Hot!

224
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,416
What's this?

225
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,833
Dear Desert Punk, I'm very sorry

226
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,125
about what happened.

227
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,375
To be honest, the
villagers and I were worried

228
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,291
that you would resort
to your selfish habits

229
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,000
and bring morale
down once you came to.

230
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,791
The thought of
that frightened me.

231
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,083
I also worry about
my daughter, Mariko,

232
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
and your intentions towards her.

233
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,625
I put a lot of thought into this

234
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,708
and I feel I made
the right decision.

235
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,458
Godspeed on your journey.

236
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,916
Best Regards, Sheik Marimo.

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,458
P.S. Thanks for
saving the village.

238
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,791
The nerve of that old man.

239
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,916
I'm heading back to the village.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,041
Make yourself useful
and lead the way.

241
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,083
Huh?

242
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,458
You can't be serious!

243
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,750
It was a half-day by
truck to this point.

244
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,541
It would take us a week on foot!

245
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
Besides, who knows
what they will do to me

246
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,041
if I go back up there!

247
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,000
Fine by me.

248
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,333
You can die out here.

249
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,541
What?

250
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,708
If you don't want to go back

251
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,000
then I'm going by myself,

252
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,250
and you can die
like the dog you are.

253
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,333
Exuse me.

254
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,416
You think I could
have a taste of that?

255
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,958
Normally I wouldn't
give a goon like this

256
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,791
my piss to drink.

257
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,458
Oh thank you so much.

258
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,208
That was delicious.

259
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,000
That's all you're getting

260
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,750
for awhile, so savor it.

261
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,625
But, but I need more...

262
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,083
You're right.
We should conserve.

263
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,500
So you're absolutely positive

264
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,541
the settlement is
in this direction?

265
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,166
Yeah. I'm sure.

266
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,125
I can't wait to get
revenge on those simpltons

267
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,583
for the way they
treated me... And Mariko!

268
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,708
Don't forget your promise

269
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,458
you gorgeous piece of ass you.

270
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,041
Okay quit your jabbering
and let's head out.

271
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,083
Come on.

272
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,541
Let me rest for
another hour or so.

273
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,375
I told you we don't
have a second to waste!

274
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,916
But if I go back to that
village they'll string me up...

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,250
Just thinking about
that makes me drag my feet.

276
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,375
Fine. I'll talk to them for you.

277
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,750
Really? Then do me a favor.

278
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,875
Let's put it in writing

279
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,500
so you can't back
out of it later!

280
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,125
'Kay?

281
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,541
Just stop.

282
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,125
This guys so easy.

283
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,583
He thinks he's a badass fighter

284
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,458
but he doesn't come to me
when it comes to mind games.

285
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,916
He'll be sorry
for helping me out.

286
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,666
If I knew where
I was going this fool

287
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,000
would be dead already.

288
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,375
I'll keep making little promises

289
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,833
to keep his spirits up until
we reach the settlement.

290
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,291
Then he's on his own.

291
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,083
At night temperatures
in the desert

292
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,041
plunge below freezing.

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,375
The cold pierces
deep into the body,

294
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,875
stabbing the bones, and
the constant shivering

295
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,750
and shaking just makes
it harder to go on living.

296
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,250
I'm so tired.

297
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,083
All I wanna do is go to sleep.

298
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,083
If you fall asleep you'll die.

299
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,083
I don't care if I die.
Just let me sleep.

300
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,125
Go ahead!
Die then, see if I care!

301
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,500
This sucks beyond belief.

302
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,416
Me having to spoon with
this guy to stay warm.

303
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh man he smells
like fish and onions!

304
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,791
Oh Mariko...

305
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,041
Ah what the hell is this?

306
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,708
You've gone rock
hard down there!

307
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,750
Not again.

308
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,750
Sorry but I
don't swing that way.

309
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,583
Huh?

310
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,458
What's your problem?

311
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,583
Stay out of my fantasy!

312
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,458
On your feet loser.

313
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,916
Ah, Mariko?!

314
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,041
Ohh, freaky
skinny dipping, yeah!

315
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,583
I can get into that.

316
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,833
Come here my love.

317
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,291
What is this?

318
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,125
The vein of water
we hit was richer

319
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,500
than we ever imagined, and now

320
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,625
we have more than we can use.

321
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,458
But Kanta, I'd like
to fulfill the promise

322
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,833
I made to you that day,
if you'll have me.

323
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,291
It's not a dream
this time, is it, baby?

324
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,833
Put some sugar on me.

325
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,541
Damn dreams keep
jacking with me.

326
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,458
Don't hurt me.

327
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,500
Beyotch!

328
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,166
No!

329
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,416
We're gonna die for
sure now! I know it!

330
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,583
Crap!

331
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,500
All we have left is about
a third of that canteen.

342
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,166
I can't stand it any more!

343
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,333
I'm gonna kill you!

344
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,041
Shut up!

345
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,166
Only halfway
through the journey,

346
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,291
they've lost everything
their lives depend on.

347
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,500
Between them,
now they only have hope.

348
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,541
Two things are pushing
Desert Punk this far.

349
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,750
His deep-seated greed
and a hunger for revenge.

350
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,291
Will it be enough to save him?

351
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,250
Obviously not.

352
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,500
He collapsed in the end.

353
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:18,958
The Great Kanto Desert
is just a bitch, isn't it?

354
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,583
There he is.

355
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,916
What a pile.

356
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,541
He looks like death
eatin' a cracker.

357
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,000
Is he alive?

358
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,083
He collapsed!
Desert Punk collapsed!

359
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,208
I never thought I'd see the day!

360
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,166
Burn baby! In your face!

361
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,666
Look at this numb nuts.

362
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,666
Let's put him out of his misery.

363
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,125
You're lucky a man Kanta.

364
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,458
Had we not taken a job
escorting some officials

365
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,583
to West Oasis a
couple of days ago,

366
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,166
you probably would
have died out here.

367
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,291
You should be
grateful to Mariko.

368
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,083
She's the one that
asked us to save you.

369
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,791
Nobody else gave a crap.

370
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,791
Two days ago in
Reclaimed Village Number 21,

371
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
after overcoming
innumerable difficulties,

372
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,000
the villagers finally hit
the water table beneath them.

373
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,791
And the reward they so
desperately needed had arrived.

374
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,583
Excuse me.

375
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,583
Sorry to bother you but
are you the mercenaries

376
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,416
that I've heard grew up in
the same town as Desert Punk?

377
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
Well, the truth is...

378
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,416
So the driver
abandoned Desert Punk

379
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,541
while he was asleep in the back?

380
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,458
My father, the Sheik,
had him removed

381
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,166
from the infirmary
without my knowledge

382
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,458
and now he's lost in the desert.

383
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,750
Hold on,
I'm about to wet myself.

384
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,500
He must be miserable
out there by himself!

385
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,416
Desert Punk getting
lost in his own desert!

386
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,083
I was hoping you could
find out if he got home safely.

387
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,958
Whoa, wait a second.
You and him?

388
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,375
What an unprofessional
thing to ask for.

389
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,375
I hate that guy even more now.

390
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,583
Yeah but...

391
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,208
Desert Punk did keep
his end of the bargain

392
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,750
in saving our village...

393
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,375
Yet we treated, him like
he was yesterdays garbage.

394
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,958
Knowing that jerk he's probably

395
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,291
walking all the way back
here to the settlement

396
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,583
just to get a little revenge.

397
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,875
The guy lives off that.
He's a bad apple.

398
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,625
You should stay as
far away from him as you can.

399
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,125
It's been three days and
he still hasn't reached here.

400
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,791
Which means the
sucker's already dead.

401
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,708
I'd hate to be the
buzzard that gets

402
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,291
the first bite
off his hairy ass.

403
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,708
What a stupid idiot.

404
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,708
Guys!

405
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,875
Calm down...

406
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,916
Would you please
just go find him?!

407
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,083
So we agreed that
if we found you

408
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,583
on our way home
that we would save

409
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,291
your miserable ass.

410
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,583
It's a shame Kanta.

411
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,333
Now Mariko doesn't owe you squat

412
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:55,500
and your never-ending quest
of getting laid sadly continues.

413
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,416
Still...

414
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,375
It's hard enough
traveling alone,

415
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,666
yet he somehow hung
on for five days

416
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,958
with this worthless stinkfist...

417
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,041
That's determination for you.

418
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,708
Its too bad he's only
fueled by tits and revenge.

419
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,666
And so this job came to an
abrupt end.

420
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,208
No payback. No Mariko.

421
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,541
Only the
ultimate humiliation

422
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,041
of the Machinegun Brothers
saving his charred hide.

423
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,833
I burned white hot.

424
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,125
That desert can't kill me.

425
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,375
Go ahead big guy.
Have a good cry.

426
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:04,916
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

427
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

428
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,875
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

429
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,125
It's actually a cape.

430
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:18,833
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

431
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,250
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

432
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,333
His heart is black.

433
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

434
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:33,083
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

435
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,625
<i>He's on the run again</i>

436
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,625
On the run again.

437
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

438
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
He's got a job.

439
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

440
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,750
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

441
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,625
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

442
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,625
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

443
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,208
<i>It's what you do</i>

444
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,500
Hey kids! I'm Desert Punk,
Demon of the Desert.

445
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,041
On the next episode...

446
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,791
You better not get a
stiffy with that minor,

447
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,416
she might not be
into that sort of thing.

448
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,583
He can get it up?

449
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,250
Next on Desert Punk,
"Age Before Beauty!"

450
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,250
If you miss it you'll be sorry!
