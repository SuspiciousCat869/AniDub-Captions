1
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:45,083
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:49,000
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:53,083
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:57,250
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
01:00:57,333 --> 01:01:01,000
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:06,666
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,375
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:15,708
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:20,041
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,791
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:26,708
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:30,666
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:36,250
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:40,083
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:14,375
I'll pull the cart when
we get to the next village.

16
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:18,708
Dad... I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

17
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:22,916
I'm sorry I'm not stronger.

18
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,750
Dad!

19
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,833
Are you okay? What happened?

20
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,875
I'm... I'm sorry Noriko...

21
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,458
You go on... without me.

22
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,500
Dad... You'll be fine.

23
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,375
You're acting ridiculous.

24
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,333
My daughter...

25
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,291
I'm here, dad.

26
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,208
Noriko...

27
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:57,500
Yes...? What do you need?

28
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,583
I love you--

29
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,416
No... No dad!

30
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,875
Dad!

31
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,500
Several centuries
after the collapse

32
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,333
of modern civilization...

33
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,125
This is the Great Kanto Desert.

34
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,000
This is a world of survival.

35
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:23,791
Here, justice is on the side
of whoever is left standing.

36
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,500
Some say the victor
in this wasteland

37
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,666
is a demon from the sand.

38
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,583
A phantom mercenary.

39
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:34,708
He is also known by
the name Desert Punk.

40
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,625
And one last move
for good measure!

41
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:44,958
Hold on pal!

42
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:57,541
His grandkids are gonna
feel that crack to the nuts...

43
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,166
Hell, I felt it.

44
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,541
You... You son of a bitch...

45
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,083
You're cold!

46
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,583
Cold I maybe, but I'm thorough.

47
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,958
This'd all be a lot
easier if that Junko chick

48
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,333
hadn't ganked me out of my cash.

49
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,541
But I gotta say,

50
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:22,041
that girl did have one
grade-A rack on her.

51
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,583
Whoa, whoa, enough, enough.

52
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:26,583
Geez If get tits on the brain

53
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,541
I can kiss that score
goodbye for good.

54
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,750
I tell you what though,
without women,

55
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,291
I'd have a much better
focus in my life.

56
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:34,833
From now on, I have
to be clear-headed.

57
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,833
Okay put your hands
up in the air now!

58
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,333
That's right! But do it slowly!

59
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,833
I said, hands up!

60
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,625
Don't make him
tell you again! Do it!

61
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,916
He's so scared
he can't even move!

62
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,416
Look, he's frozen in the sand!

63
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,291
He's just screwing around!

64
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:55,625
If that's who I think it is,

65
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:58,125
he's pretty damn ruthless,
even for a collector.

66
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,583
I've heard old
men in the villages

67
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,708
tell stories about his methods.

68
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:04,041
The way they tell it,
when he collects your money,

69
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,166
he collects your very soul.

70
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,875
Hey, why are you
just standing there?!

71
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,041
The way I understand it,

72
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:12,666
you want me to
show you my hands.

73
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah... That's right.

74
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,250
Hands in the air,

75
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,583
and we might just
let you walk out of here.

76
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,041
What the hell is this stuff?!

77
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,208
It hurts!

78
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,541
Thread...? You serious?

79
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:41,375
I've shown you my
hands like you asked.

80
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,083
What's next?

81
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,625
Hot! Hot! Ouch! Ouch!

82
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,291
Kill us!

83
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,541
You can't make us return
to the village like this!

84
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,250
We'll never live this down!

85
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,000
Please kill us!
Don't make us go back!

86
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,375
My brothers will tear me apart!

87
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:06,833
It'll be worse than death!

88
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:08,833
Is that so?

89
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,541
Forget it! We'll just
steal some pants!

90
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,791
Jackasses.

91
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:17,666
I sure didn't have to see
those things dangling like that.

92
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,541
When those old guys
said you took souls,

93
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,125
they must've meant "pride".

94
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,666
Some things get twisted as
they get passed on, I guess.

95
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,625
That was just for
wasting my time.

96
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,916
I knew someone was watching me.

97
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,750
I didn't realize it was the
famous Desert Punk, though.

98
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,458
Gotta hand it to you,
Rain Spider.

99
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,041
You got some good instincts.

100
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,750
I don't think we've
ever met formally.

101
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:40,916
No, but you have quite
the reputation in Kanto.

102
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,083
I feel like I already know you.

103
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,291
Aw, shucks.
Cut it out, big guy.

104
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,708
I've watched you work, now.

105
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,208
The skills of the
number one collector

106
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,625
in these parts are
no longer a secret.

107
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,958
Too bad I haven't
seen you in action.

108
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:56,083
I'd love to see how you prey on
the weak and the helpless.

109
01:06:56,166 --> 01:07:00,916
Uh, well, if the opportunity
arises, bring it on.

110
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:06,708
Wait--

111
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:08,250
Some other time, maybe.

112
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,416
I have urgent
business elsewhere.

113
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,833
Oh, that's too bad.
Check you later.

114
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,333
Today I've come
across every loser

115
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,916
and blow-hard this
desert has to offer.

116
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,958
It's getting old.

117
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,583
You're earlier
than expected, kid.

118
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:31,708
Not by choice.
What job is up next?

119
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:34,833
Eh, Hold on a second.
I'll check the board.

120
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,916
Mommy, I'm still
really hungry...

121
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,791
Here it is... Atoll 22.

122
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,791
There's a man called Koike
living at 29-3, Bakshi Street.

123
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:53,000
The money he owes is past due
and collection is in order.

124
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:56,291
This request comes
from Akashio Financial.

125
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:01,791
All right... 29-3... Uh...

126
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,333
29-3 is... here?

127
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,125
Man, it's a freakin'
dump! What a crapshack!

128
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,416
Knock, knock!

129
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,583
I'm, uh, looking for
some old dude named Koike.

130
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:14,958
Anyone here?

131
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,500
Hi...

132
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,958
I had no idea you
knew old Koike here.

133
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:29,125
None of my friends are
that ugly or that damn poor.

134
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,500
But if I'm here to see this guy

135
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:36,041
and Rain Spider is here
to see this guy then--

136
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,208
I'm here to collect of course.

137
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:40,416
Koike took a loan out
from Oshio Financial

138
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,875
in the South Oasis and
today is the repayment date.

139
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:46,791
Unfortunately,
as is usually the case,

140
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,833
Koike doesn't seem to
have the money on him.

141
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,625
Go figure.

142
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,291
What a bunch of crap.

143
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,291
My luck sucks this week.

144
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,375
I have one guess as
to what kind of business

145
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:59,125
you have with
our elderly friend.

146
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,583
You broke old bastard!
You took money out

147
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,958
from two loan companies
at the same time?!

148
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,250
I want all of the money you owe

149
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,291
Akashio Financial right now!

150
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,291
Wait, hold on!

151
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,583
The Akashio loan
is way past due!

152
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,500
You owe money in
the south and the west!

153
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,958
That's pretty damn ballsy.

154
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,166
Now reach inside your pockets

155
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,916
and find it
somewhere inside of you

156
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,125
to give back what
you were given!

157
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:21,875
Give it back!

158
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,250
Hey! I was here first!

159
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,583
I have dibs on this guy!

160
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:25,791
Dibs?

161
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:26,416
You're talking like
there're rules to this!

162
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,291
I need that cash!

163
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,375
Oh no, you don't!

164
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,875
You're tough
for a little squirt!

165
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,791
You're not getting
anything today!

166
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,125
You wanna bet?!

167
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,333
I'll turn this house
over until I find the cash.

168
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, shut up!

169
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:47,625
He's right.

170
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,500
There's not a damn thing here.

171
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:52,500
And this place stinks.
It stinks bad.

172
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,250
I'm sorry, but with
my failing health,

173
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,791
I can't work...

174
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,583
No one will
hire me for anything.

175
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:04,333
Let me ask you something, Koike.

176
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:07,041
In this lawless hellhole
of an existence,

177
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:10,416
do you know why the
loan sharks thrive as they do?

178
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,666
N-No...

179
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,041
Because of people
like us. Collectors.

180
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,333
No matter what injuries
we may sustain,

181
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,708
no matter what kind
of resistance we face,

182
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:23,500
we will always,
and I mean always,

183
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,833
find the debtor
and capture him alive.

184
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:28,666
That is the way
of a professional.

185
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,041
Then we use whatever
means necessary

186
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,708
to get the debt paid.

187
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,833
I have a reputation
for finishing jobs!

188
01:10:35,916 --> 01:10:37,583
You can be as old or
as sick as you want,

189
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,083
my job stays the same!

190
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,666
I just want the damn money!

191
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,791
Dad?

192
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:46,750
What a sweet-looking chick!

193
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,583
I'd like to split
her like lumber.

194
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:49,708
What's going on...?

195
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,708
What are you doing to my father?

196
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,958
So you're the only one working

197
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,583
and bringing in the money.

198
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:00,250
Must be hard
supporting a sick man.

199
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,416
Forgive me... It's my fault.

200
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,708
I knew the payment was due.

201
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,125
I don't see how someone like you

202
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:10,000
could earn the kind of
money needed to pay this debt.

203
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,000
You're right.

204
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:13,458
But I am trying
as hard as I can.

205
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:20,833
I worked hard and found a
job at a printing company.

206
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:24,083
But when the owner was
killed by a gang of thugs...

207
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:27,333
and the deadline for
the payment was looming,

208
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,791
I had to take any job.

209
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,000
But lugging around loads

210
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:32,166
was too much for
a woman like me.

211
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,166
The men were much more able.

212
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,166
So I looked into something
I could do on my own.

213
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:43,500
But I failed at
that, too. I failed.

214
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:49,333
I've just... never
been good at anything!

215
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,541
I'm sorry Noriko...

216
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:57,250
But I am more proud of
you than I have ever been.

217
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,750
Dad, you're going
to be all right...!

218
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:02,000
You've got to stop all this!

219
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,250
It's not your
fault you got sick!

220
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,083
It's all my fault dear.

221
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,458
Even the loss of your mother...

222
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,625
Dad, enough of this, okay...

223
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:14,000
You promised we'd
never speak of that.

224
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,333
My, Noriko...

225
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,541
You know I love you Dad...

226
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:22,750
We're both doing our best.

227
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,000
Not now... We have guests.

228
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:29,083
You can't just bawl up a storm
in front of strangers.

229
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,333
Oh, all right.

230
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:32,833
You know, Akashio Financial

231
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:35,291
might swing another
ten days or so...

232
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:40,125
They... they might
be okay with that.

233
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,166
Are you sure?

234
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,166
Um... yeah. I mean sure.

235
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,041
What's your deal?!

236
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,875
Oh, nothing.

237
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,958
Liar!

238
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:54,791
You were thinking
what a wussy I am

239
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:55,958
for letting that chick

240
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,083
and her dad's weepiness
get under my skin.

241
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,166
Well...

242
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,791
You got another bright idea?

243
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,750
Cause there's nothing
in this house of any value!

244
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:04,333
We checked, remember?

245
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,291
I'm not so sure about that.

246
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,916
What about her?

247
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,791
Noriko...! No! Let her go!

248
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,208
What are you doing to her,
you freakin' jerk?!

249
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,458
Crap! Are you
all right old man?!

250
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:21,041
This young lady might be poor

251
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,083
and covered in dust,
but her beauty

252
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,750
and her kind-heartedness
are unmistakable.

253
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:29,250
Selling her could bring
in quite a load of cash.

254
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:32,541
You're right. I hadn't
even considered that.

255
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,041
No absolutely not!

256
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,625
Do you have ice water
in your veins?!

257
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:39,166
Probably.

258
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,000
Let me ask you a question.

259
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,041
How do you plan to
reclaim the debt?

260
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,416
The house is empty, as
you've shrewdly observed.

261
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Only the girl has any value,
black market or otherwise.

262
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,208
How you are going to collect

263
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:55,833
without selling the girl is
a better question, I think.

264
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:59,500
You said yourself that
you always finish your jobs.

265
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,583
I still think it's wrong.

266
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,375
But go ahead and sell her...

267
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,166
On one condition...

268
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,625
I'm the buyer.
You sell her to me.

269
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,708
But I can't pay much.

270
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,041
You'll have to find
a way to take the rest

271
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,208
out of her father if you
want to pay back Oshio.

272
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,708
This is my final offer!

273
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,125
That's moronic.

274
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,875
It seems that our
time spent here talking...

275
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,375
is over!

276
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,166
Winner takes the girl.

277
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,625
Loser figures out a
different way to get the dough.

278
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,958
That's it. Sound like
a fair deal to you?

279
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,958
No objections here.

280
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,375
Don't think
I'll let this girl go

281
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:44,625
into the hands of some crazy,
fetish-prone mercenary

282
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:45,958
like you without a fight.

283
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,791
If you're done talking
we can get this started.

284
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,208
What's that all about?

285
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,000
Uh, looks like a fight.

286
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:54,333
It's like one of those
old fashioned duels.

287
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:57,291
And it's between Rain
Spider and Desert Punk!

288
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:01,291
No way. They'll destroy
everything around them!

289
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,958
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a fight

290
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,666
to decide who gets
Koike's daughter.

291
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,833
What?

292
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:08,333
Desert Punk and Rain Spider.

293
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:09,708
But elder...

294
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:11,333
Why are you here?

295
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,583
We cannot let these two fight...

296
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:15,375
If they do, our
entire village could be

297
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,750
leveled by their
fury and turmoil.

Yeah... Pretty bad actually.

01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,666
I know this guy has the
skills to really go at it.

322
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,375
But he basically uses
the same techniques as me.

323
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:07,291
Which means, my little tricks
probably won't work on him.

324
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,083
I'll have to find
a different angle.

325
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,333
He might be squatty,

326
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:12,458
but he didn't get his
reputation for nothing.

327
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:13,791
He's seen me in action, too,

328
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,833
which puts me behind
the eight ball a bit.

329
01:17:15,916 --> 01:17:18,583
I'll have to try
something different.

330
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:21,375
This is going to be
one hell of a battle.

331
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:36,916
All right!

332
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,041
This is it!

333
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,041
Take that!

334
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,125
This blows.

335
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:12,916
You missed!

336
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,666
Yeah... it really does.

337
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:17,666
I've seen this kinda thing
a hundred times before.

338
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,625
And done better.

339
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,875
You've got a point.

340
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,250
I was so concerned with
watching for his tricks,

341
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:25,500
that I never expected to
find myself in a gun battle.

342
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:26,708
This is a waste of ammo!

343
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,750
I might as well be
shooting into the air!

344
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,625
Grandpa, you shouldn't
be out here walking around.

345
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,166
What would Grandma say?

346
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,083
Yoko, is lunch ready yet?

347
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:40,166
I'm hungry. I missed breakfast.

348
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,666
Of course,
I'll make you whatever.

349
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,666
We just have to
get you off your feet.

350
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,375
Where did you find a
rifle like that out here?

351
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:49,333
I brought it with me!

352
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:51,291
Just like you did with yours!

353
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,666
Eat this!

354
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,625
Shit!

355
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:57,291
Here's one for you!

356
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,291
Ah, no!

357
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,708
Suck my lead!

358
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,500
What happens when
we run out of ammo?

359
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,958
Will we fight
with swords then?

360
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:07,791
En garde!

361
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,583
The girl is mine!

362
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:14,916
No, she ain't!

363
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,166
All I hear from you
is bitch-bitch-bitch.

364
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,000
You're fighting with nothing!

365
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:19,875
Enough of this!

366
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,791
Your voice is making me crazy!

367
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,791
Now you loose, you tiny vermin!

368
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,791
You haven't laid
me out yet, jerk!

369
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,833
You'd better be ready
for that right now!

370
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,333
This is stupid. I'm going
to the bar for a drink.

371
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:35,250
Good idea.

372
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,000
Isn't it happy hour?

373
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:39,500
I'm gonna have a
sex on the beach.

374
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,291
You know, Spider.

375
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:57,083
Your punches are
losing some of their uh...

376
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,250
uh... punch...

377
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:01,708
Your legs look shaky.
How they feeling?

378
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:18,958
We got you where we
want you Rain Spider!

379
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:21,000
You're gonna pay for
what you did to us!

380
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,208
I found you Desert Punk!

381
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,541
You're gonna pay for
what you did to my boys!

382
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,833
All right, then--

383
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,916
What happened? You cool?

384
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,291
I gotta say...

385
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,916
you really are a badass.

386
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,250
I'd have to say
the same about you.

387
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,875
How bout we rest for a
while. Then we start again.

388
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,166
Sounds fine to me.

389
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:31,541
Two IOU's... They're mine.

390
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:35,083
That one guy, I just
had to look at sideways

391
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,166
and he folded.

392
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,500
Then the two of
them started fighting

393
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,458
just like we planned.

394
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:41,416
It was great.

395
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,125
I never knew why you always make

396
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,916
the repayment date
on mom's memorial day.

397
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,958
But today I think
I finally figured it out.

398
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,375
That's just like your mother

399
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,625
to watch out for us so well.

400
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,500
Dad... don't get
that tomato juice

401
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:59,208
on your clothes again.
It stains.

402
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,791
The promissory notes are burned.

403
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,750
Nothing but ashes left,
and we owe no money!

404
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:04,916
So... where are we going

405
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,458
to "borrow" our next round from?

406
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,916
Wherever it is, this time

407
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,625
you're buying me
a very nice dress.

408
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,375
I don't know dear.

409
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:16,375
We're on a very
tight budget as it is.

410
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:20,333
We can certainly afford
vodka for your tomato juice.

411
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:22,333
The Great Kanto Desert.

412
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:25,541
Here, justice is on the side
of whoever is left standing.

413
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,875
The losers are those

414
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,125
who cannot adapt
to the conditions.

415
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:33,291
Men, women, children,
the fools, the trash,

416
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:38,500
and the scorned live
by one creed... Survive.

417
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,041
Survival is expensive.

418
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:07,416
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

419
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,500
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

420
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,375
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

421
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,625
It's actually a cape.

422
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:21,375
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

423
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,791
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

424
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,875
His heart is black.

425
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:30,666
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

426
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:35,625
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

427
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,125
<i>He's on the run again</i>

428
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,125
On the run again.

429
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:49,000
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

430
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:50,125
He's got a job.

431
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,916
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

432
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,250
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

433
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:59,166
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

434
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:03,166
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

435
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:07,750
<i>It's what you do</i>

436
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:17,833
Yo. What's up?

437
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,125
I'm Desert Punk and
the next episode

438
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:21,666
has some nice tit action...
Wait. No titties?

439
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:23,208
Poor baby.

440
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,291
But I love boobs.

441
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:26,125
Oh, like you're gonna get any.

442
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:29,458
On the next Desert Punk,
"Fire Dragon Kong!"

443
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,791
If you miss it,
I won't pay what I owe.
