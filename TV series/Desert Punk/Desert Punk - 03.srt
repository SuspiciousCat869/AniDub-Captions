1
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:45,166
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:49,083
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:53,166
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,333
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:01,083
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:06,750
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:11,458
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:15,791
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:20,125
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,875
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:26,791
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:30,750
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:36,333
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:40,166
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,416
The M40A1 sniper rifle.

16
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,541
7.62 caliber rounds.

17
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:02,625
Fiberglass stock and rubber
mounted ten power scope.

18
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:05,208
Effective range of
one thousand yards.

19
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:09,041
But crap, it's two-hundred
twenty-five thousand yen!

20
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,916
Man, that's a little
pricey for a reproduction!

21
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,583
Uhh! The collectors are here!

22
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:17,625
W-Wait a minute.

23
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,333
The deadline's
still a week away.

24
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:21,875
Who the hell's knocking on my
door at this hour?

25
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:24,250
Well hello there.

26
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:28,041
I recognize those
titties! Junko?!

27
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,750
What's so funny?

28
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,083
You're just a kid!

29
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,666
This is Kanta.
A freelance mercenary.

30
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,333
Why the hell are you laughing?

31
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,500
Just the thought that
the famed Desert Punk

32
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:47,208
is some kid,
it's just too hilarious!

33
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:49,833
Oh no! Now everyone's
going to know!

34
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:51,416
He's become rather famous lately

35
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,916
in Kanto known as
the great Desert Punk.

36
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,250
What the hell are
you doing here?

37
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,333
I have a job if you're
looking for some cash.

38
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,416
Uh, what?

39
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,125
I did some poking
around for myself

40
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,500
and found out that you're
in debt up to your ears.

41
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,500
What?

42
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:07,750
Who the hell told
you about that?!

43
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,791
He has failed in
his last two jobs

44
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,916
and started taking
on the debt of others.

45
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,375
Each failure was directly
linked to a woman.

46
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,541
The Chairman filled me
in on all the details.

47
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,625
Mugenya, that
dirty son of a bitch.

48
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,583
Who do you think you are going

49
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,000
around town asking about me?

50
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,500
You owe me big time now woman!

51
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:25,166
Hey watch it happy hands!

52
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,875
Feels like my birthday!

53
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:37,291
I charge ten thousand
yen for touching these.

54
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:38,375
And since I know you don't

55
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,041
have a dime to your name...

56
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,791
you better keep your hands
to yourself little boy.

57
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,208
So how much do you owe?

58
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:45,666
Let's see,
one million six hundred

59
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,958
ninety three thousand four
hundred fifty two plus six,

60
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,541
carry the one...

61
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:52,041
Around three million yen.

62
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:52,875
I'll pay you six.

63
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:53,625
Whoa!

64
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,541
Okay.

65
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,500
I'm your man. Whatever you need.

66
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:07,375
Booby sandwich... with
a six million yen dessert.

67
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,458
Once I pay off all
of my old debts...

68
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:12,500
I'll be able to buy the
sniper rifle of my dreams...

69
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,458
And I'll have enough left over
to have knockers like these...

70
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:18,166
everyday for the
rest of my life!

71
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:31,583
The dream Kanta had that night
was a splendid one indeed.

72
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:35,791
I wish I could have had
one like it... Anyway...

73
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,791
Hey Desert Punk!

74
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,458
I seem to remember you saying
this would be a piece of cake.

75
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,541
Yeah, piece of cake my ass,

76
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,875
we wouldn't even be in this
mess if it wasn't for you.

77
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,333
She's your damn friend.

78
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,750
What the hell are
you talking about?

79
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,833
She lured you in with
those massive jugs, too!

80
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,083
Th-There it is!

81
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,291
Nothing can stop that thing!

82
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,791
It travels like a
storm through the desert.

83
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,708
I've heard that it
burns anyone in its path

84
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:09,750
to a crisp, leaving
only ashes behind!

85
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,875
It's the mightiest,
most indestructible

86
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:15,833
and fully armored tank
in the entire Kanto Desert.

87
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:18,250
No! It's a cold blooded
killing machine resurrected

88
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,750
from the pits of hell
and forged in steel!

89
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,666
Fire Dragon Kong.

90
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:26,291
Don't plan on getting away
from me this time Junko.

91
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:29,291
I see you've hired a band
of imbeciles to help you out.

92
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:32,166
They're useless against
Kong, you know that!

93
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,125
You better take these
so called imbeciles

94
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,541
very seriously,
or else you'll be sorry.

95
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:40,625
Don't listen to her!

96
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,625
She's kidding!
She jokes all the time!

97
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:43,875
These four guys
have more courage

98
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,625
in their pinky toes than you do,

99
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,208
hiding inside that
huge pile of junk.

100
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:49,250
No we don't!

101
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:50,625
We're a bunch of cowards!

102
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:53,041
Words mean nothing
when you're dead.

103
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,000
Come on Junko!

104
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,166
Let's run!

105
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:01,666
Did she do that?

106
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,583
No way.

107
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,375
Not with a forty millimeter.

108
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:05,500
What are you guys waiting for!

109
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,833
Get the hell outta here!

110
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,250
Uh, what'd she say?

111
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,833
What are you
running away for girl?

112
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:21,625
It's not because of
that key you have is it?

113
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:22,625
I don't know what the hell

114
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,333
you're talking about you prick!

115
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,916
Key? Hey, Haru!

116
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,333
What Desert Pun--

117
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,083
Haru!

118
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,875
Desert Punk you bastard!

119
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,500
What did you do?

120
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:40,166
You must have really
pissed off the wrong person

121
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,958
to get Kong
breathing up your ass.

122
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,291
Look if you're involved
in some criminal behavior,

123
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,458
I'd rather just walk now
than get wrapped up

124
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,833
in this bloody mess.

125
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,083
You don't have anything
to worry about Punk.

126
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:51,125
This fight between me

127
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,333
and Captain Asstacular
is personal.

128
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,583
Damn. If I wasn't
in so much debt

129
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,458
I would just turn this job down.

130
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,000
And why do you have
to hang those things out

131
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,875
to dry in front of
my face all the time?

132
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,583
It blows my concentration.

133
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,250
What these?

134
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:07,083
I just can't stand wearing
this desert suit and helmet.

135
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,750
I figured I could do
without them in the morning

136
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,791
before it got too hot out here.

137
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,958
Liar! You're showing
them off on purpose!

138
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,625
Look at 'em, boing boing boing!

139
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,166
Oh God their so hot,
I wanna squeeze...

140
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,208
Oh no... Oh yeah.

141
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,125
You're a dead man
you scrod wrinkle!

142
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,750
You used us as decoys!

143
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,041
You're delirious!

144
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,541
If that was the case
I wouldn't be wasting time

145
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,083
trying to navigate her nipples.

146
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,875
I'd be running for my life!

147
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,000
By the way, he's not
trying to kill us.

148
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:32,750
What?

149
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,291
That's asinine!

150
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,291
We're all gonna die!

151
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:39,666
I don't think my dirty
shorts got that message DP!

152
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,208
I guess I have no choice.

153
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:44,125
Everybody! Keep your eyes shut!

154
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,666
Huh?

155
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:47,708
What the...

156
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:48,708
It's a heat-seeking missile

157
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,708
and an iron powdered smoke bomb!

158
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,041
All enemy tracking
devices are malfunctioning.

159
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,500
What is this...? It's blinding!

160
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,916
What are you doing?

161
01:07:58,708 --> 01:07:59,416
Where are they?

162
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,125
I can't tell.

163
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:03,041
Wait! There they are!

164
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,083
Ah shit...!

165
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,125
There's a network of tunnels

166
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,791
at the bottom of
that dry well...

167
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,666
Don't let them get inside!

168
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,458
Uh, They went inside.

169
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:12,375
Damn jackass!

170
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,833
What the hell is that...?

171
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:14,916
A balloon?

172
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,625
I don't see anyone in the well.

173
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,750
I could be mistaken sir,

174
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,208
but I think I noticed that
Desert Punk guy in the group.

175
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,958
Looks like we've been had boys.

176
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,416
After them. To the east.

177
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,416
Yessir!

178
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:41,000
Phew. I thought
they'd never leave.

179
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,875
Next time you want
to bury me in sand

180
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,250
warn me first so
I can shoot you in the face.

181
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,875
There wasn't enough
time to warn you.

182
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:49,833
Plus it was our only option
for evading that tank.

183
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:52,583
Well I think it was
a stupid ass plan.

184
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,083
What would we have done
if Kong had decided

185
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,000
to stay and wait us out genius?

186
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,416
Beats me.

187
01:08:58,791 --> 01:08:59,791
Geez. Why do you insist

188
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:02,166
on taking the
longest possible route?

189
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,541
Hovertanks have
trouble navigating

190
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,791
over such irregular
terrain dummy.

191
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:06,666
Whatever.

192
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,916
I wish you would have told us

193
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,291
we'd be going up against
the Fire Dragon Kong.

194
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,458
If I had told you that you
wouldn't have taken the job.

195
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,291
Yeah no kidding!

196
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,625
Oh man.

197
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,791
This has turned out to
be one craptastic morning.

198
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:21,250
Six million yen! Huh?

199
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,166
Well, if it isn't the
famous Machinegun Brothers.

200
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,500
And if it isn't Desert Punk.

201
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,291
What the hell
are you doing here?

202
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,291
Whatever you do don't
take off your helmet.

203
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,458
I don't want to
see your ugly mug

204
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,875
this early in the morning.

205
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,125
Ahh suck it.

206
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,333
Sorry to keep you boys waiting.

207
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,541
No worries. We just got here.

208
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,583
Huh?

209
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:43,083
Oh no. Don't tell me
she hired you guys.

210
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:45,000
W-Wait, you too?

211
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,375
That's right. We're a team now.

212
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,791
Let's have some fun!

213
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,916
Yeah!

214
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:58,416
Man. This sucks.

215
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,916
I really had no idea you guys

216
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,541
were childhood friends.

217
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,541
Hey, Akio.

218
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:06,666
Yeah.

219
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,541
I can't stop staring at those.

220
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:10,958
I know, I'd give anything

221
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,000
to have five minutes
alone with those fun bags.

222
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:15,833
So what was all
that crap earlier

223
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,458
about Fire Dragon Kong
not wanting to kill us.

224
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:20,208
What'd you pull that one out of?

225
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:21,416
I guess you weren't listening

226
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,375
to what that guy was saying huh?

227
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,250
Junko, isn't it about time

228
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:26,750
you told us everything?

229
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,375
You know about that
key you have lodged

230
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,708
between those enormously
beautiful breasts of yours.

231
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:31,500
Umm...

232
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:32,708
They want that key

233
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,375
but they're not willing
to kills us for it.

234
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,541
Why?

235
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:36,791
Because they run
the risk of blowing

236
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,791
it to smithereens along with us.

237
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,333
Now come on.
Spill the beans, baby.

238
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,083
What's the story on this key?

239
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,291
And why are they trying
so hard to get it?

240
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,458
And why don't you
take your shirt off

241
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:46,750
while you're at it?

242
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,541
Okay fine.

243
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,708
You remember this
from episode one, right?

244
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,875
I stole it after you
battled Pudding Boy.

245
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,875
This key actually belongs
to the wife of Taiko Okawa

246
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:58,458
who is president
of Okawa Industries.

247
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,625
The other day...

248
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,416
my family's armored
car was attacked...

249
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,916
The key to my late
wife's jewelry case

250
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,875
was in that car, and
was stolen in the process...

251
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,500
I'll make whoever
brings that key back

252
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,958
to me richer than
they can imagine.

253
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:12,833
That's what he said.

254
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:14,625
And so, it was his
eldest son Koichi

255
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:16,416
who hired me to
get it from Makoto.

256
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Now, it's his second son
Koji coming for the key.

257
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:20,583
I knew right away this was going

258
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,083
to be worth lots of money.

259
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,875
I secretly contacted
the eldest son,

260
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,875
and negotiated
with the second son.

261
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,708
Man, I was pretty busy

262
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:31,375
for not actually
being in episode two.

263
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,458
So in other words

264
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:34,041
you were trying
to jack up the price.

265
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,250
Yeah that's right.

266
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,041
I sort of overdid it
and Koji came after me

267
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:38,333
with his precious Kong.

268
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,291
But here's the deal ,
as long as we can slip

269
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,666
out of Koji's area of the
desert without being caught,

270
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,208
we can make it to the East Oasis

271
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,458
where Koichi rules, and cash in.

272
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,458
Sound like a plan?

273
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,416
What? You babies not
up to the challenge?

274
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,833
Well, I uh...

275
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:55,875
We can handle it.

276
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,000
I'm sure there's
a way we can do it.

277
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,875
Ooh, uh, really?

278
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:01,458
Really? Great! What do we do?

279
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:03,375
How do we destroy
that damn tank?

280
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,541
Destroy? Are you nuts?

281
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,208
There's no way we
can destroy that thing.

282
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,666
We'll just run like hell.

283
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:11,000
You know, you're
plans kinda suck.

284
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:13,708
It's just like him.
Always thinking small.

285
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:14,833
Anyone who considers destroying

286
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:16,750
Fire Dragon Kong
as a viable option

287
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,291
is the biggest freakin
meathead in the Desert.

288
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,750
Huh?

289
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,958
Desert Punk?

290
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,041
Seriously, stop making fun
of him like that guys...

291
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:03,333
He's dead after all.

292
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,666
How can I not?

293
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,416
He was a major knob and
just a lousy human being.

294
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,958
There's nothing good to say.

295
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:11,375
He was also cocky
and had a potty mouth.

296
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,625
Let's be honest.

297
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,208
He was a useless, inept shrimp.

298
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,750
An all around bum.

299
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,375
Speaking ill of
the dead, are we...?

300
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:21,208
Even I find that
behavior despicable.

301
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:23,375
Look at you all.

302
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,916
You're nothing but
filthy animals...

303
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,916
And fools for turning
against me and my Dragon.

304
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,416
And because of that
you won't die easy.

305
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,041
Let's start with Miss jug-fest.

306
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,125
Get the key from that bitch.

307
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,041
It's my pleasure.

308
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,000
Boobies!

309
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,666
Huh...?!

310
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,125
Hiro just fell off
the damn cliff!

311
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,041
What the--?!

312
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,958
Dammit.

313
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:04,458
I'm gonna kill
you, you bastard!

314
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,666
Do you have any idea
how sore my body is?

315
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,291
I can't believe you're alive.

316
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,291
I can.

317
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,708
He's always been stubborn.

318
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,041
Even I thought it was the end.

319
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:18,041
Thanks to you all of
my precious possessions

320
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,625
have been destroyed
leaving me with nothing...

321
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:23,458
Like my zero-type helmet
I just had repaired...

322
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:27,208
My desert subsistence OS and
life continuum air module...

323
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:30,541
And the shotgun was a
keepsake from my father.

324
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,791
Shut it...! Put your hands up...

325
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:35,208
You're gonna pay
for what you did.

326
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,125
You stupid, ugly, smelly,

327
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,708
manipulative,
rich piece of evil...

328
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,750
I'll never forgive you!

329
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,208
Die!

330
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:46,333
What the hell are you doing?!

331
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,958
You little freak, get off of me!

332
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,458
I hate you!
Get your hands off of me!

333
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:51,166
Please let me shoot them sir.

334
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,125
Here goes!

335
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,083
I know what you're doing sicko!

336
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,000
No...! Give that back!

337
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:18,250
Give what back this
little key here...?

338
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,958
Come and get it!

339
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,250
Suckers!

340
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,708
No good. He's gone.

341
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:30,000
We're going after him. Mount up!

342
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:31,625
What's wrong?

343
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:33,500
The girl and the
others ran off too!

344
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,958
Damn.

345
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,166
That stupid Punk.

346
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,708
He really snapped back there.

347
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,583
This is not gonna be good.

348
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:42,458
What do you mean?

349
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:43,750
Whenever he gets like this,

350
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,583
there's no telling
what he'll do.

351
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,083
He could become so obsessed

352
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:49,625
with revenge that
he'd die and not care.

353
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,625
Seriously?

354
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,333
Hey we gotta do
whatever it takes

355
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:54,416
to get that key back
from Desert Punk!

356
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,541
Hell, I'll kill him
if I have to.

357
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:08,375
Oh the nerve.
He played us for fools!

358
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:09,916
Dumbass...!

359
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,750
He's got the key
on him, remember...?

360
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,291
We need it in one piece, damnit.

361
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,083
Hey, he's not
wearing his mask...

362
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,041
I'll throw some gas at him.

363
01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:22,000
Oh no! Gas!

364
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,333
Great.

365
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,916
He's gonna get
squashed like a bug.

366
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,416
What a dumbass.

367
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:34,333
Left! Left!

368
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,083
No wait! Right! Right!

369
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,583
That was close!

370
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,708
He's bouncing around
like a damn flea!

371
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,916
I think I figured out
what he's trying to do.

372
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,041
What's that?

373
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,458
He keeps leading us
into wide chasms.

374
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,375
Keep coming baby.

375
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:03,083
So what? You think
he's leading us on?

376
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,541
I think he's gone
completely insane!

377
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,458
He's screwing with us.

378
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,541
If not for the key we would have

379
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:09,500
already ground him
into hamburger.

380
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:14,000
He's popping off that
pellet gun of his again!

381
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:17,166
Sir what should I do?

382
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:28,375
Crush him!

383
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:29,625
But the key!

384
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,833
I'd rather crush the key
than blow it to smithereens!

385
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,833
If it breaks then
we'll cut our losses!

386
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,750
Go!

387
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,666
Suck on this!

388
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:44,875
What's happening?

389
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,291
It's a cliff!

390
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,083
Idiots!

391
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:50,708
Eat me, you suckers!

392
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:54,375
Ouch!

393
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:55,625
Freeze!

394
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,041
What?

395
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,291
Pull your head out!

396
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,625
How many loose screws
do you have to have

397
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,166
to take on Fire Dragon
Kong like that?

398
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,166
Give me back the key, pipsqueak.

399
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,166
Y-Yeah, give it back.

400
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,791
And no funny business.

401
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,291
You guys blow.

402
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,208
Now quit interfering
with my business.

403
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:22,541
I'm having fun out there

404
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,958
and I don't want to be
disturbed anymore, got it?

405
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:27,875
If I can't get Kong,
I'll blow this key up with me.

406
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:28,875
You wouldn't.

407
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,250
If I hand the key over to them

408
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:32,041
they'll murder us
where we stand.

409
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,125
I'd rather take myself out than
kowtow to those bastards...

410
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:37,750
Or maybe I'll just...

411
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,708
Pull the pin right now.

412
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:43,458
Don't do anything stupid.

413
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:51,416
Yeah that guy... nuckin futs.

414
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,583
I told you.

415
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:54,250
And I wouldn't be
surprised if he did it.

416
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,625
You're right.

417
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:56,875
We know this because he's lobbed

418
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:59,250
grenades at us dozens
of times in the past.

419
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,500
I swear the guy's a mental case.

420
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,208
Awe. Isn't childhood
friendship beautiful...

421
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:07,833
Yeah, well I guess we
gotta go kill him now.

422
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,208
Evening Hiro.

423
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,333
Hey what's up?

424
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,541
You need a hand?

425
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,708
No!

426
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,333
I'm gonna get that
Desert Punk by myself.

427
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,500
And?

428
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,916
And... then I'll take
the key to Koichi.

429
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,250
So you're the
elder son's spy huh?

430
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,458
You could say that.

431
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,083
Are you talking about this key?

432
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,791
Yeah... Looks just like th...

433
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,333
Dammit! Where are
you Desert Punk?!

434
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:36,791
Sir!

435
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:37,875
There he is!

436
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,250
Get him!

437
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:41,958
I don't want anything
left of him once we're done!

438
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:46,583
You won't escape from
me this time Desert Punk.

439
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:48,916
Kill him!

440
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,750
That you Hiro?

441
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,291
Hiro...

442
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,333
Which way did you
see Desert Punk go?

443
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,125
What?

444
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:10,875
You are the first
and last person

445
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:14,416
to ever make a fool
out of me, Desert Punk!

446
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,000
Go to hell!

447
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,000
What the...

448
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:23,916
Look! It's Desert Punk!

449
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,500
He's going to let
that thing run over him!

450
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,833
What about my freakin' key?

451
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,250
No! There's nothing we can do!

452
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:34,208
I have to get it
from him! Let go!

453
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,750
I have one shot left.

454
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:38,833
The magazine's broken so
there are no second chances.

455
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,291
So Kong.

456
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,375
You're the biggest
and baddest force

457
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,125
in the entire desert.
No denying that.

458
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,666
And there's no way a guy like me

459
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,583
could defeat you, I'm small.

460
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:51,000
Oh, Shit.

461
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,375
I take that back.

462
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,041
You see losers,

463
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,583
your armor wasn't designed
to handle attacks from above.

464
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,416
That's quite a vulnerability.

465
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,958
This can't be happening to me...

466
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:15,541
It must really be you...
the Desert Punk...

467
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,625
Demon... of the Desert.

468
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,083
There goes the mightiest weapon

469
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,708
in the Kanto Desert.

470
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,166
There goes my key.

471
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:25,458
Yep, it looks like Desert
Punk was a idiot after all.

472
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:26,958
Look!

473
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,791
He made it!

474
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,041
He better have my key!

475
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,791
Hey, Machinegun Brothers!

476
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,208
Show 'em what you got!

477
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:37,458
Use that namesake of yours
and pump 'em full of lead!

478
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:39,791
Aim for the fuel tank!

479
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:40,875
Got it!

480
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,416
Abandon ship boys!

481
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,458
No way!

482
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,791
Yeah I don't want to get shot!

483
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,583
But if we stay
in here we'll get--

484
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,375
Fire Dragon Kong was too big

485
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,250
to chase a rat
down a narrow path

486
01:21:57,333 --> 01:22:00,375
and its armor was too
thin in the worst place.

487
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:03,000
It only displayed its strength
in the wide open desert,

488
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,666
but here in the subterrane,
it was a sitting freakin' duck.

489
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,750
You've got snot
running down your nose.

490
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,125
Desert Punk and the
others finally managed

491
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:14,875
to get their hands on
the score of a lifetime.

492
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,958
The lesson for today;
Put a breast in front of him

493
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:21,083
and Desert Punk doesn't
know his ass from his face.

494
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,541
Which isn't really a lesson.

495
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:26,833
But maybe he'll
learn one, someday.

496
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,000
You're absolutely
amazing Desert Punk!

497
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,375
Do you realize
you're the first person

498
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:34,000
to ever defeat Fire Dragon Kong?

499
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,250
You sand-demon, you.

500
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:40,000
It was a piece of cake, baby!

501
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:41,333
Now let me grab on your--

502
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,458
Yeah, no.

503
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,333
It looks like the
only thing he's gonna

504
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,166
be grabbing is himself.

505
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:08,333
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

506
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,416
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

507
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,291
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

508
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,541
It's actually a cape.

509
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:22,291
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

510
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,708
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

511
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,791
His heart is black.

512
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:31,583
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

513
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:36,541
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

514
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:46,041
<i>He's on the run again</i>

515
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:47,041
On the run again.

516
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,916
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

517
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,041
He's got a job.

518
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:53,833
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

519
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:56,166
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

520
01:23:56,250 --> 01:24:00,083
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

521
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:04,083
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

522
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:08,666
<i>It's what you do</i>

523
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:18,958
Yo! What's up?

524
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,166
I'm Desert Punk
and I want to say

525
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,333
that today was a
serious breast fest.

526
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:23,458
As for next time...

527
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:24,333
I'm Fuyo!

528
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:25,083
I'm Akio!

529
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,208
And I'm awesome!

530
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:27,541
No you're not!

531
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:31,166
Next time on Desert Punk,
"An Ace In The Sand!"

532
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,208
Don't miss it!
