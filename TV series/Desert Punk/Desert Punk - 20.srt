1
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,916
Where am I? And why is
everything so white?

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,916
Junko, when'd you get out...?

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,416
Oh, right...
I'm dreaming. I know.

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,958
First, put your hand on my--

5
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,583
Welcome back... How you feelin'?

6
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,333
What the hell are
you doing here?

7
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,833
Look... I'm a nurse.
Can't you tell...

8
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,916
I got a clipboard.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,416
I see the clipboard...

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,291
But the last time I saw you,
Oasis Intelligence guys

11
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,250
were hauling your
hot totties to prison.

12
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,791
How cute...!

13
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,250
You, were worried
about me, weren't you?!

14
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,416
Hey guess what Punk...

15
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,375
I lined up a new gig.

16
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,583
With the Underground
Mercenaries.

17
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,708
Your temperature is down,

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,625
but you still have
a nasty concussion.

19
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,625
You need to rest.

20
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,958
I'll check back
with you in a bit.

21
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,083
We'll run a few tests
and then maybe a bath.

22
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,416
Totally a dream...

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,333
There's no way that
chick would ever go

24
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,666
to work for an
organization of any kind.

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,583
Or this is my huge payoff
in the afterlife.

26
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,166
Yeah that's why she's here.

27
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,791
They ripped off all her clothes
and tortured her to death.

28
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,041
Stuck it to her
good in the showers.

29
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,458
She was wet and begging
for them to stop.

30
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,541
Now that gets the
gears turning. Down Charlie!

31
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,333
Kosuna?

32
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,166
What in the name of the
rose are you wearing?!

33
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,333
I know I look stupid,

34
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,625
but the googly
dingbat made me wear it.

35
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,500
Must feel weird to be
dressed like a girl for once!

36
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,541
No really, you look hot.

37
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,083
So, I haven't been
dreaming any of this?

38
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,583
Nope.

39
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,833
I think this place is like
Natsuko's hideout, or something.

40
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,708
I dunno. But the food rocks,

41
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,541
and I got to take a bath
for the first time this year.

42
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,500
We're actually
inside the West Oasis?

43
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,666
That's right.

44
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,416
But we're in some
totally obscure place,

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,083
way deeper underground than
the government even knows to go.

46
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,958
So I think we're pretty safe.

47
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,291
What's next for the two of us?

48
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,875
I wouldn't worry about it.

49
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,625
Just enjoy the down time...
And get some sleep.

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,583
You're no good
to me if you're rusty.

51
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,000
You're looking quite
at home, my friend.

52
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,625
It can't be! It's you!
Help! Help it burns!

53
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,916
My skin is melting off my bones!

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,166
What's his deal?

55
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,833
He always acts like that
around virtuous people.

56
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,333
You...! You can't be here...!

57
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,166
You're supposed to be
sold off, slavin' away!

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,416
I sold you to that
creepy hoof-sniffer back

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,166
at the human bazaar!!

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Why do you have to suck so bad?!

61
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,791
Good to see you too.

62
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,625
How'd you get out of being sold

63
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,666
to that bald-headed percy pants?

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,875
I'll admit it was a bit rough,
but as it turned out...

65
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,375
Government forces
had been tracking me,

66
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,291
and they stole me
outta there pretty fast.

67
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,166
What a complete loser.

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
You couldn't even
save your own hide.

69
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,916
Whatever you say.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,750
And I suppose you'll
say that I'm incompetent.

71
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,041
Ikeda... What the hell
are you doing back there?

72
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,666
I usually study Dark Ages
history for a living.

73
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,791
But last week...

74
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,250
they asked me to
keep an eye on you

75
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,291
and try to convince you
to join our cause ...

76
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,041
I evaluated your
character and found you

77
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,166
to be exactly what
we were looking for.

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,916
We know there's no
love lost between you

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,416
and the government.
You hate them.

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,958
Which makes you a perfect
candidate for conversion.

81
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,583
You should thank Ikeda for
bringing you into the fold.

82
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,541
I was just doing my duty.

83
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,000
Now that you know who we are,

84
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,208
you should know what we are...

85
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,875
We're the Underground
Mercenaries...

86
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,791
And we want to invite
you to join our cause.

87
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,208
What do you do?

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,625
We're clandestine
supporters of the future

89
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,666
and freedom of the
Great Kanto Desert.

90
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
We've put together a
group of mercs who stay

91
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,166
below the radar and work
endlessly for our cause...

92
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,458
And we are...

93
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,041
The Undergound!

94
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,291
AKA the Undergound Mercenaries.

95
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,291
The government doesn't
help those who need it.

96
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,208
They don't supply
decent food or shelter.

97
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,375
They won't even
keep people safe!

98
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,708
We have people both inside

99
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,583
and outside the
government's workings.

100
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,458
Together we can force change!

101
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,833
Please, Mr. Punk.
We need you on our side.

102
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,500
You're just the kind of guy
we've been missing on our team.

103
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,916
That's right...!

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,625
And you hate the
government like I do...

105
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,833
Who is a more perfect candidate?

106
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,333
We need your talents ...

107
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,333
The Underground
Mercenaries are just like you,

108
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,208
the only difference
is we're organized.

109
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,666
With your help, we can fight the

110
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,958
corrupt government bureaucracy

111
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,625
and make the
desert a better place!

112
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,041
What do you say Punk?

113
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,333
I dunno. I've always
kinda liked it.

114
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,666
The government isn't that bad.

115
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,500
Yeah, yeah, I got a short fuse

116
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,833
and they piss me off sometimes.

117
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,958
Same goes for women and
I ain't giving up on them.

118
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,916
I'm cool with the government
to a certain degree.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,666
They manage the
farming, the medicine.

120
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,500
And it might only
be the bare necessities

121
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,458
that they're providing
to everyone to live on,

122
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,833
but that's life.

123
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,750
There're no easy roads
and no promises made

124
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,791
when you're born that
say your quality of life

125
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,416
is gonna be good.

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,333
They put it in your hands
whether you're gonna live

127
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,250
or die because in the end,
they don't really care.

128
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,083
I gotta say,
I kinda respect that.

129
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,750
So are we done here?

130
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,750
There's one person
you haven't heard from.

131
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,625
A major player in our movement.

132
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,583
Major player, huh?

133
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,583
The chairman of the Underground
Mercenaries... He's great.

134
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,541
You have a chairman?

135
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,958
It's me!

136
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,333
Caca.

137
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,208
Whoa... There's so
much tension here...

138
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,625
And all in one tiny room...
these two hotshots...

139
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,208
They really look like they might
hurt each other at some point.

140
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,333
This is like a battle of the
greatest!

141
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,708
The greediest man in
the desert staring down

142
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,208
the most driven treasure
hunter in the desert.

143
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,833
Kaizuka, the president of the

144
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,000
'Game of Living' corporation
with locked eyes on Desert Punk,

145
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,791
my master and total bad-dude
scavenger of the sands.

146
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,708
I see you brought your
runt-like friend along...

147
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,500
So what's with the
little school-girl outfit?

148
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,333
I'd rather be wearing sand.

149
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,166
Fill me in.

150
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,416
Why'd you snag Natsuko

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,541
and that moose-knuckle
Stryker to talk to me?

152
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,833
You already got this life
in the desert thing covered...

153
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,541
With your business and
all that disposable income...

154
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,458
I'd sit back and enjoy my life

155
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,083
selling stupid games
if I were you.

156
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,833
You're as cocky a bastard
as you've ever been, Punk.

157
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,083
My attitude is
just small time...

158
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,541
I can't hold a candle to
some guy who wanders the desert,

159
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,708
passing off old games
like they're gold,

160
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,000
manipulating innocent
people to do his bidding.

161
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,875
And dreaming of a
fairy-princess world

162
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,583
where everyone lives in
harmony with the government.

163
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,875
What a jerk.

164
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,708
As if you've kept
it in your pants

165
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,416
and never screwed
with innocent people.

166
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,375
He's got that crazy look again.

167
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,791
The truth of all this is that

168
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,750
I do have to discuss
a matter with you.

169
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,000
I made the choice to become
the underground's benefactor.

170
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,208
And I'll make sure that you'll
be earning plenty of money, too.

171
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,458
I figured it woulda
been a good ten years

172
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,250
before I got that call from you.

173
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,250
Things have become
more urgent of late,

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,541
and I think you know it.

175
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,250
There's a wicked force rising.

176
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,125
Something that will threaten

177
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,875
and take every life in
the desert if allowed.

178
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,250
You mean those
dudes from earlier

179
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,583
with the robes and the
hats and the pretty eyes.

180
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes, I do. But not them alone...

181
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,166
You remember the
Guardian we ran into?

182
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,625
The power that
he carried with him?

183
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,791
Yeah, how could I forget?

184
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,375
Originally, the people like me

185
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,750
who came out into the
desert for excavation

186
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,333
were seeking items
from the Dark Ages.

187
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,083
But lately, it seems
that every piece

188
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,958
being dug up dates back to a
much more recent time period.

189
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,208
And the science
that courses through

190
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,375
them is dangerously high-tech.

191
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,500
High-tech?
What kind of high-tech?

192
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,166
Ah, your convoluted story's
beginning to make sense.

193
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,166
You've been scrambling
like a dog for table scraps,

194
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,375
desperate to get your hands
on one of those big bitches

195
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,958
to fight the government with.

196
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,666
You sure you're not
in this for the power?

197
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,541
Take over the government
and lead it yourself?

198
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,291
I can't lie.
That does sound nice.

199
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,666
Come on...

200
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,458
What are they talking
about that's taking so long?

201
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,291
Considering that
it's those two...

202
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,125
It's either boobs, world
domination, or boobs.

203
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,791
Why would Kaizuka
even be interested

204
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,916
in a shit-licker
like Desert Punk?

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,166
That's the kind of
question only a chick

206
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,000
who knows nothing
about Punk would ask.

207
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,500
Keep 'em up cutie.

208
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,541
During the Dark Ages,
catastrophic changes

209
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,750
affected the entire
planet, transforming

210
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,166
the Kanto Plains
into the Kanto Desert.

211
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,125
But mother nature
is a resilient lady.

212
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,291
The imbalances can be overcome,

213
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,708
and this planet will be
like it was a long time ago.

214
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,166
Sounds like you only want
things back to normal...

215
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,333
But, what is normal?

216
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,666
An environment where
things can live freely.

217
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,291
Take root in the
ground and grow.

218
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,166
Fruits, vegetables, forests.

219
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
Which all goes against
every government program.

220
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,333
Yeah, because they've
got this whole desert

221
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
engineered to benefit them.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,416
Why would they
bother planting stuff?

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,416
Exactly.

224
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,416
The most recent studies
speak of a ten-thousand year

225
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,208
process to get our planet
back to her normal, green self.

226
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,875
Ohhh... 'Kay...
I'll be really dead by then.

227
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,583
So tell me about
your big plan, yea!

228
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,875
I'm not just in this
for the coup 'de tat.

229
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,041
Bringing down the government
is merely a single step

230
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,208
in the grand journey
I have planned.

231
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,583
This is about the greater good!

232
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,375
Restoring greenery
to this planet

233
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,958
with the help of my fellow man!

234
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,125
Greenery...

235
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,333
Yeah, that's a pretty dumb plan.

236
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,958
Let's get to it.
What do you need me for?

237
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,708
Underground Mercenaries.
Kick ass.

238
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,833
People are gonna totally
pay attention to me now--

239
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,208
We're big league now boys.

240
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,583
They made us a
part of their crew.

241
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,208
So, we've gotta be ultra cool.

242
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,250
We are so awesome.

243
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,708
You two check it out!
I even changed the banner!

244
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,625
Now everyone will know that I'm
an Underground Mercenary guy--

245
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,750
When did you do this?

246
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,375
Yeah, I didn't know
you could spell.

247
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,333
I always thought you
bought that banner.

248
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,250
Shut up. I can spell.
Rifle. R-I-F-U-L.

249
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,583
Now you try taintloaf!

250
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,416
You see something down there?

251
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,833
Yeah... But I don't
think it's down there.

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,333
That was good for me.

253
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,458
You done?

254
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, and Kaizuka
said he was hungry.

255
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,583
Sure... I'll be
right back with it.

256
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,708
And...? Did you make the
decision to stay on with us?

257
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,041
Yeah. You're stuck with me.

258
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,500
You finally decided to
play for the good guys?

259
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,708
I figure if I refuse,
you kill me...

260
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,000
Or if I run, you kill me...

261
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,333
The choice to stay here

262
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,458
with you fine people isn't
much of a choice at all.

263
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,000
There's more to it, right?

264
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,791
I gotta make my money somehow.

265
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,833
Can you guarantee
you won't betray us?

266
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,541
You wouldn't believe me...

267
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,666
Not if it was yes... or a no.

268
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,583
You do have a point there.

269
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,750
We're counting on you...
Don't let us down Punk

270
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,208
Hey, there sunshine!

271
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,333
It's lunchtime! Yummy yummy!

272
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,166
A nice box lunch to eat up
and help you get better...

273
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,500
Here... Ahhh!

274
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,291
What's wrong?

275
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,083
Open up!

276
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,208
Oh...

277
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
Yeah... I know what helps...

278
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,416
He picked me up
like I was nothing.

279
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,416
I gotta keep him
from squashing me!

280
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,875
I got him.

281
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,333
Oh, crap.

282
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,291
Natsuko...
I have to tell... Natsuko...

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,750
Company.

284
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,500
I'll go say hi.

285
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,083
Holy ass nuggets...

286
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,041
Wait till you feast your eyes
on our sweet new gear...!

287
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,833
It's all light-weight
and everything!

288
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,125
Check this out! Rippin' cool!

289
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,583
Yeah!

290
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,208
You catch me,
and it's gonna cost you!!

291
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,291
Yeah...!

292
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,875
I'll just expense it to
the Underground Mercenaries!

293
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,416
I bet those guys
know what it's like

294
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,958
to go without a
piece for a long time!

295
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,166
Now, let's get these
horses outta the barn!

296
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,041
I hope I'm not
interrupting you two.

297
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,666
Yo, Tech! What's goin' down?

298
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,708
Not much.

299
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,791
Get that stalker away, from, me!

300
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,208
I'm not a stalker...

301
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,708
I'm part of the
Underground, Bitch.

302
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,166
Yeah, yeah. We're all friends.

303
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,208
Hooray...
Now, show me the goods.

304
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,916
Is that my new
suit you're holding?

305
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,916
Yes...

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,541
Identical in style
to your old ones

307
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,833
but fitted with all the
latest from the Unome suits...

308
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,458
I used their most recent
model... and I modified it some.

309
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,666
Your friends have
come back for seconds.

310
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,166
The dudes with the pretty eyes?

311
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,166
I think. You're
gonna get out there

312
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,958
and do something, aren't you?

313
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,541
It's not like I can say 'no'
and walk out the front door.

314
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,166
Welcome to the team.

315
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,541
I'll evacuate Kaizuka.
Junko, Tech.

316
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,291
Get your gear.
You're coming with me!

317
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,500
Right.

318
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,208
Ok, hold up. See you
on the other side, Punk.

319
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,416
Stryker, report back on
the evacuation status.

320
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,250
We're moving. No problems.

321
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,708
Get to the underground
parking lot and hold tight...

322
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
We'll meet you
there in ten minutes.

323
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,000
You're dead!

324
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,166
Get your indestructible
ass away from my sister!

325
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,458
Put them down...!
Don't hurt my brothers!

326
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,791
Haru! Stay back!

327
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,666
This is the coolest suit!

328
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,458
Kosuna...

329
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,166
Yeah-eh... huh?

330
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,416
As of right now...
My apprentice...

331
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,333
You're deemed
officially trained...

332
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,291
Congratulations...!
Starting this moment,

333
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,041
you are a
full-fledged mercenary!

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,708
Yea!!

335
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,958
That kicks ass! I'm the bomb!

336
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,833
Your first job is me leaving you

337
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,666
in charge of the
front of this place

338
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,875
while the enemy advances.

339
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,291
But... What about you?

340
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,083
Where are you gonna
dig in and defend?

341
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,708
Use your head, narwhal.

342
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,958
There's no way the attack is
gonna come from just the front.

343
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,458
This is a rebel base
with limited resources,

344
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,708
so they draw Natsuko
and the others out front.

345
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,125
All the while the real
target is in the back.

346
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,333
Where I'll be.

347
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,875
Be, careful out there.

348
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,791
Do you remember the last thing
Kaizuka said in the meeting?

349
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,666
Did you understand him?

350
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,958
The government won't
be removed overnight.

351
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,250
It will take some time.

352
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,500
And until everything
is complete,

353
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,708
I must continue
to run my company.

354
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,333
Keep up the image, you know.

355
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,833
But when everything
is said and done,

356
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,625
I'll make sure that
I pass it on to you.

357
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,541
Until that day, you must
continue to fight the fight.

358
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,791
What he meant was that

359
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,833
the shiz is gonna hit
the fan and splatter.

360
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,625
And we're the one's who get
to clean up the mudd afterwards.

361
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,500
I don't like any of this.

362
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,833
Stryker, Natsuko,
Underground Mercenaries.

363
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,166
It's a big, flaming
load in a paper sack.

364
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,875
What are you saying?

365
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,333
We don't take jobs to
fulfill some unselfish cause.

366
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,041
And we don't waste time
trying to fix something

367
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,833
that broke a thousand years ago.

368
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,875
We're mercenaries...

369
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,500
you and I... and
it's time to clock in.

370
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,750
Let's show them how
real mercenaries roll.

371
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,916
Yeah!

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
The front line's no
place for amateurs.

373
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,166
You're in charge
Mercenary Kosuna.

374
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,041
Mercenary me?

375
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,125
Do me proud!

376
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,541
Right on!

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,916
Mercenary Kosuna is
gonna rock the house!

378
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,208
It's a robot!

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,166
Natsuko!

380
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,791
Hurry! Everyone to the truck!

381
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,750
Escaping.

382
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,541
Get out of here, now!

383
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,916
We have visual confirmation.

384
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,916
That's Kaizuka!

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,583
He's their commander?! Amazing!

386
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,041
The president of the
'Game of Living' company

387
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,958
is running the rebel faction.

388
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,958
Ayuka you scored big time!

389
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
Get him in custody immediately!

390
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,708
Afirmative.

391
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,625
What...?! I'm going backwards!

392
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,500
Hold onto your pantyhose!

393
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,833
Kosuna!

394
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,958
Dizzy dizzy, round and round...

395
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
Restraints detected.
Movement is unavailable.

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Thank you, Kosuna!

397
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,125
Enough gratitude!

398
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,041
Get me out from
under this thing!

399
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
Ayuka, update!

400
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,375
Do you have him yet?
Do you have Kaizuka?!

401
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,500
Negative. Negative.

402
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,500
Kosuna, you are
one bad little girl.

403
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,583
Yeah, nice job, short, stack.

404
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,791
Well, I am a real mercenary now.

405
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
What happened to Kanta?

406
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,958
He went the other way.

407
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,375
He said something
about showing you guys

408
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,541
what a real mercenary
was made of.

409
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,666
Coward.

410
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,625
You don't know anything!

411
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,791
He said the real attack
would come from behind!

412
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,916
And he went there all alone.

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,791
That's what a
real mercenary does!

414
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,958
He's no coward!

415
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,375
He did what you couldn't do...!

416
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,583
You don't know
anything about him!

417
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,708
Whoa, there really was
an attack in the back.

418
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,333
Freaky. I didn't expect that.

419
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,875
I was hoping they'd just follow

420
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,125
the barrage of people out
the front and leave me alone.

421
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:54,916
I guess the truth works
better than fiction sometimes.

422
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,666
No, does that mean ...

423
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,416
Kanta...

424
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,083
Ain't that just
the strangest thing...

425
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,458
Elimination of all
forces at the rear entrance

426
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,666
to the bunker is complete.

427
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,375
Forget the grunts back there!

428
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,666
Get to the front and
help Ayuka immediately!

429
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,166
Affirmative

430
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,125
Kosuna...

431
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,666
I can't...

432
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,625
I'm going back
and help my Master!

433
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,250
Get back here!

434
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,541
What are you doing?!
He needs my help! Lemme go!

435
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,375
Was he still inside?

436
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,791
No, Master!

437
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,375
Yo, this is Desert Punk,

438
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,666
I was killed today
and won't be returning.

439
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,625
Wait. Oh, come on
gimme my contract.

440
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,625
Where's my agent!
I need somebody to... Lawyer!

441
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,833
You were the
man Punk, the man.

442
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,083
Now that you're dead,

443
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,708
can I finally have
my porn collection back.

444
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,666
The next episode is
'Successor of the Desert'!
