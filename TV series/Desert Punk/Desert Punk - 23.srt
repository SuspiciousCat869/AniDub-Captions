1
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,041
Hey Matsu!

2
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,000
The winch is working great!

3
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,916
My master would be proud...!

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,291
Your stuff really is the best!

5
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,583
If you got any
new gadgets ready,

6
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,041
I'm always in
the market for 'em!

7
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,083
Why you so quiet?!

8
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,666
Matsu, no!!

9
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't wanna go with Kosuna.

10
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
She smells like hot pee.

11
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,958
I need all of you
guarding this place.

12
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,541
It's a secret research facility

13
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,416
and it contains highly
sensitive materials.

14
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,125
Is this some snow-job?

15
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,333
We're not just gonna be
bait like last time, are we?

16
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,791
Or if so, I'd like to know.

17
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,375
No, I can assure you,
this is no snow-job.

18
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,208
It is extremely important

19
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
that we are able to
guard the laboratory.

20
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,250
The fate of the
Underground Mercenaries

21
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,541
depends upon our success.

22
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,958
Cool, sis.

23
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,750
If it is what you say it is,
then we're all on board.

24
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,041
We'll follow you anywhere.

25
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,125
You know that.

26
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,708
Kosuna...?
Kosuna, are you listening?

27
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,875
Yes!

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,000
Can we count on you
for this assignment?

29
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,750
Well... where are we going?

30
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,166
Where I just said...

31
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,166
To guard the research facility.

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250
Yeah, I'm in...

33
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,708
You better believe it!

34
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,583
This place burned fast and hard.

35
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,791
You think it was all that gas

36
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
for the welding torches he sold?

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,333
Yeah, that plus the nitro
tanks he had stored in back.

38
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,708
Anyway, I wanted
to tell you about

39
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,125
an interesting order
I had come in the other day.

40
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,666
It was a fella
you've run with some.

41
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,125
He asked for a winch exactly
like the one Kanta had.

42
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,916
I thought that was strange.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,875
Kosuna!!

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,625
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,541
They said three of
Matsu's children were saved

46
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
from the flames.

47
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,541
But the fire cost so much in
repairs to the other businesses,

48
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,541
and the expense to
keep these three kids

49
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,333
hospitalized is so high...

50
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,666
I heard that they're gonna
be bartered to traders.

51
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,291
Those kids were lucky...

52
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,708
Lucky they weren't thrown
out into the desert.

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,875
Spit it out.

54
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,791
You seem so depressed.

55
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,041
What's it to you?

56
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:45,000
Nothing. I mean,
I guess, uh, nothing, really.

57
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,291
I never, thought I'd see the day

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,208
when I'm worried over by a
tiny speck of a man like you!

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,791
I'm just trying to help.

60
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,583
What did you really
come here for?

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,500
They told me to tell
you it's time to go.

62
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,166
Alrighty!

63
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,875
Why isn't
Mr. Liberty and Freedom

64
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,416
taking this journey with us?

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,916
Who, you mean Stryker...?

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I heard that he was already
at the lab guarding Kaizuka.

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,625
I think they headed down
in a convoy earlier.

68
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,375
What's got you down, Kosuna...?

69
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,375
You look like you
lost your only friend.

70
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,583
Oh...

71
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,000
I know what's buggin her...

72
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,208
I don't like riding in the
back of this truck either,

73
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,291
but it won't take long.

74
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,458
We'll get there fast.

75
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,666
That's not my problem, Haru.

76
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,916
You're starting to freak me out.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
This isn't like you.

78
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,208
I'm just...

79
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,041
I'm curious about, what Kaizuka

80
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,125
is making at the lab
that's so important.

81
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,458
Could be some kind of gun...

82
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,416
Maybe a big-bad
relic from the Dark Ages

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,208
that he's managed to
reconstruct.

84
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,291
I know what it is...!

85
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
He's remade the
legendary M134 minigun!

86
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,916
It's not a weapon.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,708
You're not
considering how Kaizuka

88
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,166
made all his money
in the first place.

89
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,875
He got rich by
developing a board game,

90
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,583
not some super weapon.

91
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,791
So what?

92
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,500
If an ancient board game
is what made him...

93
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,750
then he's probably developing
a new, better game...

94
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,125
I bet it's called like,

95
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,666
'Spin Your Destiny' or
'Bet Your Rations'.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,125
It's gonna be so cool.
I can't wait to play.

97
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,708
I just love games. I always win.

98
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,750
What is this place?

99
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,458
I'm scared.

100
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,750
Now that's one big hole.

101
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,166
This is Kanto's Great Crater.

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,583
Toward the end of the Dark Ages,

103
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,875
there was some kind
of massive devastation

104
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,916
that changed the earth's crust.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
This change formed
an enormous sinkhole.

106
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,500
It's well over six miles wide

107
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,708
and it sits a
half-mile above sea level.

108
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,583
I've heard that
this is the abyss,

109
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,000
but I don't know
what that means.

110
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,708
It's supposed to be scary
to keep people away.

111
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,333
Which makes it the perfect
place for a secret lab.

112
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,541
So are we ready or what?

113
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,708
Anytime!

114
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,000
We'll be right down.

115
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,500
What about Rain Spider?

116
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,375
Is he gonna be in
on this with us?

117
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,375
He said 'no' in so many words.

118
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,541
Said this kinda work
wasn't worth his time.

119
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,625
Yeah, figures.

120
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,500
Ok, let's get in
this hole, guys!

121
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,458
Yeah!

122
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,875
Well, looky there.

123
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,791
Little Miss Stuff-It is still
out here kicking sand.

124
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,541
I don't recognize her.
What's she do?

125
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,916
She was Desert Punk's
annoying sidekick.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,416
Never met her.

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,666
She had the skills
of a box of dirt.

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,791
Did you manage to
establish contact yet?

129
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,500
Yes... Operation commences
in twelve hours.

130
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,041
We've got some time to kill.

131
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,750
That means our worthless,
flat-chested young friend

132
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,708
will be dead in less than a day!

133
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,125
I almost feel bad for her.

134
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,583
She'll never know
what it feels like

135
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,458
to be a real woman...

136
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,958
Well... It feels real good.

137
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
We've been climbing
down this thing forever.

138
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,375
No doubt. Are we there yet?

139
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,791
Mitz, are you okay?

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,291
You look like you're stumbling!

141
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,625
No I'm fine.

142
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,041
You want us to carry
some of your pack?

143
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,583
No, I'm useless out here if
I can't even carry my own load.

144
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,583
I'm just going to
have to get stronger.

145
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,666
I remember...

146
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,916
I'm useless...!

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,208
What good am I if
I can't carry my own load?

148
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,666
Fine. You get one shot!

149
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,541
I'm bothered most by the fact

150
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,625
that I couldn't hold it
together in front of him.

151
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,583
My master always
saw me at my weakest.

152
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:26,958
Mitz is... he's just like me.

153
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,875
No, he's not!
He's just a dumb kid!

154
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,916
If you wanna get stronger,

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,791
it won't happen with you
resting on your haunches!

156
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,250
You got it! I'm not
even close to tired.

157
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,416
You're a bad liar, Mitz.

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,708
You'll have to
work on that, too.

159
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,041
I knew the second
I saw Stryker in action,

160
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,333
that I needed to up
my game out here

161
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,250
if I was gonna
amount to anything.

162
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,166
If the fairy-boy is
such an inspiration

163
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,625
to you, then why don't you
run off and apprentice him?

164
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,833
You two would
make a cute couple.

165
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,541
I didn't mean it
like that! I like you!

166
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,125
Things are coming to light.

167
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:01,541
Our pal Mitz has a huge
bone-on for the old lady.

168
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,458
Sounds like a bull's-eye to me!

169
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,083
Shut your mouth, Fuyo!

170
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,875
What do you know?! You're a kid!

171
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,041
You have no clue what it
takes to please a real woman!

172
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,791
Somebody stop her!!

173
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,541
I think we have a visitor.

174
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,750
Where? I don't have
anyone on my monitor.

175
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,958
Looks like a sandstorm.

176
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,791
I hate going
through those things.

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
Kosuna, you got the
best telescopic lens.

178
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,041
What do you see?

179
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,166
I got nothing.

180
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,166
It's still way too far off
to get any solid readings.

181
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,166
I don't like this.
We should keep moving.

182
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,166
Good.

183
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,333
Morning, Tech...
How are the tests?

184
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,500
Oh... they're
very well, Chairman.

185
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,208
Everything looks
right on schedule.

186
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,875
Correct. And if
we stay on track,

187
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,250
cultivation will be
finished in two weeks.

188
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,875
That makes eighteen specimens,

189
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,083
including the Series Zero-Zero
units completed earlier.

190
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,625
Are those numbers still correct?

191
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,208
We used compiled data
from the earlier Series

192
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,333
and combined it
with the current models

193
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,291
to create this
Series Zero-One line.

194
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,750
They should be
much more powerful.

195
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,250
I can't shake the feeling
of how creepy this is.

196
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,541
It doesn't feel right to be
standing in a room like this,

197
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,083
filled with ancient
weapons from the Dark Ages.

198
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,458
My young boy...

199
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,041
Don't think I don't
understand you... cause I do.

200
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,708
But if we are
going to save this,

201
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,625
then we must have a
force powerful enough

202
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,333
to destroy a government army.

203
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,375
We need their strength.

204
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,416
Of course we do.
But is this the way?

205
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,208
I've heard the term, 'Use a
thief to catch a thief'...

206
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,333
Or 'fight fire with fire'.
Call it what you will.

207
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,583
Because when all
is said and done

208
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,791
you will never see
these guardians again,

209
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,916
nor will you see me.

210
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,625
Stryker...

211
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,875
Tech...

212
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,250
When I am gone you two will be

213
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,833
the leaders of the
Great Kanto Desert.

214
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,791
I want you to build a
new desert, a better one.

215
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,041
A desert without
poverty or hunger.

216
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,458
A desert surrounded by an oasis.

217
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,291
You can count on me...!

218
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,375
I won't even let my
own mother near this lab!

219
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,000
And I'll ratchet up
production of the guardians!

220
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,708
They'll be finished
a week early!

221
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,750
Yes! The time for change is now!

222
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,625
We have to hurry and
make this a better place!

223
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,791
Those boys are just
what I need right now.

224
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,791
They're going to
come in handy later.

225
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
But if that other
jerk-off was still alive,

226
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,875
he'd have been a much
better puppet for me.

227
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,916
He might not have been
the easiest to control,

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,833
but even genius has
its opportunity cost.

229
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,041
Not a very imposing laboratory.

230
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,166
I sent my two favorites
inside to investigate.

231
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,708
We should have
details anytime now.

232
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
One is positioned on the east.

233
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,958
One is on the west.

234
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,958
Something else. A human
is giving them orders.

235
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,916
What a humorous moment.

236
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,375
That is the laughing.
Should I laugh now?

237
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,041
The moment has passed.

238
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,166
I wonder why we
need these humans.

239
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,500
We are more powerful than they,
as are the soldiers down there.

240
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,416
Master said to us once

241
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,625
that a good soldier
does not ask questions.

242
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,791
He simply completes his task.

243
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,666
Is it time?

244
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,916
Yes.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,583
Did you just say
that they're learning?

246
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,708
Of course, they are.

247
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,541
You're a smart girl Kosuna.

248
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,375
You didn't notice that
back in Skeleton City?

249
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,750
I did.

250
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,958
My master and I fought

251
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,125
these giant antiques
a few months back.

252
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,083
They've gotten a
lot better since then.

253
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,500
Like you said.

254
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,250
Their capacity
to learn is growing.

255
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,291
Which makes them more dangerous.

256
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,541
Didn't that busted up head of

257
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,791
that one robot say
something about a master?

258
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,541
You mean there's
some faceless dude

259
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,000
out there teaching these
metal-heads how to fight?

260
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,750
He must know how to
think like a robot...

261
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,250
A cyborg brain!

262
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,916
I think he's someone

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,458
with an incredible knowledge
of fighting techniques.

264
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,958
He can think his way
into or out of anything,

265
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,208
knowing any number
of ways to cheat.

266
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:45,791
He is merciless and cunning and
he is training them as we speak.

267
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,083
Hmm merciless and cunning...

268
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,291
You found only three
guarding the front?

269
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,583
The rest of the
facility was dry.

270
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,750
Then the rebels
haven't even come close

271
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,625
to mass-producing them.

272
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,166
If we are to attack,
I believe it should be now.

273
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Agreed.

274
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,291
No. We're going wait this out.

275
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,250
But why?

276
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,083
Master says so. His orders.

277
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,833
We are honored you would come

278
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,500
to this remote location for us.

279
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,083
Master will lead you
into battle this time.

280
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,583
We are a dozen strong!

281
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,375
Today we will march as an army!

282
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,916
Failure is for the uninspired!

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,583
This place sucks.
The footing is all crappy.

284
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,083
There're rocks everywhere.

285
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,916
It's like walking
across ball bearings.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,541
Yeah, it's wearing me out.

287
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,000
It's not that much further.

288
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,875
You can rest when we get there.

289
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,250
Hey-uh Kosuna.

290
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,458
Yeah?

291
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,541
You might wanna go
fetch your boyfriend.

292
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,125
What?!

293
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,166
The Machinegun
Brothers each have

294
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,000
a ton of equipment,
and they can carry it all.

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,083
They're walking around
like it's Sunday afternoon.

296
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,333
Too slow!

297
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,791
You're dragging
ass behind the crew!

298
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,541
If I weren't your master,
you'd be a dead man right now!

299
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,250
I'm sorry!

300
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,458
Take this off!
You don't need it anymore!

301
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,583
We can't have you prancing

302
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,000
around the desert
like a Rain Spider.

303
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:07,791
What did I do wrong?!

304
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,583
What ya got here?! TNT?!

305
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,333
C4?! Hand it all over!

306
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,416
You having any
of this is useless!

307
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,875
Strip, bitch! I said strip!

308
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I need an adult!

309
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,375
Deal with it.

310
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,791
You've got twenty-five
bullets and a liter of water.

311
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,541
Now get your ass
back to the truck.

312
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,541
But, uh... I don't--

313
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,750
Do what I ordered you to do!

314
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,750
Are you gonna be okay?

315
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,500
Shut up!

316
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,041
Stop concerning
yourself with how I feel.

317
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,750
Now, put a sock in it
and go back to the truck.

318
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,708
Sorry for running behind, guys!

319
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,458
How's Mitz doing?

320
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,750
Who cares?

321
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,916
I gave him a gun,
some bullets, and some water

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
then sent him packing
back to the truck.

323
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
Hey you're kinda mean!

324
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,875
Oh cram it!

325
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,500
Anyone who can't
hold their own out here

326
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,291
deserves whatever they get.

327
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,375
Is that the kind of tough
love Punk taught you?

328
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,833
Leave me alone jerk!

329
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,000
Quiet!

330
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,916
What is that in the sky?

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,666
It looks like reflected water.

332
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,541
Yeah, but in the sky?

333
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,250
I've never seen
anything like that before.

334
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,833
Sparkle in the sky make happy.

335
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,750
Hold up-- 

336
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,583
What was that?

337
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
An explosion.

338
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,583
It looked like it was
at the bottom of the crater.

339
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,916
Yeah, right where the lab is.

340
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,291
The entire facility is on fire.

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,083
Who did this?!

342
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
It looks like they
left out the other side.

343
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
They must have
that cloaking device

344
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,166
where we can't see 'em.

345
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,083
Don't let your guard down.

346
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,416
I know those parts!

347
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,208
That's one of 'em.

348
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,125
Natsuko look! It's a guardian.

349
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,500
You mean it's one
of those things you

350
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,416
and Desert Punk threw
down with in Skeleton City?

351
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,833
There's another one!

352
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,958
I don't get it.

353
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,166
Why are these
Dark Ages things here?

354
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,625
Who's using them?

355
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,958
This is starting to freak
me out, man! I'm losing it!

356
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,833
I hope I'm wrong.

357
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,083
But could these
monsters have been

358
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,583
what Kaizuka has been
researching down here?

359
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,000
That's right.

360
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,500
To fight back against the
government's robot troops,

361
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,083
we needed our own army.

362
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,750
One we could control.

363
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,000
That's crazy!

364
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,875
These things aren't worth it!

365
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,166
So, we were dragged
all the way down here

366
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,541
to guard these machines?!

367
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,083
Didn't they destroy
the world before?!

368
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,916
Do you not get it?

369
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,625
You can't fight a monster

370
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,208
if you don't have a
monster of your own.

371
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,666
We had to use these
things to survive.

372
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,958
Lots a good
they're doing us now.

373
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,208
Natsuko, watch it!

374
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,333
That's a barrel cannon!

375
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,041
Eighty-eight millimeter class!

376
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,750
Where is it coming from?!

377
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,583
There! It's coming
through the smoke!

378
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,083
No, that's the--

379
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,625
It can't be--

380
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,708
It's Fire Dragon Kong!

381
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,583
 Fire What-ing Who?

382
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
It's this badass
tank that we thought

383
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,166
we destroyed with
Punk a while back.

384
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,791
Well what's it doing here?

385
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know!

386
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,583
Uhhh, I'm out.

387
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,833
I guess Kong must have been

388
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,416
what was kicking up
all that dust earlier!

389
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,625
It wasn't a sandstorm after all!

390
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,666
Enough with the
conversation! Just run!

391
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,916
Even these guardians
from the Dark Ages

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
are no match for a blast
from that tank's cannon!

393
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,750
Oh that's hot!

394
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,166
I gotta find Kaizuka!

395
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,041
He's too important to die!!

396
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,416
Natsuko, no!

397
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,416
This whole place is gonna go up!

398
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,875
You'll die in there!

399
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,583
Natsuko, get outta there!

400
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,166
I'll save her!

401
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,875
We're going this way!

402
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,041
Natsuko! Help is on the way!

403
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,833
Natsuko?! Where are you?!

404
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,833
The floor's crumbling.

405
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,375
Where did you go, Natsuko?

406
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,666
You in here, Kosuna?!

407
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
I've had nightmares like this.

408
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,416
It looks like more ruins
from the Dark Ages.

409
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,958
Did you see where Natsuko went?

410
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,000
I got nothing.
You see what I've seen.

411
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,250
Did he just come through
that wall backwards?

412
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,791
It's a guardian!

413
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,125
Shouldn't we start running?

414
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,208
Shut up you panty-waste
let's try shooting it first!

415
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,208
You got to be kidding me!!!!!

416
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,500
How did it get
all the way in here?!

417
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,000
Aww it's the
Mosquito-bite Bandit!

418
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,625
I can't believe you're
still alive after all that.

419
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,708
I know that voice.

420
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,708
Junko! But what're
you doing on that tank?!

421
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,208
I made a promise...

422
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,125
And I am always
a woman of my word.

423
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,458
I told him I'd help
kill Old Man Kaizuka

424
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,500
and destroy every one of
his experiments down here.

425
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,875
You told who?

426
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,250
Bring it on!

427
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,750
Yeah, give it your
best shot, you bitch!

428
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,083
Who's shooting at us?

429
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,541
Where are they coming from?!

430
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,416
Everywhere!

431
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,041
They've got us surrounded!

432
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:26,208
Uh, Fuyo, I uh, I need to--

433
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,416
Not now, Haru--

434
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,625
You were right.
We are surrounded!

435
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,583
I didn't plan on dying today!

436
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,708
You didn't plan on dying?!

437
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,541
I got a girl back
home waiting on me!

438
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,041
And this time she's real.

439
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,125
So you get the picture...

440
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,291
There's no way for you
to weasel out of this,

441
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,458
so you might as well
throw down your guns.

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,375
I'm... I'm scared...

443
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,000
Not a chance.

444
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,500
Is this a little weird?

445
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,541
Those are just balloons.

446
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,583
Thanks, Kosuna.

447
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,625
Yeah, good work
seeing through her.

448
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,875
It wasn't her. It's their feet.

449
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,125
How's that?

450
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,250
They're standing on this
crappy, crumbling floor,

451
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,958
but there's no
cracks or anything.

452
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,583
Like they have no body weight.

453
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,333
I guess I taught you too well

454
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,333
for my own good, Kosuna.

455
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,708
You're the only person
who's ever been able

456
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,166
to figure out my balloon tricks.

457
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,500
I admire you for it.

458
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,541
The way every mentor
admires his pupil.

459
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,333
I know that voice!

460
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,208
He's not dead...

461
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,333
This is just the right spot...

462
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,708
To be continued on the
next and final episode!

463
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:13,958
 Yo, Desert Punk here!

464
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:14,958
I've was gone but now I'm not!

465
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:15,958
And I'm Kosuna!

466
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,125
So why'd you come back?

467
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,708
Do you even know the
title of this show?

468
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,875
Yes. And I know that this is
the last preview I'll ever do.

469
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,458
I'm the star, so I'll
do the last preview.

470
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,708
I wanna!

471
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,750
You heard her! The next
episode is the last one!

472
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,916
You'll wanna watch it!
