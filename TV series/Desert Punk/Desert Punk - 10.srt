1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,208
Ghost towns dot Kanto's
great desert landscape.

16
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,041
These villages are relics,

17
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,291
the only remnants
of ancient civilizations.

18
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,958
They contain valuable
natural resources

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,833
and priceless artifacts
that were left behind,

20
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,458
a mound of goods
as proof of life.

21
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,333
Nowadays people come
to these towns simply

22
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,750
to loot and cause destruction.

23
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,583
In an attempt to
bring some order

24
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,250
to these forgotten
outposts, each is numbered

25
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,833
in the order
they were discovered,

26
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,041
and subsequently discarded.

27
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,833
During excavations,
each ghost town is named

28
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,875
after the individual
or team that first finds it,

29
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,625
providing bragging
rights to those

30
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,041
who conquer the unknown.

31
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,750
We found one!

32
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,166
An unmapped ghost town!

33
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,958
So it was here after all.

34
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,333
Break out the booze, boys.

35
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,625
This calls for a celebration.

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,750
Check this sucker
out! It's aluminum!

37
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,000
I found titanium here!

38
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,625
This is incredible.

39
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,250
Just imagine what we'll
find below the surface!

40
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,333
Hell yeah!

41
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,875
This is virgin
territory, Kaizuka!

42
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,458
Gentlemen, we've discovered

43
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,500
the eighty-fifth
ghost town to date.

44
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,833
It had been twenty years

45
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,333
since ghost town eighty-four
had been unearthed.

46
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,375
Since then, no new
discoveries had yielded

47
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,500
so much as a fossil.

48
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,416
These three men had made

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,291
the biggest discovery
in a generation.

50
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,083
Then of course
we got shitcanned.

51
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,333
Run!

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,208
I ran for my life that day

53
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,541
and eventually passed
through the town gates.

54
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,291
The Guardian stopped
at the threshold,

55
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,166
not daring to venture
past the outer walls.

56
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
Why? I have no idea.

57
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,250
But I do know I was
lucky to have been spared.

58
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,208
From those ruins I only left

59
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,166
with my life and
a hallowed relic.

60
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,375
I had lost everything that day.

61
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,375
My two friends and
colleagues I had trusted

62
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,666
my life with for many years.

63
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,875
That was a decade ago,
but it seems like yesterday.

64
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,916
It changed me in ways
you couldn't understand.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,375
I had no idea it
was that long ago.

66
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,875
Now you said that you found
an artifact in the ruins.

67
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,291
What was it?

68
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,458
A deteriorated computer
hard drive from the Dark Ages.

69
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,958
After cleaning it
out and tinkering

70
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,250
with it for a few days,

71
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,166
I found the time-worn
Game of Living on it.

72
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,625
I knew it!

73
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,750
There were plenty
more just like it...

74
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,833
but I didn't have
time to grab them.

75
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,125
What?!

76
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,458
A room with tons of money makers

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,166
like the Game of Living.

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,041
Plenty more just like it.

79
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,500
That game alone is
worth ten million yen!

80
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,166
Time to cash in
on that stuff baby!

81
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,291
I remember that room being

82
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,333
in the basement
of the tallest tower,

83
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
but then again I may be wrong.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,291
It has been a decade
since I've been there.

85
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
Five of those years I
spent building my company

86
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,416
from the ground up and
distributing the game of Living,

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,833
the other five years
I've spent pursuing him.

88
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
Yet in those
five years I've made

89
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,166
no progress toward my goal...

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,833
I've started to believe
that killing him is impossible.

91
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,041
So all we need to do

92
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,750
is kill the Guardian
to get the treasure?!

93
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,458
I mean it's not like we
have to excavate the site.

94
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,250
We already know where
the goods are located.

95
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,208
It's so simple.

96
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,541
It's like we already have
the money in our pockets!

97
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,375
Right?

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,916
Ten million... Ten million...
ten million yen!

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,208
But doesn't that mean we'd have

100
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,166
to fight it out with
that gigantic monster?

101
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,750
You can take him, babe...

102
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,916
It shouldn't be
too hard since you're

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,541
Kanto Desert's number one.

104
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,041
You better believe
it sweetheart!

105
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,583
Just wait, I'll
tear him a new one!

106
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,333
Come on...

107
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,375
Okay then it's settled.

108
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,916
We should get started soon
but let's take a break...

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,666
My boobs are all sweaty.

110
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,458
I need to cool down first.

111
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,833
I'm gonna get
some rest over here.

112
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,916
Ahh, that's better.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,083
I despise that filthy trick.

114
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,541
No peeping allowed boys.

115
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,250
You heard what the
broad said, old man.

116
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,375
No peeping!

117
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not trying to
sneek a peek, kid...

118
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,625
I'm merely keeping track.

119
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,958
The last thing
I want is information

120
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,166
about my treasure
being leaked to the world.

121
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,041
That's some smart thinking.

122
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,291
You expect me
to buy that stool?!

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,583
You'd be smart if
you did the same thing...

124
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,833
If she betrays me the ten
million yen deal is off...

125
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,916
It's all in the contract
if you read it kid.

126
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,958
Go ahead and stew if
it makes you feel better...

127
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
As for Junko I'll handle her.

128
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,208
You two start dinner...
we need to eat soon.

129
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,666
Let's see baby cakes ...

130
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,333
Where are you? You can't hide.

131
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,625
I just don't trust that old man.

132
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,500
Master, I kinda have a
theory I want to run by you.

133
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,875
Well I have my
doubts that the old man

134
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,708
is really after the treasure.

135
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,958
Why's that?

136
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,375
He knows how
deadly the Guardian is

137
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,875
and it already
killed his friends.

138
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,375
It seems too dangerous
to go after that treasure.

139
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,833
So, what is it
you're getting at?

140
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:57,708
Well...

141
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,416
I think it could be for revenge.

142
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,333
That's a terrible theory...!

143
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,833
Who the hell would
spend five years on revenge?

144
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,791
But weren't you even
listening to him before?

145
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,541
His two closest
friends were slaughtered

146
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,000
by the Guardian and
he barely escaped himself.

147
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,458
Plus the guy is a loner.

148
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,958
I think someone
like him gets a friend

149
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,333
once every fifty
years if he's lucky.

150
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,625
I know if I were in his shoes

151
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,875
I'd want revenge
more than anything.

152
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,625
Can't you see that?

153
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,250
You've put a lot of thought
into this haven't you...?

154
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,916
Lay it out?

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,041
Seeing as I'm not going to get

156
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,250
a dime of the ten
million yen reward,

157
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,833
I'm able to be objective
about the whole thing.

158
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,958
I've noticed that
you're pretty touchy

159
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,208
when Junko is around.

160
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,875
I get the feeling
you don't like her.

161
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,000
No crap.

162
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,833
Jealous much?

163
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,541
I can not believe
you just said that...!

164
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,291
What do you take me for...?

165
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,625
That may be the stupidest
thing you've ever said!

166
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,041
I can't stand how women like her

167
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,541
can use a couple
hanging lumps of flab

168
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,041
to get what they want.

169
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
She has no redeeming qualities
other than her bra size.

170
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,750
It's so stupid.
I hate girls like that!

171
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,666
You brat.

172
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,083
What the...

173
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,250
It has started.

174
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,166
Look at all of them.

175
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,416
Are they pirates or something?

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,333
This all feels off.

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,833
The Guardian!

178
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,416
Hey, Master! Look who it is!

179
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,708
That, scag...
That two timing scag!

180
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,291
Junko? I was wondering
where she ran off to.

181
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,666
What's she doing down there?

182
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
I thought she was with us?

183
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,916
Betrayal's all she knows.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,333
She's been pullin this
job on us for a while.

185
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,541
I bet some rival interest
hired her when they heard

186
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,041
the legendary treasure
hunter was up to something.

187
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,333
That skank will pay!

188
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,833
This is it...!

189
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,000
The first new discovery in
this desert in over thirty years

190
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,166
and she's trying to
steal it for herself...

191
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,333
but there ain't no way
I'm gonna let that happen!

192
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,791
What a load of crap.

193
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,958
I'm going to tear her to shreds.

194
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,791
I'm watching you old man.

195
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,375
What are we going to do?

196
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,166
Let the Guardian take
care of the soldiers

197
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,750
while we swipe the goods.

198
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,375
Nice, chief.

199
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,625
That kid. I thought
he looked familiar.

200
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,208
It's those eyes of his.

201
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,541
Like a glint of light off
the steel of a sharp knife.

202
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,208
Part of me doesn't
want to trust him,

203
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,791
but perhaps that's just
what is necessary to slay

204
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,375
the vicious and
merciless Guardian.

205
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,458
What is that? A monster?

206
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,750
He's fast!

207
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,083
Everybody, fall back!

208
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,916
Keep holding him back!

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
I need more time!

210
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,083
I've got you now.

211
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,958
Did we get him?

212
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,041
I couldn't have asked for
a more perfect diversion...

213
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
Whoa that's the...

214
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,833
Hold up.

215
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,708
Huh?!

216
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,041
Hand it over Sluts McBoob!

217
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,791
Sorry but I'm no
slut little girl.

218
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,458
And this artifact
here is nothing.

219
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,958
There's plenty
more where it came from.

220
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,333
So why don't
you calm down and--

221
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,166
Shut up traitor!

222
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,750
You have a lot to learn kiddo.

223
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,458
It was clearly
written in my contract

224
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,333
that I could leave
at any time I wanted,

225
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,791
and I chose to
exercise that option.

226
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
Whatever.

227
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,500
If I said I
wouldn't hand it over

228
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,666
what would you do...? Shoot me?

229
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,750
I don't think you
have what it takes Kosuna...

230
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
Trust me you're gonna
need a certain level

231
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,666
of consciousness in order
to kill me in cold blood,

232
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,458
do this and you're finished.

233
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,541
You're such a cutie pie.

234
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,375
There you happy?!
Now hand it over!

235
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,708
If you want it you'll
have to come and get it.

236
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,833
Give it to me before I
pop those balloons of yours!

237
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,833
Not gonna happen.

238
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,125
This game is over kid!

239
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,625
You should never
throw down your weapon,

240
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,958
no matter what
someone says to you.

241
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,625
Does it hurt? Too bad kid...

242
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,375
I'm willing to do
whatever I have to do

243
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,541
to complete my objectives.

244
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,875
Some advice...

245
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,958
Unnecessary thoughts
will get you killed.

246
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,708
You can consider us
even now doll... Ciao!

247
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,708
You are one
pathetic apprentice.

248
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,375
Crap.

249
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,958
Looks like he finally
managed to kill them all.

250
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,583
With enough cold
hard cash anyone

251
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,541
can buy all kinds of help.

252
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,375
Yet that old
man took five years.

253
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,666
Of course it wasn't for revenge.

254
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,791
I didn't quite get it
at first, but I see it now.

255
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
Hey, you over there!

256
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,458
What are you fighting for?

257
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,958
Do you even remember?

258
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,916
There's no one left to
appreciate your abilities

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
and order you around.

260
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,708
Now come get it!

261
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,708
You're an amazing specimen!

262
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,791
I have to hand it to you,

263
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,750
you're really something else.

264
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,375
But this is the end!

265
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,666
Damn, I thought for sure
we'd get him this time...

266
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,791
I better not have to
wait another five years.

267
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
That won't be necessary.

268
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,791
You're still alive.

269
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,000
Huh, but I see you're
without the treasure,

270
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,458
so I guess that
means you failed.

271
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,750
Give me a break old man.

272
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,500
This was your
objective all along right?

273
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,250
There's no need to be afraid.

274
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,916
He's dead as a doornail.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,458
Uh, you serious...?

276
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you absolutely
positive he's dead?

277
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,250
Of course I am.
I got him good, see?

278
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,916
I guess you could say
I dealt the final blow.

279
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,375
Do you have any idea,

280
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,041
what it is you're sitting on?

281
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,500
Ah, well, kind of.

282
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,583
Kind of huh?

283
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,000
And you figured
this was more valuable

284
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
than the treasures found
in the ruin's basement...

285
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,833
Did you really believe
that I would want this

286
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,208
before a lifetime of wealth?

287
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,083
What, am I wrong?

288
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,125
You really are a spiteful kid...

289
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,875
I bet you don't
have many friends do you?

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,625
I have business associates!

291
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,291
I'm not kidding.

292
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,958
As a freelance
mercenary you hear

293
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,541
all kinds of
rumors and old stories.

294
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,875
For instance, toward
the end of the Dark Ages,

295
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,041
instead of using
humans to fight wars,

296
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,250
soldiers were manufactured.

297
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,958
Each one of these
soldiers had the strength

298
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,083
of one hundred men
and their dominance

299
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,000
eventually lead to
the demise of civilization.

300
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,041
Now I don't know
how true that story was,

301
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,416
but when I saw the
Guardian fighting that army,

302
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I thought the other
treasures paled in comparison.

303
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,000
Defeating one of his
kind wasn't too difficult,

304
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,625
most of his
tactics were textbook,

305
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,458
but I can only imagine
the destructive force

306
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,625
an entire squad
of them could have...

307
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,250
Now be honest with me old man.

308
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,458
You've spent the last five years
testing the Guardian, right...?

309
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,500
To see if there's a
market for this nowadays.

310
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,291
In the last five years

311
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,166
I've worked in
complete secrecy...

312
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,958
Not even my son or my company

313
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,916
knew what I was doing ...

314
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,083
Look kid...

315
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,708
Just look at him...

316
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,958
Battered by the sun
and sand and even able

317
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,541
to endure the heat
from his own blasts,

318
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,541
he has survived the
last decade on his own.

319
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,208
His clothes are burnt
and stuck to his body.

320
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,208
His armor pitted
from countless gun battles.

321
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,916
All this without
any maintenance.

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,625
No repairs. He's
a perfect machine.

323
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,791
Add in that he
was most likely inactive

324
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
for hundreds of years
so he probably wasn't

325
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,125
even operating at
one hundred percent.

326
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,333
And still he managed

327
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,708
to display shocking
abilities at fighting.

328
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,708
His capacity for
growth is endless.

329
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,583
And the money to
be made. Boundless.

330
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,583
Scary.

331
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,833
That's right, kid.

332
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm talking about you.

333
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,000
For the last
five years you've been

334
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,875
stringing along people
like me to battle him.

335
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,375
Getting others to
do your dirty work.

336
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,250
How many men have
died doing this...?

337
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,125
Tell me.

338
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,750
It's a small price to pay.

339
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,333
Think about the money here.

340
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,875
You know the world we live in.

341
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,416
What group wouldn't want
an army at their disposal?

342
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,666
They'll pay out the wazoo!

343
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,875
Oh hell's yeah!

344
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,083
That's awesome!

345
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,166
No unnecessary thoughts.

346
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,708
No unnecessary thoughts.

347
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,458
No unnecessary thoughts.

348
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,583
No unnecessary thoughts.

349
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,541
Watch where you're
shooting that thing!

350
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,958
No unnecessary thoughts.

351
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,000
No unnecessary thoughts.

352
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,958
Persistent little brat!

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,791
No unnecessary thoughts!

354
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,791
Damn.

355
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,833
Don't move.

356
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,000
You're pretty good kid.

357
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,583
So, why didn't you kill me?

358
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,333
Because there's no need to.

359
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,125
We're even now.
Take off your clothes.

360
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,583
I'm taking you to my master.

361
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,333
I lost! I lost!
And to a kid! Dammit!

362
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,625
I'm such an idiot!

363
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,083
I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

364
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,833
You annoying little piss-ant.

365
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,916
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,041
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,666
I understand.

368
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,541
I said strip.

369
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,291
Wow!

370
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,708
Evening boys!

371
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,125
I wasn't sure where
she hid her weapons

372
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,083
so I just had her
strip down for you Master.

373
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:54,583
Well well, what do we
have here, a nice little...

374
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,083
Damn you Junko!

375
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,666
You filthy traitor!

376
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,916
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry!

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,375
Excellent work Kosuna...

378
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,541
You've finally proved yourself

379
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,000
to be a worthy student.

380
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,416
Thanks.

381
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,166
All I had to do was avoid
unnecessary thoughts sir.

382
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,916
And you did well.

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,208
Now then.

384
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,458
That robot I killed
will be worth millions

385
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,041
but it's a threat to
the Oasis Governments...

386
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,458
I can assure you if
they find out about this

387
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,416
it will be the
end of your company...

388
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
They would go out of
their way to silence each

389
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,083
and every one of us
for what we've seen here.

390
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,583
If we make it
look like an accident

391
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,833
and kill you right now,

392
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,375
then at least the
rest of us will be spared.

393
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,125
That way, we could
at least recoup our costs.

394
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,166
If you were planning
to do this all along

395
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,291
I don't see the point
in killing the Guardian.

396
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,916
Why must we both die in the end?

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,541
A job's a job...

398
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,250
Besides it's no fun,

399
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,083
if I can't collect
on the ten million yen.

400
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,625
You're not going to kill me.

401
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,875
Maybe not now.

402
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,375
But we'll see
what happens if you come

403
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,750
after me down the
line wanting your money...

404
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,833
Believe it or not there are

405
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,208
plenty of people
that want me dead.

406
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,166
If you come after
me I won't hold back

407
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,291
against you or
your robot army...

408
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,333
However you should
know that I have never,

409
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,875
in my life broken a
confidentiality agreement

410
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,916
in my contract.

411
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,083
And I've never snitched

412
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,583
under any
circumstances, even torture.

413
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,750
Not that I expect the
most legendary treasure hunter

414
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,875
in all of Kanto to believe
a scumbag mercenary like me.

415
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,083
But I'm a professional

416
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,833
and that's what
keeps me in business.

417
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

418
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:18,791
Question!

419
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,541
Go ahead, kiddo.

420
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,125
You plan on making
lots of these robots

421
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,458
and selling them right?

422
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,458
Precisely.

423
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,666
But, I heard that those robots

424
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,333
were the cause for
the last civilization

425
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,875
almost going extinct.

426
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,583
So what are you getting at?

427
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,958
Well after you make
your millions selling them

428
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,958
what if the robots really
do bring mankind to extinction.

429
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,250
Is it worth the risk?

430
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,541
If that's all it takes to wipe

431
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,625
the human race off
this planet then the sooner

432
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,500
it happens, the less
suffering there will be.

433
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,750
You're nuts.

434
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,625
After the demise
of the Dark Ages

435
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,083
treasure hunters like
myself began venturing into

436
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,500
this hellish desert to
find a better way of life,

437
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,500
or at least something
worth living for.

438
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,250
As years progressed
and more wealth

439
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,208
was unearthed people
began to flock here,

440
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,333
wells were dug and
towns starting forming.

441
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,291
Eventually it
grew into some oases.

442
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,750
That's why the Oasis Government,

443
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,875
which are just a bunch
of Johnny-come-lately's

444
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,708
who profess false safety
for this land, collect taxes

445
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,583
and make the rules
to suit their own needs.

446
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,208
They couldn't care
less about the people.

447
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,291
As long as they turn
a profit, anything goes.

448
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,041
I hate them for that.

449
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,500
So your plan all along was

450
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,500
to bring down the governments?

451
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,583
Just give me another ten years.

452
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,916
This desert will
look completely different.

453
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,791
We'll see...

454
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,208
Hey you're still going to pay me

455
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,666
to keep my mouth shut right?

456
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,666
Listen good, kiddo!

457
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,833
'Kay!

458
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,500
You'll be getting
ten million yen as well.

459
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,333
You did your part to earn it

460
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,250
so I'm giving you Junko's share.

461
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,000
You deserve it, kid.
You did a great job.

462
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,083
Oh come on!

463
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,500
Shut up prisoner
no talkie talkie...

464
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,833
Just be happy
we didn't leave you

465
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,416
in a ditch for
the vultures okay?

466
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,250
You mean you're
not going to kill her?

467
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,041
What would I do
with a dead chick?

468
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,791
But she sided with the enemy!

469
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,541
You can't let her
get away with that!

470
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,041
Kanta... If you're
still alive in ten years

471
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,208
why don't you look
me up...? I'll hire you.

472
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,458
I don't know...

473
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,958
By then who's to say
you won't be my enemy?

474
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,291
That kid.

475
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,208
I admire that
steely look in his eyes.

476
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,875
He's a tough
one that's for sure.

477
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,041
It's the same thing I used

478
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,625
to see in the mirror
when I was his age.

479
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,875
And with that
yet another nightmare

480
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,000
from the Dark Ages
made a step closer

481
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,583
to reviving itself.

482
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:43,041
Do these idiots
ever learn? Come on!

483
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:04,333
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

484
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,416
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

485
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,291
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

486
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,541
It's actually a cape.

487
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:18,250
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

488
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,666
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

489
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,750
His heart is black.

490
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,541
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

491
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:32,500
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

492
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,041
<i>He's on the run again</i>

493
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,041
On the run again.

494
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,916
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,041
He's got a job.

496
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,833
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

497
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,166
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

498
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,041
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

499
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,041
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

500
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,625
<i>It's what you do</i>

501
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,875
Yo! Desert Punk here.

502
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,708
Looks like I'm finally going
to get to juggle some gigglers!

503
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,791
Congrat's kid!

504
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,750
Hey, get your
hands off me you perv!

505
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,416
I'm not even sure
we can broadcast this!

506
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,583
Ah screw it!

507
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,125
Next episode,
"Compromising Positions!"

508
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,583
If you miss it,
Punk'll squeeze your nips!

509
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,291
Oww.
