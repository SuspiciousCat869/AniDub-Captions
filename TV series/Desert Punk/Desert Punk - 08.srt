1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,291
Legend speaks of a woman

16
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,625
who had observed man
from the dawn of civilization

17
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,250
all the way through to his
inevitable self-destruction.

18
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,416
She had rejected
him at every turn,

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,583
preferring to preserve
her own kind first.

20
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:11,000
Preferring survival
over what man had to offer.

21
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,916
Even in this age of the Great
Kanto Desert, she watches.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,541
And she's still not
letting anything slip.

23
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,083
Calm down, it's just a rock.

24
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,875
It's not just an ordinary
rock, it's the inumeiwa...

25
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,333
That means dog, female, and
rock, which sounds harmless...

26
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,708
But the thing's as
cursed as King Tut's tomb.

27
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,000
Who's King Tut?

28
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,625
Oh, you're a moron.

29
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,500
The story goes, if you
try to move the inumeiwa rock,

30
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,458
you'll be cursed
by the Dogwoman.

31
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,875
Not far from the rock
there was a stretch of road...

32
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,791
I heard they were gonna
extend it that direction,

33
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,291
so I found that land,

34
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,750
and I bought it cheaper
than a used hooker...

35
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,166
I knew it was
too good to be true.

36
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,291
That kinda deal always is.

37
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,291
Yeah...

38
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,791
I knew I had to move that rock,

39
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,666
but every contractor I asked
slammed the door in my face.

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,958
It's liked
they were all scared.

41
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,541
I didn't know where to turn.

42
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,791
Desert people
are all superstitious.

43
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,625
Black cats, broken
mirrors. That kinda thing.

44
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,041
I figured that out.

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,583
So I went and hired the biggest,

46
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,833
nastiest oaf my money could buy.

47
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,375
What curse is he talking about?

48
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,666
The only curse here is the one

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,041
that I'm gonna throw
down on this stone bitch!

50
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,250
You tell her, brutha!

51
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,375
Hold on to your pantyhose!

52
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,708
Show that biatch why you're

53
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,250
the strongest in
the Western Oasis!

54
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,833
My brother...! I killed him!

55
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,833
It's... It's
not going to get me.

56
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,250
I can do this.

57
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,958
Just break the rock and
we get a new home to live in.

58
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,625
Just swing already, would you?!

59
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,541
When can we eat? I'm hungry.

60
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,083
Here goes...

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,375
My back ...

62
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,958
Honey! Are you okay?!

63
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,375
It was the curse...

64
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,041
I wanna go home!

65
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,916
No pathetic piece of stone can

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,708
defeat this--
My behemoth supertank!

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,000
Feel the shock and
awesomeness of my Kasumi II!

68
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,125
What the hell?!

69
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,666
Not the engine again!

70
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,500
It's... the... curse.

71
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,375
And I've hired dozens
that I haven't told you about.

72
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,666
Every last one of them failed

73
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,125
or buckled under the fear.

74
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,666
So what do you
want me to do about it?

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,416
Help me!

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,875
You're the desert's go-to man.

77
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,291
You head up the Handyman Guild.

78
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,791
You're my last resort...

79
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,125
I need that rock...
I need it obliterated!

80
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,166
Consider it done!

81
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,875
Just take a breath mint!

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,125
The inumeiwa rock?!

83
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,416
Yeah, but he's
willing to shell out

84
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,166
five hundred grand per person.

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,416
That's a ton of cash.

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Balls no!

87
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,333
Uh...

88
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,375
Did you just say "balls no"?

89
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,250
Damn right.

90
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,416
The machinegun brothers don't

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,291
take on crapcrazy
jobs like that.

92
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,666
Yeah, it's not that
we're scared or anything.

93
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,833
Right. We just got,
uh, other things, to do.

94
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,166
Yeah. Other things.

95
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,291
Inumeiwa?!

96
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,250
What's the big deal?
I just need it moved.

97
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,208
My war wound's acting up!

98
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,500
Did you say the inumeiwa?

99
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,041
Yeah, it pays
five hundred thousand--

100
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,500
No, money don't mean nothin'

101
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,000
after the dogwoman
rips your balls off.

102
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,791
And believe me, my balls

103
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,708
have a lot of
work ahead of them.

104
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,875
Inumeiwa?!

105
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,583
Nooo!

106
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,333
Don't even mention
that cursed word around me!

107
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,333
Hmm.

108
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,291
You want me to remove
the inumeiwa rock, huh?

109
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,041
Please help me out
on this one Desert Punk.

110
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,458
It'll be worth your time.

111
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,875
But that thing is cursed!

112
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,166
It's where men and women
and children meet their doom!

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,458
But... it's just a big rock.

114
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,416
Great! That means you'll do it?

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Gimme a break. It's
a little removal job.

116
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,500
They got grunts
for that kinda work.

117
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,750
Yeah, but all of those grunts

118
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,708
have already
chickened out on me.

119
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,958
What a bunch of pussies!

120
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,458
And...?

121
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,375
Don't forget about
your current situation.

122
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,333
Your reputation has
taken one hell of a hit,

123
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,333
but today that changes...

124
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,833
You're not washed up...

125
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,166
Go out there and prove
that Desert Punk's back...

126
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,083
The Demon of the
Desert rises again,

127
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,625
and he's not just
the best mercenary

128
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,083
in the Western Oasis,
he's the best mercenary

129
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,083
in the whole freakin desert!

130
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,125
In the whole freakin desert...

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,583
Trust me...

132
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,333
Only the Desert
Punk could swoop in

133
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,750
and pull off a
job of this magnitude.

134
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,125
That so?

135
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,291
We've seen that no ordinary
mercenary could do it...

136
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,583
But there is nothing ordinary
about you, Desert Punk.

137
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,541
Yeah, you're right...

138
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,083
this job should
be a flipping breeze

139
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,708
for someone with
my superior skills!

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,458
The curse!

141
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,375
It's already
started to take hold!

142
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,958
There's no such
thing as a curse!

143
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,166
Bartender...!
You chair is a piece of junk!

144
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,166
The complaint
box is by the door.

145
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,458
No...! It's the curse...

146
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,833
The curse of Inumeiwa!

147
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:02,916
What?!

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,875
What do you mean?

149
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,916
Why are you hanging back?

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,791
Still scared?

151
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,083
Course. Aren't you?

152
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,583
You'd be stupid not to be.

153
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,000
Then I'm stupid.

154
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,041
It's a mystical statue
created thousands of years ago,

155
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,416
during the age of darkness.

156
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
It's been cursed since

157
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,708
before man first
considered moving it.

158
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,000
So what?

159
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,541
It's so jinxed that no
one has ever budged it!

160
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,333
Not a single freakin'
person since the dawn of time!

161
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,416
Ha! Well, I ain't
just anyone, sister.

162
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,708
Try to remember who I am.

163
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,125
You can't lump me in
with all of those losers.

164
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,041
Thank you.

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,708
That son of a bitch.

166
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,791
Did he just call us losers?

167
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,875
Uh... I don't think
he meant us specifically.

168
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,583
I hope he doesn't hurt us...

169
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,666
Shut up!

170
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,916
If he actually
moves that damn stone,

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,208
we're gonna
look like jackasses,

172
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,708
and he'll rise above
it all as some kind

173
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
of hero they sing songs about.

174
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
You think we'll
ever live that down?

175
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,250
Pull it together, man!

176
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,041
Sorry about that,
I just get a little spooked.

177
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,541
We're taking a shortcut.

178
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,666
Right.

179
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,875
It's the curse,
the friggin' curse!

180
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,958
I can feel it!

181
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,416
There's no such thing.

182
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,750
Only babies believe that crap.

183
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,166
Is this an earthquake?

184
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,666
I hope not.

185
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,166
Where the hell is
that noise coming from?

186
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,625
That didn't feel too good.

187
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,083
The curse! The curse!
It almost killed us!

188
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,291
How many times do
I have to say this?

189
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,916
There is no curse!

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,166
Bad stuff is gonna
happen no matter what.

191
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
And every time it does,
you blame it on the curse

192
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,666
because that's all
you can think about!

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,166
If you keep
focusing on the negative,

194
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,541
that's all we'll get.

195
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,166
Look. You see the valley?

196
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,375
This place is
known for rockslides.

197
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,875
If you never heard of the curse

198
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,250
and you walked
through this place,

199
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,375
you still might get hit
by some of the falling crap.

200
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,666
Or you might not.
It's just a luck of the draw.

201
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,458
Do you get what I'm saying?

202
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,583
Do you?

203
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
Whatever. Let's keep moving.

204
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,708
All right, but I still
say this place is weird.

205
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,750
I was right! It's the curse!

206
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,833
There's no
stupid freakin' curse!

207
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,500
At least tell me
that you're kinda concerned

208
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,875
about the curse, chief.

209
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,083
Huh?

210
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,083
I'd feel a lot
better about being out here

211
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,458
if I just knew you
took the curse seriously.

212
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,416
Well I don't. It's
all a giant load of...

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,625
Dammit, man.

214
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,791
I just paid good money

215
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,500
to have this piece
of junk A/C unit fixed!

216
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,958
That dude replaced
all the busted parts!

217
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,500
Master!

218
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm gonna find that repairman,

219
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,500
take every part
he fixed, pop them out,

220
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,791
and shove them
so far up his ass,

221
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,458
I'll air condition his brain!

222
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,916
Master! It's the
curse, you're gonna die!

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,583
Shut up already
and open your eyes!

224
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,791
It's not the curse!
It's a sandhole!

225
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:00,875
Ooh...

226
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:01,666
What is it?

227
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,791
My stomach is killing me.

228
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
Can I help?

229
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,708
That smells like death!

230
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,416
I just ate some
bad Thai food is all,

231
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,416
so don't tell me I'm cursed!

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,958
Master, you know what...

233
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,666
Not the curse,
it's not the curse.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,666
I know it isn't.

235
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,708
I didn't even say anything.

236
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,666
Then what are you getting at?

237
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,291
Inumeiwa is
supposed to mean dog

238
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,291
and woman or dogwoman right?

239
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,166
Something like that.

240
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,875
I'm just wondering
exactly what a dogwoman is.

241
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,166
I don't know!

242
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,000
But oh, oh, since
they call her dogwoman,

243
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,541
she probably looks like a...

244
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,041
Like what?

245
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, that's about it.

246
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,791
Ruff!

247
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,791
Mine is, I think,
quite a lot hotter than yours!

248
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,416
No...! It's not the curse...!

249
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,750
Now get off my case, shortstack!

250
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,416
You're trying
to convince yourself.

251
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,833
Nah ah!

252
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,250
Let's get a move on...!

253
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,041
With the A/C's
busted I don't wanna

254
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,708
be out here
longer than I have to.

255
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,458
Kosuna, let go of me!

256
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,208
You're acting like a scared kid!

257
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,333
What's your problem?!

258
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
I'll tell you
what your problem is.

259
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,208
They're everywhere.

260
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,750
All these signs
telling us to stay away.

261
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,125
Get your ass goin! Come on!

262
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,208
If you don't let go of me,

263
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,166
I'm gonna beat you
like a snare drum!

264
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,583
Well, we made it.

265
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,416
Ready to head on back now?

266
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,041
The inumeiwa rock...

267
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,708
It's nothing but a dressed
up piece of stone; look at it.

268
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,166
Stop saying stuff like that,

269
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,958
you're gonna
really piss her off!

270
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,500
Rock wearing a skirt.

271
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,583
You don't see that every day.

272
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,041
I never saw a
sandstorm blowing in!

273
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,333
It's... the... dogwoman!

274
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,791
Let's get it on!

275
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,208
What a surprise,
all the way out here.

276
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,791
The dogwoman...
looks like a dude.

277
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,000
I am a dude!

278
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,375
So, what's the
famous Rain Spider

279
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,791
doing on another
job I've been hired for?

280
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,458
Rain Spider? I've heard of you!

281
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,458
You're the collector
that roams the desert taking

282
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,916
not only the money from
men but their very souls!

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,833
And then you freakin' eat 'em!

284
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,583
From what I
understand, he'd rather

285
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,625
have a burger
and a beer like me.

286
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,416
Wow... Who'da
thought Desert Punk

287
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,833
and Rain Spider were friends.

288
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,708
We're not friends!

289
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,250
I guess after that hit

290
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,083
to your reputation
you had recently...

291
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,333
you've really felt the
need to get back on the horse.

292
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,708
You know, prove
that you don't suck

293
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,416
as much as everyone thinks.

294
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,916
I think you've had
more disasters than me.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,750
Plus, you got yourself
a cute new assistant with

296
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,208
pretty pink hair.

297
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,916
Pink hair.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,583
I know that went out of
style in like 1997 or so,

299
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,875
but kudos to her for sticking
with something outdated.

300
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,125
Whoa... Did you hear...?

301
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,333
He said I was cute

302
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,291
and he really likes
my awesome hairstyle!

303
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:30,916
Thank you!

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,791
Shut up!

305
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,375
Cut the crap. Why are you here?

306
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,291
The scenery.

307
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,916
Enough jokes. Why?!

308
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,208
I thought you would
have figured it out.

309
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,708
I'm going to
destroy the inumeiwa

310
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,708
before you get a chance.

311
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,250
Don't hate me.

312
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,291
Wait why?

313
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,541
Good ol' Ray
hired me the same time

314
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,541
he hired Mugenya
and a dozen others.

315
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,583
How can you blame me?

316
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,458
This is just business.

317
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,666
Ass clown!

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,958
What the hell?

319
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,291
This piece of
crap always jams...

320
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,333
Do you see that master...?

321
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,208
Everything's
being covered in mist!

322
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,500
That's not exactly what I see.

323
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,208
There's a party in my pants

324
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,208
and everyone's coming!

325
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,416
You shoot at me
again, and I'll kill you!

326
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,166
Why do I have to see this?

327
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,208
It's the curse!
It's tearing him up!

328
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,666
Possibly... but I don't think

329
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,666
he's putting up
too much of a fight.

330
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,541
But you did see it,
didn't you master...?

331
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,333
The creepy white mist
floating out from the rock?

332
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,333
You're delirious.
I didn't see anything.

333
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,416
But that's not
what should worry you.

334
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,416
We almost lost half a
million to this doorknob...

335
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
That's too close of a call
for us to make as a team...

336
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,291
From this point on,
we have to be more careful.

337
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,166
Your call, are we gonna
set a charge on that rock,

338
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,833
or shoot it from the ridge?

339
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,750
No...! No...! No...! No!

340
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,041
Shut your pie hole, kid,

341
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,291
and get that grenade
launcher out and ready!

342
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,000
Fine...! I'll take it then!

343
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,041
Please no!

344
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,958
Yeah, well,
I don't speak coward!

345
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,916
Did you say "coward"?

346
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,375
When did you get here?

347
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,958
We've been here the whole time.

348
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,500
And the three of
us aren't cowards!

349
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,750
Got it?!

350
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,000
No way I'm letting
you take my score!

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,958
Wow...! That...
looked like it hurt.

352
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:29,916
I... I failed... I hope
my sister can forgive me.

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,083
She must... It's not our fault.

354
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,291
It is the curse...
of the dogwoman,

355
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,833
No...! Please, let's go home!

356
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:45,708
Stop the madness!

357
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,000
Houston, we have a problem!

358
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,208
Let's bail!

359
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,875
Even the Machinegun
Brothers were chewed up

360
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
and spit out!

361
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,625
Which I'm so comfortable with,

362
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll use it to
keep me warm tonight.

363
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,250
When I destroy that big rock...

364
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,708
the whole world will
know just how much I rock.

365
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,541
And how totally sweet
it is to be Desert Punk...

366
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,125
Then the next stop
is Sweater Puppy Station!

367
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,958
You're sounding crazy!

368
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,083
Why'd it get so
onim-om-uh, scary?

369
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,958
There wasn't a cloud in
the sky five seconds ago!

370
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,458
What's happening?!

371
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,625
That freakin' hurt...

372
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,916
Dogwoman you bitch-let!

373
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,166
Master, where are you?! Master!

374
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,666
That's the same
white mist I saw earlier!

375
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,250
Master, wake up!

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What the hell
just happened...?

377
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,291
Huh...? I, feel
so squishy inside.

378
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,583
Lady, you're giving doggystyle

379
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,166
a whole new meaning!

380
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
You're smoking like a cigar!

381
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,083
Oh and look, you
brought your friends!

382
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,208
I don't like this.

383
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,833
It's like something's sucking
the oxygen out of the air...

384
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,416
And if that
thing keeps sucking,

385
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,000
then I'm gonna
end up pulled in, too!

386
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,708
That black blob!

387
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,250
It's master's plasma libido!

388
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,666
Please, try a little more.

389
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,958
'Kay.

390
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,208
Oh yeah! Sweet!

391
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,166
Course, I'd be drinking
anything you poured,

392
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,166
you filthy, stinkin' dog, you.

393
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,416
I'm pleased to meet your
standard of approval, Master.

394
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,416
Let's give the
mammary wagon a test drive.

395
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,750
No... Not yet.

396
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,833
You know you
want the sausage, baby!

397
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,291
This is so not right.

398
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,916
His superhuman manly desires

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
are actually
fighting the dogwoman!

400
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,458
He's an animal!

401
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
The libido plasma...

402
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,583
It's all sludgy
and black, like mud...

403
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,041
And that god awful
smell, it's like--

404
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,500
Nasty! Get it off!

405
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,500
Stop drop and roll!

406
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,666
If you really, really want me,

407
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,791
then you have to
try and catch me!

408
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,666
Are you putting me up

409
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,875
to a challenge, Ms. Dogwoman?

410
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,750
It's a battle between
hatred and desire...

411
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,541
It's hell... It's hell...

412
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,625
right here in
our desert it's hell!

413
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,041
There's no escaping
me now, pumpkin pie!

414
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,000
Time for me to eat you!

415
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Yeah, about that...

416
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,083
I'll make you my trophy.

417
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,833
I love it when you howl!

418
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,791
Can't believe I'm alive...

419
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,833
But where did master go?

420
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,833
Oh my... You are
a sick, sick bastard!

421
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,416
Sorry, that happens
sometimes when I dream.

422
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,291
I guess I slept
through it. What did I miss?

423
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,583
A dream?

424
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,041
Was he just dreaming
everything that happened?

425
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,333
Would you look at
that beautiful sight there.

426
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,041
What the crap?!
The Inumeiwa Rock!

427
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,791
Looks like that
huge desert storm

428
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,625
knocked it all to pieces.

429
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,833
Speaking of
knocked to pieces...!

430
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,166
That's what getting
scared'll do to you boys...!

431
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
Right?!

432
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,666
I guess Desert Punk
has regained his title

433
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,458
of baddest stack of awesome
to walk these desert sands!

434
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,166
What are you waiting on, kid?

435
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
Let's get the hell
outta here and go collect.

436
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,166
You got it!

437
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,250
I wanna hurry up.

438
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,500
We got a sweet
half-million yen payday

439
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,750
waiting for us as we speak.

440
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,708
After that, all of the stories
about inumeiwa dried up,

441
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,708
like the desert itself.

442
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,000
But another rumor was birthed.

443
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,750
One about the man who eradicated

444
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,000
the curse of
the desert dogwoman.

445
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,750
The fame of Desert Punk
began to spread again,

446
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,291
and things got back to normal.

447
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,041
Which meant women
and drinking, of course.

448
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,625
But if that whole
scene that I saw back there

449
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,791
was something other
than a freaked out dream,

450
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,416
I swear, I might
just lose my damn mind.

451
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,375
I don't know if
I can handle that.

452
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,250
Well... Are you coming or not?!

453
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,791
Cripes, I don't know
what I've been thinking.

454
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,625
Desert Punk himself
is more dangerous

455
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,583
than some dumb curse.

456
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,250
But there's one
way in this desert,

457
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,083
and that's follow and learn.

458
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,291
I'll stick with him for
as long as he'll have me,

459
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,416
then I'll be on my own.

460
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,875
We'll see how
dangerous he is then.

461
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:04,916
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

463
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,875
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

464
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,125
It's actually a cape.

465
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:18,833
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

466
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,250
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

467
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,333
His heart is black.

468
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,125
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

469
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:33,083
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

470
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,625
<i>He's on the run again</i>

471
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,625
On the run again.

472
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

473
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
He's got a job.

474
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

475
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,750
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

476
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,625
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

477
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,625
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

478
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,208
<i>It's what you do</i>

479
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,166
Yo! Desert Punk here with a
serious question for you all.

480
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,916
How was Ray's
performance this episode?

481
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,791
Sucked.

482
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,208
I'll give you something to suck.

483
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,708
