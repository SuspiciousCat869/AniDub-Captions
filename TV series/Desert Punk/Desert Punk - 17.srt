1
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,583
Give it up, girly.

2
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,791
You don't have a chance
in hell of escaping me.

3
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,291
If we're done, I think Kosuna

4
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,708
and I will be heading back now.

5
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,791
I can't thank you enough

6
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,208
for all the hard
work you've put in...

7
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,250
You've done a great job

8
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,416
at earning that
reputation of yours.

9
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,791
I do what I can.

10
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,416
All the violence helps.

11
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
And somewhere along the

12
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,583
way you've managed to train a
damn good apprentice as well...

13
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,125
You should be quite proud
of yourself young Kosuna.

14
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,500
Oh, no. It was nothing.

15
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,791
I just watched over
Mitz most of the time.

16
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,750
It's about time she got into
guys who're more her own age.

17
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:25,041
It's about time you got
into guy's your own age.

18
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,250
Mitz, why you hiding
behind your dad?

19
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,041
You a little fairy now cause
you got babysat by a girl?

20
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,125
Oh I get it now!
Mitzy's gotta crush!

21
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,208
Nanny nanny boo boo!

22
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,125
I'd stop picking on him,
if I were you.

23
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,625
Remember last time...?

24
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,750
When you had to re-learn
how to pee standing up?

25
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,625
Yeah ... Uhhh... Yeah.

26
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,166
That sucked.
Don't wanna go there again.

27
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,875
We should do this
more often. Stay in touch.

28
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,125
Yeah, see ya.

29
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,625
And I'm paying for
dinner next time. I'm not.

30
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,791
That was so unreal!

31
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,250
I had no idea that
you had a master, too!

32
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,416
We all learn how
to shit from someone.

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,541
Anyone who says otherwise
is a friggin' liar.

34
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,958
And probably out to get you.

35
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,500
What I'm saying
is that your master

36
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,750
doesn't seem like he taught you.

37
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,333
He's so nice and... unassuming.

38
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,750
What have I told you
about big words?

39
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,250
They have no use in the
desert, I know. Sorry.

40
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,666
With Koid, what you
see is what you get.

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,666
He's a nice guy.

42
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,833
Yeah... He is.

43
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,375
Help!

44
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,208
Oh, those luxurious milk motels!

45
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,000
Bags that big can
only belong to Junko!

46
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,458
Let's say 'hi' with a squeeze!

47
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,958
Why can't you ever
recognize me by my face?

48
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,458
Probably cause the
ugly gets in the way.

49
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,625
I can't believe I found you!

50
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,666
What?

51
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,750
I went looking
for you in some town

52
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,333
and they said you
were out on a job.

53
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,750
I came as fast as I could.

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,333
I was so worried that
I couldn't find you, but I did!

55
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,500
This is a lifesaver!

56
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
What kind of a loser
do you think I am?!

57
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,166
Get off of me!

58
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,291
You cant just show up,
give me a brumpsky,

59
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,958
then expect me to
do whatever you want!

60
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,875
I deserve better
I deserve respect!

61
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,541
You're sounding
like a crazy man.

62
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,541
I sound crazy? You're crazy!

63
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,791
As far as I can recall,

64
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,333
nothing bad ever happened
between you and I.

65
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll show you 'nothing bad'!

66
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,666
Did you forget all about that
stupid contract you signed?

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,791
Trapped in your hideout, she
used her wiley womanly ways.

68
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,166
This ring a bell?

69
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,500
I assume you're finished

70
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,958
with the job you
were doing out here.

71
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,458
And I talked with Mugenya.
He gave me something.

72
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,541
Here it is. Your new job.

73
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,916
My what now??!

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,166
That's a real Mugenya contract.

75
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,750
Rescue Junko Asagiri. ASAP.

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,291
And the job payment
is two million yen!

77
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,708
Whoa!

78
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,250
I thought that'd be a
fair pay for your services.

79
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,416
What kind of a mess
are you in this time?

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,458
I'm sorry?

81
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,791
This sounds like a crock.

82
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,041
Who would pay that kind
of cash just to save you?

83
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,958
Someone with low self-esteem?

84
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,500
Forget it!

85
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,708
What?

86
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,416
I wouldn't do anything for you,

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,208
even if it was you I had to do!

88
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,333
You have to listen, Kanta!

89
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,500
If you don't help me I'm going
to be forced into marriage!

90
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,375
No way!

91
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,166
WAY!

92
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,333
I just saw a glint

93
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,916
from something on
the top of that hill...

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,041
Sniper fire!

95
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
Master!

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,583
He's fine. Just a
little concussion.

97
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,208
He's coming.

98
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,541
Then we gotta get outta here.

99
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,833
Does this mean
that you'll help me?

100
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,416
That's not my call,
but we're leaving now.

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,208
But I've always thought
that you didn't like me.

102
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:48,750
I hate you! But I... I can't...

103
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,583
I'm not strong enough to
carry my Master by myself.

104
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,583
HUH...

105
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,875
If I agree to what you want,

106
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,708
he'll cut my head off
when he wakes up.

107
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,458
So, if you want help to get
Mr. Sniper off our backs,

108
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm gonna need you to
hand over that contract.

109
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,416
Oh... So the brat's got
some brains in there.

110
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,583
She's still not willing
to throw in the towel.

111
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,000
What's that sound?!

112
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,541
My Kanta...

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,583
Come, to me!!

114
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,833
You have to listen, Kanta...!

115
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,666
If you don't help me I'm going
to be forced into marriage!

116
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,666
Junko!

117
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:05,958
POR-QUE JUNKOOOO!

118
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,375
PORQUE HABLO ESPANOL?!

119
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,625
Welcome to the
land of the living...

120
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,333
How's your head holding up?

121
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,791
Junko your boobies
always make me feel happy!

122
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,875
Stop it! That tickles!

123
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,791
Set these puppies free!

124
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,916
You awake?!

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,291
Yes, I'm awake. Stop shouting.

126
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,250
All right, Kosuna. Update me.

127
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,291
It's been one hour
since the first shot.

128
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,458
We've moved to a safer position
in this ancient missile silo.

129
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,250
Whoever that was took a
shot from a long way off.

130
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
I didn't hear it until
way after I saw it.

131
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,916
This guy's skilled.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,375
The only damage he caused
though was to your head.

133
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,375
Oh, and I guess that
dent in the helmet, too.

134
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,250
Just an inch or two lower

135
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,208
and you would have been
in some serious trouble.

136
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,250
It looks like it destroyed the
enemy locator device inside.

137
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,833
That... dick!

138
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,333
What do you think our
next move should be?

139
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,166
Please, you have to help me.

140
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,250
Or we could just
leave her here to die.

141
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,625
If you want.

142
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,541
Grown-ups are talking.
Why don't you just shut up?

143
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,375
We're out of provisions
and ammunition.

144
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,500
We can't help.

145
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,500
Kosuna, I hear
what you're saying,

146
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,083
but we have to take this job.

147
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:19,916
What?

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
Have you lost it?

149
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,541
Thank you!

150
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,666
I do not approve of this.

151
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,583
Well, you don't have to...

152
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,833
It's my call, and I hate being
used by Junko as much as you do.

153
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,875
Believe me... But the thought...

154
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,791
The thought of her
marrying another man

155
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,541
fills me up with
maniacal rage!!!!

156
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,666
That's my boy, Kanta!
Step up to the plate!

157
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,000
Hold on.

158
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,958
Is there a condition?

159
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes. After this
you agree to be mine.

160
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:55,958
No.

161
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,416
I swear, it's so pathetic to see

162
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,458
'the awesome Desert Punk
reduced to a needy pervert...

163
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,875
If you want me,
just be a man about it

164
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,666
and win me over with
your charm and dignity.

165
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,125
You suck.

166
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,375
You manage to pull that off
and I'll be your slave...

167
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,166
I'll do everything your sick
and twisted mind wants, me, to.

168
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,708
Are you serious?

169
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes. And it won't
cost you anything.

170
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,416
You're offering up
free knocker rides?!

171
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,416
But you let me become
some other man's wife,

172
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,375
and none of this is ever
gonna happen for you...

173
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,750
Now, sign here.

174
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,916
And how!

175
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,208
I knew he'd crumble
under the pressure

176
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,708
of Junko's Utters. Moo.

177
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,208
He's alone.

178
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,583
Three hundred meters
to the north.

179
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
Three hundred?!
He got close fast.

180
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,916
Wait, Kosuna,
please don't tell me--

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,583
I already took care of it.

182
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,125
Which wasn't easy
while I was dragging

183
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,666
my unconscious Master
across the desert.

184
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,791
FINE!

185
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,291
He's wearing a
prototype desert suit.

186
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,625
What kind?

187
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,916
Don't know, but it has an
amazing tracking system.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,291
Your usual bag of tricks
ain't gonna do it for us.

189
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:15,958
Is he really that good,

190
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,208
or are you just
blowing smoke up my--

191
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,375
He annihilated thirteen
fully loaded mercenaries

192
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,500
without blinking.
Yeah, he's good.

193
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,000
This is one of those
details you could

194
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,666
have informed me of before
I signed that contract.

195
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,541
Didn't she do this last time?

196
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sick of being shot at!

197
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,541
How can he squeeze off

198
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,333
such accurate shots
at night like that?

199
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,500
It's not him, it's the suit,
like I said before.

200
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,833
We're dead if we stay
stuck behind these rocks!

201
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958
We're still waiting
for that plan of yours!

202
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,166
We're out of ammo and
we're in a crappy location.

203
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,333
We just have to run.

204
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,416
That's stupid!

205
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,541
Shut up!
Now line up single file!

206
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,708
Okay!

207
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,791
Not so fast.
Junko, you get in back.

208
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,041
Why me?

209
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,750
Dammit! I can't get a decent
shot with her in the way!

210
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,250
Guess they get to
live a little longer.

211
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,708
You're pissing me off, Junko.

212
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,333
What loser did you run
off and hire this time?!

213
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,583
At least it sounds like
the idiot fell for the trap.

214
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,000
Nope! He's still alive!

215
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,500
Man... If I'd have
known about his suit,

216
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,416
I would have set up
an explosive instead.

217
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,666
You set up a gas bomb?!

218
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,708
What's going on in
that tiny head of yours?!

219
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,333
That helmet's expensive...

220
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,791
I didn't want to blow it up.

221
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,083
You're so cheap
you were planning

222
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,708
on going back for the helmet?

223
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,958
Enough of the chatterboxing!

224
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,416
We gotta start running!

225
00:12:54,375 --> 00:13:00,958
I'm going to get you... Junko!

226
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,875
Did we lose him?

227
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,458
Yeah, it looks like it.

228
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,791
But keep your eyes peeled.

229
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,750
We're safe inside
the Stone Forest...

230
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,375
A sniping attack,
here is impossible.

231
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,208
I just need a few minutes
to catch my breath.

232
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,833
I wouldn't get comfortable.

233
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:35,250
I've been trying to
outrun this guy for a week.

234
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,958
No matter what I did,
he always found me.

235
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,875
Maybe, but you weren't with
the demon of the desert then.

236
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,708
Start at the beginning.
Tell me the whole story.

237
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,208
You've heard of Ballsahurtin
Incorporated right?

238
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,125
Yeah, it's that desert suit
factory in the Northern Oasis.

239
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,208
That's where his prototype
suit was designed.

240
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,625
They excavated a
bunch of technology

241
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,250
from the Dark Ages and
reverse-engineered it illegally.

242
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,166
Contraband...! No wonder
he's giving us so much trouble.

243
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,708
He headed up the design
team for the prototype.

244
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,666
His name is Tech. Go figure.

245
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,041
Are you ever gonna get around
to why he's chasing you or not?

246
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,375
I wanted to know the things
Ballsahurtin had dug up

247
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,708
I tried to get close to them,

248
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,250
close enough to
know their secrets.

249
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,583
Junko, I want you
to run away with me.

250
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,750
What?

251
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,875
When I sell the
memory chip in this case

252
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,416
to that other company, they'll
pay millions for the data.

253
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,708
Back up... What are
you trying to tell me?

254
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,625
It's no secret how
I feel about you.

255
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,958
It's destiny. Come on, run away
with me and live the rich life!

256
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,750
Tech, you're not serious...

257
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,208
That chip is contraband...

258
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,916
It's not the kind of thing
that disappears into the night.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,416
You're not making any sense.

260
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
Let me spell it out for you.

261
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,000
The only reasons
why you and I have

262
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,500
become so close is because
you're an expert in technology

263
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,541
and you work at Ballsahurtin.

264
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,375
You leave the company
and you're worthless to me.

265
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,458
Bitch--

266
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,125
Junko!

267
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,291
Don't you leave me...!

268
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,041
You walk out that
door and I'll find you!

269
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,041
I'll find you and make you mine!

270
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,000
You didn't have to
be such a bitch to him.

271
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,666
No wonder he's hunting you down.

272
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,333
Yeah, well, he irritated me.

273
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,958
Introducing Ballsahurtin
Incorporated's

274
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,625
newest prototype desert suit.

275
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,875
This new design is the ultimate
in lightweight desert luxury.

276
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,541
With a compact design and
reduced power consumption,

277
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,291
the suit comes complete with a
built-in air-conditioning system

278
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,333
and large-sized monitor,
in addition to the powerful

279
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,958
and highly accurate
enemy locator device.

280
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,291
Looks can be deceiving with
Ballsahurtin's new design,

281
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,458
considering that the suit
can be worn for almost

282
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,708
twice as long as any
other suit on the market,

283
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,291
your yen will go twice as far.

284
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,083
That's about the whole story.

285
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,500
If that prototype lasts
twice as long out here,

286
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,333
that's two times the jobs
and two times the money.

287
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,166
You think you can
get that suit off him?

288
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,500
And the deal stands
that if I rule

289
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,875
and kick his ass,
you'll be mine forever?

290
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,416
That's the deal.

291
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,125
But what do you say we wait
and see what actually plays out.

292
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,666
Have you two stopped to consider
how screwed we are here?!

293
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm the only one with
an enemy locator device!

294
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,583
We're out of ammo!
We're down to just one battery!

295
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,916
And, oh yeah!
The temperature is about

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,375
to dip below zero
and we have no heaters!

297
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,541
Thanks for pointing all of
that out to us, Obvious Girl.

298
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,291
I have an insulated jump suit

299
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,000
and a few solar patches to
retain heat, so I'm good.

300
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,875
The real problem
here is that no matter

301
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,875
where we go or what we do,
this guy is gonna find us.

302
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
Junko...

303
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,541
Wow. You are a genius.

304
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,083
Ah... No, I'm not...

305
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,833
You're spending so much
money on me! I feel bad!

306
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,791
Forget about it!
It ain't nuthin'!

307
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,000
If your company
finds out about this,

308
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,958
you will be in trouble.
It just worries me so much.

309
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,916
Don't sweat it. It'll be
alright. I want you to take it.

310
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,791
You leave the company TECH...
and you're worthless to me.

311
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,500
He found us!

312
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,041
Yeah.

313
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,791
But how?

314
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,250
Where's he shooting from?

315
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,583
Shooting between these stone
pillars is nothing to him.

316
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,458
Not a chance!

317
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,041
No one could take those shots!

318
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,250
He's getting pretty close!

319
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,875
I'm telling you,
as long as he's wearing

320
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,875
that suit we've got
no place to hide!

321
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
Kosuna! Hit him with a flare!

322
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,125
You got it!

323
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,375
Smart move.

324
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,333
Looks like that may have
bought us some time--

325
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,625
Why don't you listen to me?!

326
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,666
I told you your old
BS tactics wouldn't work!

327
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,958
Shut up, I told
you--ohh, my coccyx.

328
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,916
You don't have your
night vision on, remember?!

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,291
You have to be more careful!

330
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,750
Well... this might be
the end of the line for us.

331
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,750
How can you say that?!

332
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,541
Don't give up, you pansy!

333
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,166
Face it! There's just no way
we can win against this guy!!

334
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,625
You're pathetic, Kanta...!

335
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,458
I thought you were going
to make me fall for you!

336
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,000
Be a man, and all that!

337
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,291
You're all washed up.

338
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,458
You're nothing but a
sad shadow of Desert Punk.

339
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,791
Say something else!

340
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,458
Open your mouth! I dare you!

341
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,958
I'm washed up?

342
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,541
Yeah, that's what I said.

343
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,541
You're supposed to rescue the
women, not act like one of them!

344
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,541
Uh, are you okay?

345
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,291
Punk? Hey, Punk?

346
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,625
I'm acting like
a woman! Washed up!

347
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,500
Ha ha ha! I'm awful, a loser!

348
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,708
A shadow of my
former self! Ha ha ha!

349
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,458
Well, it's about time.

350
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,166
Where did your
little saviors go?

351
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,375
They're hiding.

352
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,958
Probably setting their
sights on your head

353
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,750
and heart right about now.

354
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,166
No way.

355
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,041
There's no one within
two hundred meters.

356
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,083
During the day,
someone might have a shot.

357
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,833
But at night,
in the stone forest,

358
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,375
that range is
impossible for anyone else.

359
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,708
You never know,
unless you give it a shot.

360
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,125
You're wasting your time if you
think I'll get blinded twice.

361
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,500
I wouldn't be so
confident if I were you.

362
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,666
You wouldn't, huh?

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,833
Ohhh...

364
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,375
Yeah!

365
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,791
Impossible! My enemy locator
didn't pick up anything!

366
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,708
How did you get me?
Where were you hiding?

367
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,375
Take off the suit.

368
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,666
You do anything other
than that and you're dead.

369
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,083
Mud! You're covered in mud!

370
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,833
You did that to hide
your body heat, didn't you?

371
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,083
Then I heated the entire area
with that last flare we had.

372
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,458
After that, your
sensors couldn't see

373
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,416
the temperature variations.

374
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,291
And no matter how accurate
your enemy locator is,

375
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,500
it was still built
by human hands.

376
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,916
Wait, how did you
find mud in the desert?

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,500
There's not an oasis
out here for miles.

378
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,625
Cut it out!

379
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,375
Don't you dare
look at me right now!

380
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
Oh, it's warm like a tea bag.

381
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,375
You're sick.

382
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,833
Oh That is just nasty!

383
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,833
Yeah...

384
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,916
I can't believe
I was had by a guy

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,875
who rubbed pee-mud
all over himself!

386
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,958
Technology beaten by urine!

387
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,916
Ah... well played.

388
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,625
This suit was supposed
to make me unstoppable.

389
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,083
That's what you get for
screwing with technology.

390
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,458
A bullet and a big,
fat guilty conscience.

391
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,041
You might have learned
a lot today, Tech.

392
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,083
But the one lesson
I want you to leave here

393
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,458
with is the knowledge of what

394
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,166
an inexperienced
little boy you are.

395
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,458
Stop snotting in the
suit and take it off.

396
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,791
You have to tell me
one more thing! Please?

397
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,750
What is it?

398
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,833
How did you know
that I'd come in

399
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,208
so close for that last attack?

400
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,166
I wouldn't want
any man I didn't know

401
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,958
to be alone with Junko...

402
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,791
not for one solid
second in the day.

403
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,458
You got me more
figured out than I do.

404
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,458
Enough of the
slobbery loser routine!

405
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,375
Take the suit off already!

406
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,041
Tear gas--

407
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,458
Get back here!

408
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,208
I underestimated him. I failed.

409
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,958
I failed in
my promise to help her.

410
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:21,166
I broke the contract.
I'm an idiot. I gotta help...

411
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,291
Master!

412
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,750
Junko, here! With
superboobs and superdudes!

413
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,000
One of whom kidnapped me!

414
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:17,625
I didn't--

415
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:18,291
Uh huh!

416
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,458
She belongs to me!

417
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,625
Over poor little me?

418
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,416
I will kick!

419
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,666
And I will punch you!

420
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,916
Men are weird.

421
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,791
On the next Desert Punk,
'Too Close for Comfort"

422
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,916
Don't miss it or, uh...
things will happen!
