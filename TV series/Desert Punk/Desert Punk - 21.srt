1
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:11,250
It's been six months since that
day... the day he died.

2
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,458
Kosuna--

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,958
I'm gonna go back
and help my Master!

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,083
Get back here!

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,250
What are you doing?!

6
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,791
He needs my help! Lemme go!

7
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,333
Master!

8
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,458
I went back there a
dozen times to check,

9
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,291
but the only thing I ever
found was rocks and dust.

10
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,375
A desolate wasteland,
like everything else out here.

11
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,250
Somehow I kept thinking
that he'd show up,

12
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,041
the way he always did, with
some smart-ass thing to say.

13
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,458
That never happened.

14
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,625
Still, I can't believe
that he's dead.

15
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,958
Until I know one
way or the other

16
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,125
for sure where he is,
I'm just gonna keep working.

17
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,958
That's what he'd do.

18
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,916
I knew him better
than most, I think.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,916
And anyone who did know him

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,666
would say all the
things I know as fact.

21
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,375
He was spiteful, stinky,
had a nasty sense of humor,

22
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:30,125
and was completely devoid
of any morals or ethics.

23
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,375
My master...

24
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,666
He was brutal to a fault,

25
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,541
his breath could
kill a small animal,

26
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,125
and he was offensive
to women, children, animals,

27
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,291
and nearly every
person who met him.

28
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:45,166
But in the end,
he was magnificent.

29
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,916
Your name will never die...

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,250
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

31
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,666
You just watch me now...!
I gotta great plan...!

32
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,875
Kosuna the all-powerful,
the most

33
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,791
relentless female force
in the whole desert...

34
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,708
I will keep your
name alive by becoming

35
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,083
the formidable
Desert Punk Part Two!

36
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,583
For real.
I'm totally gonna do it.

37
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,250
Yes, this is so
freaking cool...!

38
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:45,416
I... am... ba.. swingin'!

39
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,625
You sure you know
how to use that thing?

40
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,291
Oh, yeah.

41
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,250
I used to borrow Master's all
the time without him knowing.

42
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
No kidding... Well...

43
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
Just make sure you
don't get too reckless...

44
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,625
The, human body is
a delicate thing,

45
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,916
and I can't afford to
lose any more customers.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,875
The economy is bad enough.

47
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,291
I don't plan on dying.

48
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,916
Yeah... Neither did the Punk

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,708
or any of the other
mercs around here...

50
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,125
but they're dead,
and now I'm losing money.

51
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,750
I've almost got
this thing tight.

52
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,083
One more second.

53
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,416
My master always told me--

54
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,708
He always said if
anyone needed a winch,

55
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,125
they'd be a freaking tool
if they went anyplace else

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,083
but Matsu's Custom Winches.

57
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,416
Smart guy.

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, your new winch
is fitted and spiked.

59
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,625
You're ready for action.

60
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,666
Thanks!

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,083
Um, excuse me...

62
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Mitz?! What are you doing here?

63
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,916
You're supposed to be working!

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,291
I know... But I'm finished.

65
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,458
You walked that lady's

66
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,791
Heracles Golden
Helmet Beetle already?

67
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, I'm done... But Mugenya--

68
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,291
Speak up!

69
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,291
Mugenya has a job for us.

70
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,750
I ain't a mind reader!

71
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,458
Why didn't you
just say that first?!

72
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,291
I'm sorry I will next time.

73
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,666
Thanks a ton, Matsu.

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,416
I'll be back for a
tune up in a week or so.

75
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,166
Good. I need the business.

76
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,166
With any luck
we won't go dying on you.

77
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,458
What do you mean?

78
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,583
Matsu...!One more thing ...

79
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,250
No matter how bad business gets,

80
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,500
I need to count on you
to be here for my repairs.

81
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,791
I'm going nowhere...

82
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,375
I got six kids, two dogs,
and a large wife to feed.

83
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,041
See ya! What are you doing?

84
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,458
Standing guard? Come on!

85
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,916
I'm sorry, I was just--

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Always with the excuses.

87
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,791
That sad-looking sack with
the chili-bowl haircut is Mitz.

88
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,250
Koid was my master's
master and this is his kid.

89
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,166
He said it would be too hard
for me to go it alone out here,

90
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,125
so he had Mitz
tag along with me.

91
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,791
Koid is a nice man,
and I was really thankful

92
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,541
that he wanted to
help me out so much.

93
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,083
But Mitz is cursed.

94
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,375
Everything he touches either
breaks, explodes, or hits back.

95
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,750
He's just hopeless.

96
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,916
Kinda like my master
thought of me at first.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,625
You know sometimes I think
I'm too hard on the kid.

98
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,250
But sometimes he
completely deserves it.

99
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,125
What?!

100
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,458
The Kawazu Gang?

101
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,000
They regrouped...
Even after what Punk did.

102
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,833
The way he told the story,
he crushed them all into dust.

103
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,083
He embellished a bit.

104
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,375
He did bust them up some,

105
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,375
but they've reformed
much stronger than before.

106
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,666
The merchant union
considers them a threat,

107
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,291
so they asked us to
do something about it.

108
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,666
You just leave this
extermination to me...

109
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,875
Desert Punk Number Two!

110
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,416
Sorry, Kosuna,
but I already gave

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,625
the Machinegun
Brothers the contract.

112
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,875
You did...?

113
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,000
And you think I'm gonna sit
here and do nothing about it?

114
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,000
I guess they could use help...

115
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,250
But I kinda doubt they'd need
the assistance of the kid.

116
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,541
He's fine!

117
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,000
He might not look like much,

118
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,666
but he's got teeth of steel
and instincts... like me!

119
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,125
He's learning from me
like I learned from Punk.

120
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,333
The awesome force of

121
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,250
Desert Punk Two will
destroy the Kawazu Gang!

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,750
Okay.

123
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,833
I hope he doesn't screw this up.

124
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,208
I bet he'd cry if I shaved
that stupid head of his...

125
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,208
Guess this is one mission
that I got to do on my own.

126
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,416
I'm sorry, Kosuna...

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,583
I'm sorry you don't like me.

128
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,875
I like you fine.

129
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,708
You just do everything wrong.

130
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,791
Hey, Kosuna. It's been a while.

131
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,708
You thirsty...?

132
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,833
Stop by the
ol' shop for a drink!

133
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,208
Sure.

134
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,125
Hey, Barkeep, set me up
with a cold one! Pronto!

135
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
Make that two.

136
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,166
Yo, Kosuna.

137
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,208
How's stuff?

138
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,291
Oh, I can't complain.

139
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,666
I bet.

140
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,458
Without that scrawny
sleaze-monger barking orders,

141
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,375
you must be pretty chilled out.

142
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,333
You know, he went
and got himself killed

143
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,250
before he could pay off
his debt at my shop.

144
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,458
I'll be happy to pay
you whatever he owed.

145
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,833
It wasn't your debt, sister.

146
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,250
You're just in the crossfire.

147
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
Don't think you owe me anything.

148
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,458
Heck, I would've paid twice

149
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,875
what he owed just to never
see Desert Punk's face again.

150
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,875
Demon of the desert, my ass.

151
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,416
When it came down to it,
he was an ordinary guy.

152
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,083
He just smelled
a whole lot worse.

153
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,750
Remember that time when he tried

154
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,583
to steal that truck
of toilet spackle?!

155
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,625
What a buncha jerks.

156
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,750
Without Punk's business they
would have folded years ago.

157
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,375
Don't even have respect
for, nothin'. Whatever.

158
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,666
Uh... is something wrong?

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,500
Yeah, about a thousand things!

160
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,333
Sorry. Forget it.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,833
I was just making conversation!

162
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,666
That's gunfire.

163
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,250
Seven point six-two millimeter.

164
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,208
We're the only thing between
them and the West Oasis.

165
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,166
The Great Machinegun
Brother Wall!

166
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,500
What have I done...?!.

167
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,791
I'm a failure as a father
for bringing my family

168
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,083
into a war zone!

169
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,375
You've done your best!

170
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,416
Seriously I'm hungry

171
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,083
You can stop crying sir.
Now that we're here,

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,916
nothing bad is gonna happen
to you or your family. Die!

173
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,666
Just like I thought.
The Machinegun Brothers.

174
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,416
Who are they shooting at?

175
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,750
Haru! How you
holding that thing?!

176
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,958
Tight and hard,
like that dancer we met

177
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,333
in the West Oasis
last week! Slut.

178
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,916
They're retreating,
but don't let up yet!

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,416
They might flank us!

180
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,625
It looks like the Kawazu Gang.

181
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,875
It's such an easy target.

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,916
I can't go any further.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,833
Holy fart stains,
this suit is hot.

184
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,875
I need a donut and a malt.

185
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,916
Have you considered exercise?

186
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,583
Who's there?!

187
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,541
Where are you?!

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,375
In your face!

189
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,291
That hurt.

190
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,208
Oww... Oh,
everything's spinning...

191
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,500
It might not have been

192
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,166
the most dramatic
overpowering of a henchman,

193
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,666
but it did the job.

194
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,291
Uh, Kosuna, ma'am!

195
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,791
How many times do
I have to say this.

196
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,458
On the job, it's Master.
Off the job, it's Master.

197
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,958
Yeah, I forgot.

198
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm sorry... Really.

199
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,750
You're like a broken record.

200
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,291
Watch and learn.

201
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,125
I'll show you how
Desert Punk would do this job.

202
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,541
We call this 'old school'.

203
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,625
And you're gonna have
to pitch in this time.

204
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,041
You up for that?

205
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,000
You're saying the West Oasis

206
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,541
has hired mercenaries
to try and take us out?

207
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,583
Three huge fellas
with machineguns!

209
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,750
And they hit everything
they were aiming for!

210
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,750
They ambushed us!

211
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,916
We were pinned down.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,875
There was no other
choice but to retreat.

213
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,500
It's of no concern.

214
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,791
Those three fools will
be dead before long.

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,208
Only one man could
ever take us down

216
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,833
and that one man is dead...

217
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,666
No other living
creature should ever face

218
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,916
the Neo Kawazu Gang
and walk away alive.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,250
Isn't that right?

220
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Yes, sir!

221
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,041
He is so calm. How awesome
of a leader is that?!

222
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,416
He is the coolest,
man. So sweet.

223
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,000
After this dish... Some gelatin.

224
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,166
Gelatin, gelatin!

225
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,041
Sweet, luscious gelatin!

226
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,791
Oh It's worth living
and dying for!

227
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,541
Now...

228
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,791
We all know I'm not an idiot,
so who's going to tell me...

229
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,875
Why are we missing
one of my henchmen?

230
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,750
Henchman Q is just out of shape.

231
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,916
He can't run.

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,583
Don't worry, fatty
will be back for dinner.

233
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,208
Boss! I found something!

234
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,750
Yeah, what is it?

235
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,375
I went out to look
for Henchman Q--

236
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,083
I found him knocked out
cold and completely naked.

237
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,083
And stuck to his sweaty
junk I found this letter...

238
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,083
I love receiving mail.
Who's it from?

239
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
Yeah, that's the thing boss...

240
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,833
I didn't believe it,

241
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,916
but on the backside
it says it's from Desert Punk!

242
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,041
But it can't be!

243
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,041
I thought that freak was dead!

244
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,000
He is! I saw the gravestone!

245
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,750
Read it to me.

246
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
Oh, yeah...

247
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,833
Uh... Dear Giant Jerk Monster.

248
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,166
Why haven't you
killed yourself...?

249
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,875
I would if I were you...

250
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,583
If my mother, was that ugly
I wouldn't have a choice...

251
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,541
Yeah, you heard me...
Your mother is so ugly--

252
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,375
My mother... ain't ugly!

253
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,125
Boss is upset again!

254
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,416
It's the Hulk Syndrome!

255
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,625
This always happens

256
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,291
The gelatin! Find him some
gelatin and stop this madness!

257
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,291
Desert Punk...

258
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,458
I was so glad to hear that
you'd come back from the dead...

259
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,458
Now I get to send you
to the grave for good.

260
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,291
Come and get me,
you zombie-nutjob!

261
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,958
Sir, I've found him!
It's Desert Punk!

262
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:15,166
All right, men...!
Let's get to work!

263
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,750
Suck on these, Punk!

264
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,166
I can't see. Did we hit him?!

265
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,333
Let me check, sir.

266
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,666
Stay alert, men!

267
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,666
He likes to use all kinds
of gadgets and traps...

268
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,583
Don't fall for any of it!

269
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,041
There! I found him, sir!

270
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,541
He's running away like a coward.

271
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,750
Is he really running

272
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,708
or is it another one
of his stupid tricks?

273
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,250
No, it's the real thing!

274
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,916
I see his legs moving and
his feet touching the sand!

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't let him get away...!
That means move!

276
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,541
But, sir, we don't even
have a plan of attack!

277
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,833
If you could just
give me one minute--

278
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,000
Move!

279
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,458
It doesn't matter
what he's armed with,

280
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,208
how he moves, or what
idiot bothered to train him...!

281
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,416
There's no way one man is ever
gonna stop the Kawazu Gang!

282
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,916
Nobody comes into my desert

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,750
and tells me
my mother is ugly...

284
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,458
Any of you get the
killshot, you take it!

285
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,833
I've got you now!

286
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,083
Who the heck are you two?!

287
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,625
What the--
Who is shooting at us?!

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
Here we go...

289
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,625
No! He's tricked me again!!

290
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,958
What was that...?

291
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,000
I can barely hear myself speak.

292
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,208
I guess I have
to thank you Mitz.

293
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,791
With all of this
empty space out here

294
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,291
I couldn't just use landmines...

295
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,333
And sniping them all
would have taken forever.

296
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,875
I gotta say, I didn't think this

297
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,916
would all work out
as well as it has.

298
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Those special words Master
taught me worked like a charm.

299
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,708
What special words?

300
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,375
Oh, you just tell that dude,
his mother is ugly.

301
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,875
My mother...

302
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,541
Is not...

303
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,666
My mother is not ugly!

304
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,666
No, Kosuna!

305
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,708
I told you...

306
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,916
You're supposed
to call me Master...

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,833
On the job, and off the job.

308
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,500
You'll only fool
this bad guy one time!

309
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,916
Now, prepare to die!!!!

310
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
Take that!

311
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,208
What happened to you?!

312
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,500
He's out of his gourd...
But how...

313
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,666
You what...?

314
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,500
You actually want me to take
on Mitz as my apprentice?

315
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,500
But he's going to become
a mercenary sooner or later.

316
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,416
Training this early will
help him as he grows up

317
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,125
to have his own apprentice 

318
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,833
Yeah it is, but he's your son.

319
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,208
Won't you miss him
when he's gone?

320
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,583
Of course, I will...

321
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,583
But he's going to become
a mercenary sooner or later.

322
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,791
Training this
early will help him

323
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,916
as he grows up to have
his own apprentice.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,208
I don't wanna be rude,
but he's kind of--

325
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,000
I know what you wanna say.

326
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,958
He's green... But I think...

327
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,458
When you're in a tight spot...

328
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,000
You just might
find him to be exactl

329
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,041
 what you need when you need it.

330
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,666
I guess this was the kind of
tight spot he was talking about.

331
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,791
Okay--Time out! Wait!!

332
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,083
My mother...
is a beautiful lady.

333
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,416
That was amazing.
Nice job, Mitz!

334
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,916
Whoa, hold up there!
What are you thinking...?

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,541
You and I are pals, remember?

336
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm your master?

337
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,000
No, oh, no! Put that down!

338
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,083
You don't need it.
Come on, let's just talk!

339
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,291
That's what friends do!

340
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,833
They don't turn on each other!

341
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,750
Mitz, please! Your father
would not appreciate this!

342
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,333
This kid is just a time bomb
waiting for a place to happen.

343
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:34,250
And he's my
responsibility. Oh, no.

344
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,875
I found out that Mitz had some

345
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,000
kind of massive emotional shock
when he was three years old

346
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,875
and he's had this Hulk
Syndrome thing ever since.

347
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,041
Kinda sad.

348
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,500
Tell me one thing...

349
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,083
How is it that the
master gets stuck

350
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,833
carrying the apprentice
around on her royal back?

351
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,208
Fine.

352
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,166
How am I gonna
be able to control

353
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,875
this Hulk thing of his
from now on if I can't

354
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,833
even wake the kid up from a nap?

355
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,625
I need to establish
more authority.

356
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,541
Natsuko, you're here!
You actually made it!

357
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,916
Hey!!

358
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,208
There may be some obstacles,

359
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,791
but nothing is going to keep me
from becoming Desert Punk Two,

360
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,166
the strongest, kick-ass power
babe in the Great Kanto Desert!!

361
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,541
Only this Punk is
gonna try to smell better.

362
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,083
A lot better.

363
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,416
Yo, it's the desert
beauty here, Kosuna,

364
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,083
AKA Desert Punk Two!

365
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,166
Did you like my first outing?!

366
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,208
Oh, yes.

367
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,500
So you had a good time, Mitz?

368
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,208
Yeah, but I ate all the rations.

369
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,583
You idiot, I was hungry!

370
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,791
Anyway, the next episode

371
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,833
is called "Hidden
Agendas", I think.
