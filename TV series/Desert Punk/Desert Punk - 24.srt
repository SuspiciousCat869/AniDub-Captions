1
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,041
Is, is that really him?

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,041
You!

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,541
Wait! Where are you going?

4
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,291
Oh jeez!

5
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,416
It's moving again!

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,125
And so are we!

7
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,250
I don't think you're
gonna make it!

8
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,666
That was him...

9
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,958
No!

10
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,375
Kosuna, behind you!

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,625
Weird lights...

12
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,958
I wonder if they may
be some kind of strange

13
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,125
phenomenon predicting
future and tragic events.

14
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,500
Really, it's the last
episode. Can I eat now?

15
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,041
Kosuna!

16
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,375
Master...

17
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,166
Kosuna! Listen up!

18
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,458
Take a look at where you stand
in all of this right now...

19
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,041
You have to consider
your strength

20
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,583
versus your opponents...

21
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,708
what you want to do and what
you are actually capable of...

22
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,750
It's a lot to think about!
Don't get too intimidated!

23
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,125
Dumb kid... you
are not getting away!

24
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,750
My strength versus theirs.

25
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,541
What am I truly capable of?

26
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,541
What's my place in this fight?

27
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,125
Should I surrender?

28
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,666
Hell, no! I own these bitches!

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,125
What is she doing?!

30
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,625
She actually did it!

31
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,708
That's all I got
in me right now boys!

32
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,791
I'm gonna go find your sister.

33
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,750
You stay here and
finish what I started!

34
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,916
See you in a bit!

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,708
Did she just give us an order?

36
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,333
Yeah. She's Desert Punk's
apprentice through and through.

37
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,291
And we're still stuck
doing the grunt work.

38
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,583
Which is fine by me. Akio! Haru!

39
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,541
Let's show these
tank-totin'-tools

40
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,875
what the Machinegun
Brothers are packing!!

41
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,333
Yeah!

42
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,083
Is that you, Sergeant?

43
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,916
Chairman...
What's going on in here?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,916
You're too late, Natsuko.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,166
The whole facility
has been destroyed...

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,166
Everything ...
Every experiment is wiped out.

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,583
It's all over.

48
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,583
Everything's out of whack...

49
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,166
The lab's destroyed.

50
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,666
Only the Dark Ages
cannon is still active.

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,583
What kind of cannon?

52
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,000
Particle beam.

53
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,000
The crater we are deep
inside was cut into the earth

54
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,416
by this beam thousands
of years ago.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,416
Then that light we
saw in the sky was...

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,125
It's an atmospheric reaction
as the device warms up.

57
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,041
We have to leave now!

58
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,083
It's too late.

59
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,791
You two need to
find some optimism.

60
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,625
This isn't my only laboratory.

61
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,041
But we have to fire the beam

62
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,208
to give those trespassers
what they deserve.

63
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,083
Nobody screws with Kaizuka!

64
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,000
You can't fire that weapon!
It's suicide!

65
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,500
mmmPoppycock!

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,875
The accelerated neutrons in the
beam will reach a velocity

67
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,166
great enough to vaporize every
living thing in this place.

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,583
Have you lost your mind?!

69
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,083
How is blowing all
of us up not suicide.

70
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,583
I have an escape route planned.

71
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,583
We'll be long gone
before the blast happens.

72
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,958
But we can't--

73
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,416
I didn't ask your opinion.

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,416
But why Kaizuka--

75
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,333
I've poured my soul into this
development and those bottom

76
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,291
feeders tried to tear apart
everything I've built.

77
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,416
They deserve every ounce
of pain coming to them.

78
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,166
That old dude has put on one
hell of a show for a long time.

79
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,375
And now we all get
to see the sticky turd

80
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,291
for what he actually is.

81
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't expect to see you here.

82
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,833
Well, here I am.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,166
Oh, Matsu, I'm sorry.

84
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,083
We're pinned down.

85
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,666
I don't wanna die!!

86
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,375
I don't like this
anymore than you,

87
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,500
but we gotta play
this like the Punk would.

88
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,000
What? Didn't he come damn
close to killing himself.

89
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,458
Where am I?

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,125
Kosuna, you remind
me of a wet rat...

91
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,291
always looking for a
quick way out of the sewer.

92
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,833
Have some gun!

93
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,041
You're getting fast!

94
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,833
I don't have the time
to waste messing around

95
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,250
with a back-stabbing
panty hamster like you!

96
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,125
Whoa! Your master
vanishes for a bit

97
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,750
and you get a
nasty little mouth!

98
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,333
They're making this
way too easy on me.

99
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,583
What the--

100
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm surprised you didn't
remember this trick

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,375
from last time!

102
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,500
Your new buddy
Desert Punk showed us

103
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,708
your one weak spot
a long time ago!

104
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,875
No!

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,375
Wolverines!

106
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm, disappointed...
You've learned nothing...

107
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,250
all this time and you're no
better now than you were then...

108
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,541
I suppose that means...
that Kanto Desert's

109
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,875
baddest power babe,
isn't actually you.

110
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,541
Cause... It's... Us.

111
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,250
I bet you never thought...

112
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,791
That your life would end here.

113
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,583
What the hell?!

114
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,833
Why're you here?

115
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,625
Fulfilling my contract.

116
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,958
Rain Spider!

117
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,250
You've got razor wire
wrapped around your body.

118
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,125
Just like a fly, you're
trapped in the spider's web.

119
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,250
Try to escape, and the
web will only get stickier.

120
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,916
The point is,
keep your ass still.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,958
Kosuna, where are you?!

122
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,083
Are you dead?

123
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,000
Those guys are still alive...?

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,458
I guess that means that
they were actually able

125
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,833
to bring down the Dragon.

126
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,958
What do you think you're doing?!

127
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,083
I can't go out like this.

128
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,250
I said don't move!
She's got a grenade!

129
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,208
Later.

130
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,208
Rain Spider, move!

131
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,916
I never thought you listened
to a thing Desert Punk said.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,583
Shut up! I practiced
everything he taught me--

133
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,583
I was wrong.

134
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,208
That was one hell of a shot.

135
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,541
Now, go find your master.

136
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,333
But, you need help...

137
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,791
Go! Get out of here
before you die like me!

138
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,458
At least you didn't
hit me in the assets.

139
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,208
I can go out in one piece.

140
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,583
That's enough
for me. Run, Kosuna.

141
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,250
He won't wait around
here forever. Go...

142
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,625
Wait. What are you doing?

143
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,666
You're not gonna finish the job?

144
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,000
I know tomato juice
is expensive...

145
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,208
But it did save my life.

146
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,083
Too bad it couldn't do
the same thing for Kosuna.

147
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,833
I'm gonna miss
that scrawny leech.

148
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,458
Time for Junko to
hit the road folks!

149
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,458
I know those eyes too well.

150
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,750
They possess the same
look of rage and calmness

151
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,375
that mine did so many years ago.

152
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,666
Enough of your
hoity-toity words, geezer.

153
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,791
Get to the point.

154
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,666
Exactly what I mean.

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,166
I'll pop a bullet
through your jugular

156
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,333
in the middle of one of
your speeches if I have to.

157
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,666
You can't do that.

158
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,791
No kidding... What, did I do?

159
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,250
You're a liar, Kaizuka.

160
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,500
You and claim that all of
your work is for the people.

161
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,333
But the sad truth
behind all of this is

162
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,125
that you plan to take control
of the desert as well as

163
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,375
the people you
claim to represent.

164
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,625
No... You've got it all wrong...

165
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,625
The only reason we're here
is to ensure a decent future.

166
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,458
He's not anything
like you Desert Punk--

167
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,166
Move again and
I'll shoot you in the face.

168
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,333
Kaizuka's money still
isn't enough for him.

169
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,541
He can only think of himself,

170
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,666
which doesn't leave
any room for you guys.

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,125
What happens after you kill me?

172
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,208
Any big plans?
How 'bout a vacation?

173
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,416
No amount of talking's
gonna slow me down.

174
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,666
Or maybe you and
your little girlfriend

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,541
can start a family together?

176
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,291
Kanta!

177
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,333
Letting you stay alive
was a huge mistake,

178
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,916
and I don't plan
on making it twice.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,125
Wow, you're cool.

180
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,000
Kaizuka may be a
self-involved ego maniac...

181
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,625
Natsuko, what are you saying?

182
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,625
I'm saying--

183
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,125
That at least he's
not so heartless

184
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,833
that he would betray those
closest to him like Kanta would.

185
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,583
I can't believe you
fell for my oldest trick!

186
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,000
Even Kosuna sees
through that one by now!

187
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,833
And if that one got you,

188
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,000
I know you won't
see this coming.

189
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,166
Take her.

190
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,041
Human beings should not
waste life, for it is precious.

191
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,125
How the hell did this
thing get a hold of me?

192
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,208
He's got a cloaking device.

193
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,541
So...

194
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,166
What do you say we put
an end to this right now?

195
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,208
You're going to die down
here with us, you know.

196
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,791
I'm not gonna die... Not today.

197
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,625
You might not have
a choice in it.

198
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,000
We'll see.

199
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,583
Natsuko!

200
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,708
Here we come!

201
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,375
There she is!

202
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,541
You made it!

203
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:38,375
Punk is here too?!
Whatever, just shoot!

204
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,166
Junko let them get away!

205
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,958
Slow down man!

206
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,666
Mekori, I need some
help over here! Come on!!

207
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,625
Affirmative.

208
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,916
Master!

209
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,375
Our bullets are useless
against that wall of a robot.

210
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,125
What are we going to use?

211
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,875
Are you okay Natsuko?

212
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,541
Yeah, I'm fine.

213
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,375
But we have to get out of these
ruins before they blow.

214
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,541
Master, what's going on?

215
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,833
The coast is clear.

216
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,291
Good. Let's bail
before we get lit up!

217
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,333
I'm right behind you!

218
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,041
Don't have to tell me twice!

219
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,916
It took you long
enough to get up here.

220
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:28,333
Master? Master!!!

221
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,625
Hey-o!

222
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,750
Found him!

223
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,791
They're all over the place!

224
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,708
Why won't these
dudes leave us alone?!

225
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,333
And these dudes ain't balloons,
if you couldn't tell.

226
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,416
Kanta, you son of a bitch!

227
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
I suppose we don't
have much of a choice.

228
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,583
Then let's tear 'em up!

229
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,458
They'll either kill us now
or later, and I hate waiting.

230
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,000
No, don't!

231
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,916
Ow, that hurt.
What are you doing?!

232
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,916
Ciao bitches!

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
That guy sucks.

234
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,875
Aw, Let him go...
He's just a cockroach.

235
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,791
Master?

236
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,666
We thought you were dead.

237
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,500
From the second I saw
you again back there,

238
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
I knew I had to tell you things.

239
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,208
Things that I didn't think

240
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,208
I'd ever have the chance to say.

241
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,666
I don't know what's
happened to you,

242
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,625
but you need to
know this about me.

243
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,916
I've always considered
you my savior.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,833
You see, I make
mistakes today the same

245
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,416
as when you and I were together.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,000
The difference is that back

247
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,916
then I all I had to do
was follow orders.

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,333
Now I have to give them,

249
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,708
and sometimes I don't
trust myself with how I think.

250
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,083
And I thought that you
sacrificed your life--

251
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,708
And that's where you're wrong.

252
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,625
I wasn't interested
in saving anything

253
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,208
but my own pale ass...
I was using all of you...

254
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,208
I needed an easy way
out of that place

255
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,000
and you guys were there.
Then I screwed up.

256
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,583
I got caught...

257
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,041
But I flipped my situation
and joined these guys.

258
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,541
You sold out the
people you know best

259
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,375
to get in bed with the bad guys?

260
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,791
Is this a war?

261
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,541
You can call it what
you want, old man...

262
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,083
But you know what it is.

263
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,583
There's been pressure
on our boundaries.

264
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,958
Maybe you're
underground mercenaries

265
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,875
or the dragnet elite,
I don't care.

266
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm just here to stop you.

267
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,875
So you're just here
to cash in my body

268
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,583
for another step up the
government's military ladder?

269
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,875
Anything goes out here...

270
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
This is a war, right?

271
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,083
You're going to use us
to take over the oasis.

272
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,916
That's your plan.

273
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,333
Yep.

274
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,166
Where are you, Kosuna?

275
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,833
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
I dragged you all into this.

276
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,458
No apologizing!

277
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,875
Yeah, sis!

278
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,708
I'm proud that I got to fight
this battle with you!

279
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
We followed you into Hell,

280
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,541
and we'll follow you out.

281
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,083
Thanks guys...

282
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,541
Kosuna!

283
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,375
Yeah, what!

284
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,625
I wanna give you a choice.

285
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,916
What you've shown today says

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,750
that you might have
what it takes to do this.

287
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,291
You can come over to my side,
but you have to tell me now.

288
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:25,291
Huh? Oh, uh... I uh... well...

289
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,875
I know it might be hard...

290
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,416
War can be confusing.

291
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,916
But know that
inside this confusion,

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,916
you can finally become Kanto
Desert's baddest power babe.

293
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,875
Master.

294
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,750
Yeah?

295
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,125
I have to know something...

296
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,500
The fire that burned
down Matsu's store...

297
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,916
did money from your
pocket pay for that?

298
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,416
Oh... Yeah, that.

299
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
If anyone had known
I was still alive...

300
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,416
there would have been
some big problems.

301
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,333
After I went back for the winch,

302
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,500
I didn't have much of a choice.

303
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,916
I thought about feeling bad
about it, if that matters.

304
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,375
What are you doing staring
down that little girl?!

305
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,416
You were supposed
to kill Kaizuka!

306
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,916
Yeah... I'm on that.

307
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,708
Mitz, you stupid,
piece of trash!

308
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,083
Show me what you're
made of you pansy!

309
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,166
Do not move.

310
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,208
You slime...
I'm gonna kill your father.

311
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,875
Kosuna... Oh, no...

312
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,250
Where's your winch?

313
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,666
Now we have to
deal with this kid!

314
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,375
Hulk Syndrome.

315
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,958
Now!

316
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,000
What did, you do?!

317
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,041
I bet you didn't know,

318
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,625
that Matsu's winches
could do this!

319
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,416
Kosuna...! You are in
so much trouble young lady!

320
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,333
I'm so clever.

321
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,375
Anyone wanna leave.

322
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,583
But where do we go?

323
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,291
No clue! But we gotta move fast!

324
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,458
I am Rain Spider,
Savior of the Sands

325
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,375
and all her people!!

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,083
This is it!

327
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,708
That truck is our
ticket outta this place!

328
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh... Okay.

329
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,958
Get into the back, hurry!

330
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,708
They actually had a plan-B.

331
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,583
I never expected
it with that group.

332
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,791
But they did leave one behind

333
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,833
which means they must
not be that organized.

334
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,458
Master.

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,791
I'm not switching sides.

336
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,666
From now on, you're my enemy.

337
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,041
That's your decision...

338
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,500
Can you live with it?

339
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,791
I just saved your ass Punk.

340
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,541
I'll follow you wherever you go!

341
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,416
You have to do
whatever's necessary.

342
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,166
Idiot! Why did you
shoot at that thing?!

343
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,291
I'm sorry!

344
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,166
No...! Please, let's go home!

345
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
Stop the madness!

346
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,375
You know what I really want?

347
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,333
A 308 caliber assault rifle!

348
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,458
It's so heavy...

349
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,875
I'd be useless after an hour.

350
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,166
You, brat.

351
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,500
Thanks!

352
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,416
Thanks, master!

353
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,333
Master!

354
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,250
Master!

355
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:26,083
Master! Master! Master! Master!!

356
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,791
Mitz! We're going!

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,458
And still there's
that other voice

358
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,250
in my head that
tells me, "You're stupid.

359
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,583
That's your master.

360
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,125
It would be so much
better over there with him."

361
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,583
Betraying us the way
he did was something

362
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,041
very much in character for him.

363
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,833
I don't know how good that is.

364
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,041
As bad an apprentice
I was to him at times,

365
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,083
he said I'd gotten better.

366
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,125
But if I went with master,
it would be another lifetime

367
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,333
of being his little sidekick.

368
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,041
That would ensure
that I'd never become

369
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,333
the baddest power babe
of the Great Kanto Desert.

370
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,333
Which I can't let happen.

371
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,166
Let's get out of here, Mekori.

372
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,750
Time is up.

373
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,000
That was the moment it happened.

374
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,250
The moment the dead
of night gave birth

375
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,916
to mid-afternoon in
the Great Kanto Desert.

376
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,291
A place where the brutal and
the righteous are brothers.

377
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,583
The Great Kanto Desert.

378
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,458
During the day
the temperature soars

379
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,000
above a hundred and twenty
degrees in the shade.

380
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:59,541
At night, it takes a
nosedive well below freezing.

381
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,250
These are the ruins
of a civilization--

382
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,666
one that fell under the weight
of its own thoughtlessness

383
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,333
and greed several
hundred years ago.

384
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,583
It is now simply a grave
reminder of the lost promise

385
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,666
of those who
destroyed themselves.

386
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,125
The Great Kanto Desert.

387
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,541
The fiercest and most brutal
people in human history

388
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:26,083
live day-to-day in this
scorching hell on earth.

389
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,333
It is a life of loneliness
and scavenging.

390
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,000
Come again, will you?

391
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,541
Today, these hardened people

392
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,791
of the desert live
with bolstered pride...

393
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,916
Which also seems to
be one of the things

394
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,541
that brings about
hard times for them.

395
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,416
It's a vicious cycle.

396
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,166
But oh, well.
That's the way it goes, I guess.

397
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,083
And these people sure
aren't changing... dumb-asses.
