1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,750
The great Kanto Desert.

16
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,291
Even in this wild
churning heat storm,

17
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,041
the few surviving souls
that make their home here

18
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,083
fall in love, it's their way
to validate their existence

19
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,416
by perpetuating the future.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,125
But even then...

21
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,875
Procreation can
sometimes bring out

22
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,833
the worse in anyone,
causing even the normal ones

23
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,416
to be shunned by
others in society.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,875
And no sooner, the right
punishment will always be

25
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,541
more than what
they ever suspected.

26
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,041
This is the reenactment,
front row seats

27
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,416
I might add, of ten days in
the life of a desert dweller

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,708
in this exact predicament.

29
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,291
Watch how fitting
the punishment is

30
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,708
for deviant behavior in
a harsh world such as this.

31
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,791
Now, my sweetie...

32
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,125
Say you don't mean me.

33
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,500
Faster woman! Use
those long legs of yours!

34
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,333
How about I use
them to kick your ass!

35
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,333
Come on, Master.

36
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,666
We don't need
the extra weight.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,291
Why can't we just dump
the wench's body out here?

38
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,708
No way.

39
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,541
Im gonna use her till
she's dried up like a raisin.

40
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,791
Eww! Are you kidding me?

41
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,458
Listen up, Miss Sunshine.

42
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,375
Uh, yeah?

43
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,583
You head on back home.

44
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,291
I'm sure I'll be able
to quote-unquote "handle"

45
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,666
our fine traitorous
friend here myself.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,333
What the hell
were those quotes for?

47
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,375
What are you gonna do to me?!

48
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,750
Fine... I'm going.

49
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,291
Finally, we're alone.

50
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,708
What's this about
you "handling" me?

51
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,625
If you're gonna take me
out, just man-up and kill me.

52
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,208
I'm not gonna kill you.

53
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,791
Then what it is?!

54
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,541
Round and round
and round you go,

55
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,083
and where you
stop no one knows!

56
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,750
Spinny, spinny, spinny, spin!

57
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,416
I just can't wait to cram it in!

58
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,708
Hello?

59
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,708
What is this place?

60
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,625
I call it Desert
Punk's Super-Secret,

61
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,750
Ultra Sticky Love Dungeon.

62
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,375
You've got to be kidding me!

63
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,833
Isn't it just the best?!

64
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,666
I ran across it
while scavenging out here

65
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,166
about five years ago.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,083
These are all historic ruins
I found buried in the sand.

67
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,625
Course I had to
do some remodeling.

68
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,875
I haven't really
told anyone about it yet.

69
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,208
It might be corny,
but I kinda wanted you

70
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,666
to be the first
person to see it.

71
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
And here you are!

72
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,041
I'm honored.

73
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,708
Sorry about the
spinning and blindfolding,

74
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,166
but the exact coordinates
are privileged information.

75
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,041
I couldn't just
walk you on in here.

76
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,125
I have to say...

77
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,458
It's not such a
bad place to keep you.

78
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,541
Keep me?!

79
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,541
I'm outta here!

80
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,833
I gotta few things
to do, you know,

81
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,916
business, meet and greets.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,375
There's food and
water in the back.

83
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,583
Just go ahead and
make yourself right at home.

84
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,625
Damn, I got a foxy hostage!

85
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,625
This just sucks.

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,916
That Punk...

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
He's certainly doing a fine
job of handling the traitor.

88
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,375
I guess I can't blame
him, though, I am pretty hot.

89
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,083
The tiny guy is alone.

90
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,250
I'll have plenty of
chances to bail on him.

91
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,250
I'll take it easy for a while.

92
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,291
Now, if I can just
find his hot tub.

93
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,083
But seriously he's
gotta have a bathroom.

94
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,250
I'm startin to smell funky.

95
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,541
The AC must be busted...
It's freakin' hot in here.

96
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm gonna melt...

97
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,875
Can't take it...

98
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,125
He's waiting for me to die

99
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,833
from dehydration
or heat exhaustion.

100
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Let me outta here!

101
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,375
Can anybody hear me?
Open this door.

102
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,500
Help!

103
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,166
This is for real.

104
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,791
I'm gonna cook to death in here.

105
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,125
Some body help me.

106
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,833
No... No way.

107
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,208
Perfume, brush,
towels, duckie...

108
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
A bath tub...!

109
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,708
Only rich people
actually have baths!

110
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:31,208
I've always wanted to
try one of these suckers out!

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh... Who's gonna see me here?

112
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,625
Nobody's going to know.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,833
This is the life!

114
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,958
I've never seen
such royal treatment!

115
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,500
If everyone could
have a dose of this,

116
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,958
I swear, there'd be
no problems in the world!

117
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,333
My skin's slick with soap it...

118
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,250
feels... so good.

119
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,791
I could so stay in this thing

120
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,375
for the rest of my life!

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
My clothes are gone!

122
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,208
Hello!

123
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,958
You, took them!

124
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,583
I didn't think you needed them

125
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,958
to enjoy my facilities here.

126
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,750
You turned off
the air conditioning!

127
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,416
Yes. I did.

128
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,833
I also ditched all of
those sweaty, worn out clothes.

129
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,666
There's nothing
sexy about dirt.

130
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,583
But I do have
replacements for you.

131
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,916
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

132
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,625
See, you tomorrow.

133
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,083
Not if I have any say about it.

134
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,291
Now he turns on the AC?!

135
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,333
The damn thing won't budge!

136
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,541
Where are my clothes!

137
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
I can't wear this.

138
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,958
I can't give that
perv what he wants!

139
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm gonna catch pnemonia .

140
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,458
Fine.

141
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,166
I'll humiliate myself
and wear this damn thing

142
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,541
if you'd just stop
blasting cold air on me.

143
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,625
I gotta say, I
have good taste.

144
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,375
Women shouldn't wear
stinky desert uniforms.

145
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,083
They should wear bathing
suits and stripper heels.

146
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,916
That one-piece
makes you look like

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,833
six pounds of crap
in a two pound bag,

148
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,875
and those ruby
heels prop you up

149
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,458
like side of beef
in a window. Beautifull.

150
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,375
Why the hell did you
have me put this crap on.

151
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,750
You betrayed us.

152
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,250
You got in bed with the enemy,

153
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,041
and now you're my prisoner...

154
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,583
In the desert, the
sentence for your crime...

155
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,916
is hanging.

156
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,666
So, I can do
what I want with you.

157
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,583
I could chop you up...
No one would touch me.

158
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,666
It seems Junko's day
of reckoning has arrived.

159
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,875
Oh, yeah...

160
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,625
Your day of
reckoning has arrived.

161
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,916
Day of what?

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333
I have a prediction...

163
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,708
About one year from now...

164
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,500
You will be
tending to a tiny baby

165
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,375
that just happens to look
a lot like the Desert Punk!

166
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, all right.

167
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll have your
stupid freakin' baby.

168
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,458
Well, okay...

169
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,875
I expected more
resistance from you...

170
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,458
being a strong, powerful
woman and all that crap.

171
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,916
I don't have any other choice.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can go along with you,

173
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,125
or you can chop
me up, like you said...

174
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,166
I'd be stupid to
allow myself to get hurt.

175
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,500
Good, nice to know
your using reason.

176
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,708
What are your plans
after we have this baby?

177
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,958
I don't have any plans.

178
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,916
You're the one who's gonna
raise the little terror...

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,958
I can't get tied
down to my baby, mama.

180
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,666
I got my whole
life ahead of me.

181
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,541
Our purpose
really is to get it

182
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,708
on then knock you up,

183
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,958
not have some
ever-lasting relationship.

184
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,166
It's kinda my mission.

185
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,583
I feel obligated to
leave children behind.

186
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,625
Kids who will grow up

187
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,500
and take over
after I'm long dead.

188
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,750
Which is a ways off, so
lets get to the nitty-gritty.

189
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,041
Sounds good, champ.

190
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,583
I'm happy to raise the kid.

191
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,583
And I won't cause
you any trouble.

192
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,000
Yee-Haw!

193
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,000
You should scream...

194
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,416
Because one day
I am gonna have

195
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,833
this child find
you and neuter you.

196
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,125
My yam sack.

197
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,250
Ever stop to think
about your own offspring?

198
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,666
Desert Punk's kid?

199
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,833
It'll be maniacal,
hot-blooded, and born to kill.

200
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,500
A ruthless machine
of the desert.

201
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,958
The perfect
combination of traits

202
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,000
for someone who'd
snuff out his own father.

203
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,500
Gabba-goo.

204
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,041
It's me! Your daddy!

205
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,708
You recognize your
own daddy don't you?

206
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,916
Excellent! That was
just how we practiced it!

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,041
Good work, sweetie!

208
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,541
Gabba-goo.

209
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,791
You filthy skank!

210
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,666
Take my son and
turn him against me?

211
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,916
You're the one
who started this!

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,541
Just go ahead
and kill me then.

213
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,083
I don't wanna be apart of
your twisted game anymore!

214
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,916
The only thing that's
gonna get twisted is you!

215
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,708
I'll take that!

216
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,083
Good gracious crap.

217
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,375
I knew my junk would
get me into trouble someday.

218
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
It feels like they're
lodged in my throat.

219
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,166
You're the most
gullible kid I've ever met...

220
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,041
You actually thought
I'd let you knock me up.

221
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,416
I have standards.

222
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,625
What's the deal?

223
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,250
There's gotta be some
way to spring this door open.

224
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,791
I'm the only one who
knows the code for that door.

225
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,833
What is it?

226
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,333
That's confidential.

227
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,833
I know you can't escape.

228
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,291
You know you can't escape.

229
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,875
You know you can't escape,

230
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,333
and I know that
you now-- come to me.

231
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,125
Sounds confusing
but your only choice

232
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,333
is to become mine.

233
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,500
You got spirit. I like that.

234
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,125
Uh, Punk. You alive?

235
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,041
Please be faking!
I can't die in here!

236
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,250
You're the only one who knows

237
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,833
how to get us outta here!

238
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,875
I'm only gonna ask
you one time to wake up!

239
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,625
Wake up! Wake up!

240
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,916
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

241
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,541
You feeling better?

242
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,791
Yeah.

243
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,625
Then pop that lock
and let's both busta move.

244
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,708
Wait a sec... it's coming back.

245
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,666
But I forgot it.

246
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,833
How could you forget?!

247
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Forget what?

248
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,125
Cut it out!

249
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,166
Where are we?

250
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,916
And who the hell are you?

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,375
Wait, who am I?

252
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,833
What's my name again?

253
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,333
I should've seen it coming.

254
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,666
A couple of smacks
to that small head

255
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,791
of his and now
he's got amnesia. Idiot.

256
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,166
Would you just
pull your head out of

257
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,958
your ass and remember?!

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,208
It's all coming back to me now.

259
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,500
That's great!

260
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,458
You and I were going
to do some babymaking.

261
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,041
Pass along genes...

262
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,625
perpetuate the future...

263
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,750
Enough, Don Juan.

264
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,416
This isn't the time or place.

265
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,666
You need to focus on how

266
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,208
you're gonna get me
outta this hell hole!

267
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,583
What did you say...?

268
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,708
The only one
hole I'm interested in

269
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,625
is the one you
have between your legs

270
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,375
that my kid's gonna
come marching out of

271
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,416
in about nine months or so.

272
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,541
You like that, don't you?

273
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,416
I never knew
that stripper heels

274
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,916
could be used so violently.

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,833
Based on my
observations, that's not

276
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,041
the only thing you
don't know about women...

277
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,333
Over time, we've learned

278
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,375
to use every accessory
we have as weapons.

279
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,708
Including birth control?

280
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,375
Well, I've always known
the best birth control

281
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,125
is simply to point at
it and laugh, little guy.

282
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,375
That mouth of yours could be

283
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,875
doing much more
than talking right now!

284
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,666
You ready for another round?!

285
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,958
Any of that jog your memory?

286
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,416
Type the damn code!

287
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,083
Uhh... I, uh...

288
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,625
What is it?!

289
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,791
I told myself to write down
the code but I didn't listen.

290
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,708
You let me know
which punch it is

291
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,333
that kick starts that
trashed out brain of yours!

292
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,333
I can't think when
your hitting me like that!

293
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,333
That doesn't sound
like a passcode!

294
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,791
Spit it out!

295
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,166
God. You're still hot!

296
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,291
I will beat you
all night until I get

297
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,500
the code out of
your sorry perverted face.

298
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,500
I'm gonna die in here,
locked in this metal dungeon.

299
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,666
I deserved a better way to go.

300
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,125
It's pathetic...

301
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,375
I have to die in a room
that smells like hot garbage.

302
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,666
You didn't have to you know?

303
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,666
You could have
just done what I wanted...

304
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,708
That way you'd have simply
walked out of here days ago.

305
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,750
Up yours...!
I hope you die first!

306
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,125
You know...

307
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,875
You get really nasty
when you don't get your way...

308
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,458
I bet daddy called
you princess all your life,

309
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,375
cause you actually believe it.

310
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,375
I hate you.

311
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,666
Hold that mirror
up to yourself, smart guy.

312
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,125
Every move you make
is to get yourself laid...

313
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,791
And the only
guys who act like that

314
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,666
are the guys who
have never gotten any.

315
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,375
That's a lie!
I've had some before!

316
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,958
I got some like...
uh, uh... Yeah...!

317
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,916
Three weeks ago, a waitress!

318
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,083
Yeah, she knew what it
meant to get "Punked" that day!

319
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,625
And that ain't no lie!

320
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,833
It's enouh to
make me wanna cry

321
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,166
when boys lie to women just

322
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,791
to make themselves look cool.

323
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,166
Yeah...? Does it make
you wanna cry as much

324
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,583
as those dumb-ass little poems

325
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,125
you write make me wanna puke?

326
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,500
My poems are good!

327
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,666
Uh, no, they're not.

328
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't think I've
ever been this tired.

329
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,750
I know. I could sleep
for about a week.

330
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,291
We need some water...

331
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,583
And I already drained the tub.

332
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,250
Yeah, that was
all the water I had.

333
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,875
Did the air conditioning die?

334
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,833
I had to use up
all of the electricity

335
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,125
to get you
into that bathing suit.

336
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,916
I'm hungry!

337
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,541
Nothing like a tall glass
of orange water on a hot day!

338
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,875
Who the hell am I kidding?

339
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,583
I'm dejected and bored...

340
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,916
We have a job waiting
for us from Mugenya

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,666
and Master is
out there masterb--

342
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,125
You want one of these?

343
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,708
Totally, thanks.

344
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,083
Where's your boss?

345
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,041
Not that we really
care on anything.

346
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,750
It's not like
I'm scared of him.

347
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,083
He didn't hurt himself did he?

348
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,833
What do these guys want?

349
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,500
Thanks for the food guys!

350
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,666
Wow...! That's rich!

351
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,958
What is it?

352
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,166
What do you say?
Wanna go out with a bang?

353
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,000
Or maybe some heavy petting?

354
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,875
You just don't stop.

355
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,375
You're like an endless
stream of sexual angst.

356
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,291
Thanks, but I'm not
asking for compliments.

357
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,791
I think I have to
satisfy the temptation in front

358
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:57,500
of me cause I could
drop dead any minute,

359
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,375
and I want to feel
alive, just one last time.

360
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,041
That's not crazy, is it...?

361
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,166
I'm just a man.

362
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,375
You're right for
once... I'll do it.

363
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,583
You serious about that?

364
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,958
You're actually going
to let me touch you?

365
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,666
And you won't hit
me or nothing, really?

366
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,708
Right.

367
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,708
This is a dream come true!

368
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,916
But nothing freakish,
deviant, or weird.

369
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,250
Fair enough...
Let's get started.

370
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,458
Hold on.

371
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,750
No more holding me
prisoner or punishing me.

372
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,458
That ends right now.

373
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,250
We're gonna do this
on an even playing field.

374
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,666
One man, one woman.

375
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,041
Whatever you say.

376
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,083
I want it in writing.

377
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,125
Sure!

378
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,625
Thanks for this.

379
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,083
It's hard in
the world we live in

380
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,208
to be respected as independent.

381
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,916
And a thousand years from now,

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
when they dig up our bones,

383
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,583
you and I will
be seen as equals.

384
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,166
Which means a lot to me.

385
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,833
I can't thank you enough.

386
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,416
Even though I'll
try here very shortly.

387
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,750
I don't know why,
but just thinking about

388
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,208
doing you has worn me out.

389
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
Me, too.

390
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,791
I'm just...

391
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm almost too tired to even
think about the next move.

392
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,041
We can catch a few
Z's before we start...

393
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,166
If that's cool...

394
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,458
Sleepy...

395
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,208
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

396
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,416
You're a dynamo!

397
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
Master, it's about
time you woke up.

398
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,333
Perpetuate my bloodline!

399
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,833
I have to make
baby while I'm still live!

400
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,458
Don't worry. I'm
doing it with Junko.

401
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,958
I signed a document saying
that we were both on the uh--

402
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,875
From the feel of things,
she and I already did it.

403
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,416
That's just gross.

404
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,041
Hold on...

405
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,541
Where the hell am I?

406
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,166
You're at the town
hospital in a bed.

407
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,916
Are we're here because
my baby's being born?

408
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,125
He says things like "Gabby-goo"

409
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,291
and I've already chosen
a name for the little tyke...

410
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,041
I'm gonna call him Punkie...

411
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,583
Will you cut
the moron routine?!

412
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,625
You sound like the "Punk"

413
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,375
in your name
turned into "Pathetic"!

414
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,708
What?

415
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,000
And now this whole
situation has turned to shit.

416
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,333
No, it can't be...
Was it a difficult birth?

417
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,416
I remember...!

418
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,750
Junko and I were
stashed away in my lair!

419
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,250
Wait one second!

420
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,166
How did you of all people
find my secret freakin hideout?!

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,791
A few months back
I saw you scurry off

422
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,375
into the desert with a
shovel and building supplies.

423
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,541
Naturally, I was curious.

424
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,083
You sneaky trick...
You followed me?

425
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,250
I did... And you
should thank me.

426
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,500
If I didn't follow you,
you'd be dead...

427
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,666
I had to find you

428
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,750
cause we got a
job offer from Mugenya...

429
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,458
But when I got to the hideout

430
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,458
the stupid door wouldn't open...

431
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,583
So I had to ask
the Machinegun Brothers

432
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,375
to use what they got
and bust into the place...

433
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,791
They did...

434
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,458
And we found you collapsed

435
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,833
on the floor next
to Junko the skank.

436
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,333
Where is she?!
What happened to her?!

437
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,625
You can't let that
filthy hose beast get away!

438
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,083
She left yesterday.

439
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,958
You let her go?!

440
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,041
I had to...!

441
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,916
She had a letter
signed by you that said

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
you absolved her of any

443
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,541
and all wrongdoings
in the past!

444
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,916
You had her
under your dirty thumb

445
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,208
for over a week

446
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,041
and then you just
let her slip away so easily.

447
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,041
Must eat you up inside.

448
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,416
She beat the
sense right out of me.

449
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
Akio check this out!

450
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,708
There's an assload of guns!
And look at all that ammunition!

451
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,250
This is a brand
new freakin bathtub!

452
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,083
Take it! Take it all!

453
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,583
I'm still hungry...

454
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,791
We can trade all this for food!

455
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,458
Oh dear!

456
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,833
Oh, this is wonderful!

457
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,958

483
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,041
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

484
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,041
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

485
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:05,625
<i>It's what you do</i>

486
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,541
Yo! Desert Punk here,

487
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,291
and I wanna let
you know that the, uh...

488
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,250
the Demon of, of something.

489
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,791
It's the, uh, the desert.

490
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,375
Those punches must've
really gotten to him.

491
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,166
Sorry. Anyway, the next episode
is called "A Change of Heart!"

492
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,000
I wonder what they're
gonna change it into?

493
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,750
My vote's for a load of cash!
