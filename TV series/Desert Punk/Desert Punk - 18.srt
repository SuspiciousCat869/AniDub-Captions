1
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,208
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
The one on the couch!

2
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,083
Did you see the last episode?
Need a refresher?

3
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,500
That missile-chested poor excuse

4
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,625
of a whore Junko suckered
Master into another job.

5
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,791
And what do you know, it's a job
all about saving her stupid ass.

6
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,083
I told him we should
just walk away, but, no...

7
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,333
he doesn't listen.

8
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,000
Which is why, at this
moment, we are screwed.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,250
Check out what happens.

10
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,416
Uh, Junko?!

11
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,166
ESPERA! QUE PASO AQUI?!

12
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on...! Dinnertime, kids!

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,541
Don't tell me you
squeezed out another one?

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
That makes number six!

15
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,000
Daddy's gonna have to work much
harder now to feed all of us.

16
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,750
Don't you know it!

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,666
Es muy tarde! Porqué
estoy soñando en español.

18
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,000
What the hell?
Why do I dream in Spanish?

19
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,541
We over slept...!
Look how high the moon is!

20
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,416
It's late...!
Oh, no... jerk... moron...

21
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,583
Yeah... I hate
sleeping on rocks.

22
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,208
It always makes my butt hurt.

23
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,333
You're, uh... In my...

24
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,500
Oh, Master...
What are you doing up?

25
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,625
Hello...! You have
no business sleeping

26
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,958
in the same bag
with a grown man...

27
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,583
What's wrong with your brain...?

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,583
Although I do understand
how you can be drawn in

29
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,083
by my striking good looks
and giant muscles.

30
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,458
Check out that ego...

31
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,000
I was only sleeping next
to you to keep us warm...

32
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,458
We could have frozen
to death out here

33
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,416
if I hadn't done it, tool.

34
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,208
Sick!

35
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,416
He stinks like pee!

36
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,666
We could have used
my suit's heater,

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,875
and drained our only battery...

38
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,625
But we'd be nailed to the wall

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,333
without the enemy locator
device... You get it?!

40
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,208
That's why I warmed your
nasty body up with mine.

41
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,791
So are we gonna go after that
skank or let her get married?

42
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,083
Let's see what my
other head is thinking.

43
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,166
Ooo, let's go save her!

44
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,708
Stop dragging your heels!

45
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,666
This is an emergency situation!

46
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,166
Emergency?

47
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
It's been hours since they left,
and we stopped for a nap.

48
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,000
Shut up.

49
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,125
I bet they're doing it.

50
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,541
Cork it!

51
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
No slimeball smart-guy is
gonna lay a hand on Junko!

52
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,625
I'll show him what's what!
Yeah, he'll be hurting!

53
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,958
If I'm not mistaken, lover boy,

54
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
you've had plenty
of opportunities

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
with Junko and
you have yet to score.

56
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,875
Are you limp or something?

57
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,041
A man's heart is a deep ocean.

58
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,458
There's no way there'd be time.

59
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,958
He'd have to haul
her off, marry her,

60
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,750
and then somehow
manage to convince her...

61
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,083
Master? Master, look at this!

62
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,791
What?! What is it?!

63
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,750
Look at what?!

64
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,833
Don't mean to be paranoid,

65
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,541
but that's three of those
prototype suits, right?

66
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,000
Ballsahurtin Incorporated
must have sent

67
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,541
out a team to find Tech.

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,166
Do you think they
know we're here?

69
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,666
With those suits on, they might.

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,833
But they don't act like it.

71
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,458
Maybe they're just
keeping a low profile

72
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,791
until they can
pounce on their target.

73
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,000
We can't fight four
guys in those outfits.

74
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,500
They'd shred us
into minced meat.

75
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,791
They're walking away.
What are we gonna do?

76
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,541
We're almost out of ammo...

77
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,333
There's no choice.

78
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,375
We have to deal with them.

79
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,125
The trick is
finding the leverage.

80
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,916
Kosuna, what's
our exact location?

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,416
If I'm right,
which I usually am,

82
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,291
there's an abandoned
mine nearby.

83
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,000
Uh, yeah, lemme see.

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
It's about an hours
walk to the west.

85
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,083
Excellent. Time for a pit stop.

86
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,083
You still can't figure out how
to repair that busted com?

87
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,666
How could you tell?

88
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,833
Just a lucky guess.

89
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,666
You think taking that sucker
apart here is a good idea?

90
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,000
That hardware's delicate.

91
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,416
I know what I'm doing...

92
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,750
Fix two or three things...
I'm good.

93
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,666
Do you have any idea
how screwed you are?

94
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,875
Yeah... I thought everything
was going to be smooth...

95
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,333
I can't blame any of this on
my lack of skills or the suit.

96
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,416
It's that Desert Punk of yours.

97
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,666
I don't think I've ever seen
eyes like that on a person.

98
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,625
But the first ones you
hired out to rescue you,

99
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,541
those guys gave me
a bit of a scare.

100
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,791
Thanks to my suit, I didn't
have too much of a problem.

101
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,375
The second chump you hired out
was fairly well known,

102
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,791
if I'm not mistaken.

103
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,041
The third one was a
collector, I think.

104
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,375
The fourth was an inquirer.
And they all failed.

105
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,666
Don't count your chickens yet.
I'm still alive.

106
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,458
I wonder... How many you killed.

107
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,208
What the-- What's that?!

108
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,250
That's Desert Punk!

109
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:41,958
No way!

110
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,958
I knew it... I'm saved.

111
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,083
Help me Punk...! I'm in here...!

112
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,166
You gotta hurry...!
He's already got me naked!

113
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,708
Tech?! Who's with you in there?

114
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,416
I see you. And your friend.

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,208
I guess you and your
little girlfriend made up.

116
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,916
You have no idea
the shit you're in.

117
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,875
Tech... Who are they...?
Tell me.

118
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,125
Ballsahurtin Incorporated
sent them to find me.

119
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,041
And bring me back. Oh no!

120
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,416
That's cheap for
such good stuff.

121
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you serious?

122
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,041
The suits they have are models
D, E, and F of the prototype.

123
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,541
I only have Type C.

124
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,958
And if I know those voices,

125
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,208
it's the same crazy mercenaries
hired to test the suits.

126
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,375
Come on, Tech, my man.

127
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,083
I'm gonna be nice
and give you ten minutes

128
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,083
to scuttle your ass out here.

129
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah. Do that,
and we won't bury you alive.

130
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,083
I'd take that deal
if I were you.

131
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,291
You gotta give up...

132
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,041
They said they'd let
you live if you just go!

133
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,250
He's on his way...!

134
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
That's right...! He surrenders!

135
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,833
If we walk out of here,
they'll kill us...

136
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,416
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

137
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,875
I'll run a distraction...
When I do, you get outta here.

138
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,791
Tech, you can't stay.

139
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,625
It's not like that.

140
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm not giving up
my life for yours.

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,750
I have things I want to do.
See the world, Ventriloquism .

142
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,541
I'm gonna make it out of this!
I refuse to die today!

143
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:35,541
I GOT DREAMS.

144
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,375
His time's up. What's our move?

145
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,416
We're dealing with a death wish.

146
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,333
We'll deliver. Kill him.

147
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,041
There you are, C-Type!

148
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,000
How can he hit us
from so far away?!

149
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,166
It's the suit. C-Type suits have
more accurate distance counters.

150
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,583
They ditched it with our suits

151
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,791
to make room
for the shit locker.

152
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,333
Would you two
stop chatting it up?!

153
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,333
I can't focus on my aim when
you two pop off like ninnies!

154
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,666
He's on the move!

155
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,416
What's he doing leaving
the woman behind?

156
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,708
How should I know?!

157
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,958
And don't kill him.

158
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,708
I've got about a hundred
questions for the thief.

159
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,250
Okay, I'll just
take out his legs.

160
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,166
Corner him in the ravine!

161
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,333
You got it!

162
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,750
Akagi! Go after the girl!

163
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,541
He's trying to give
her time to escape!

164
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,125
Can do!

165
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,875
And watch your ass.

166
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
That chick's no
featherweight. She's lethal.

167
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,500
Trust me. I'll be fine.

168
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,583
You know...

169
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
You're not a bad fighter
for an engineer,

170
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,583
but I gotta ask,
is the broad worth all this.

171
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,750
Uh, yes. She absolutely is.

172
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,833
Sounds like she's
my kind of girl.

173
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,416
Busted!

174
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,208
It's Desert Punk!

175
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,875
He's flying!

176
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,333
I thought you
were alone out here!

177
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,000
To hell with being outnumbered!

178
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,583
He's running away.

179
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,500
A coward's always a coward.

180
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,000
He's got that prototype on and
he's still scared.

181
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,583
But you know what I always say.

182
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,083
There's a time to stay, and a
time to run like a little bitch.

183
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,791
Here.

184
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,291
I assume you'll feel more
comfortable with that one.

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,541
Me? I'm taking this
bad boy right here.

186
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,625
What is this guy thinking...?

187
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,291
It's even loaded.
This must be...

188
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,791
Those guys are after you,
and you got Junko ...

189
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,208
Which puts us on
the same side...

190
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,166
You and I can settle
our differences as soon as

191
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,416
we send those blowhards packing.

192
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,833
If you don't like
the sound of that...

193
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,000
Then shoot me in the back

194
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,208
and see how far you
get fighting alone.

195
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,666
I'm in.

196
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,458
All my life is spent

197
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,500
with one jerk or another
chasing down my ass!

198
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,250
She's got a nice ass.

199
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,750
It'll make a good target.

200
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,041
I know that...

201
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,333
That's Desert Punk's mark.

202
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,000
I have no idea what I'm doing!

203
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,125
Left here!

204
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,958
A dead end!
You gotta be jerking my chain!

205
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,708
End of the line for you, baby.

206
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,541
But, damn, chasing
you sure looked good.

207
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't shoot!
Please, don't kill me.

208
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,458
I'll do anything you want!

209
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,041
That true? Anything?

210
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,791
Of course...!
Whatever you want...

211
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,625
We could get busy here or...

212
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,875
If you got a sleeping bag,
it'd be warmer.

213
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,208
You mean the sex.

214
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,708
Yeah... the sex.

215
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,916
Tempting.

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,250
It can be more than that.

217
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,875
I can do all kinds of things.

218
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,458
Ya know , whatever your into.

219
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,916
Too bad I've got an
issues with slutty chicks.

220
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,166
I can't believe I missed!

221
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,375
Where the hell did
you come from?!

222
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,375
Come on out! I just wanna talk!

223
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,541
This is it! The end!
The big sleep!

224
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,416
I said I wanted to talk to you!

225
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,833
Talk to this.

226
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,791
Nice

227
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,458
Enough!, you sound like a pig!

228
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,875
Master!!

229
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,291
The grenade didn't do it.
Figures.

230
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,916
I'd live forever if
I had one of those suits

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and you shooting at me.

232
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,125
If I hadn't lured that
dingbat down this dead end,

233
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,416
I would have never
gotten close enough

234
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,875
for any kind of shot on him.

235
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,958
And just who are you
calling dingbat, huh?

236
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,208
You.

237
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
Enough! You can't
just use me as a decoy

238
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,333
just to lure that
doofus Tech out of hiding!

239
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,125
Tech, what are you--high?!

240
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,333
We're all gonna
help each other out

241
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,666
until those Ballsahurtin
farts are done with.

242
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,916
Huh?

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,875
I can't afford to act
like an idiot any more.

244
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,750
Has the world gone crazy?

245
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,583
Two hours till sun-up.

246
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,125
We just have to
watch each others backs

247
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,833
for a little while longer.

248
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,625
Do you have a plan
or are we coasting?

249
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,875
I always have a plan.

250
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,916
And a backup.
And another backup.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,708
Come on... It's me.

252
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,208
Maybe we can take cover
behind his huge ego.

253
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,583
We use the daylight.

254
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,166
How do we do that?

255
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,625
I make it two men with Tech.

256
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,875
That's not including the girl.

257
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,333
They ambushed us
once they can do it again.

258
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,750
They're not leaving
this desert alive.

259
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,458
Let's show them what
these suits can really do.

260
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,875
Give Tech the feel of what
it's like to be a hunted dog.

261
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,458
I'll fire off as
many rounds as I want!

262
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,708
What do you know desk jockey?!

263
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,541
That's not what it
says in the manual.

264
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,958
It says--

265
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,208
Yes! Yeah!

266
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,166
You were a damn
good engineer, Tech.

267
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,833
Why'd you have to do it?

268
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,958
Stay behind your desk,
do your job.

269
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,666
But no. You had to come out here

270
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,041
and ruin a
perfectly good career.

271
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,083
Don't worry.

272
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,500
They're just showing off
their suits like spoiled kids.

273
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,458
Those spoiled kids are
close to shooting my face off!

274
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,875
We can't get outta here!

275
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:48,791
Five...

276
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,208
Four...

277
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,625
Three...

278
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,041
Two...

279
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,208
One...

280
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,041
Master, they're here!!

281
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,291
The cavalry!

282
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,041
Right on!

283
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,791
That did it!

284
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,833
Are... Are those tanks?

285
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,708
Those are government tanks.

286
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,875
And you win a prize!

287
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,333
You son of a ...

288
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,458
I keep my word...

289
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,041
I told you we'd
settle our differences

290
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,791
when those guys are done for...

291
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,916
And from the looks of it,
they're out of escape routes.

292
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,916
TANKS! I JUST
FILLED THAT LOCKER!

293
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,166
Please, do not try to escape.

294
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,375
We have you surrounded.

295
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,208
Please, put down your weapons.

296
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,625
We have your surrounded.

297
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,041
Please, give up, already.

298
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,333
We have you surrounded.

299
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,083
No talking tank's gonna
tell me what to do!

300
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,500
Don't tell me you actually
called in the government.

301
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,333
Oh, I did...

302
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,416
Not too far from here
is an abandoned mine.

303
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,458
It used to be a
government place,

304
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,291
and there's still
a top-secret hard-line

305
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,541
to those losers
hooked up inside.

306
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,666
A hard-line?

307
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,958
Yeah, a phone.

308
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,916
Only the top government
jerks and their close,

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,916
personal pals know
about this place.

310
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,166
I knew it...!
You're a government rat!

311
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,875
A rat. I don't think so.

312
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,791
I just know the right people...

313
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,041
And today it happened
to save your ass.

314
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,208
Think about it. Who's the enemy?

315
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,958
The guys who work
for Ballsahurtin?

316
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,000
No. We kill these
three or four guys,

317
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,916
and they'll send eight
to kill us next time.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,208
Then twelve.

319
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,208
But if we take down
the entire corporation...

320
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,166
Problem gone... Then we win.

321
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,583
What...? Ballsahurtin's gone?

322
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,541
Well played again,
Man Im a loser!

323
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,416
Words to live by. I always win.

324
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,625
I don't care what it takes,
I will have my victory!

325
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,333
I lost everything...

326
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,208
Thanks to you and all
the dirt you stirred up,

327
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,416
we were able to uncover all

328
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,416
of the Ballsahurtin
Incorporated secrets.

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
Now that the
North Government has

330
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,958
all of the evidence it needs,
we will shut down Ballsahurtin

331
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,041
for unethical scientific work
and treasonous activities.

332
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,083
Those at the top
will be executed.

333
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,583
The companies'
one thousand employees

334
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,041
and their families will all
be banished to the desert.

335
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,541
And... it's all my fault.

336
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,125
They did it...!

337
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,791
They threatened to fire me...!

338
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,583
I said I was gonna
tell what I knew!

339
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,916
What a loser...

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,166
I don't know any guy
who doesn't act like that...

341
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,208
Always thinking with that
slower second brain of theirs.

342
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,958
You bitch.
This is all your fault.

343
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,208
Our old merc, Junko.

344
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,333
I hear you've had
some business up north...

345
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
The illegal kind of business.

346
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,333
What do you mean?

347
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,708
Don't worry. I'm not
going to arrest you.

348
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,625
I just need your cooperation.

349
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,333
A helpful hand, if you will.

350
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,041
Nothing that's going
to put you in harm's way.

351
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,666
Whoa, no way! Hold up!

352
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,500
What the... There you are!

353
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,250
Who are you?

354
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,041
Hi...

355
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,083
This piece of tail owes me

356
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,625
a buncha cash as
you can see here...

357
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,208
We have a binding contract.

358
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,333
If you take her away,
I can't get paid.

359
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,875
I got a government
seal and everything.

360
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,625
Prick...! What do you think--

361
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,750
Master!

362
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,625
Of course, nothing
happened here today...

363
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,541
There were no witnesses to
any of this... Are we clear?

364
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,250
Help, me!

365
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,958
Let go...!
Get your mitts off...!

366
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,375
You're making me-Master!

367
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,958
Are you okay?

368
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,625
I need some help! Somebody!

369
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,625
He needs a doctor! Help, please!

370
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,541
Master!

371
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,000
Everyone just left.

372
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,041
All of that, and we're
left with a big goose egg.

373
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,583
Man, I'm hungry.

374
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,250
But it serves that
dumb bimbo right!

375
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,750
She deserves whatever
those soldiers are going

376
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,125
to put through her.

377
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,375
Get it?
Pretty good one, huh? Huh?

378
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
Let's go.

379
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:09,958
Okay.

380
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,208
On the walk home,
he didn't say a word to me.

381
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,625
Of course, with
that swollen mouth,

382
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,708
it probably didn't
feel too good to talk.

383
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,375
I don't think the banged up ego

384
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,500
helped the situation
much, either.

385
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,625
I never thought a
signed contract could be

386
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,541
torn up like that.

387
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,375
It makes me think...

388
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:33,041
Is everything we do as
fragile as a piece of paper?

389
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,791
I hope not.

390
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,875
I am the demon of the desert--

391
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,625
I'm sick of how you keep pulling

392
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,375
your punches on these outros.

393
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,583
You gotta pump up.
You're just phoning this in.

394
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,291
Next Time,
'Scratching the Surface."

395
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,875
Uh, better. But not
really. Anyway--

396
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,750
Miss the next episode
and be sorry.

397
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,125
That's my line.
