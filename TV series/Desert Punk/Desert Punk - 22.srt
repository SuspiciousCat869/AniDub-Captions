1
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,250
My name is Kosuna,

2
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,875
and I'm the baddest
power babe to ever

3
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,875
trudge through the
Great Kanto Desert.

4
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm way cute and
everyone loves me!

5
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,000
Um, why are we
showing this? Nevermind.

6
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,041
With my trusty apprentice Mitz,

7
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,166
I'm gonna take this
desert by the balls!

8
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,166
Actually Mitz has
a bit of a condition.

9
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,416
He's got this Hulk-ish
disease or something.

10
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,583
Any emotional shock
will set him off

11
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,208
and he transforms
into this evil monstrosity.

12
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
Pretty nasty, really.

13
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,583
Man, I don't have a clue
how I'm gonna handle this kid.

14
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,000
Anyway, with the miraculous
feat of our mission

15
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,541
being completed, I returned
to Desert Punk's gravestone

16
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,833
to find my hero
Natsuko waiting for me.

17
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,375
She had a wild idea.

18
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,375
You gotta be joking!

19
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,875
So...!

20
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,458
You want me to stand guard
at the First Strategy Council

21
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,125
of the Underground
Mercanaries Union...?!

22
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,166
I can do that.

23
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,708
Over the past
few months, several towns

24
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,791
have been conducting
their own excavations,

25
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,041
which have led to other
enterprises, encouraging

26
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,750
increased independence
from the government.

27
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,166
Our enemies have targeted

28
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,458
and eliminated these rebel
movements with precision.

29
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,750
Enemies?

30
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,291
The government and its troops.

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,833
That's crazy!

32
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,875
Why would the government run
around killing its own citizens?

33
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,416
They'd lose their tax money!

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,750
Come on, Haru.

35
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,333
You know any rebel out
there who's paying taxes?

36
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,916
A dead rebel is just one more
mouth they don't have to feed.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
It's about time the
government understood

38
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,583
that there are more of us
than there are of them.

39
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,583
We're just forced
to play under the table.

40
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,500
No longer will we be pets
to the Oasis Government.

41
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,208
The time of the Underground
Mercenaries is at hand.

42
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,916
For the freedom and
liberty of all citizens

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,208
of all corners of the desert,
we must stand up and be counted.

44
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,208
Freedom and liberty... huh...

45
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,375
That's the purpose of
the Strategy Council.

46
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,333
To find a way
toward those goals.

47
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,041
But if we're the
rebels and the government

48
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
is our enemy, won't
they send their soldiers in

49
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
to bust up our little meeting?

50
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,916
I think she's got a good point.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,791
They could destroy us...

52
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,375
And they wouldn't
think twice about it.

53
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,750
I won't lie to you.
They could show up.

54
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,250
If any of you would like
to back out of this meeting...

55
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,958
That's fine.
There's no shame in walking.

56
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,958
Screw that...! Count me in...

57
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,500
Any enemy of my
Master's is my enemy, too.

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
We're with you till it's over...

59
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,000
Nobody's getting within
shooting distance of my sister.

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,791
What the hell good am
I if I'm not out there

61
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,333
backing up my brothers
and sister? I'm in.

62
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,625
Me, too.

63
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm totally gonna
protect the shit outta you.

64
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,750
Thanks, guys.
I knew I could count on you.

65
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,958
You're in, boys!

66
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,583
Right on!

67
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,375
Um, hey, uh, Kosuna?

68
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,958
Mitz? What are you doing here?

69
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,041
You're supposed to be walking

70
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,625
that dumb lady's
Green Gordian Beetle.

71
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,500
There was a problem...

72
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,833
It kept wanting to
walk away from me so,

73
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,916
I just tugged on
its leash some and...

74
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,000
Please tell me you didn't!

75
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

76
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,916
Please forgive us! I'm sorry!

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,458
We didn't know the
leash was so tight!

78
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,916
We can't apologize
enough for this!

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,083
I am so sorry! We'll replace it!

80
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,291
I can't believe
I let you have that thing

81
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,166
without getting the
money from her up front.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,583
Am I in trouble?

83
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,583
You bet your sweet ass
you're in trouble!

84
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,875
I really am sorry, Kosuna.

85
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,208
Sorry don't put the
head back on the beetle.

86
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,041
Just go get ready for tomorrow.

87
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,208
Okay!

88
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,083
Idiot, can't even
take a bug for a walk

89
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,041
without screwing
the whole thing up.

90
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,250
 Maybe he's not so bad.

91
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,166
You fellas have all the
equipment you'll need?

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
Absolutely!

93
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,416
We're armed to the teeth!

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,875
You can send government
soldiers, ghosts,

95
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,541
or robotic monsters at us!
We got it all covered!

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,958
We're losing daylight!
Let's get a move on!

97
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,500
Move your tail Mitz!
We can't wait forever!

98
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,583
I know! I'm sorry!

99
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,916
Off to work, young lady?

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,125
Oh, hi, Matsu.

101
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,541
Looks like you're ready for war.

102
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
So what's up you got a den
of thieves to exterminate?

103
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,916
Uh, yeah, something
like that. Just a job.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,166
What about you?

105
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,791
Looks like you got stuck
with all the kids today.

106
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,083
My wife spends
so much time at home

107
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,625
with the kids, I thought maybe
she could use a day to herself.

108
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,791
Take some time off.

109
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,500
Wow. That's really nice of you.

110
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,333
Husband's duties.

111
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,666
Anyway, I wanted
to tell you about

112
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,041
an interesting order
I had come in the other day.

113
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,708
It was a fella
you've run with some.

114
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,750
He asked for a winch exactly
like the one Kanta had.

115
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought that was strange.

116
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,500
Daddy! Come on!

117
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,333
Oh, the natives are restless!

118
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,333
Well, good luck on your job.

119
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,291
Thanks!

120
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,250
Oh, and Matsu?

121
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,333
Yeah?

122
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,666
When I get back,
will you tell me more

123
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,583
about that guy asking
about the winch?

124
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,083
Yeah, sure... we'll talk later.

125
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,416
We're waiting!

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,708
Can it!

127
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,833
See ya later, Matsu!
Say hi to the wife for me!

128
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,333
Bye-bye!
See ya later, alligator!

129
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,958
What's an alligator?

130
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,500
It has begun.

131
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:22,583
The warriors will soon
breach the gates of battle.

So how's that apprentice
working out for ya?

142
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,625
He looks like a D. B.

143
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,041
I wish I could argue with you.

144
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,375
He doesn't know anything.

145
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,208
He can't even load a gun,
never mind shoot one.

146
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,625
Everything he touches
turns to runny crap.

147
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,916
Yep. Douche bag.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,250
He was supposed to walk
a stupid beetle earlier

149
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,250
and he killed it.

150
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,291
I can't put him
out there with us.

151
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,750
Who knows what'll happen.

152
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,541
What're you gonna do about him?

153
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,916
I don't know.

154
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,291
Knocked a shart out.

155
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,333
Everybody out.

156
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,333
Cool we're there, or, uh, here.

157
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,625
This place looks familiar.

158
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,791
Yeah.It's Skeleton City.

159
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,833
But... I don't get it.

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,333
Sure you do.
You've been here before.

161
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,916
With Kaizuka.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,291
He found this place twenty years
ago, well before you were born.

163
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,041
I know. But last time
I could have sworn

164
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,416
it took us forever to get here.

165
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,250
Kaizuka's a smart man.

166
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,541
He led you down the scenic route

167
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,750
so you wouldn't be able
to find your way back.

168
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,250
Well I feel dumb.

169
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,125
Listen up.

170
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,833
The first guard team was
in place an hour ago.

171
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,875
You're team 2. I need --

172
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,833
Who's shooting?

173
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,166
Kosuna, wait!

174
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,833
I'm the Master!
I give the orders!

175
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,083
Now stay put!

176
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,416
No, I give the orders--Now stop!

177
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,833
It might be the enemy!
I have to check!

178
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,625
This is bad.

179
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,416
It looks like they
were just shooting

180
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,750
in all directions at random,

181
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,333
like they didn't
even have a target.

182
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,166
How rude.

183
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,166
That wasn't the way I was
raised to welcome old friends.

184
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,416
I'm not your friend!
Who are you?

185
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,333
You don't even recognize me?

186
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,750
Pity, because I remember
you very well, little Kosuna.

187
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,666
But seeing you all by your
lonesome is a new sight.

188
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,166
I'm used to you
always being stuck

189
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,833
behind Desert Punk
like shit on a boot heel.

190
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,833
Watch your mouth!

191
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,291
Oh, my mouth's not shown.

192
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708
And shouldn't an
Underground Mercenary

193
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,416
be able to take some ribbing?

194
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,875
How did you know that?!

195
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,125
Because he's one of us.

196
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,833
Why'd you do that?

197
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,083
We hired him to help us.

198
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,166
We need all the
muscle we can get.

199
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,916
Something's not right here.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,833
These men were slaughtered.

201
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,333
They were fighting
something they couldn't see.

202
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,000
But they're
government-trained soldiers.

203
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,166
This should not happen.

204
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,166
It's a boot print.

205
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,416
Fancy footwork still
leaves traces behind,

206
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,458
it doesn't matter how many
men you kill in the process.

207
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,750
Natsuko!

208
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,583
It's all right!
We're here to save you!

209
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,416
Don't move! We'll come to you!

210
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
We're your heroes!

211
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,666
Hold it right there!

212
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,833
What are you doing here?!

213
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,375
You should have stayed at
your position like I told you!

214
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
Yeah, we just figured, uh--

215
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,541
You don't figure anything.

216
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,666
We might be underground mercs,

217
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,500
but we still have
a chain of command.

218
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,083
I know that you're the commander

219
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,458
and we're the grunts and all,
but we're also your brothers.

220
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,291
And as your brothers,
we get worried about you.

221
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,291
Yeah. You don't have
to bite our heads off.

222
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,708
Forget it. It's cool.

223
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,208
I want Rain Spider and
Kosuna tracking the enemy.

224
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,291
Stryker, you go with them.
Report back to me ASAP.

225
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,333
We'll get it done.

226
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,916
 We make a fine team.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,916
Uh, what should I do?

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,250
Are you brain dead?

229
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,458
We just talked about this!
You wait in the truck!

230
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,208
It's so sweet to see how much
you care for that small one.

231
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,583
He must mean a lot to you.

232
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
I'll sell him
to you for ten yen.

233
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,166
Mitz is gonna
have to go with you.

234
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,166
Does he have to?

235
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,250
He'll never learn to fight

236
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,791
if he's always
sitting in the truck.

237
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,916
Okay, Natsuko. Whatever you say.

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Now that the business is over...

239
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,916
I'm gonna find our prey!

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,375
Wait for us! We're a team!

241
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Looks like the
party's already started.

242
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,083
You ready to go?

243
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
Yeah, sure.

244
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,250
This is looking bad!

245
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,333
These prints are
headed toward the hall!

246
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,583
What?

247
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,125
They just stop.

248
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,708
He must've used a
rocket winch or something

249
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,166
to shoot straight up like that.

250
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,583
I'm gonna die!!

251
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,000
Kosuna, what is that thing?!

252
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,666
The name is Master!

253
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,500
Kosuna behind you!

254
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,416
Go go!

255
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,541
I've never seen one
of those things before.

256
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,291
It's, it's a ghost!

257
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,750
How many ghosts do you know
that are handy with an uzi?

258
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,291
We can barely see it
and we're in the dark

259
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,625
as to its true nature--sure
sounds like a ghost to me.

260
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,000
You're hurting me.

261
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,791
It's a remnant
from the Dark Ages.

262
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,541
Designed with unmatched
reconnaissance abilities.

263
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,625
It can distort the
air particles around

264
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,458
itself making it invisible
to the human eye...

265
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,833
It was revolutionary.

266
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,583
It's going to
go after the council!

267
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,833
An invisible enemy.

268
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,041
Sounds like the kind of opponent

269
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,250
who might actually
pose a challenge.

270
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,625
Shut up! You're not helping!

271
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,166
I mean he might pose
a challenge to you.

272
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,000
But because this is
a contract job for me.

273
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,500
It's not worth dying for.

274
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,125
Good luck suckers!!

275
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,875
He can't just leave us here!

276
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,166
Adios, amigos.

277
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,125
That dirty fruit-cake!

278
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,625
We can't just stay here
pinned down like this.

279
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,208
Are you okay? You sound weird.

280
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,958
I don't care if it's the
baddest robot ever built

281
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,041
or if it destroyed the living
world during the Dark Ages...

282
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,666
Nothing is gonna hold me back
from completing my mission...!

283
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,958
We have to move!

284
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,958
The time to fight is now!

285
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,958
These robots have to be stopped!

286
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,250
No more children of the Dark
Ages can be revived in our time!

287
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,791
Not if we're ever going
to survive this awful life!

288
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,208
The First Strategy Council

289
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,000
of the Underground
Mercenaries must succeed!

290
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,750
For the lives, liberty,
and freedom of all people

291
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,666
of the desert,
today the world will change!

292
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Freakin' do-gooder.

293
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,708
That guy is the coolest!

294
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,291
Serious?

295
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,083
I need a battle update!

296
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
I have sustained
a myriad of scratches,

297
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,750
but nothing that caused
functionality problems.

298
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,416
Well then be more careful.

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,791
There's only one of you.

300
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,041
We can't afford to lose you
this late in the game.

301
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,250
Breaking is not an
option with my equipment.

302
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,833
I will execute the mission.

303
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,166
I'm counting on you.

304
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,041
And just so you know,
your master has come

305
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,125
here today to
watch you in action.

306
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
Please give my
best to my master.

307
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,583
I will not disappoint.

308
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,666
He told me to give
you his best, Master.

309
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,291
Said you'll be proud.

310
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,458
Do you guys need a break?

311
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,750
No, I'm totally in shape.

312
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,083
Mitz, have you not been
exercising, like I said?

313
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,333
I've been too
busy walking beetles!

314
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,541
So is this the place?

315
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,541
I thought they were holding

316
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,083
the council in
a conference hall.

317
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,375
They are. The hall was
built in the ruins below us.

318
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,083
Natsuko and the
Machinegun Brothers

319
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,791
should already be
down there waiting.

320
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,083
We should go.

321
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,666
What about old man Kaizuka?

322
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,625
I expect he's there, as well.

323
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,791
That is good
information to hear.

324
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,375
I certainly do appreciate
you leading me here.

325
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,583
While sometimes you
are sly in your doings,

326
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,791
other times you move as if
you are ruled by your emotions.

327
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,375
Humans are such
interesting specimens.

328
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,791
It is with reluctance
that I must end your life.

329
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,375
Kosuna, you gotta do something!

330
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,416
No, you do!

331
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,291
Huh?

332
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,375
Do that hulk-ish thing you do!

333
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,708
The what?

334
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,125
If you can change into
that monster like thingy,

335
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,875
then we might make
it out of this alive!

336
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,375
I don't know what you want!

337
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,791
There's gotta be an
easier way to do this!

338
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,291
No, don't!

339
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,208
I can tell by the sound of your
voice what's gonna happen!

340
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,625
Being a teammate
is all about sacrifice!

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
Why are you hurting me?

342
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,375
I didn't do anything wrong!

343
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,125
I know you're in there,
you giggling idiot!

344
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,250
Pull off your gloves
and come out fighting!

345
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,791
Get angry, Mitz! Mitz
has zits and he's the pits!

346
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,500
Why aren't you changing?!

347
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,250
My name is Stryker
and as a fighter

348
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,041
for the freedom and
liberty of all people,

349
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,958
I will not give up the fight.
I will carry on !!!

350
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,083
For the children of the world!

351
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,583
Those were good moves.

352
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,208
You are a strong human.

353
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,041
I look forward to
fighting you in the future,

354
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,125
but at this time, I have
a mission to complete.

355
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,708
I wish you a safe journey

356
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:31,208
until we meet again
when I will destroy you.

357
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,125
But we're supposed to fight.
I made a speech.

358
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,250
I'll get him!

359
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,458
Negative.

360
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
He's heading underground
toward the council!

361
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,291
That's hilarious.

362
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,833
I didn't think my
string barriers

363
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,375
would be tripped at all,

364
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,791
and to be honest, I expected
more from a machine like you.

365
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,750
To think that a coat
of paint is all it took

366
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,041
to render your Dark Age
stealth capabilities useless.

367
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,500
Rain Spider, you're back!

368
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, he is, and with
one hell of a plan too!

369
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,458
I don't know if
this counts as a plan.

370
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,833
It sounded more like
he stumbled into it.

371
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,333
Let's stop talking
and shoot this guy?!

372
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,000
You got it!

373
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,000
My thoughts exactly!

374
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,416
I do not believe that the
ancients from the Dark Ages

375
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,666
can be defeated
by such a thing as paint.

376
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,125
Let me show you.

377
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,166
Move!

378
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,458
Thanks, Stryker!

379
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,416
This sucks! We almost
had that guy down!

380
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:36,333
The robot's problem is that
he always thinks like a robot.

381
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,333
Calculating next move.
Probability: eighty percent.

382
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,625
We can't let him
reach the council!

383
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,958
He's gone!

384
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,208
Natsuko and her
brothers can handle him!

385
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:59,291
My favorite part
of the match--endgame.

386
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,000
He won't make it --

387
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,500
What the holy molly
just happened?

388
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,500
No, what about the council?

389
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,875
Do you think
they're okay? Master?

390
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,041
The woman actually did it!

391
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,041
See you guys on the flip-flop.

392
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,750
I am so sick of that guy
running away from everything.

393
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,000
Uh, Master?!

394
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,583
I think we might need
to run out of here, too!

395
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,416
I love the sound of explosions.

396
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,583
You find anything
over there yet?!

397
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,708
Man, I ain't found shit!

398
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,541
What?! You're telling
me the whole conference

399
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,916
was nothing but
a gigantic lie?!!

400
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm sorry, but we needed a way

401
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,916
to draw the enemy out
and eliminate them.

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,541
This was our best option.

403
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,708
Wow. That is not cool.

404
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,625
You lied to us, sis.

405
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,833
I gotta say,
props to you, Sergeant.

406
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,500
I never would have guessed that
you'd actually use me as bait...

407
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,541
That was one smooth move.

408
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,833
It was a nice
trap set up by Natsuko,

409
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,791
no matter who was
in the crossfire.

410
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,250
I'm glad we could help.

411
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,916
It's a good thing
only the target fell

412
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
into the trap and none
of us went tumbling after.

413
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,708
That was never part of the plan.

414
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,583
Sergeant, I found it!

415
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,875
Is that all that's left?

416
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,041
Is it still alive, or aware?

417
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,000
I am impressed.

418
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,041
Your ability to execute
effective strategy is admirable.

419
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,416
What about the rest of him?

420
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,958
Disintegrated, most of it.

421
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,916
But some got buried
under the rubble.

422
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,750
Works for me.

423
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,166
You wanted to know
this thing's secrets

424
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,125
so badly that you would
build up this elaborate charade

425
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,333
and risk all of our lives?

426
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,958
It wasn't my decision.
This was all Kaizuka.

427
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,416
Figures. He always
pulls crap like this.

428
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,208
Either way we got what
he wants so it doesn't matter.

429
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,291
Who's shooting at us!

430
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,458
Up there!

431
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,791
Shit.

432
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:11,750
Master. Your.
Skill. Is. Admired.

433
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:18,125
You. Are. Master. You. Are.

434
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,000
Who was he calling Master?

435
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,333
Amazing.

436
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,375
You've got skills hitting
it from this far away.

437
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,958
And you're a human, which
is the real shocking part.

438
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,416
How did you learn--

439
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,500
And he's gone.
He always does that.

440
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,458
See you later, guys.

441
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,958
Bye, Kosuna.

442
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,291
I feel like I could
sleep for a year.

443
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,500
I haven't been this tired

444
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,250
since the last time
I went to Skeleton City.

445
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,500
What do we have
for tomorrow, Kosuna?

446
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,833
This again? I told you--

447
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,083
Sand! We need sand! Hurry!

448
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,041
Who has the shovels?!
I can't find them!

449
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,375
Where is the fire team?!

450
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,916
They should be here by now!

451
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,166
How could this happen?

452
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,208
What about Matsu's family?

453
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,916
He's got six kids in there!

454
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,916
It's no use!
The flames have taken it!

455
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,541
We can't get inside!

456
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,875
Not Matsu...

457
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,500
He asked for a winch exactly
like the one Kanta had.

458
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,791
I thought that was strange.

459
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,458
When I get back,
will you tell me

460
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,125
more about that guy
asking about the winch?

461
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,375
Yeah sure, we'll talk later.

462
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,791
I am Rain Spider,
collector of the desert.

463
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,833
If you run into me, you run
into the face of true fear.

464
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,291
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

465
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,541
How many of these have you done?

466
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,583
You didn't even
bother to mention that

467
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,041
there are only
two episodes left!

468
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,333
Read the script next time.

469
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,791
On the next episode,
"Voices in the Wind".
