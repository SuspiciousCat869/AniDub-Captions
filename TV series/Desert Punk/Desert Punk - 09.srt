1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,083
All right, dammit...!

16
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,458
Enough! What do you want?

17
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,291
I'm not buying
what you're selling!

18
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,708
So you can, uh, leave now.

19
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,375
What's up Punky?

20
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,083
You jerk, is this how you act

21
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,833
when a beautiful
woman like me shows up

22
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,958
at your door?

23
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,666
Yeah, well shit
always hits the fan

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,583
whenever you come around.

25
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,541
Hmm, well so much

26
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,041
for the sweet hookup
I was gonna give you.

27
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,791
Master, Master!

28
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,208
Master?

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,291
She's my apprentice.

30
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,666
Desert Punk has an apprentice?

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,125
Whoa! Check out those hooters!

32
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,500
So, Master...
These cans have a name?

33
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,041
You can call her Junko...

34
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
She's the perfect example
of what you don't want

35
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,041
to be when you grow up.
A gold-digging whore.

36
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,375
Course, she's got a nice rack.

37
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,958
Right. Jeez, this is
the first time I've seen

38
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,958
a pair of golden
bozos this big in person.

39
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,625
You know, other
than fat, sloppy ones.

40
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,041
Don't forget...

41
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,125
Your mom had a nice pair
of firm, shapely melons also.

42
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, I know. I wasn't talking

43
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,708
about my mom,
just old, tubby ladies.

44
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,083
Funbags don't have to be tubby!

45
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,875
You think you can
trick me again...?

46
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,666
Shoving your milk sacks in my
face so I'll let down my guard?

47
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,916
What was that?

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,875
I've decided to start
investing in my future

49
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,958
with this
little one right here.

50
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,541
Face it, you've hit your peak.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,125
It's just a matter of time
before you start fading away.

52
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,958
I give it five years
and those cans'll

53
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,708
be banging on your kneecaps.

54
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,041
By the time big
bertha over there

55
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,250
starts going down hill,

56
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,833
Kosuna will just be
starting to blossom...

57
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,666
Then she can do all the work,
while I sit back and retire!

58
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,125
No... there's no way...

59
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,791
I've got more than five years...

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,625
Maybe I really
should get married...

61
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,291
Before I lose my looks.

62
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,958
If my boobs start to
sag then, what will I do?!

63
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,291
I don't think I could take it...

64
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,583
If only I could have both.

65
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,333
Junko's ripe Winnebagos now

66
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,125
and Kosuna's fresh
muffins later. Heaven!

67
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,291
Master, you are so predictable.

68
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,916
This here's Kaizuka,
our new employer.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,291
At 56 years of age,
he's become the Kanto Desert's

70
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,541
top authority on locating
treasure from the old times.

71
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,625
Later!

72
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,083
But... But wait!
Where are you going...?

73
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,666
The fee for us
is ten million yen!

74
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,333
You got sand on your brain?!

75
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
Do you really think
this old dried up tea bag

76
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,000
could actually come up with
ten million yen to pay us?

77
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,458
He's a freakin'
toad! Look at him!

78
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,458
A kickass toad!

79
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,666
Okay, what's the deal?

80
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,750
This is not your run
of the mill blue-hair!

81
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,250
He's just a 56 year-old guy

82
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,375
that obviously stays in shape.

83
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,041
Wait a minute! I think
I've heard of this guy.

84
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,166
Yeah!

85
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,333
Master, who is this old-timer?

86
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,041
He's the guy that
discovered the ancient game

87
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,916
of Living deep within the
ruins of the Dark Ages city.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,916
Kaizuka reproduced
the game, sold copies

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,250
of it all over Kanto
and made tons of sweet cash.

90
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,125
Now, this old, oatmeal-faced
fart is totally loaded!

91
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,750
He played the game
of Living for real

92
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,666
and scored more than
just measly beer tokens!

93
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,541
Oh, great lord moneybags...

94
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,791
You know, you only
get the ten million yen

95
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,250
if I see some results.

96
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,541
Certainly. Yes, sir!

97
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,666
Um, so what exactly
is the job, if I may ask?

98
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,333
We're going after
treasure you moron.

99
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,166
So Kaizuka, do these two
meet with your approval?

100
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,833
Yeah... just as long as they do

101
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,791
what I tell them and
take care of the gear

102
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,291
without giving me
any lip, they'll do...

103
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,333
They're so damn small

104
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
I suppose they
won't eat too much.

105
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,541
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

106
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Thank you!

107
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,083
Besides... you come
very highly recommended

108
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,833
by my sweet princess here so,

109
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,166
I'm sure you'll do fine.

110
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,708
Oh, Mister Kaizuka...

111
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:56,875
I'm so happy I was able to
please you with my suggestion.

112
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,333
Junko, my darling,
you always please me

113
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,000
with everything you do.

114
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:01,875
Everything?

115
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,375
I know who you are Desert Punk,

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,208
but what's the deal
with the stumpy one?

117
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,458
Junko didn't mention
anything about her.

118
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,083
Oh, this is Kosuna
my peon apprentice.

119
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,125
She's in training learning
to be a treasure hunter.

120
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,416
Well then, as
an apprentice she won't

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,166
be getting a cut of the
reward money, now will she?

122
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,875
Okay, let's get going!

123
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,166
You kids go grab the
gear and roll on out.

124
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,208
Yes, sir!

125
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,333
You'll never catch me.

126
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
Oh yes I will. Here I come.

127
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,375
Master, I gotta say, this
stuff is getting really heavy.

128
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,291
Yeah, what the hell
is he making us haul?

129
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,041
You little punks
are falling behind!

130
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,250
Pick up the pace!

131
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,625
Coming sir!

132
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,250
Bandits moving in, go get 'em!

133
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,250
Right away...

134
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,000
This sandstorm!
I can't see a thing!

135
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,708
Get out there
and find the road!

136
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,125
If I go out there now,
I may never get back!

137
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,083
Oh shut up and
stop being a pussy.

138
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,666
Find that thing now!

139
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,083
Okay...

140
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,458
Hey Punk, whip
me up some dinner!

141
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,166
Yes sir!

142
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,625
Ten million yen,
ten million yen...

143
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,333
Ten million... ten million.

144
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,583
I had no idea you
were so domesticated.

145
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,125
For ten million yen,
I'll cook and clean,

146
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,708
hell, I'll even spit
shine his toilet seat...

147
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,208
Like my old man used to tell me,

148
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,250
money can make a beggar
out of any dignified man.

149
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,333
So Punk, are you saying
you're a dignified man?

150
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,333
Money, money, money, money,

151
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,625
money, money, money, money...

152
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,458
Yeah, he's losing it.

153
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,583
Well, maybe you can
explain this to me cause I...

154
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,500
Why does a rich
dude like Kaizuka go out

155
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,666
on an expedition with
just the three of us?

156
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,541
If he were to put
some real money into it,

157
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,291
and you know he's got
it, he could probably find

158
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,416
a ton of treasure
out in the ruins.

159
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,750
Yeah, but that's not his style.

160
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
I guess he's a
bit of a romantic...

161
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,958
you know likes to do
things the old-fashioned way.

162
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,958
For him, it's really
nothing more than a hobby.

163
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,625
That's damn cute...
So, tell me totty top...

164
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,250
Yeah, what?

165
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,416
How you do it...?

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,875
How do you always
sniff out the money...

167
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,708
You've gotta have some sixth
sense that leads you to it...

168
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,916
Can you smell it?

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,333
Oh, I just always seem to be

170
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,166
at the right place
at the right time.

171
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,208
Come on, I see the way you
are around that old geezer.

172
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,458
Did... Did he... um...

173
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,333
Did you let him...
Did he ram you?

174
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,833
And what if he did?

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,333
Are you jealous?

176
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,708
Yeah I'm jealous...

177
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,333
I'll beat you down
you two timing hussy!

178
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,875
The mean old bastard
wants his dinner.

179
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,791
Yes sir! Right away!
Here comes the food!

180
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,958
Whoa, nelly.
That was a close one.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,666
Gee, it must be tough
for you at this age,

182
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,375
I mean, with you
being so small, you know.

183
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,958
Oh I didn't mean...!

184
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,125
I didn't mean the
size of your breasts.

185
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,375
You know, having big cans
is not all that great...

186
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,791
It really can be quite
tiring on the shoulders.

187
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,416
When you run they're
always flopping around

188
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,541
and hitting you in the face.

189
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,750
One time I busted my
own lip jogging...

190
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,916
I'm so worried they're gonna
sag, I do these all the time.

191
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,500
They say this
exercise builds up

192
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,958
the muscles under your
jugs and keeps them

193
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,500
from losing their
cantaloupe-like firmness.

194
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,041
What the heck's
your problem kid?

195
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,166
Pretty soon, they'll be sagging

196
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,208
like Kaizuka's hacky sack.

197
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,125
You, foul-mouthed
little cowbag...!

198
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,000
What's that big dumb stupid
head been teaching you anyway?

199
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,083
Stuff!

200
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,083
This tastes like
ass, you waste of space!

201
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,958
Make something
that's actually food!

202
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,250
Yes, sir...

203
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,250
Status report.

204
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,083
Nothing's changed
with the Game Master.

205
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,916
GPS tracking module
switching to stand-by mode.

206
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,208
Stop poking me
you dirty old man...

207
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,833
Master, are we there yet?

208
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,833
Yeah, we're there.

209
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,166
Exactly, where
are we going anyway?

210
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,416
What am I, the answer machine?

211
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,333
Answer machine?

212
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,416
He's taking us to help him

213
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
find some hidden treasure.

214
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
He's not gonna
tell us where it's at

215
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,916
before we get there and
risk us bumping him off.

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,333
You think the skank knows?

217
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,291
I doubt it.

218
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,541
Maybe there's a map?

219
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,875
No way!

220
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,291
That coffin dodger would
never do something stupid

221
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,875
like writing it down on a map

222
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,375
for anyone to find, or steal.

223
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,208
He's even got
us running around in

224
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,458
circles out here so we can't
remember how to get there.

225
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,500
I have no idea where we are.

226
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,250
Kaizuka may act like
an old, horny bastard

227
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
but he knows
exactly what he's doing...

228
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,916
He's a total pro.

229
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,083
It's all that tramp's fault.

230
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:19,125
That filthy stupid tramp
with those huge bazookas.

231
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,958
Gee, it must be tough
for you at this age,

232
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,291
I mean, with you being so small.

233
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,625
Just you wait, scag.

234
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,708
I'll show you and
those boobs of yours.

235
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,666
I'm being boob-wrangled!

236
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,000
This sucks!

237
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
Following some old
fart across the desert to

238
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,083
who knows where,
sweating my tail off...

239
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,166
But, I guess ten million
yen kinda makes it worth it.

240
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
If this works out, that'll
be a nice chunk of change

241
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,708
to sock away and spend at
my leisure, if the guy pays.

242
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,375
It's ten thousand...

243
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,375
for touching these babies.

244
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,625
Imagine if I
had a million yen...

245
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,541
I could pet those
Chihuahuas a hundred times.

246
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,333
Just thinking
about it-- a hundred times--

247
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,541
kinda, kinda,
kinda gives me a chub.

248
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,916
What would she
charge for a lick?

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,333
Or just a little suckle?

250
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,916
Okay, I've got to
stop thinking about this.

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,291
I'm getting some full wood

252
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,958
and the desert is no
place to try and rub one out.

253
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,250
Dead dogs, my
grandma, dead dogs,

254
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,625
my grandma, dead dogs,
my grandma ...

255
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,041
Ok that worked.

256
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,125
Eh, maybe not.

257
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,666
We made it.

258
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,500
It looks just like
it did the last time.

259
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,833
Punk, I ain't paying you

260
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,541
for lounging around on your ass.

261
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,458
Get up and go scout the area!

262
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,833
Okay, no problemo...

263
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,125
It sure is quiet.

264
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,375
Kinda spooky, too.

265
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,833
What's up with you?

266
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,083
How come you're
not saying anything?

267
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,041
I've been all over and seen

268
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,875
all kinds of different places.

269
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,458
And, what I haven't
seen first hand,

270
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,166
I've heard stories about.

271
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,333
I thought I knew
every nook and cranny

272
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,541
of this Kanto desert,

273
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,208
but I've never heard
of anything like this.

274
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,708
Show's you what I know.

275
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,125
I didn't think old cities
like this even existed anymore.

276
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,250
Kaizuka, why did you send
them out scouting like that?

277
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,291
I thought you said this place
was completely uninhabited.

278
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,666
What's with this
tweaked out feeling

279
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,250
of dread I've
got coming over me?

280
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
This is definitely not like

281
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,041
any other ghost
town I've ever been in.

282
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,666
I have no idea why,
but I feel really on edge.

283
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,875
Master!

284
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,791
Holy crapstick...

285
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,083
I guess we found it...

286
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,458
the treasure hunter's graveyard.

287
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,125
A graveyard?

288
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,333
No wonder I've never
heard of this place before.

289
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,416
Doesn't look like anyone's

290
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,125
ever made it out
alive to tell the tale.

291
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,833
Poor dead guys...

292
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,375
What's that?!

293
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,500
Motion sensor! Aw.

294
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,416
Hey, wait for me!

295
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,916
Calm down and
keep your eyes peeled!

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,666
We gotta find
who we're fighting!

297
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,041
I can't see anything!

298
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,416
The alarm's coming
from close by though!

299
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,541
This sucks! Where is it?!

300
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,833
Hold your position!

301
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,250
Okay, where are you?
Where are you?

302
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,583
Show yourself
would you, come on!

303
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,833
Well that got off the
ground really quickly.

304
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
This is good news for us.

305
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,875
It means that no one has
gotten to that treasure yet.

306
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,416
What do you think
you're doing?

307
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,583
Why are you putting
on that combat suit?

308
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,125
Here's the deal...

309
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,458
I'm gonna go down
there now to check

310
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,000
on things with my own two eyes.

311
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,125
Um... no... don't.

312
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,000
This isn't turning
out to be the quick in

313
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,708
and out job you
made it seem like...

314
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,791
I have to get down there
and see what's happening.

315
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,416
Well, if you insist on going,

316
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,416
then you can take
this baby with you...

317
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,958
Hold on... Here you go.

318
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,291
Whoa! How did you
get your hands on that?!

319
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
Whatever it is,
it's gaining on us!

320
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,000
Why did you shoot at them?!

321
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,166
For all you know,
they could've been

322
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,041
friendly folks
just checking us out.

323
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,291
Now, they want us
to join the dead guys!

324
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,625
Well, I'm sorry okay?
I got scared!

325
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,916
Listen kid, if
you're going to shoot,

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,083
make sure you hit somebody.

327
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,291
Otherwise,
you're wasting bullets

328
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,250
and it comes out of your pay.

329
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,500
Oh come on, man!

330
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,333
You pissed him off
so it's all your fault!

331
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,000
Back off! I said I'm sorry!

332
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,666
If he starts shooting,
I'm using you as shield.

333
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,291
Oh crud.

334
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,291
The alarm stopped!

335
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,791
Maybe we're out of its range.

336
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,208
Don't get too cozy.

337
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,958
I've got a
tingle my in sack that

338
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,541
tells me this isn't over yet.

339
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,750
I think it's gone.

340
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,000
What was all that
business back there?

341
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,666
Not again.

342
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,375
Don't freak out on me!

343
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,291
He's close by!

344
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,416
Bullet-proof robe?

345
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,833
Why won't you die?!

346
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,583
Oh... ok.

347
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,833
That 16mm exploding shell

348
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,041
sure showed you
Mr. PJ Hoodie...!

349
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,791
Oh, crap...!
Oh...! What are you?!

350
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,125
Master?!

351
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,916
Okay, so the 16 didn't work!

352
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,458
Get the 40mm ready for me now!

353
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,375
I dropped it!

354
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,791
Idiot!

355
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,000
This isn't working. Maybe
we should just apologize.

356
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,166
There's no way you
can be that stupid!

357
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,666
All right, big guy. I'm sorry.

358
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,041
Besides she shot at you first!

359
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,416
Shut up, you idiot!

360
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,916
You've hit him
three times already!

361
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
When I shot at him, I missed!

362
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,041
Will you shut your suck-hole?!

363
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,666
I know those cans!

364
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,958
Oh, it's her.

365
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,041
You guys are lucky I decided

366
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,125
to come down and
save your hides!

367
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,541
You scared him off.

368
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,416
I'll track him with
infra-read... Vanished!

369
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
You two owe me big time.

370
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,208
Thanks, Junk-ho-- 
Sorry, I mean Junko.

371
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,041
Nice job! Good
work with the RPG!

372
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,041
One flash of that and he
high-tailed it out of here!

373
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,458
That means we can beat
him with that weapon.

374
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,083
Unless he ran off cause of
her freakishly large ta-tas.

375
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,833
Where did you come
up with that thing anyway?

376
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,875
Kaizuka had it with him

377
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,208
in the gear you
guys hauled up here.

378
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,166
Hmm, that
sneaky old rust bucket

379
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,750
was expecting trouble
from the get-go.

380
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,333
He's getting feisty.

381
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,041
Maybe we should
bail while we can?

382
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,750
Gimme that launcher

383
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,125
and I'll stand
guard up here, okay?!

384
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,416
We're counting on
you to protect us, Punk!

385
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,583
What was with that thing?

386
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,083
When I tracked it
with my infra-red,

387
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
it showed up like any other
living thing with body heat.

388
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,416
But then, it just disappeared...

389
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,125
It doesn't make sense.

390
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,166
Oh, come on!

391
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,208
He doubled back on me!

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,875
Master?!

393
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,166
Do something!

394
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,458
Oh well this is just perfect!

395
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,083
How did he get behind me?

396
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,541
There's no way
he could've slipped past

397
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,250
without me seeing him.

398
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
And, how did those
two dumb, stupid,

399
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,333
ratty-head scags
fall into that hole?

400
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,291
I could pop him with the RPG

401
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,250
but that would
pretty much 86 the girls.

402
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
He's using them
to protect himself.

403
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,333
It's screwing up my whole plan!

404
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
He's got me right
where he wants me

405
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,125
and he's got my
women as hostages.

406
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,166
What am I gonna do?

407
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,833
Kosuna's the
lovely young prospect

408
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,000
that I'm working
on for the future.

409
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,625
But, Junko's the amazing piece

410
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,000
of thoroughbred tail I'm
trying to tear up right now!

411
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,541
I don't think I can
save them both but,

412
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,416
how do I pick one over
the other. It's not fair!

413
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,291
"Here and now" gnugs
versus "future hopeful" gnugs?

414
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,458
It would be a shame
to lose either pair.

415
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,958
Which ones do I save?

416
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,625
Which set of
twins will I rescue?

417
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,458
Sweet cans of the future?

418
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,000
Present day teats? Which one?

419
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,125
Which one? I don't know.

420
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,416
Damn you! Boobiesnatcher!

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Master?!

422
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,583
Punk, what are you doing?

423
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,458
Don't get us killed you dumbass!

424
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,166
What the...?!

425
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,958
Jump Kosuna!

426
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,666
Oh, man!

427
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,875
He hasn't come after us...

428
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,416
You think you killed him?

429
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,541
Don't count on it--

430
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
at least not until
you see the body...

431
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,833
I was going to
shoot a grenade down

432
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,250
his gullett up close
and personal like,

433
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,625
but he snuck around behind me.

434
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,000
You talk tough now...

435
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,208
What happened
to you protecting us

436
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,416
like you said you would?

437
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,250
We almost died back there!

438
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,875
You just got
lucky with the jump.

439
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,791
You're both still
alive aren't you?

440
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,041
So, I guess he just popped up

441
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,500
and out of this hole then?

442
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,916
Yeah, took me
totally by surprise.

443
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,750
You should have seen
the look on Junko's face

444
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,750
when that guy busted
out of the ground.

445
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,750
My face?

446
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,250
You couldn't even see my face.

447
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,875
I had my helmet on.

448
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,083
Well, I guess he's
not coming after us.

449
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,791
Maybe he turned out
to be a coward after all.

450
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
A coward?

451
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,541
Yeah. He wouldn't
fight us head on.

452
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,333
This old ruin is probably
knee-deep in tunnel systems.

453
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,208
He used these
tunnels to sneak up on us.

454
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,083
That's how he was able
to evade my infra-red

455
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,291
and disappear like he did.

456
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,000
Maybe he's being
more careful now

457
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,125
that we know about
his secret passageways.

458
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,708
Okay, we'll just take this
tunnel system back to camp.

459
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,291
The tunnels are small enough,

460
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,833
he'll have a tough time
sneaking up on us again.

461
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,333
Wow, you guys are still alive.

462
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,666
Yeah, somehow...

463
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,833
Kaizuka, you
manipulative bastard.

464
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,958
You should have told
us that thing was down there!

465
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,000
Calm down.

466
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,666
You're good Punk...

467
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,041
You're the first in a
long line of treasure hunters

468
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,500
to make it out of there alive.

469
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,375
Well, I appreciate
the compliment

470
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,416
but a little head's up
that someone was going to try

471
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,416
and kill us would
have been nice, too.

472
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,750
Anyway, why don't
you level with me

473
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,541
for a second here and
tell me, who was that guy?

474
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,750
He's known as The Guardian.

475
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,375
He stands watch
over this dead city,

476
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,916
even now, centuries
since it fell.

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,708
His mission is
to attack and destroy any

478
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,958
and all who penetrate the
walls of this once great city.

479
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,666
Which now is a
city of death and dust

480
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,541
and lost souls.
He is their Guardian.

481
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:04,333
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

482
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,416
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

483
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,291
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

484
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,541
It's actually a cape.

485
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:18,250
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

486
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,666
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

487
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,750
His heart is black.

488
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,541
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

489
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:32,500
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

490
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,041
<i>He's on the run again</i>

491
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,041
On the run again.

492
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,916
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,041
He's got a job.

494
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,833
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

495
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,166
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

496
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,041
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

497
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,041
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

498
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,625
<i>It's what you do</i>

499
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,458
Yar kiddies, the
famed Desert Punk here!

500
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,375
The next episode's
chocked full of action,

501
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,333
danger and, of course,
sweet melons.

502
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,291
The Punk schemes, Kosuna
does a little shopping,

503
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,125
and Junko's pals
do a little shaking.

504
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,791
What's with you and
the jugs again, Punk!

505
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,958
Cram it!

506
