1
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,458
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:49,541
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:53,708
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,458
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:03,083
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,791
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:12,125
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:16,458
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,208
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,125
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:32,708
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,541
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,916
The Great Kanto Desert.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,750
During the day the
temperatures soar

17
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,416
above a hundred and twenty
degrees in the shade.

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,750
At night, it takes a nosedive
well below freezing.

19
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,708
These ruins are from a
forgotten civilization--

20
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,458
one that fell under
the weight of its own

21
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,916
thoughtlessness and greed
several hundred years ago.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,291
They're here now only as grave
markers for the lost promise

23
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:24,125
of those who willfully
destroyed themselves.

24
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,208
And yet somehow their
descendants still managed

25
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,541
to survive this harsh
terrain over the years...

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,500
But these descendants
still have no idea

27
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,666
what the hell they're doing.

28
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,708
Namiko, get up!

29
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,083
Come on! If they catch us,
they'll kill us all!

30
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,208
Namiko, are you okay?

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,875
I'm hungry, mommy.
Can I have something to eat?

32
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,916
Are you kidding?
We'll eat when we're safe!

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,291
Honey, no!!

34
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,666
Tasty...

35
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,333
Let my mommy go, you creep!

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,416
Namiko!!

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,916
How cute...
I always wanted a family.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,416
You can't get away from us.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,708
I think the best thing for
you people to do is relax,

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
and let us take what we want.

41
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,416
But even if you don't,
we'll take it anyway.

42
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,541
Please don't violate me!

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,916
How could you do that to us?!

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,041
Making us think
your wife was hot!

45
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,041
Why would you try to protect
something that damn ugly? Man!

46
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,875
You have got
serious issues, loser!

47
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,333
Hey guys! You fellas happen
to be part of the Kawazu Gang?

48
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,708
Who are you?

49
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,458
Kinda small to be in
the desert alone, huh?

50
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,083
My size isn't the issue, chief.

51
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,250
You the ones who attacked
the oasis transport truck

52
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,041
at Water Station forty-five
three days ago?

53
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,125
You can take that question
and cram it up your ass!

54
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,291
Cram it up your ass!

55
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,041
Up the ass!

56
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,291
Yeah, that treasure you stole--

57
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,250
the owner hired me
to come take it back.

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:50,416
Yeah...? What are you,
some kinda cop? We kill cops!

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,708
We also kill bounty hunters!

60
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,416
We kill anything!

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,125
First off, no police officer
would dare make their way

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,833
out to this God-awful
Dutch oven of a place.

63
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,041
Second, bounty hunters just pick
on the weakest and smallest.

64
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,083
I guess I can't complain though,
I do get a lot of work.

65
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,291
Just tell me where that
idiot boss of yours is

66
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,166
and we can call our
business done.

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,333
Hell, I might even
let you walk away.

68
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,541
Aww... I offended them.

69
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,416
This is really getting old.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,666
You think we used enough
bullets to finish him off?

71
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,750
Hey!! Look up there!!

72
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,541
Whoa! How's he
flying around like that?

73
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,666
He's that demon! I knew it!

74
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,041
He's gonna eat our souls!

75
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,500
It's the Desert Punk!!

76
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:21,375
What did you do...? I feel
like I'm dying over here...

77
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,041
It's my uber-badass
paralysis spray.

78
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:31,166
No taste, no smell, no color.
I'd say it works like a charm.

79
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,750
Y-You...

80
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,208
I have a reputation as a man

81
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,166
that will complete
any job given to me.

82
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,916
It's not a reputation
I intend to lose.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
I worked too hard for it.

84
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,416
So why don't one of you three
slobbering nimrods tell me...

85
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,541
Where the hell is that damn
hideout of yours?! Huh?!

86
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,375
I ain't gonna say it again.
Fess up! I demand answers!

87
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,541
I'm gonna keep beating
you util you tell me!

88
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,500
Answer me! Where is it?!

89
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,208
Fifty-five, fifty-six...

90
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,333
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight,
fifty-nine, sixty. That's it.

91
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,750
Your lives today were saved for
two hundred thousand yen each.

92
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,625
That's a fantastic deal.

93
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,958
I hope to do business with you
again in the future. See ya!

94
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,083
This... was all
because I am weak.

95
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,750
I couldn't protect you
and now were dead broke!

96
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,250
Why'd I marry such a tool?

97
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:35,041
What? Those three wouldn't just
end up missing for no reason.

98
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,291
None of them are answering
their coms, either.

99
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,625
They were in charge of guarding
Sector Thirty-three in the west.

100
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,166
Those three jokers are too
busy playing around out there.

101
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,333
That makes three
jokers who aren't

102
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,208
getting any after
dinner pudding.

103
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,541
Sir! I'll personally
see to that!

104
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,875
Make sure their pudding
is on my plate tonight.

105
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,250
Pudding, pudding!
Sweet, luscious pudding!

106
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,916
Oh, it's worth living
and dying for!

107
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,708
Boss! I have bad news!

108
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,875
Yeah, what is it?

109
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,458
I found a letter
at the entrance.

110
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,041
At first I thought it was crap,
but it's signed by Desert Punk!

111
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,625
Mmm... Desert
Punk... How neat...

112
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,333
The reportedly small
mercenary who's going around

113
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,791
tearing up gangs using
magic-like powers...?

114
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,500
Sounds interesting... Read it.

115
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:41,416
Of course... Here goes...
"Dear Stupid Idiot Boss Man.

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,458
I am here to take your head.

117
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,250
You can fight me if you want,
but don't bother running.

118
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,041
It'll just wear you
out before I kill you

119
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,291
and that's no fun for anyone.

120
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,708
I've already busted up those
dumbass losers of yours,

121
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,541
and you're next, Jackass
Boss. With love, Desert Punk."

122
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,541
Uh-oh...

123
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,958
Yeah...?

124
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,625
Amazing. He calls Makoto
all those nasty things,

125
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,083
and he doesn't even flinch.

126
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,916
He's like a rock.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,916
That's why he's the boss.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,083
He's pretty damn cool,
if ya ask me.

129
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,458
And P.S.... Your mother is
nothing but a dirty whore.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,916
My mother... ain't no... whore!

131
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,625
Boss is upset again!

132
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,791
I don't want to deal with this.

133
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
Careful...

134
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,833
What a face!

135
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,541
And those knockers!

136
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,250
Are you all right lady?!
Holy crap, please be all right!

137
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,166
I'll take care of you!

138
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,125
Sorry I kicked you.

139
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,833
I thought you were a scavenger
trying to steal my clothes.

140
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,833
Uh, okay. Look.
I just wanna know

141
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,208
what you're doing
all the way out here.

142
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,208
In such a sexy little number--
I mean, hot pants.

143
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,958
Look at you, you'll be
blistered and sun-poisoned

144
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,666
in less than a day unless
you have some more clothes.

145
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,333
Actually... I ran...

146
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:06,000
I ran away!
Please save me!

147
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,500
You're my new hero...!
You can finally save me!

148
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,416
Save you from what, exactly?

149
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,083
I was kidnapped and dragged
through the desert,

150
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,791
forced to travel with that
pudding-obsessed Kawazu guy.

151
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,291
I couldn't take it, so I found
a way out and I ran away.

152
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,708
What did those
bastards make you do?

153
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,291
I was told by Makoto that
I would make him vats

154
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,416
of his mother's pudding
for the rest of my life...

155
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,916
He'd whip me until
I got it perfect...

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,291
Man, that's pretty hot. I mean,
sure, the guy's gotta pay,

157
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,916
but damn, she probably
looked good making that pudding.

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708
Please help me...!
I could die out here!

159
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,333
Don't cry.

160
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,958
Look, booby girl, I've got
some business to attend to

161
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,500
with those
Kawazu jerks, titties.

162
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,791
Let me take care of that,
and then, fun bags,

163
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,125
I'll escort you personally
back to the oasis.

164
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,000
How's that sound, milk mounds?

165
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,916
Wait a second...
Those three guards

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,166
aren't roaming around
out here anymore...

167
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,291
Hey, yeah, you must
be that guy!

168
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,375
She knows my work?

169
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,958
What's wrong with you, lady?
Are you okay?

170
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
It's the relief of finally being
safe since you're here.

171
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,375
It's overwhelming.

172
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,750
At this moment, this
woman truly needs me.

173
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,208
She needs every ounce
of courage I can muster.

174
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,875
She's relying on me
to save her very life!

175
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,416
She will suffer, nay!
I'll see it to the end!

176
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,708
It's over, Kawazu Gang.

177
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,458
What you've done to this
woman is unforgivable!

178
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,583
You're mine now!

179
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,041
I'm not quite sure I
know where they are.

180
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,583
It's around here, I know,
I just don't have specifics...

181
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,875
--y'know, like an address, or...
--Oh. It's right there.

182
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,833
Yes, yes it is.

183
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,583
There's no hideout here.

184
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,708
There's a balloon
tied to the ground.

185
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,875
Is that the Desert Punk?

186
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,041
He's smaller than I expected.

187
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,666
I've heard stories about him...
Some people say that he's

188
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,500
nothing but the desert sand
wrapped tight in those clothes.

189
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,083
The whole thing really
creeps me out, you know.

190
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,583
You're twice his size.
Calm down already.

191
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,500
Shit! He's looking right at us!

192
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,083
Then shoot him,
you moron! Shoot him!

193
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,625
Would someone please
shoot back at this jerk?!

194
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,250
What a bunch of freakin' morons.
You guys don't have

195
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,958
what it takes in the
grey matter department

196
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,541
if you're going to take me down.
You have to be smarter.

197
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,583
Fire! Fire!

198
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,291
Jeez, you'd think I
started this fight!

199
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,875
Dammit!

200
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,666
He's pinned down!
Don't lose him!

201
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,500
Well, I used up way
too much of my ammo.

202
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,291
I suppose I could tack it onto
the bill under 'incidentals'.

203
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,541
I am a businessman.

204
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,041
I have to consider the
bottom line, after all.

205
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,625
Which is fifteen hundr...

206
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,833
You guys are making it real
easy to shoot you right now!

207
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,125
He's only one guy!
Let's get him!

208
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,833
Remember kids,
a smart man knows

209
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,083
when it's time to run
like a little bitch!

210
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,500
What a fool!
He's running into a dead end!

211
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,291
Storm the building, men!

212
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,916
Wait, that's a--

213
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,791
Oh, shit!

214
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,875
You guys are bigger
losers than I thought.

215
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,833
That was good.

216
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:04,041
But 'good'... can't compare
to the legend of Desert Punk.

217
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,625
You were the one who
challenged me, but it turns out

218
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,125
you fell right into
my trap. How ironic.

219
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,041
That... is an ugly looking man.

220
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:18,250
Must've had it hard with all of
his 'Hulk Syndrome' and stuff.

221
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,291
I challenged you, huh?

222
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,666
Oh, you must be Makoto.

223
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,250
Of course I am!

224
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,333
Hey, easy there, big fella.
I just came here

225
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,750
to take back that little gold
necklace you're wearing.

226
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,458
And now I have to hurt you.

227
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,375
You have some nerve killing
off the Masami boys.

228
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,041
You're not gettin'
outta this one, Punk.

229
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,875
Not after what you've done.

230
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,750
How the hell do you think you're
getting out of here alive?

231
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,458
Make your move.
I'd love to see it.

232
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,708
Killing off? Get your
facts straight. They're fine.

233
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,583
I tied them up and tossed them
in a building somewhere, genius.

234
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,166
Who's your daddy now?
Tell me, who's your daddy?

235
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,000
My mother is not a dirty whore!

236
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,125
Uh, what?!

237
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,083
You son-of-a-bitch!
Don't play stupid!

238
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,500
We know you sent the letter!

239
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,583
Don't deny it! You signed
it yourself, crack head!

240
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,166
'Crack head'? Is he serious?

241
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,416
Well, that's it. I'm sick of
dealing with these turds!

242
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,916
Crap, it's camouflage gas!

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
Get him!

244
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,708
Alright, men... Cease fire...!

245
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,666
Go bring me the
pieces of that punk.

246
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,458
Hey, where'd he go?

247
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,791
I think we shredded
him with the gunfire.

248
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,125
So do we pick up the pieces?

249
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,833
That's what the boss said.

250
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,666
That freak is flying!

251
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,708
He's--He's a demon!

252
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,083
What's he gonna do to us??!

253
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,083
He's multiplying!
He is a demon!

254
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,625
Idiots! There's no such
things as demons!

255
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,208
Now, kill him!!

256
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,666
Whoo-hoo!!

257
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,000
Yee-Haw!!

258
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,708
Now that sideshow freak
is just dust in the wind!

259
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,375
Then what the hell is that?!

260
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,375
Boss! There's a dozen of him!

261
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,625
Your mother's a dirty whore...

262
00:17:53,708 --> 00:18:04,250
--Your mother's a dirty whore...
--Your mother's a dirty whore...

263
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,416
You... prick!

264
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Stop talking about my mother!!

265
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,416
Your mother's a dirty whore...!

266
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,083
Your mother's a dirty whore!

267
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,208
Stop saying that!

268
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,833
Your mother's a dirty whore!

269
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,875
Your mother's a dirty whore!

270
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
Got any ideas in
that small brain

271
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,833
about why they call
me Desert Punk?

272
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,958
My mother... is a saint, punk.

273
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,500
It's a... balloon?

274
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,958
No way!

275
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,125
He lost?

276
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,291
How the hell did he lose?!

277
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,625
That thing was
all flying around--

278
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,666
No human could do those things.

279
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,125
He's a demon!

280
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,000
He's the demon of the desert!

281
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,291
The legendary Desert Punk.

282
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,166
I own this desert, bitches!

283
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh, it's tittie girl.
How ya doing?

284
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,583
You're amazing... I watched
you in action out there.

285
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,375
You really kicked
those fellas' asses.

286
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,250
Yeah, except that I didn't
see that explosive coming.

287
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,791
How could you? Oh, thanks
for grabbing this for me.

288
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,416
We work for the same client,
so I'm sure you understand...

289
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,000
This was just business.
To tell you the truth,

290
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,458
I really don't know what he
sees in that necklace anyway.

291
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,291
He's spent a boatload of
cash hiring people like us

292
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,291
to bring this thing back to him.

293
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,666
So--the--that--that--

294
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,166
that explosion that almost took
off my head--th-that was--

295
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,291
Yep... That was my handiwork.

296
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,041
It was too convenient to
pass up. Get crazy man Makoto

297
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,333
and the legendary Desert Punk
to destroy each other.

298
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,291
Makes my life much easier.

299
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:09,708
I'm Junko. And like you, I'll do
anything for cold hard cash.

300
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,291
Wait. You can't just take that--

301
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,708
You'll be seeing a lot more
of me, since I'm your

302
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,583
new rival and all. We're gonna
have some fun. Later!

303
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,458
What a freakin' bitch!

304
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,958
She's been playing me
since I found her all alone.

305
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,916
Me? She played me?

306
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,083
That is <i>not</i> cool!
Not cool at all!

307
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,208
The Great Kanto Desert.

308
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,125
Some of the fiercest and most
brutal people live day-to-day

309
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:49,541
in this scorching hell on earth.
But that's what it is.

310
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,291
A life of loneliness
and scavenging.

311
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,000
Junko, I'll find you.

312
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,000
You think you can just
pull the wool over my eyes?

313
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,958
No way. Not gonna
happen again, Tits McGee.

314
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,333
Walk on a man's pride and
expect him to just take it?

315
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,958
Uh-uh. You haven't won yet.

316
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,375
I finish every job I start
and I don't intend on

317
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,208
ruining my reputation
this late in the game!

318
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,083
I don't understand it, these
hardened desert people live

319
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,541
with inflamed pride... Which
seems to bite them in the ass.

320
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,666
You'd think they'd
learn their lesson.

321
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,541
It's a vicious cycle,
but... oh, well.

322
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,333
That busty bitch. The things
I'm gonna do to her.

323
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,416
But those knockers. Damn.
Those were nice.

324
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,833
She's gonna give
back what's mine.

325
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:40,041
I fought for it, I found it,
I stole it back.

326
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,500
Those jugs were huge,
though, weren't they?

327
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:03,875
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

328
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,958
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

329
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,833
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

330
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,083
It's actually a cape.

331
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:17,791
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

332
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,208
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

333
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,291
His heart is black.

334
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:27,083
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

335
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:32,041
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

336
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,583
<i>He's on the run again</i>

337
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,583
On the run again.

338
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,458
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

339
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,583
He's got a job.

340
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,375
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

341
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,708
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

342
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:55,583
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

343
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,583
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

344
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:04,166
<i>It's what you do</i>

345
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,125
Yo. What's up? I'm Desert Punk
and I'm here to tell you

346
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,291
that the next episode has
some nice knockers in it.

347
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,125
Do not refer to my
mother's loving bosom

348
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,333
as, quote, "knockers"!

349
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,375
Weirdo. On the next
episode of <i>Desert Punk...</i>

350
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,458
"Rock, Paper, Scissors!"

351
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,750
You don't want to miss it.
