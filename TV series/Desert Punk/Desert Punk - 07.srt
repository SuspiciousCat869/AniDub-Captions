1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,666
Something bit me!

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,875
Die...!

17
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,291
It's jammed!

18
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,541
Dammit!

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,416
Huh?

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,916
Did I do that?

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,541
I just saved your
ass Desert Punk.

22
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,500
What...?
Who said that...? Hello?

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,583
Oh great.

24
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,458
Not you again!

25
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,916
You have a name right?
What is it?

26
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,541
It's Kosuna!
Am I that forgettable?!

27
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,750
You're saying, you didn't
see me following you...?

28
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,791
You gotta be
completely worn out,

29
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,833
I wasn't trying to dodge you.

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,583
After all you did almost die
out here in the desert, master.

31
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,458
And then just to make
everything worse...

32
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,875
after collapsing you were saved

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,666
by your long time loser rivals

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,625
the sleezy Machinegun Brothers.

35
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,625
Aren't you well informed?

36
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,666
Of course.
I know all about my master.

37
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,791
Which isn't gonna be me!

38
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
So why don't you
just scurry on home?!

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,666
Not a chance!

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
I'll follow you wherever you go

41
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,375
to prove my unflinching loyalty!

42
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,250
Why the hell do you want

43
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,625
to be my apprentice anyway?

44
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,583
Well that's simple!

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,375
I want to become
stronger than any man,

46
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,750
and more beautiful than
any woman known to man.

47
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,416
I want to be intelligent
and quick-witted

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,708
and destroy all the
bad guys on the earth!

49
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,416
Someday I'll be the prettiest

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
and mightiest chick in
the Great Kanto Desert!

51
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,125
No one'll screw with me!

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,958
It's great...

53
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,083
I can picture myself...
gorgeous.

54
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,375
Hey hold up!
Wait for me, master!

55
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,041
How's it goin' buddy...

56
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,458
I heard you had it kinda rough.

57
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,833
Feeling any better now?

58
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,916
Hey Desert Punk!

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,791
Get a little sand caught
in your helmet?

60
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,333
Hey kid, life's long,
hard and tough.

61
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,583
You're bound to
get into trouble...

62
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,125
But don't get all
down on yourself

63
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,250
just because you keeled over.

64
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,375
That's right...!

65
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,333
I heard you almost
died in the desert!

66
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,416
Let's go.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want to
catch his "suckiness".

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,041
You're so famous!

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,750
Everyone in this town knows you!

70
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,375
Why me?!

71
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,166
You talking about
that poor wash-up?

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,333
That's right.

73
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,625
And we're the ones
who saved his dumb ass!

74
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,208
It was so pitiful!
You should have seen it!

75
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,250
When he saw us approaching him

76
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,708
he started
crying like a baby

77
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,750
and yelling, "I'm
saved! I'm saved!"

78
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,166
Damnit Haru!

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,666
So you're the one
spreading unjustified claims

80
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,666
about my personal
character around town!

81
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,958
I'm gonna take
this outta your ass!

82
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,291
But he's a mercenary.

83
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,125
I know, and that's what
makes it so damn funny...

84
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,708
If the guy had
any sense of shame

85
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,625
he'd never show his
face again in this town.

86
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,333
What a loser.

87
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,500
The villagers who hired him

88
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,583
to protect them were
disgusted by him...

89
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,916
Then he needed us to save him.

90
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,833
You bastards.

91
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,583
Quit spreading these
dirty lies about me

92
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,958
before you really piss me off!

93
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,583
What the hell do you
find so funny huh?!

94
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,416
I would have been fine out
there if I were by myself!

95
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,791
Look me in the eye DP!

96
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,041
What a pansy!

97
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,291
Loser!

98
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,916
I've had prettier
things look at me before.

99
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,125
Whoa... You must be
completely embarrassed.

100
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,041
Shut it.

101
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,916
Well that's not nice...

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,166
But what about me--

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,875
Well if it isn't Kanta.

104
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,041
Huh?

105
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,625
I heard you had a bad week...

106
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,375
But... it's good to see
you on your feet again.

107
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,291
Ha. Very funny Mizu. Jackass.

108
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,458
Seriously I envy you Kanta...

109
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,541
I'd give anything to
live a life of adventure

110
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,208
like your own with
the guns and the fighting.

111
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,291
No way.

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,291
Please don't get
into anything dangerous.

113
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,333
Back off!

114
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,791
My Mizu doesn't
want you that close.

115
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,416
There's no law that
says my Mizu's all yours,

116
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,041
so get it through
your thick skull, girl!

117
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,291
Now, now girls...

118
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,875
Let's try to get along
with each other okay.

119
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,750
I'm sure I'll
see you later Kanta.

120
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,958
And you better be ready

121
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,541
with some good
stories cause I'm all ears.

122
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,916
Who's the pretty boy?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,875
The girls seem
to really like him.

124
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,541
Yeah he's the man.

125
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,791
Why's that?

126
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,875
Just look at him.

127
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,291
He's twenty-five and unemployed.

128
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,500
I don't think
I've ever seen him

129
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,291
with less than five
girls clinging to him.

130
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,250
His nickname is
the Harem Prince.

131
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,000
He's just surrounded by
easy chicks twenty-four seven.

132
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,750
Ugh...! That's nasty!

133
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,250
What the hell do you know?!

134
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,833
The chance to live each day

135
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,500
in pure bliss surrounded
by beautiful bouncing breasts.

136
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,250
Isn't that the ultimate
dream of every red-blooded man?

137
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,833
I can see it now.

138
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,041
You're nuts.

139
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,291
Whatever.

140
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,625
What is a man?

141
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,500
A man should
sweat when he works

142
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,791
and fight to protect
his family from the dangers

143
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,208
of the desert
environment and his enemies.

144
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,833
He should battle for his food

145
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,958
and carry it home on his back.

146
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,875
I'm glistening with man grease.

147
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,625
That's a man...

148
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,375
Yes... A truely manly man.

149
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,375
Well... good luck finding him.

150
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,125
I need to get back in shape.

151
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,583
I'm nowhere near my top form,

152
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,791
and I have to show those jerks

153
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,666
that made fun of
me what I'm made of.

154
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,250
If only I had Mizu's life.

155
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,250
Enough about you.

156
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,583
What about me?

157
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,833
Look if you make me your
apprentice you'll always,

158
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,583
have back up and I'll
even pick up after you.

159
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,958
I wouldn't mind if you were

160
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,875
stacked like Mizu's girlfriends.

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,083
But who in their
right mind would want

162
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,916
a pink-haired dumbbell
as their apprentice?

163
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,708
What?

164
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,166
I think it's time
I showed you something.

165
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,833
Whoa! Creepy!
Keep your clothes on!

166
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
That kinda thing's illegal!

167
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,125
But this ain't!

168
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,333
Holy taintstankles!

169
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,541
Who's the Holly Hotass?!

170
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,541
My mom.

171
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,916
You serious?

172
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,041
You following me yet?

173
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,375
I am her daughter...

174
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,041
which means that
I am the lucky one

175
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,416
to have inherited
her amazing genes...

176
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,458
I'm gonna look pretty
good when I get older.

177
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,916
Take a look and call me a liar.

178
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,708
Fine. I'll give you one shot!

179
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,958
Listen to the hand
for today's specials.

180
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,333
Eight legs for
the price of four!

181
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,291
Say...

182
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,625
What did you mean when you
said you'd give me a shot?

183
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,833
Uhh.

184
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,541
Come on, tell me?

185
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,458
Desert Punk?

186
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,083
Desert Punk!

187
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,583
Hey, what are you doing
over here master...? I...

188
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,291
It's settled.

189
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,166
Huh?

190
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,125
Oh, so this the kid...?

191
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,500
She's a bit on the...
scrawny side but I...

192
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,791
I got some work.

193
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,708
What's this...

194
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,375
I'm not feeling 100% yet,

195
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,583
so you can cover for
me until I'm up to par.

196
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,708
Got that? It's a golf term.

197
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,875
Let's see.

198
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,375
I'll start you off on
a simple job for ole Hash.

199
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,541
Wa-Wa-Wait a minute.

200
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,833
This won't work.

201
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,208
I want to become a
mercenary not a day laborer.

202
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,625
Put a sock in it!

203
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,458
You said you wanted to be
my apprentice, didn't you?

204
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,625
Yeah.

205
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,458
You said you'd do
whatever I said, right?

206
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,083
Yes!

207
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
In that case...

208
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,375
The job of a mercenary
is the most grueling job

209
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,625
in the entire desert.

210
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,625
It's also sought after
more than any other job.

211
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,666
So, how you do
today will determine

212
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,458
whether or not I accept
you as my apprentice.

213
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,250
I see where you're going
with this and I'm game!

214
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,916
You're gonna be
so impressed with me!

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,500
I am so freakin' psyched!

216
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,625
We'll see.

217
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,583
Oh I can't take
any more of this.

218
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,750
Thanks...

219
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,791
Damn septic tank's
been broken for a week.

220
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,958
I assumed that was the case.

221
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,208
Say...

222
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,208
Could I ask you to
deliver something for me?

223
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,333
Umm well...

224
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,666
Are you saying
you don't want to?

225
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
Because in my
experience mercenaries

226
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,250
will do just about
anything for a small price.

227
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,458
Fine, I'll do it!

228
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,791
Now this is the life.

229
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,000
I should have
gotten an apprentice

230
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
a long freakin' time ago.

231
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,833
I think I have
it all figured out.

232
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,166
The reason I
haven't had any luck

233
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,416
with women is simple.

234
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,000
They've all been
too damn independent

235
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,625
and mature for
someone like me.

236
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,208
But this time I'll
take that worthless piece

237
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,625
who's neither a man
nor a woman at this point...

238
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,750
and whip her body, mind,

239
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,333
and spirit into
the perfect specimen.

240
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh Kanta you know
how to work it so good.

241
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,625
I'll turn her
into the best damned

242
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,958
mercenary's assistant
ever possibly imagined.

243
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,500
No touching the candy.

244
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,041
Sorry.

245
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,083
I'm so excited.

246
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,833
It's like that
tiny broad is gonna

247
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,041
be my own science experiment.

248
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,333
Please Mizu kiss me next...!

249
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,708
Kiss me kiss me
kiss me... please Mizu.

250
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,833
There's plenty
of me to go around.

251
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,416
Small time...

252
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,000
That is small time
Mizu... I have a plan.

253
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,875
I'll start experimenting,
first with the kid

254
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,833
and then I'll gather
all of the perfect broads

255
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,000
I've created over the
years... then I'll do it...

256
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,875
Build a boobie
amusement park just

257
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,291
for my own pleasure!

258
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:43,500
Delivery...
Delivery... Delivery!

259
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,875
Yes.

260
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,333
Oh! I have a delivery
for you from some Hash guy.

261
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,125
Hello... Have
you seen my pills...?

262
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,625
I think I dropped
them in the toilet.

263
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,958
I can't even
see what I'm doing.

264
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,166
Hey kid! Hurry up!
I ain't got all day!

265
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,458
Alright...

266
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,708
This will be the
perfect job for me.

267
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,750
Hurry up and draw
some customers here.

268
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,875
Yes sir!

269
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,000
Come one, come all.

270
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,333
It's a sale-e-bration!

271
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,041
Get forty percent
off any item here

272
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,541
at the newly
renovated Mushiya Store!

273
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,666
Your voice is too soft.

274
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,916
'Kay...

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,250
We've got forty
percent off every item!

276
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,625
Louder.

277
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,958
Forty percent off every item!

278
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Louder.

279
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,291
Please come over
here and buy something!

280
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,833
You're gonna
have to speak louder.

281
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,500
But there are
no customers around.

282
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,041
The streets are empty.

283
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,500
That's why you
gotta be louder...

284
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,083
To bring them to you!

285
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,125
It's a sale-e-bration!

286
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,375
Come check out
items forty percent off!

287
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,041
He even remodeled
the store so you

288
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,666
stop lollygagging and
buy something, dammit!

289
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,250
What?

290
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,833
I can't take it anymore!

291
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,375
It's so embarrassing.

292
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,791
What are you doing Kosuna?

293
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,416
Master, I can't-- I don't...

294
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,541
Look girly...

295
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,166
If you want to be
a mercenary you have

296
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,708
to do whatever's necessary.

297
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,916
I know that...

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,375
but I want to
help you fight bandits

299
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,041
and run guns
not clean chimneys

300
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,916
and scream at empty streets.

301
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,541
Kosuna... Do you
know why I was able

302
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,375
to defeat the
Shimmer Sniper... Do you?

303
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,458
No.

304
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,291
Because I am...

305
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,333
the Demon of the Desert.

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,541
That entire day he was
in a better position than me.

307
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,625
But I survived
that fight because of

308
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,166
the skills I've
acquired over the years.

309
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,458
Now granted
he was a damn good

310
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,291
sharpshooter,
better than me...

311
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,500
And he probably had a
hell of a lot more training...

312
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,041
But that was the
only advantage he had.

313
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,000
See...?!

314
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,166
Doing battle is the
same as going through life.

315
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,125
Conditions change from minute

316
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,708
to minute and you
have to be prepared

317
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,166
for events you
can't even predict.

318
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,333
You need to be able to read

319
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
each situation
with a rational mind.

320
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,416
Be clear in your decisions
and take action in an instant.

321
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,916
None of this is possible
without pure self-confidence

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,875
and that only
comes from experience.

323
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,041
To hone your abilities,

324
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
you need to experience
everything you can

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,750
no matter how crummy the job is.

326
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,250
And the only
profession that allows you

327
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,791
to make money while doing
this is mercenary work.

328
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,625
So you see... I am the balls.

329
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,083
You're amazing. A king!

330
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,916
I promise I'll
work as hard as I can

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,375
from now on without complaint.

332
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,541
Just remember
to learn something

333
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,000
valuable in, all that you do.

334
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,250
Yes sir!

335
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,416
Sweet...!

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,666
Now I get to blow all
the money she made for me!

337
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,583
Hey there Kanta.

338
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,833
Yo. I'm here to pick
up Kosuna's earnings.

339
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,875
Right, right.

340
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,125
Alright! I'm gonna
get so hammered tonight!

341
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,500
Here you go.

342
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,791
What is that?

343
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,708
The bill.

344
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,541
Huh?

345
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,708
I took care of the damages,

346
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,166
so just reimburse me.

347
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,625
What the... hell?

348
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,791
I'm gonna kill her!

349
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,083
That girl doesn't
have what it takes, Punk.

350
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,250
She spilled human
waste on a client...

351
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,708
she fell and re-covered
a chimney in soot...

352
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,291
She destroyed every
item she tried to deliver...

353
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,500
It was a total mess.

354
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,833
So the rumors I've
been hearing are true?

355
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
That's right...
It was all a lie...

356
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,791
Desert Punk is
nothing but a sham.

357
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,750
A two-timing hackjob.

358
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,916
You know I gave her those jobs

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,666
because you recommended her.

360
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,500
And I let my clients know that.

361
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,958
And after that
incident in the desert,

362
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,750
your credibility has
already taken a nose dive.

363
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,541
I hope you have a plan
for digging yourself out

364
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,875
of this hole
'cause it's a deep one.

365
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
Where is she?

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,708
If she's walking the
Campbell's Green Gordion beetle

367
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,750
then she should be close by.

368
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,958
That looks like a campfire.

369
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,500
Smells nice.

370
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,541
What's wrong?!

371
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,500
What the hell are you doing?!

372
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,833
Eating... I was
freaking starving here.

373
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,458
But... that beetle
is not for eating...

374
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,083
Oh, dammit.

375
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,166
This thing was a pet, stupid!

376
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,333
Mrs. Campbell loved it
more than her own children!

377
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,333
It's an endangered
species for crying out loud!

378
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,666
Who in the hell
keeps a bug as a pet?

379
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,041
How was I supposed to
know not to eat the thing...

380
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,500
You never told me.

381
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,291
You should know all
rich people are crazy!

382
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,916
You're lucky I don't just...

383
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,583
Don't... please don't ah oh...

384
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,791
be gentle... eh...
not in the face...

385
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,375
don't... ow... oh

386
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,708
Mrs. Campbell.

387
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,625
Oh my sweet Tama.

388
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,666
Did you enjoy your walk?

389
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,875
Come give mommy a kiss.

390
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,166
What, what's wrong?

391
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,000
We, had, a problem.

392
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,875
Just give her
to me. How dare you.

393
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,708
You...! What did you do

394
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,791
to my Tama you
ugly little bastard!

395
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,166
It was an accident. I swear!

396
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,583
Do you have any idea...

397
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,708
I want to sock this rich
snot in the face right now,

398
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,583
but I have to be patient.

399
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,083
Think long term Kanta.

400
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,791
How do you plan on making
up for this neglect, huh?

401
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,625
I knew I shouldn't
have trusted you

402
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,291
after I heard about what
happened to you in the desert.

403
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,791
So it looks like I'm
right back to where I started.

404
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,166
Swimming in debt.

405
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,541
My buddy.
What's happening Kanta?

406
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,541
Huh?

407
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,708
Whatcha doing big guy?

408
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,833
Getting in touch
with your inner self?

409
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,416
Enjoying the sunset...

410
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,750
And... doing a little
of what you mentioned.

411
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,000
That's cool.

412
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:32,750
My friend...

413
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,291
that is a truly
beautiful sight.

414
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,875
Yes it is...

415
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,625
So tell me Mizu
why are you so blue?

416
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,666
And what happened
to your pretty face?

417
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,875
About that...

418
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
What the...?!

419
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,875
I'm gonna kill you and then
myself you cheatin' bastard!

420
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,833
Wait stop!

421
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,458
I was just a
conquest for you wasn't I?

422
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,708
Yeah me too.

423
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,750
What about me?

424
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,416
I loved you.

425
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,500
Wait... Hold on...

426
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,708
Let me explain, ladies...
I love you all equally.

427
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,750
I thought I could get away

428
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,791
with loving all my
girls at the same time...

429
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,458
but women don't
work like that.

430
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,833
Wow, they really jacked you up.

431
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,791
You don't know the half of it.

432
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,583
Take it easy, Kanta.

433
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,333
Yeah you too. Good luck.

434
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,791
I guess ...

435
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,625
I'm not the only
one out there...

436
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,791
with problems to handle.

437
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,750
Ah screw it...

438
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,000
I suppose I'm gonna have
to work that much harder.

439
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
In order to reach my dreams

440
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,375
of building a
boobie amusment park.

441
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,291
There they are.

442
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,000
Not long after
that sunset a new pair

443
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,458
was spotted in
the Great Kanto Desert.

444
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,708
Listen. Attack when
I give the signal.

445
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,625
You got it, master.

446
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,791
It was Desert Punk and
his new apprentice, Kosuna.

447
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,375
But there wasn't
an ounce of respect

448
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,250
or trust between them.

449
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,625
Only selfishness and greed kept

450
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,458
these two working together.

451
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,625
May these two unfortunate souls

452
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,500
find happiness in their misery.

453
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,375
Let's go Kosuna!

454
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,916
Right behind ya!

455
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,208
You are the most pathetic
sidekick I've ever laid eyes on.

456
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,416
I just want you
to know that next time

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,333
you think you're a badass.

458
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,125
Can you hear me?
Can you talk? Hello?

459
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:05,166
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

460
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,250
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

461
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,125
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

462
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,375
It's actually a cape.

463
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:19,083
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

464
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,500
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

465
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,583
His heart is black.

466
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,375
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

467
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:33,333
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

468
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,875
<i>He's on the run again</i>

469
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:43,875
On the run again.

470
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

471
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,875
He's got a job.

472
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,666
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

473
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,000
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

474
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,875
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

475
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,875
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

476
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:05,458
<i>It's what you do</i>

477
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,625
Yo! Desert Punk here.

478
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,208
Sorry there were no
gnugens this time around.

479
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,625
Don't worry, Master!

480
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,375
We flat-chested girls have
a flavor all to ourselves!

481
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,541
I bet it tastes awful!

482
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,708
Like you'd know!

483
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,458
Next time on Desert Punk,
"A Dog in Heat!"

484
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,208
If you miss it
your boobs will deflate!
