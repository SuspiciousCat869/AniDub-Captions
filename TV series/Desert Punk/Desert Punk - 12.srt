1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>I am the one pushin' on ahead</i>
<i>just like you, yeah yeah</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>Won't you please hear me now</i>

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>and give a name to</i>
<i>the demon in the desert</i>

4
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>You can't help</i>
<i>but clench your teeth</i>

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As your heart starts</i>
<i>to tremble from the heat</i>

6
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,125
<i>Now stop it</i>
<i>It'll only bring destruction</i>

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Let's do it!</i>
<i>I killed an angel</i>

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>to stand and be strong</i>

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>It's a sad history</i>
<i>hidden in a big story</i>

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,250
<i>That is the mystery</i>

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>There's no way now of knowin'</i>

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,166
<i>Knowin' about what</i>
<i>tomorrow holds for me</i>

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>So I just keep moving on</i>
<i>Living till the moment's gone</i>

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,583
<i>Forever just me</i>
<i>My mission</i>

15
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,500
Man this job is boring.

16
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,500
Tell me about it. Us
newbies get the crap work.

17
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,916
I told my folks
I would make it big

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,041
when I left home,
and now I'm stuck out here

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,833
and haven't even shot my weapon.

20
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,458
What's up?

21
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,416
I think I saw a kid.

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,708
A kid? Are you sure about that?

23
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,958
We're way far out.

24
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,916
This is the last place
I'd expect to see a kid.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,583
No man, I'm serious.

26
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,583
Check it out.

27
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,083
See! There it was again!

28
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,958
Hold up!

29
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,083
You're not supposed
to leave your post!

30
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,208
Idiot.

31
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,458
How much longer
do we have to wait?

32
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,125
Easy.

33
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,333
Have some patience.

34
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,833
No, kidding.

35
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,500
By the time the
sun rises tomorrow

36
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,375
we'll have more money

37
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,291
than we'll know what to do with.

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,625
What's going on?!

39
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,250
Oh... Sorry...

40
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,583
Did we wake you Mr. Shimada?

41
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,500
Isn't it about time
you guys changed guards?

42
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,958
Right. We lost track of time.

43
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,291
We'll get on that right away.

44
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,666
Come on guys, let's punch
it up a bit, let's move!

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,375
I'm moving, I'm moving.

46
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,166
So, why isn't
she eating anything?

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,125
Don't know. She
won't even look at it.

48
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,541
We warmed it up and everything.

49
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,000
I put the mask back on
her just to keep her quiet.

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,083
Guess she's not a big fan

51
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,375
of cookies, butter,
and dog food.

52
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,291
Well, she can
starve for all I care.

53
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,166
If she continues to
refuse I could always

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,666
shove the food down her throat.

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,041
Just leave her be.

56
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,458
Come morning when
our client arrives

57
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,083
this little babysitting
job will be over.

58
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,166
This brat is gonna make us

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,958
some serious money ain't she?

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,208
I figure each
of us will get more

61
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,625
than an entire year's
salary out of this, huh?

62
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,291
Don't bother speculating

63
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,583
on how much you're gonna get.

64
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,666
It'll only bring
you disappointment.

65
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
We do the job
we're hired to do...

66
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,458
and that's all you should
concern yourself with.

67
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,875
Somebody! Come quick!

68
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,708
Stay here and watch the girl.

69
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,625
What the--?!

70
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,750
Who could have done this?

71
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,166
Well, are they both alive?

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,666
Yeah. They're just
knocked out pretty good.

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,625
This is strange.

74
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,166
Huh?

75
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,416
Whoever did this could
have just killed them.

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,083
Why put them
on display like this?

77
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,666
What purpose does it serve?

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,458
Oh no it's about the girl!

79
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,000
We're dealing with a pro guys.

80
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,083
Come on. Get up.

81
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,250
I had guards placed
all over this floor.

82
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,791
How did he...

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,375
Sorry, sir.

84
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,000
I never even saw it,
I was attacked from above.

85
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,375
Above?

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,708
Oh, I see.

87
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,833
Send out an alert.
Seal all the exits.

88
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,500
We can't let them get away.

89
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,916
Yes, sir!

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,333
You three come with me.

91
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,291
We're going on a rat hunt
boys so bring your A game.

92
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
It's a real ballsy
move to steal a mark

93
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,416
from professional kidnappers...

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,125
This guy has no idea
who he's dealing with.

95
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,250
That was close.

96
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,291
I recognize that guy.

97
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
He's the legendary
Night Mist, the best,

98
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,875
or at least most professional,
kidnapper in the world.

99
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,500
And that guy's quick so
I gotta be one step ahead.

100
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,250
Stop wiggling kid.

101
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,875
Kosuna can you
hear me? Kosuna? Pick up!

102
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,291
Yeah. Loud and clear.

103
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,666
The situation has changed.

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,375
Switch our strategy from
Cyclone to Hurricane. Copy?

105
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,416
What? I just finished
setting up Cyclone!

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,875
Stop complaining and just do it!

107
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,083
Fine. Right away sir.

108
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,750
Calm down. It's gonna
be all right kid.

109
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,541
You must have
been pretty scared, huh?

110
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
The nerve of
those guys tying up

111
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,333
a helpless child like
this. You poor thing.

112
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
You're lucky I
found you in time.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,291
Get away!

114
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,250
What's wrong?

115
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,375
Mind your own business, pal.

116
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,916
Mind my own what?!

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I bet my daddy asked
you to rescue me...

118
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,291
Figures he can't do it himself.

119
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,666
Yeah, uh, he hired me.

120
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,083
I hope you're careful with me

121
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,875
because I don't want to
get caught in the crossfire

122
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,375
of a gunfight between
you macho boys.

123
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,916
If my daddy had
just paid the ransom

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,125
this would all be over with

125
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,916
and I'd be at home with my toys.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,708
But...

127
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,250
Oh no! My favorite dress!

128
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,333
Look you got it
all dirtied up...!

129
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,041
What are you going
to do about it, huh?

130
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,500
It was a one of a kind!

131
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,666
What am I going to do
about it, I'm rescuing you?!

132
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,833
I assume we're going to have

133
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,291
to start walking
after this right...?

134
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,666
Of course we--

135
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,791
Well I'll have you know
that I don't like to walk...

136
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,333
What are you nuts?

137
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,375
And I'm hungry too and I assume
you have some food for me.

138
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,375
You're starting
to drive me crazy!

139
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,250
Don't you know how to listen

140
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,500
when someone's talking?!

141
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,833
I would think you'd
act a little nicer

142
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,708
to someone who's
trying to save your life.

143
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,125
But what do I know?

144
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,875
Look little girl.

145
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,875
This is not a simple
snatch-and-grab kidnap

146
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,250
for ransom case okay?

147
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,666
There's a lot
more to it than that.

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,500
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,000
These guys are professionals

150
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,333
that were hired to kidnap you.

151
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,750
They're not thugs
looking for a quick buck.

152
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,125
But I don't understand.

153
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,833
I'm just an innocent,
fragile, little girl.

154
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,916
Okay.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,666
Your father recently
used some, questionable

156
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,166
if not unethical, tactics
to aid in the demise

157
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,375
of a rival company. Got it?

158
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,958
Now the person
that hired these guys

159
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,541
to kidnap you is probably
the owner of that company.

160
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,583
Um, whatever you say.

161
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,625
In other words their
goal is not money.

162
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,250
It's a grudge. It's malice.

163
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,958
Their goal is to
make your father suffer

164
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,208
in the worst possible way,

165
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,458
which is why you're here now.

166
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,125
Geez! You just don't
get it do you?!

167
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,125
Listen to me. Okay?

168
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,625
What I'm saying
is paying the ransom

169
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,000
doesn't mean you're going
to go home safe and sound.

170
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,750
Is, that a fact?

171
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,083
Yes. Usually they
would just take the ransom

172
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,458
and then kill you anyway.

173
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,000
You get off lucky
if they just kill you.

174
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,333
However more often than not,

175
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,500
they'll force you to
satisfy the desires of fat,

176
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,250
sweaty, stanked-out men
and trust me little girl,

177
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,375
death is a sweet
release in comparison.

178
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,916
I got her scared.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,958
Good, that should
keep her in line.

180
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,125
Would the fat man want me

181
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,041
because he thinks I'm cute?

182
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,083
I knew it...

183
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,583
I know I shouldn't
point it out myself,

184
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,541
but I'm a pretty girl
that all the boys want

185
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,916
to be with, aren't I?!

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,916
Give me a break.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,625
It must be because I've
been raised so well...

188
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,416
Even criminals can see it...

189
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,541
I'll grow up to be a great
wife and an excellent mother.

190
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,875
I don't believe
this wretched kid!

191
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,291
Look we have
to start running now

192
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,666
or we'll be throat
deep in trouble! Got it?

193
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,458
Sure I got it but,
my conditions are no pain,

194
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,833
no dirt, and no
running. Got that?

195
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,333
Why did I take this job?

196
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,833
Time to go. They found us.

197
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,000
They did?

198
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,541
Shut up and run.
We have to move!

199
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,500
Hold on!

200
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,166
I don't think it's on... hey!

201
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,708
We found them. Thirteenth
floor section B.

202
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,583
Okay let everyone know
we're closing in on the rat.

203
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,041
Stay focused out there.

204
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
Copy that.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,875
Huh, this is
starting to get fun...

206
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,916
It's been awhile since
I've felt such a rush.

207
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,125
Impressive.

208
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,916
They're approaching
on all sides.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,416
Waiting patiently, no rushing,
slowly closing in on us.

210
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,125
Hey.

211
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,625
There's no hesitation.

212
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,125
Hello!

213
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,416
They must know this
building inside and out.

214
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,791
Mister!

215
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,125
This isn't going to be easy.

216
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,041
They have a solid
advantage from every position.

217
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,625
Listen to me!

218
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,000
What is it?!

219
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,416
I'm really tired.

220
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,958
Tired? We haven't even
walked five minutes yet.

221
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,916
I can't take another step.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,875
Come on kid. Enough
with the games already.

223
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,000
Shut up kid!

224
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,000
You'll give away our position!

225
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,041
I'm dirty and I'm hungry.

226
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,541
She's gonna blow
this whole operation!

227
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
I want to go home
and see my daddy!

228
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,916
I'd give anything for a
tranquilizer dart right now

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,041
but even then my exits
are all blocked... Kosuna.

230
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,333
Do you read me?

231
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,166
Yes, Master.

232
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,625
I read you.

233
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,291
What's going on?

234
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,708
Well I can honestly say that

235
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,666
since we teamed up
this is the first time

236
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,333
I've found you to
be an obedient kid.

237
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,833
Okay...?

238
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,250
Anyways I need you to
drop the Hurricane strategy.

239
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,916
We're moving right
into Monsoon now.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,458
We're changing again?

241
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,125
I was almost finished!

242
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,291
I don't care!

243
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,708
You have to be
ready to change strategies

244
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,291
at a moment's notice
depending on the situation.

245
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,375
Now go!

246
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,666
Come on kid let's get moving...

247
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,000
Hello?

248
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,500
What is it?

249
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,625
You're not going to
throw another fit are you?

250
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,916
I have to use the facilities.

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,041
What?

252
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,625
I have to use the facilities.

253
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,166
Speak up kid.

254
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,416
I said, I need to...

255
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,125
Volume! I can't hear a word.

256
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,291
Stop trying to
embarrass me you ass!

257
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,291
I have to pee real bad!
That's what I was saying!

258
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,625
Oh, you have to pee.

259
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,500
Why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

260
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,416
You're so mean.

261
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,125
Just hold it for now.

262
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,166
I can't hold it!

263
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,000
Then just go right
there. I'll keep watch.

264
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,541
I need privacy!

265
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,541
You're unbelievable!

266
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,625
I'm gonna go in that
dark corner over there.

267
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,250
Wait. It's too
dangerous to be by yourself.

268
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,958
If you look I'll tell my
dad you're a creepy pervert!

269
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,583
She will make a great bitch.

270
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,375
What's taking her so long?

271
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,125
I should check
on her. No I can't.

272
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,208
If she thinks I'm peeking
and has another one of

273
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,000
her tantrums the kidnappers
will find us for sure.

274
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,666
Plus I don't want
any rumors flying around

275
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,500
that I spied on a little
girl going to the toilet.

276
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,833
Who knows what Junko

277
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,375
or the Machinegun
Brothers would think of that.

278
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,666
Wait a sec...

279
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,166
Kosuna come in.

280
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,625
Yeah what is it?

281
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,208
Wait you're not changing
the strategy again are you?

282
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,666
No I just wanted
to ask you something.

283
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,083
Okay, shoot.

284
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,833
It's a weird
question but how long

285
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,916
does it usually
take for a girl to pee?

286
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,125
These girls will
be the end of me.

287
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,291
No of course
that's not the case.

288
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,291
I'm not at all interested
in that type of thing.

289
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,416
But given the situation
I'm in I have no other choice.

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,375
The kid's simply taking
too long to come back

291
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,458
and I'm worried,
worried, nothing more.

292
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,500
I just need to
check for her safety.

293
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,958
So I'm not a pervert.
No I'm not a pervert.

294
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,000
Not a pervert. Not a pervert.

295
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,833
What is taking her so long?

296
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,541
Hey kid.

297
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,791
I'm not trying to be weird.

298
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,500
I just need to
check that you're okay.

299
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,041
It's in my contract
with your father

300
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
that I return you
in perfect condition.

301
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,750
Are you listening to me? Hello?

302
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,208
Well, look who it is.

303
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,625
Tell me, what kind
of sick bastard gets off

304
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,083
watching little
girls tinkle. Huh?

305
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,166
Looks like
you're cornered buddy.

306
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,000
Sucks for you
because Mr. Shimada

307
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,000
knows this building
like the back of his hand.

308
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,291
There's no use in running

309
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,041
because we'll know
exactly where you're going.

310
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,458
So without getting too close

311
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,541
you were following me,

312
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,500
waiting for the
kid and I to separate?

313
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,166
Duh! This young lady

314
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,333
is a very valuable
source of cash for us.

315
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,875
We couldn't risk her
safety in a gun battle.

316
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,750
Now it's about
time we got you back

317
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,041
for that stunt
you pulled earlier.

318
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,500
The choice is yours.

319
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,708
Either you can take a beating

320
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,916
and then fall to
your death, or you can take

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,541
a beating and fall
to your death, huh.

322
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,875
Why don't you do us
a favor and just jump.

323
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
There are five of them.

324
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,333
The odds are against me.

325
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,625
They know every
corner of this complex,

326
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,958
so if I decide to run they'll
probably find me right away.

327
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,958
Let's see, decisions decisions.

328
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,291
Ah what the hell.

329
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,541
Hey what are you doing?!

330
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,000
What the--?

331
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,875
Damn! He blew out
our night goggle things!

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,125
I can't see anything!

333
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,666
Let's go princess!

334
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,083
Damn. Find them!

335
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,250
Hold on!

336
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,750
I don't like this!

337
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,208
It's dark and scary!

338
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,458
And it smells like crotch
rot! No, this is so freaky!

339
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,291
Shut up! It's not that bad.

340
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,083
You're sick!

341
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,750
Why are you kicking me?!

342
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,166
No one's allowed
to touch me there!

343
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,875
My daddy told me...

344
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:35,750
Found them!

345
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,916
There in here.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,916
You gave us away!

347
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,791
Watch your fire!
Your gonna hit the kid!

348
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,208
Ow that hurt.

349
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,500
Way to go genius!

350
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,791
Now my hair is full
of dust thanks to you!

351
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,416
And the way you
saved me back there.

352
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,750
What was that all about?

353
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,833
You were dragging
me around like a caveman!

354
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,958
What if my face had
gotten all scratched up?

355
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,416
What would you have done then?

356
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,625
Probably nothing!

357
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,916
I hope you realize that my face

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,125
is worth a heck of
a lot more than yours...!

359
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,083
I bet your face
is so ugly you have

360
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,375
to wear that
helmet all the time

361
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,833
when you're in
public so you don't scare

362
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,208
the children that
think you're some sort of...

363
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,666
You're only pretty
because your father

364
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,500
is so rich he probably
bought you a new face.

365
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,500
I knew it!

366
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,375
If my daddy heard you say

367
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,125
that he would be
really angry with you.

368
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,541
Then what do say
we don't tell Daddy.

369
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,125
Great, I hear them,
they caught up with us again.

370
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,125
We can't use the
ventilation ducts anymore...

371
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,375
Kosuna, come in.

372
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,208
I'm here.

373
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,666
Want to talk about going
to the bathroom again?

374
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,791
No! It's about the game plan.

375
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,541
Oh then don't you worry, sir.

376
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,916
I'm carrying out the
Monsoon Strategy as we speak.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,083
Cancel Monsoon.

378
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,500
Focus all of your
attention on Phoenix.

379
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,041
Are you doing this on purpose?

380
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,416
Shut up and listen!

381
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,166
Phoenix Strategy now! Go!

382
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,041
Okay.

383
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,041
There! Don't let
them get away...!

384
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,041
We found them sir.

385
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,375
He went your way!

386
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,708
Get in front of them!

387
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,375
This is the checkmate... pal.

388
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,750
He was smarter
than I anticipated.

389
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,208
But making a move
like this is suicide...

390
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,750
This guy must be
just a lucky amateur.

391
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,708
I guess he doesn't realize
that by running upwards

392
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,291
in that part of the
building he's cutting off

393
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,000
his own escape route.

394
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,958
Unless he's thinking...

395
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,958
I'm done. I can't go on!

396
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,083
Cut the crap already!

397
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,375
You want to be

398
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,125
that greasy old fat
man's love child forever?

399
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,166
But I can't
help it! I'm so tired!

400
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,791
This way!

401
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,125
Roughly ten enemies. Perfect.

402
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,625
Get on.

403
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,916
Smoke bomb!

404
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,750
Don't stop! Keep moving!

405
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,291
No, wait! Stay there!

406
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,500
We've got them cornered!

407
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,916
Those with head in
clouds fall down hole.

408
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,833
We finally made it.

409
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,541
Well, where are we going now?

410
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,666
Kosuna! Where are you?

411
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,500
You better be prepared!

412
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,583
Well look who it is.

413
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,583
I had a hunch it
was you Desert Punk.

414
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,333
You're not half bad
for a low life mercenary.

415
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,791
You're a mercenary?!
Well that's just great!

416
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,000
No wonder you got caught.

417
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,416
Daddy should
have spent a lot more

418
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,875
and gotten a
real man for the job!

419
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,125
You're pathetic!

420
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,333
It's nice to meet you.

421
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
I've heard many tales about
the legend of Night Mist

422
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,375
and here I stand before you.

423
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,250
It's too bad we had to meet
under these circumstances.

424
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,375
Unfortunately I need
to cut this meeting short.

425
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,791
Yeah well...

426
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,166
Drop your guns or your cash cow

427
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,875
here gets a bullet in her brain.

428
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,833
Desert Punk,
think this one through.

429
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,375
She's a valuable
commodity alive, right?

430
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,708
If you don't want her dead
then I suggest you help me.

431
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,541
Time's a tickin'
boys, make your choice.

432
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,791
Wait just a minute.
You can't shoot me!

433
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,291
My daddy would have
you killed if you did that!

434
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,958
Shut your sloppy pie
hole you little brat!

435
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,541
I'll just tell him
I didn't get here in time.

436
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
He won't know the difference.

437
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,708
You're crazy!

438
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,875
I'll be sure to collect my fee

439
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,791
though whether
you're dead or alive!

440
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,833
That's one sick puppy.

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,875
You're just like
your reputation says...

442
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,833
A cunning, cowardly,
worthless waste of human flesh.

443
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,125
Say what you will.

444
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,458
If you want to
kill the girl go ahead.

445
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,791
What?

446
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,041
It doesn't matter to us
if the girl lives or dies.

447
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,833
It doesn't affect
our business too much.

448
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,166
Sure we won't get as
much for delivering a corpse,

449
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,916
but it would be worth
the loss to see you fail.

450
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,166
I refuse to let you
have your way Desert Punk.

451
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,083
You will die here today.

452
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,500
Is that right?

453
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,791
What if I drop a
bomb and vaporize her?!

454
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,458
How would that work out?!

455
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,375
Kosuna! You're late!

456
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,916
Huh?

457
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,416
Whoops.

458
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,666
So you had an accomplice!

459
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,291
Kosuna! Phoenix strategy! Go!

460
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,583
Roger dodger!

461
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,083
What in the hell do
you think your doing?!

462
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,541
Isn't this a little
much for Phoenix?

463
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,416
Whatta ya mean?

464
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,291
I did exactly as you told me.

465
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,416
Two sticks of TNT at
all ten support fixtures.

466
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,708
You idiot!
That's the Tornado Plan!

467
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,666
I told you to set
up Phoenix! Phoenix!

468
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,666
That was a close one...!

469
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Saved at the last second!

470
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,333
You mercenaries
are more prepared

471
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,250
than I took you
for, having a parachute

472
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,125
on your back the whole time.

473
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah that's fine and dandy

474
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,083
but it looks like we
picked up an extra passenger.

475
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,666
We're overloaded, Master!

476
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,666
We're losing altitude fast!

477
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,041
We're what?!

478
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
Would you let go of my leg!

479
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,708
There's only room
for three on this ride!

480
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,458
Shut up you reckless bastard!

481
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,541
I can't believe I didn't

482
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,750
know you were
working with a partner.

483
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,041
First class
mercenaries like myself

484
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,375
are always three steps
ahead of frauds like you.

485
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,458
Don't laugh too soon!

486
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,166
You don't have a
check in your hand yet!

487
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,375
Face it, you lost!

488
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,166
Get rid of that guy Master!

489
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,166
If I'm going down
I'm taking you with me!

490
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,375
Get off me!

491
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,958
You bunch of morons!
We're all going to die.

492
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,041
Master!

493
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,041
I did it!

494
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,916
We're floating again!

495
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,250
In one of the most unorthodox

496
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,958
and selfish escapes
in recent history,

497
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,416
the little girl
in effect freed herself

498
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,375
from her kidnapper...
at her savior's expense.

499
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,916
Are you feeling
any better Master?

500
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,416
About the reward
from the last job,

501
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,208
I took my share
before I paid off

502
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,250
some of your outstanding debts.

503
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,958
It's not much
but here's what's left.

504
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:28,875
I'm gonna go shopping!

505
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,750
Hope you feel better! See ya!

506
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:04,750
<i>Start with one circle</i>
<i>Add one more circle</i>

507
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,833
<i>Then add one more big circle</i>

508
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,708
<i>Then a raincoat</i>
<i>blowing in the wind</i>

509
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,958
It's actually a cape.

510
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:18,666
<i>Whoa, don't forget</i>
<i>about the sunshade now</i>

511
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,083
His heart is the
blackest in the desert.

512
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,166
His heart is black.

513
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,958
<i>Shotgun is what he's gonna use</i>

514
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:32,916
<i>And then you've got</i>
<i>yourself a Sunabozu</i>

515
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,458
<i>He's on the run again</i>

516
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,458
On the run again.

517
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,333
<i>Just one more day and you'll see</i>

518
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,458
He's got a job.

519
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,250
<i>He won't stop</i>
<i>till tomorrow comes</i>

520
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,583
He won't stop until
he gets the girl.

521
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,458
Until he gets the girl.
Get that girl!

522
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:00,458
<i>Risking your life is</i>
<i>what you do, what you do</i>

523
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:05,041
<i>It's what you do</i>

524
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,458
Yo! Desert Punk here.

525
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,250
What's with the
lack of boobies?!

526
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,666
Don't worry! I'll
be busty in five years!

527
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,458
Or better make
that ten just to be safe!

528
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,333
Oh whatever, I want boobs now!

529
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,958
Next on Desert Punk,
"Opposites Collide!"

530
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,208
If you miss it you
won't get no boobs!
