1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,814
(rain pattering)

2
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,617
‐ It’s raining.

3
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,619
‐ It’s raining.

4
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,961
The Ballgame Festival’s been
canceled because it’s raining.

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,674
‐ No way!

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,464
You’ve gotta be kidding!

7
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,048
All my efforts were‐‐

8
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,555
‐ A complete waste of time.

9
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,723
(exasperated sigh)

10
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,675
‐ You don’t have to
be so blunt about it.

11
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,103
(door sliding)

12
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,847
‐ Everyone, listen up!

13
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,647
The Ballgame Festival’s been
canceled ’cause of rain!

14
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,781
Mr. Yamada said we
could all go home!

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,730
‐ Hey, that’s great!

16
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,989
‐ No!

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,199
I spent a week
helping my brother

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,159
with the secret training
he did for today!

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,080
‐ Wait, secret training?

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,118
‐ What kind of stuff did you do?

21
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,374
‐ Well, let’s see now.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,873
(bright music)

23
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,875
We did some close‐contact
exercises and stretches

24
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,628
and other stuff like that.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,171
(bell dinging)
(coy giggling)

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,804
‐ No!

27
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,762
Your brother is a pervert!

28
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,262
‐ Yes, she is!

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,513
(Karen giggling)

30
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,935
‐ It’s a shame that
the Ballgame Festival

31
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,434
was canceled, Miss
Miina, don’t you think?

32
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,678
‐ Yeah, I guess.

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,017
‐ Is there something the matter?

34
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,443
‐ No, I just, I hate rain.

35
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,727
‐ Well, your clothes
do get pretty wet.

36
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,027
‐ Oh, why do I even try
for a serious conversation?

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,282
(uptempo J‐pop music)

38
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,035
(bold music)

39
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,447
‐ [Mike] What’s with
the sudden blue sky

40
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,705
as soon as the Ballgame
Festival was canceled?

41
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,080
Damn it, I just don’t
feel like working today.

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,708
‐ [Miina] Well, then
how about we go out

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,213
and have some fun for a change?

44
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,706
It’s still before noon,

45
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,546
and Karen and I don’t have
to work today, so we’re free!

46
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,182
‐ Oh, Miss Miina,
that’s a wonderful idea!

47
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,760
‐ [Mike] Okay, I guess
we could do that.

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,716
(whimsical music)

49
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,576
(exasperated sigh)

50
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,544
‐ I’m sorry, I don’t
like scary things.

51
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,705
‐ You know what, Karen?

52
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,173
Something just occurred to me.

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,753
Your tastes are so
different from ours.

54
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,458
Maybe you are the stranger.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,970
‐ Oh, Miss Miina, no,
please don’t say that!

56
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,932
‐ Miina!

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,260
‐ Relax, I’m only kidding!

58
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,756
‐ Hmm!
‐ Oh!

59
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,426
I’m sorry, but do you mind
if I go look at some clothes?

60
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,765
‐ No, of course not.

61
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,270
‐ [Karen] Oh, I love that brand!

62
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,772
‐ [Mike] Yeah, I see.

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,938
Hey, Karen, I’ll just be
waiting outside, okay?

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,784
‐ Thanks, Mr. Mike!

65
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,189
‐ I’m going too!

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,490
(crowd chatter)

67
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,035
(gentle whimsical music)

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,785
‐ Hey, Mike, I’m sorry!

69
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,002
‐ Damn, you’re late!

70
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,882
So how long do I
gotta wait out here?

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,750
‐ Actually, Karen’s still
kinda looking around.

72
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,297
(Mike sighing)

73
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,300
She seems to be the
indecisive type.

74
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,553
‐ So what?

75
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,966
You gonna make me
wait even longer?

76
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,223
‐ Don’t be silly!

77
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,466
I told her to meet
us here in an hour

78
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,266
so we can go do
whatever we want.

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,769
‐ Oh, okay.

80
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,191
You wanna go and have some tea
while we’re waiting for her?

81
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,851
‐ That’s such a
big waste of money!

82
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,148
Why don’t we just
buy some drinks

83
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,361
and head out to the park?

84
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,612
‐ Sounds good, all right.

85
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,613
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I
gotta thank Karen for this!

86
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,205
‐ Sorry, did you say something?

87
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,611
‐ Uh, no!

88
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,118
No, nothing at all!

89
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,619
(quiet sigh)

90
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,041
‐ Well, miss, have you decided?

91
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,791
(quiet sigh)

92
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,872
Miss, oh, miss?

93
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,214
‐ [Miina] And now that
Shimazaki has started dating

94
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,043
Vice President Tsubaki,

95
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,129
Akina’s group has
gotten really depressed!

96
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,423
They totally had
it in their heads

97
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,378
that you and he were
some kind of an item.

98
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,756
Let me put it this way,

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,515
they were so sure that
Haruku actually came up to me

100
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,636
and said, "You do know that
Shimazaki is bi, right?"

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,524
You know, I don’t think she
even knows what that means.

102
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,438
You don’t like
talking much, huh?

103
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,566
‐ It’s not that.

104
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,323
It’s just that I’m
really not used to it.

105
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,324
You know, spending so
much quiet time like this.

106
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,042
‐ Yeah, well, I’m not sure
this place is all that quiet.

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,790
(crowd chatter)

108
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,959
(quiet gasp)

109
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,384
Oh, Mike, look over there!

110
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,092
It’s Miss Kazami, and
she’s with her boyfriend!

111
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,795
‐ [Mike] Isn’t that her husband?

112
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,587
You really shouldn’t
stare at them.

113
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,218
‐ I can’t stop!

114
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,521
Oh!
(can clanging)

115
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,352
(disappointed groan)

116
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,476
‐ You’re so stupid.

117
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,275
‐ Oh, fine, call me stupid.

118
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,441
But I still had a
lot of ice tea left.

119
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,453
(surprised gasp)

120
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,450
‐ Here.

121
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,411
You take it.

122
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,818
‐ Okay.

123
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,620
(pensive music)

124
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,379
(quiet gasp)

125
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,337
‐ [Mike] And don’t
drink all of it.

126
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,377
(surprised gasp)

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,548
‐ Well, of course I won’t!

128
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,047
You ruined it!

129
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,308
‐ I what?

130
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,561
‐ Nothing, okay?

131
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,271
‐ How come you’re pouting, then?

132
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,477
So let me see your face.

133
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,313
‐ No way!

134
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,267
‐ Do what I said!

135
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,565
‐ I won’t!

136
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,518
‐ [Mike] Miina!

137
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,029
(quiet gasp)

138
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,744
(awed gasp)

139
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,662
(quiet gasping)

140
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,819
‐ I...

141
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,239
(quiet gasp)

142
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,246
I...

143
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,505
(tense music)

144
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,669
‐ [Karen] Miss Miina?

145
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,127
(blade sheathing)

146
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,587
Oh, Miss Miina!

147
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,177
I’m afraid you’ve violated
Love Alliance rule number one.

148
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,684
I can’t forgive such action!

149
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,058
(heavy slice)
(anguished scream)

150
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,854
‐ She’ll cut me up!
‐ Huh?

151
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,018
What are you saying?

152
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,234
‐ Oh?

153
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,265
(crowd chattering)

154
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,204
‐ [Mizuho] Mr. Kamishiro?

155
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,448
(coy laughter)

156
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,702
‐ Well, hello there.

157
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,366
(nervous giggling)

158
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,075
Thanks a lot, Miina.

159
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,915
I really didn’t need
that embarrassment
you put me through.

160
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,172
‐ [Miina] I’m sorry.

161
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,548
I’m sorry, Karen.

162
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,551
I very nearly kissed Mike.

163
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,552
If I hadn’t suddenly remembered

164
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,297
about you and the Love Alliance,

165
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,678
I’m sure that I would have.

166
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,886
I would have.

167
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,643
Oh, what should I do?

168
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,558
I can’t seem to control myself
when I’m alone with Mike!

169
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,069
‐ [Radio] Inter‐high
school tournament

170
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,361
to be held in Matsumoto this
year is only a week away!

171
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,574
From all over the country,

172
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,405
many of the nation’s
finest young athletes

173
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,699
have begun to gather‐‐
‐ Oh, right.

174
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,992
It’s that time of year again.
‐ In preparation

175
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,866
for the opening ceremonies
and the start of competition.

176
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,413
‐ Huh, hey, Mike?

177
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,538
Where are you?

178
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,423
Did he just go ahead without me?

179
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,091
It’ll be okay, as long as
I get back to the boutique.

180
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,050
So while...

181
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,093
Hey, wait, where
is the boutique?

182
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,215
(quiet sigh)

183
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,551
‐ [Mike] Karen!

184
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,886
‐ Mr. Mike, I’m sorry I kept
you waiting for so long.

185
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,814
‐ Don’t worry about it.

186
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,444
Has Miina shown up here yet?

187
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,059
‐ I haven’t seen her in a while.

188
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,645
Is something the matter?

189
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,772
‐ I think she got lost.

190
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,819
But I’m sure she’ll show up

191
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,232
if we stay here for a while.

192
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,238
I don’t want to miss each other

193
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,779
by going off to look for her.

194
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,658
(pensive music)

195
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,538
‐ Tsubaki, can’t you just try
to be a little bit friendlier?

196
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,621
I mean, this is supposed
to be a date, you know.

197
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,786
‐ Would you please stop
assuming that this is a date?

198
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,836
‐ But I thought that, I
mean, I didn’t think I was‐‐

199
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:30,803
‐ Ah‐ha!

200
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,970
Oh?

201
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,430
This is no time for me
to be snooping on anyone.

202
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,182
(crowd chatter)

203
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,101
‐ Miss Miina still isn’t here.

204
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,016
‐ Nope.

205
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,570
Hey, you didn’t buy any clothes?

206
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,729
‐ No, I found
something that I liked,

207
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,648
but it was kinda over my budget.

208
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,988
‐ You know, I could help
you a bit if you want me to.

209
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,622
‐ No, no, thank you.

210
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,159
I’m already freeloading
at your place.

211
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,994
I couldn’t take
any more from you.

212
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,907
‐ Hey, don’t be so standoffish.

213
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,286
It’s quite possible that you
and I just might be family.

214
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,424
‐ Yeah, and it’s possible
we might be strangers.

215
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,801
‐ Hey, stop saying
things like that.

216
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,589
‐ If we were strangers...

217
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,802
‐ Yeah?

218
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,682
‐ What would you do
if weren’t related?

219
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,091
(exasperated sigh)

220
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,138
‐ I wouldn’t do anything,
just normal stuff.

221
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,761
Like I’ve always done, I guess.

222
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,139
‐ I just don’t think...

223
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,596
(pensive music)

224
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,056
I would be able to act like
nothing had changed between us.

225
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,270
‐ Of course I’m
sure that it’d be

226
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,277
a little bit awkward
for us at first.

227
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,949
‐ That’s not what I
was talking about.

228
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,239
I mean I didn’t...

229
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,868
I’m sorry for saying
such weird things.

230
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,957
(surprised gasp)

231
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,208
He must’ve really hated
what I was saying.

232
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,086
Oh?

233
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,088
‐ Here.

234
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,639
‐ [Karen] Mr. Mike!

235
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,930
‐ I asked the salesperson,
so I’m sure this is it.

236
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,306
This is the new outfit
that you wanted, right?

237
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,226
‐ Oh.

238
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,108
(surprised gasp)

239
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,945
(quiet crying)

240
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,400
‐ What’s wrong?

241
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,989
Karen, how can you cry?

242
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,953
‐ You can’t keep
being so sweet to me,

243
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,495
or I won’t be able to
restrain myself any longer.

244
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,498
‐ [Mike] What are
you talking about?

245
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,409
‐ I mean I‐‐

246
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,129
I mean I‐‐
‐ Karen!

247
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,331
(pistol cocking)

248
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,588
Karen!

249
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,131
You realize you’re
in clear violation

250
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,425
of Love Alliance
rule number one!

251
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,878
I’m sorry, I can’t
let that slide.

252
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,762
(loud bang)
(anguished scream)

253
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,308
(Karen squealing)

254
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,721
‐ Hey!

255
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,018
Yeah, this is ridiculous!

256
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,601
Why are you passing out now?

257
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,687
Hey, Karen, wake up!

258
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,731
(crowd chattering)

259
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,112
‐ Uh, don’t mind us,
everything’s fine!

260
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,284
She gets lightheaded sometimes!

261
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,953
(nervous laughter)

262
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,871
(sighing) Gimme a break!

263
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,999
(crowd chattering)

264
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,246
(footsteps patting)

265
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,166
‐ Oh?

266
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:17,876
Uh‐oh.

267
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,682
At least I finally
found the boutique,

268
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,274
but I’m so late,
they left without me!

269
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,056
(gentle music)

270
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,107
‐ What am I gonna do?

271
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,993
I can’t just leave Karen
alone when she’s like this.

272
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,491
But what about Miina?

273
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,069
She can be so clueless.

274
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,447
‐ [Haruko] Oh, look, it’s Karen!

275
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,584
Hey, so what’s wrong with Karen?

276
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,081
Is she asleep?

277
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,543
‐ I’m glad that you’re here.

278
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,924
Can I ask the two of you to
watch Karen for a little while?

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,540
‐ Uh, yeah.

280
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,248
‐ Great, thanks.
‐ Whoa, wait a second!

281
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,167
We were just about to
go in and watch a movie!

282
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,455
‐ Ah, come on, Senpai!

283
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,758
This is important!

284
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,551
‐ Well, since you
put it that way.

285
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,347
(crowd chatter)

286
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,466
‐ Where in the hell
could Miina be?

287
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,188
Yeah.

288
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,269
(bright music)

289
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,735
(quiet grumbling)

290
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,316
(tired gasp)

291
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,359
‐ [Karen] Mr. Mike?

292
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,281
‐ No, silly!

293
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,201
It’s me, Matugu Shido!

294
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,282
(surprised gasp)

295
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,117
(loud scream)

296
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,581
‐ Mr. Pervert!

297
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,332
‐ How dare you say that!

298
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,212
‐ Oh, calm down, Karen!

299
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,711
He’s quite safe!

300
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,792
My brother is more of a
closet pervert, you know?

301
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,376
‐ You too, Haruko?

302
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:44,465
(crowd chattering)
(birds singing)

303
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,258
‐ They’re not here, either.

304
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,769
Karen wasn’t at the
boutique when I checked.

305
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,601
It’s possible that they
might have already...

306
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,187
(romantic music)

307
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,441
‐ Hey, Miina.

308
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,654
We’re gonna head on home
now in lovey‐dovey mode.

309
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,743
‐ Oh, Miss Miina, I hereby
disband the Love Alliance.

310
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,198
(quiet sigh)

311
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,624
‐ It’s just a fantasy.

312
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,124
I can’t believe I’m
thinking this way.

313
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,577
This is just ridiculous!

314
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,666
I’m stupid like Mike said I was.

315
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,670
(crowd chattering)

316
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,717
‐ Mr. Mike must be
with Miss Miina.

317
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,185
(romantic music)

318
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,431
‐ Hey, Karen.

319
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,184
We’re gonna head on home
now in lovey‐dovey mode.

320
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,485
‐ Oh, Karen, I hereby
disband the Love Alliance.

321
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,941
‐ Oh, no!

322
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,153
Please take me with you.

323
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,615
Don’t leave me all alone!

324
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,744
(sentimental music)

325
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,124
(slide whistle)
(loud slurping)

326
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,121
(quiet sobbing)

327
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,792
‐ Hey, guys, where’s Karen?

328
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,872
‐ She’s gone off.

329
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,035
I don’t know where.

330
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,504
‐ Man.

331
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,285
Darn it.

332
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,168
(video games beeping)

333
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,925
‐ Oh, Mike, Karen.

334
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,837
‐ Mr. Mike, oh, Miss Miina.

335
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,599
(phone ringing)

336
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,765
(phone ringing)

337
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,485
(phone ringing)

338
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,488
(phone ringing)

339
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,991
(phone ringing)

340
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,202
(phone receiver slamming)

341
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,584
‐ Terrific, they’re
not home, either.

342
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,499
Well, is it possible
something bad happened?

343
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,827
Miina, Karen.

344
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,166
(sinister music)
‐ Help me, Mike, please!

345
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,843
‐ Oh, Mr. Mike!

346
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,170
‐ Why don’t you ride
with me ’til the morning?

347
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,045
Come on!
(loud slam)

348
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,843
(surprised gasp)

349
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,296
‐ Hey, you’re that
guy in the red Chaser!

350
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,505
(girl screaming)
You bastard!

351
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,348
‐ What?

352
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,390
What did I do?

353
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,929
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I hate it.

354
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,387
I hate being alone.

355
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,936
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I really
don’t like being alone.

356
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,237
‐ I hate it.
‐ I hate it.

357
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,531
‐ [Mike] Don’t you
be popping up on me

358
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,704
at a crazy time like
this, you got it?

359
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,372
‐ Wha, what the hell?

360
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,779
I don’t know what
your problem is,

361
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,487
but you’re making a big mistake!

362
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,619
(exasperated sigh)

363
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,787
‐ Damn it, I just don’t
get how it’s come to this.

364
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,797
(melancholy music)

365
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,222
‐ [Miina Voiceover] Mike.

366
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,852
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Mr. Mike.

367
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,766
‐ [Mike] Miina, Karen.

368
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,066
Miina.

369
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,980
Karen.

370
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,446
Miina and Karen.

371
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,327
Miina, Karen!

372
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,583
I’m standing right over here!

373
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,054
Mike Kamishiro is right here!

374
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,470
Where are you,
where have you gone?

375
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,011
Hey!

376
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,932
Hear me!

377
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,096
I’m standing right here!

378
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,352
Miina!

379
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,602
‐ Oh, is that Mike?

380
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,306
‐ [Mike] Karen!

381
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,686
‐ Oh, Mr. Mike?

382
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,282
(bright music)

383
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,164
(rapid breathing)

384
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,241
‐ Mike!

385
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,034
(rapid breathing)

386
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,277
‐ Mr. Mike!

387
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,330
(surprised gasp)

388
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,334
‐ [Mike] Miina!

389
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,286
Karen!

390
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,125
‐ Karen!

391
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,633
‐ Oh, Miss Miina!

392
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,800
‐ Oh, no!

393
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,216
(surprised gasp)

394
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,137
(worried gasp)

395
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,894
(all screaming)

396
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,935
‐ Where have you been?

397
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,364
‐ Mr. Mike!
‐ Oh, Mike!

398
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,325
(both sobbing)

399
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,863
‐ Oh, geez.

400
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,318
(pained grumbling)

401
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,239
Oh?

402
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,705
‐ Kamishiro!

403
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,116
How could you in
such a public place?

404
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,004
‐ Well, my hats
off to you, Mike.

405
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,921
You know even I couldn’t
possibly top anything like that.

406
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,758
‐ You can see their undies!
(joyous crying)

407
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,091
(nervous gasp)

408
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,466
(exasperated gasp)

409
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,853
‐ Today is the worst day.

410
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,018
(crickets chirping)

411
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,103
‐ Hey, Karen, I’m envious.

412
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,357
Mike was really nice and
bought you some clothes.

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
‐ I’m so sorry.

414
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,820
‐ [Miina] Oh, well.

415
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,899
‐ So it’s all right with you?

416
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,909
‐ Actually, I...

417
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,697
I very nearly kissed Mike.

418
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,045
Out in the park.

419
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,001
‐ What?

420
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,909
No fair!

421
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,084
‐ I’m telling you this

422
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,537
per our Love Alliance
rules and regulations.

423
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,711
‐ Okay, but that’s not
really the point, is it?

424
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,756
‐ No, but he bought
you those clothes!

425
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,342
(sentimental music)
(quiet gasp)

426
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,388
‐ All right, no
more cheating, okay?

427
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,225
‐ You too, Karen.

428
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,476
(coy giggling)

429
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,113
‐ [Both] Hey, why don’t we agree

430
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,401
that everything that happened
today never really happened?

431
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,284
(quizzical gasp)

432
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,283
(coy giggling)

433
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,995
(coy giggling)

434
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,621
(both laughing)

435
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,002
(birds singing)

436
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,537
(bright music)
‐ Hey, Mike!

437
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,297
Let’s go out and
have some fun again.

438
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,051
‐ [Karen] Yeah, let’s all
go out together again!

439
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,762
‐ [Mike] Nope,
never gonna happen.

440
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,054
‐ Ah, what?
‐ Mr. Mike, that’s terrible!

441
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,757
‐ [Mike] Terrible’s fine by me.

442
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,185
(Miina giggling)

443
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,426
(exasperated sigh)

444
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,019
‐ [Miina] If we stay
like this next time‐‐

445
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,692
‐ [Karen] We’ll never lose
sight of each other again!

446
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,612
(frustrated gasp)

447
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,561
‐ [Mike] You think I’d be able

448
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,858
to walk around town like this?

449
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,071
Let me go!

450
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,321
‐ We’ll lose sight
of each other.

451
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,864
‐ It’ll be bad if
someone gets lost.

452
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,236
‐ Like that would happen when
we’re just going to school!

453
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,784
‐ [Miina] Oh well, it might!

454
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,037
‐ [Karen] You know, there
is a chance that it would.

455
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,619
‐ [Mike] Ah, geez.

456
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,134
‐ [Girl] Miyafuji?

457
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,037
‐ Huh?
‐ Oh?

458
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,459
‐ It is you, right?

459
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,015
‐ [Miina] Yuka?

460
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,346
‐ Miina, to see you again
in a place like this!

461
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,062
What a coincidence!

462
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,691
‐ Yuka.

463
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,146
‐ I was so worried about you.

464
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,861
You disappeared so suddenly.

465
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,942
I’ve missed you.

466
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,992
(Yuka giggling)

467
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,741
(birds singing)

468
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,371
(uptempo J‐pop music)

469
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,956
‐ [Both] Next
episode, more twins!

470
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,924
‐ [Miina] To think that I’d
see Yuka there, of all places.

471
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,264
‐ [Karen] She’s a person that
knows about Miss Miina’s past.

472
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,092
The past that we
don’t know about.

473
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,637
‐ It’s all right.

474
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,051
I’m all right.

475
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,677
‐ [Karen] Tell us what
happened, please, Miss Miina?

476
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,145
‐ I don’t want them to know.

477
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,806
Not Mike and not Karen.

478
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,355
I don’t want them or anyone
else to know about me.

479
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,767
‐ [Karen] Oh, Miss Miina.

480
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,355
Please Twins episode
10: I Want To Run Again.

481
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,612
Be sure to watch it.

482
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,995
Next episode, more twins!
