1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,385
(soft music)

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,533
‐ [Mike] Karen.

3
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,614
‐ [Karen] Mr. Mike.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,196
‐ Where’d Miina go?

5
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,873
‐ [Karen] I don’t know,
she isn’t back yet.

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,832
‐ I see.

7
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,454
‐ I suppose it can’t be helped.

8
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,328
This is the first time
she’s seen her friend

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,874
in quite a long while.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,040
‐ That’s true.

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,708
I think so too.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,170
‐ Yes.

13
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,215
A vague sense of worry

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,050
was starting to wrap
itself around me.

15
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,892
Most likely, Mr.
Mike was feeling

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,224
the very same thing.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,100
Miss Miina had kept
her past a secret

18
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,478
from us for all this time.

19
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,944
And both Mr. Mike and I

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,395
had been very
careful not to touch

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,444
that issue for her sake.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,780
However, now that Miss
Miina’s friend had appeared,

23
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,156
something was going to change.

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,292
At least, that’s what
I started to think.

25
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,712
There were only supposed
to be two of us,

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,079
but we decided to stay
together as three.

27
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,131
And we finally started to
feel that it was all right.

28
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,795
And yet, I couldn’t seem to

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,965
shake the worries away.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,354
(upbeat music in
foreign language)

31
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,811
‐ What?

32
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,018
‐ Nothing.

33
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,529
I was just wondering.

34
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,611
What kind of conversation did
you have with your friend?

35
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,156
‐ This and that.

36
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,529
But she seemed like
she was very happy

37
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,788
to hear that I had
found my relatives.

38
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,329
‐ Oh, I see.

39
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,583
That’s wonderful.

40
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,247
(sighs)

41
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,215
‐ It was.

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,379
(soft music)

43
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,513
So you run on the
inner high school team?

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,180
‐ Mmhmm, my last race
was the best I ever ran.

45
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,557
I was like, so excited.

46
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,314
Though I could say my
mother was more excited.

47
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,318
‐ Good for you.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,990
‐ Sorry, how inconsiderate.

49
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,449
I shouldn’t talk about it.

50
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,991
‐ Oh, don’t be ridiculous.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,873
I know you’ve been working
hard for a long time.

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,871
You should be proud.

53
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,333
I’m very happy for you.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,120
‐ Thanks a lot.

55
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,169
Aren’t you ever
coming back, Miina?

56
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,471
‐ But I told you.

57
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,471
I found my relatives
so I’m staying.

58
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,473
So you don’t have
to worry about me.

59
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,605
I’m very happy with my life.

60
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,352
‐ [Yuuka] Should I keep this
a secret from my mother?

61
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,903
‐ [Miina] If that’s possible.

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,360
‐ Can I assume that everything’s

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,820
finally cleared up now?

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,281
That we’re okay?

65
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,359
I mean, I was able to meet

66
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,324
my mother’s
expectations at last.

67
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,569
And Miina, you were able
to locate your family.

68
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,949
‐ Yeah, that’s right.

69
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,248
I guess that’s good enough.

70
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,882
(water splashing)

71
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,666
‐ Miss Miina, it’s
time for us to,

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Miss Miina!

73
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,889
‐ [Mike] Idiot, you
should know better

74
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,805
not to soak until
you’re hard boiled.

75
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,475
‐ [Miina] There goes my dignity.

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,734
‐ Oh yeah, well, you
didn’t have too much.

77
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,488
‐ [Miina] That
hurts my feelings.

78
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,324
‐ [Mike] Karen, I trust you
take care of Miina, okay?

79
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,117
‐ Sure, I’d be happy to.

80
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,334
‐ [Miina] Hey, Mike?

81
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,165
‐ What do you need?

82
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,919
‐ It’s fine for me
to stay here, right?

83
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,131
‐ Oh, Miss Miina.

84
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,633
‐ I can stay here.

85
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,756
I can, right?

86
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,762
‐ Of course you can.

87
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,256
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,653
(crickets chirping)

89
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,027
Of course you can.

90
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,243
(bells chiming)

91
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,369
‐ Hey Miina, hi Karen.

92
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,912
All of us are going
over to my place

93
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,407
to hang out after school today.

94
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,119
‐ So then, would
you like to join us?

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,248
‐ We’ll have a blast.

96
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,547
‐ So Miss Miina,
what should we do?

97
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,467
‐ Oh, I’m sorry.

98
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,049
I have a lot of stuff I
have to get done today.

99
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,095
‐ That’s too bad.

100
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,509
‐ Oh, that’s really a shame.

101
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,097
This morning my
brother was saying

102
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,563
that he was going to
volunteer to cook for us.

103
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,774
‐ [Girls] Huh?

104
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,564
(giggles)

105
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,978
‐ No way, you can count me out.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,154
‐ Me too.

107
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,612
‐ Huh, why not?

108
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,074
It’s my brother cooking for us.

109
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,282
‐ So Miss Miina, you
gonna go see your friend?

110
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,157
‐ Yeah, I guess.

111
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,414
‐ [Mike] Hey, Karen.

112
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,455
‐ Hi, Mr. Mike.

113
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,330
‐ Where’s Miina?

114
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,584
Isn’t she with you?

115
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,325
‐ [Karen] No, she’s
going to get together

116
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,877
with her friend this afternoon.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,550
She already left.

118
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,879
‐ I see.

119
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,713
Hmm?

120
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,467
‐ Something the matter?

121
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,591
‐ Well, isn’t that girl
over there Miina’s friend?

122
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,394
‐ Excuse me.

123
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,272
If I’m not mistaken,

124
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,274
you’re Miss Miina’s
friend, aren’t you?

125
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,896
‐ Yes, yes that’s right.

126
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,363
Are you friends of hers?

127
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,823
‐ Sort of, we’re Miina’s family.

128
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,108
‐ [Yuuka] Family?

129
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,115
(gasps)

130
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,621
(soft music)

131
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,246
‐ Even if I do something
like this here,

132
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,633
it’s still not gonna
make any difference.

133
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,546
But Karen always looks
so worried all the time.

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,677
I’m happy Mike pretends
to look the other way.

135
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,143
I appreciate it.

136
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,222
But for now at least,

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,227
I really don’t
want to see Yuuka.

138
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,652
No, I can’t say that.

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,244
(squeals)

140
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,949
Oh, Ms. Kazami.

141
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,109
‐ Good afternoon.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,330
‐ What are you
doing here, ma’am?

143
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,659
‐ Well you see, I
noticed that you were

144
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,913
walking towards Mount Kokama

145
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,045
on your way home from
school, Miss Miyafuji,

146
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,293
so I thought that I
should follow you.

147
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,834
It’s not safe for
a girl like you

148
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,497
to be in such an isolated
area by yourself.

149
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,506
‐ I’m sorry, ma’am.

150
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,341
‐ It’s not that I’m
upset at you or anything.

151
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,797
May I join you for awhile?

152
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,757
‐ Yeah, of course.

153
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,058
(moans)

154
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,682
‐ It feels so nice.

155
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,847
It’s been quite awhile,

156
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,229
since the last time.

157
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,533
‐ Can I ask you a question?

158
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,358
‐ [Mizuho] What is it?

159
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,283
‐ Well.

160
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,817
How can I put this?

161
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,566
Oh that’s right, I know.

162
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,080
You’re married,
right, Ms. Kazami?

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,710
‐ Yes, to a wonderful man.

164
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,290
‐ [Miina] Did you
have lots of dramas

165
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,495
before you got married?

166
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,505
‐ [Mizuho] Mmhmm,
there were lots of them

167
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,207
after we got married too.

168
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,127
‐ Really, afterwards?

169
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,545
‐ That’s right.

170
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,425
I think I can finally
say it with a smile now.

171
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,926
But there were times
that I felt as if

172
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,266
my body and soul had been

173
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,980
ripped apart at the seams.

174
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,771
‐ What did you do when
you felt that way?

175
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,896
‐ I verbalized it all.

176
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,151
‐ Verbalized?

177
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,532
‐ Yes, just about everything.

178
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,572
I verbally expressed
everything that I was feeling.

179
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,577
Sad things, happy things.

180
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,752
Even things I didn’t
want to think about.

181
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,456
‐ [Karen] Excuse me, but if
it’s not too much trouble,

182
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,416
would you please tell me

183
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,554
what you can about Miss Miina?

184
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,921
‐ About Miyafuji?

185
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,509
‐ Yes, something happened
to her, didn’t it?

186
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,224
‐ You mean, she hasn’t told you?

187
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,307
‐ Miss Miina doesn’t
say much about herself.

188
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,056
‐ Well, I‐‐

189
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,936
‐ Oh please, I really
want to know about her.

190
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,274
You gotta tell me.

191
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,108
‐ Karen, stop it.

192
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,194
‐ Mr. Mike?

193
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
‐ I said stop.

194
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,108
‐ Why would you say that?

195
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,356
Don’t you care about her?

196
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,657
Doesn’t Miss Miina worry you?

197
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,083
‐ Just because you’re worried,

198
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,329
does that make it right for you

199
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,662
to pry information
out of a stranger?

200
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:23,996
To me it seems like you’re just

201
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,294
trying to lessen
your own worries

202
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,836
in spite of what Miina wants.

203
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,381
I don’t want to find out
about Miina this way.

204
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,633
Especially if it’s something

205
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,626
that she doesn’t wanna tell us.

206
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,048
‐ Mr. Mike.

207
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,309
‐ I think, I think
he’s absolutely right.

208
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,057
‐ Yeah, me too, I’m sorry.

209
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,399
‐ Don’t worry about it.

210
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,071
‐ I’m sorry, I
shouldn’t have asked.

211
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,902
‐ I’m relieved.

212
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,947
I’m glad that Miyafuji’s
living with people like you,

213
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,530
because you care about her.

214
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,988
‐ Well sure, we’re family.

215
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,833
‐ Ms. Kazami, there
are times in your life

216
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,004
that you know you’re
making a mistake.

217
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,295
But no matter what you try,

218
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,586
there doesn’t seem
to be anything

219
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,709
you can do about it, right?

220
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,048
What should you do
in times like that?

221
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,094
‐ [Mizuho] There’s
always something that

222
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,345
you can do about it.

223
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,887
You’ve probably already
found the answer

224
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,352
and just don’t know it yet.

225
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,852
‐ [Miina] What do you mean?

226
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,687
‐ Well I think of it this way.

227
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,980
When we’re feeling sad,

228
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,691
we spend all of our
time thinking about

229
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,073
and wondering how
not to feel that way.

230
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,031
Even when we don’t realize it.

231
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,361
I guess what I’m saying is that

232
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,744
we find the answers we need

233
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,612
before we know we have.

234
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,697
I know you’re looking for

235
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,533
the right way to avoid mistakes,

236
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,037
just as you realize
you’re making one.

237
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,039
You can’t see it now

238
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,543
because you’re still
really uncertain

239
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,674
about all your feelings.

240
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,090
The answer is already
inside of you.

241
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,711
All you have to do
is move forward.

242
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,298
Just move forward.

243
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,848
(crickets chirping)

244
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,059
‐ Hi, I’m home.

245
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,429
‐ Miss Miina.

246
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,847
‐ [Miina] Karen?

247
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,517
‐ Oh you’re home, Miss Miina.

248
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,863
I was so worried about you.

249
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,704
‐ I asked you not to make
us worry but then you did.

250
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,242
‐ I’m very sorry.

251
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,407
‐ [Mike] Don’t you have
anything else to say?

252
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,076
‐ I do.

253
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,005
‐ Miss Miina?

254
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,497
‐ Karen, Mike.

255
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,455
Tomorrow after school,

256
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,707
could you guys plan to spend

257
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,257
a little bit of time with me?

258
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,971
Please come, all right?

259
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,270
(whistle blowing)

260
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,439
‐ [Mike] You wanted
us to spend time

261
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,770
with you at the track?

262
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,234
‐ [Miina] You know
about the inner

263
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,114
high school track and
field competition, right?

264
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,651
This is the training field.

265
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,936
‐ I didn’t know
about a competition.

266
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,148
‐ Hey, wait a minute.

267
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,450
I saw something about
this on the news.

268
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,243
‐ [Miina] You know
that girl over there,

269
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,405
the one who’s talking?

270
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,499
‐ [Karen] Oh yeah.

271
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,120
‐ [Mike] So is she
one of the competitors

272
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,575
in the tournament?

273
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,335
‐ Mmhmm, distance runner.

274
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,459
Her name is Yuuka Yashiro.

275
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,299
She was in my class
in junior high.

276
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,048
‐ [Karen] Were you
two close friends?

277
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,345
‐ Yeah, I think so.

278
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,470
You see, I kinda stayed with her

279
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,596
and her parents
during junior high.

280
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,023
‐ So the two of
you lived together?

281
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,604
‐ Yeah.

282
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,517
But I, I ran away from there,

283
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,148
right before I came here.

284
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,937
‐ Ran away?

285
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,238
‐ Well, I left without
saying anything.

286
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,242
That’s running away.

287
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,414
‐ But how come‐‐

288
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,159
‐ You see, just like Mike did,

289
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,865
I lived in an orphanage
from when I was a baby.

290
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,538
When I went to junior high,

291
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,666
I got to know Yuuka
pretty quickly,

292
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,172
and I started to practice
with the track team.

293
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,844
At first it was just
to hang out with her,

294
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,514
but then I got to like it.

295
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,005
It feels silly to
be saying this,

296
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,355
but I was a fast runner.

297
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,181
I started for a simple reason.

298
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,517
But the more I did it, the
more I really enjoyed it.

299
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,233
Not too long after
I started training,

300
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,235
Yuuka’s mom came
and talked to me.

301
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,977
It seems she’s a famous
track and field athlete.

302
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,028
And she told me that I
had a lot of potential.

303
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,412
At first, I turned her down.

304
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,621
I didn’t have any
money to pay her.

305
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,001
That’s when she offered
to be my legal guardian

306
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,539
until I grew up.

307
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,503
She said that I could live
in her house with Yuuka,

308
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,003
and that she would train me.

309
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,554
I was happy.

310
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,549
I ran really hard all the time

311
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,092
because I never
wanted to go back

312
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,836
to that awful orphanage again.

313
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,260
I had nothing but bad memories

314
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,467
of living in that place.

315
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,515
I entered competitions, set
new records, and won awards.

316
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,435
And then one day,

317
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,021
I received a recommendation for

318
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,235
a certain high school.

319
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,652
If I got a scholarship,

320
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,783
I thought I’d be able to run
without troubling anybody.

321
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,736
But then, I injured myself.

322
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,119
So as an athlete,
I became no good.

323
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,169
And I just couldn’t meet
everyone’s expectations.

324
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,303
The scholarship offer
was canceled too.

325
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,553
As soon as I became unable
to run, I lost everything.

326
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,465
I just couldn’t stay at
Yuuka’s place anymore,

327
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,266
so that’s why I left.

328
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,679
The only thing that
I could rely on

329
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,138
was that photograph.

330
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,230
I was such a horrible person.

331
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,935
From the moment my
scholarship offer

332
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,437
was received in the mail,

333
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,149
all I could think about
was setting a new record.

334
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,660
Even Yuuka, who lived
with me, was my rival.

335
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,833
On top of that,

336
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,371
I never understood why Yuuka

337
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,373
always insisted on calling
me by my last name.

338
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,424
All I could think about
was how to protect

339
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,382
what I thought I belonged to.

340
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,676
You see, I desperately
wanted a place to belong.

341
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,178
‐ Oh, Miss Miina.

342
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,563
‐ [Miina] I, I‐‐

343
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,387
‐ Idiot, what are
you talking about?

344
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,479
Miina, you’ve got a place.

345
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,776
Our place is yours
and you belong there.

346
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,989
And so, there’s no need
to force yourself to run.

347
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,952
If you want to run, you
can go ahead and do it.

348
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,491
And if you don’t want to
run, that’s fine as well.

349
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,946
No matter what you say or do,

350
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,247
Karen and I will not change

351
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,120
how we feel about you.

352
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,167
But that’s not the point.

353
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,342
Don’t you have something
you need to do?

354
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,251
Wasn’t there a
reason you came here?

355
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,338
‐ [Karen] There was,
wasn’t there, Miss Miina?

356
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,140
‐ Karen, I,

357
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,685
I, I’m sure that, I
mean I, I’m certain.

358
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,988
(soft music)

359
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:56,832
Yuuka.

360
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,832
‐ Miyafuji, doesn’t
your knee hurt?

361
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,413
‐ Just a little.

362
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,248
Let me run with you
for a little while.

363
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,045
‐ I’m fine with it
if you are, Miyafuji.

364
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,750
‐ Thanks.

365
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,215
Yuuka, you know, I’m fine now.

366
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,089
I really am fine.

367
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,562
I finally found a
place where I belong.

368
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,599
A place where I can be myself

369
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,183
without overexerting myself.

370
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:27,064
Please make sure to tell
your mom about it, okay?

371
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,358
And Yuuka, I’m sorry
about so many things.

372
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,374
That’s what I wanted to say.

373
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,369
That’s what I’ve
always wanted to say.

374
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,122
‐ Miyafuji, I was
jealous of you, you know.

375
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,461
I was jealous that you
could run faster than me.

376
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,511
I’m so sorry.

377
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:53,837
‐ Yeah.

378
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,798
Thanks for being
so honest with me.

379
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,314
‐ You know, I think
of you as a friend.

380
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,559
(gasps)

381
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,979
I really do.

382
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,493
‐ Yeah.

383
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,201
(soft music)

384
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,962
(screams)

385
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,843
‐ Miina!
‐ Miss Miina.

386
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,962
‐ Are you all right?

387
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,971
‐ [Mike] Miina.

388
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,179
‐ Miss Miina.

389
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,850
Did you hurt yourself?

390
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,965
(laughs)

391
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,057
‐ I just tripped.

392
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,694
‐ Oh good.

393
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,769
‐ You had me so worried.

394
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,194
‐ Me too.

395
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,534
‐ [Miina] Yeah, that’s right.

396
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,408
This is where I belong.

397
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,885
(birds chirping)

398
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,756
Hey Karen, is Mike still asleep?

399
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,052
‐ It seems he was working
rather late last night.

400
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,006
‐ Do you mind if I leave
you to do the chores?

401
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,136
‐ It’s all right.

402
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,394
You should feel
free to go and help

403
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,475
Miss Yuuka out for
as long as you need.

404
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,943
‐ Thanks a lot.

405
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,653
I’ll be back in plenty of
time for us to go to work.

406
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,613
‐ Okay, have a good day.

407
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,569
‐ Thanks, you too.

408
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,736
(birds chirping)

409
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,720
‐ I’m so glad the three
of us can stay together.

410
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,590
The three of us in this house.

411
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,981
There’s something
not quite right here.

412
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,596
Now I see it.

413
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,937
The difference is
that there’s a road

414
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,442
in between the
pool and the house.

415
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,234
That means the photograph

416
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,568
wasn’t taken from the place

417
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,072
where we all thought it was,

418
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,820
but from the other side.

419
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,369
(soft music)

420
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,793
There’s no doubt about it.

421
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,175
This photograph was
taken from this location.

422
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,288
But why did someone need to come

423
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,589
all the way up here just
to take a photograph?

424
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,093
(soft music)

425
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,177
‐ Good morning.

426
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,644
Hmm, that’s weird.

427
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,726
The two of them have
gone out already?

428
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,321
‐ No way, it can’t.

429
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,650
Could this possibly be the house

430
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,322
where our mom used to live?

431
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,406
Could this really be
where I came from?

432
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,536
(upbeat music in
foreign language)

433
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,655
‐ [Girls] Next
episode, more twins.

434
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,844
‐ [Karen] I will no longer
ask myself what I should do.

435
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,261
I understand how Miss Miina

436
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,419
and Mr. Mike are concerned.

437
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,047
So I, Karen Onodera, am
going to let them know

438
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,256
the feelings I
have inside of me.

439
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,427
I have to express
these strong feelings,

440
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,885
even though it could mean

441
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,635
a possible breakup
of the love alliance.

442
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,560
Please Twins, episode 11.

443
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,147
I Want To Tell You I Love You.

444
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,114
Be sure to watch it.

445
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,242
Next episode, more twins.
