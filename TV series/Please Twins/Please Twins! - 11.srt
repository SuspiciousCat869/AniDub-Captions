1
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,983
(tranquil piano music)

2
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,253
(upbeat electronic music)

3
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,560
(singing in Japanese)

4
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,182
(school bell rings)

5
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,555
‐ [Haruko] Mina, hey Mina!

6
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,813
We’re over here!

7
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,692
‐ [Mina] Sorry to
keep you guys waiting.

8
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,059
‐ Hey wait, what
happened to Karen?

9
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,688
I thought she’d be with you.

10
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,485
‐ She’s just gonna watch today.

11
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,106
It’s that time of the month.

12
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,613
‐ Amazing, girls get
such special privileges

13
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,867
when it’s their girly
time, that’s cool!

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,450
I didn’t know about that!

15
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,044
‐ [Koishi And Yuuka] You
mean you don’t get it yet?

16
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
‐ Uh, I don’t?

17
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,174
‐ You don’t?

18
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,082
Oh Haruko.

19
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,723
‐ [Teacher] Hi everyone,
let’s get started.

20
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,469
Today we’ll move on
to the sample shown

21
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,591
on page 76 of your textbook.

22
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
The sample is where
Mi meets Kumihiko‐

23
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:42,889
(sighs)

24
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,813
‐ What’s wrong?

25
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,060
‐ [Teacher] And acknowledges

26
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:45,982
that he is fuming from
conversing with him.

27
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,139
‐ Nothing, it just suddenly felt

28
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,557
like there was
someone in the hall‐

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,225
‐ [Teacher] Mr. Kamishiro
and Mr. Shimazaki.

30
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,732
‐ I’m sorry.

31
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,444
‐ [Teacher] As I was saying
before I was interrupted,

32
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,356
this part of the excerpt
is a good example

33
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,783
of a process by which we‐

34
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,662
(birds chirping)

35
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,748
‐ [Koishi] Mina, I’m
heading to school now.

36
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,831
I can trust you to take
care of the shop, right?

37
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,626
‐ Of course you can,
have a good class.

38
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,923
‐ Bye Karen, I’m going now!

39
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,587
Karen?

40
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,888
‐ Oh yes, one serving
of chicken soba noodles!

41
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,182
Thank you very much.

42
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,270
‐ What was that about?

43
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,733
‐ A bit of over dingy‐ness

44
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,572
‐ [Mike] Karen’s been
acting strange lately?

45
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,240
‐ [Mina] Yeah, I mean a
different strange than normal.

46
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,275
I don’t know.

47
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,954
(plate breaks)

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,950
She’s been in ultra
clumsy mode lately,

49
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,959
and I don’t think it’s her
time of the month either.

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,961
‐ Time of the month?

51
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,343
‐ [Mina] Nevermind, I’m worried.

52
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,961
She’s been taking her baths
lately all by herself.

53
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,093
So I‐

54
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,595
‐ Talk to her, see if she’s
got something on her mind.

55
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,300
‐ Yeah.

56
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,266
‐ Miss Mina Myafuji
and Karen Onodera.

57
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,356
Love alliance rule number one,

58
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,405
neither of us asks Mr. Mike out

59
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,067
until we figure out which
one of us is his family.

60
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,704
Love alliance rule number two,

61
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,286
if one of us finds out
she’s family with Mr. Mike,

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,500
we inform the other right away.

63
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,582
Love alliance rule number three,

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,336
whoever turns out to be
the relative will support,

65
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,247
the relative will support

66
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,378
the other’s romantic
relationship with Mr. Mike.

67
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,394
And so‐

68
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,221
‐ [Mina] Karen!

69
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,845
Hey, can I come in?

70
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,390
‐ (gasps) Miss, Miss Mina!

71
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,096
‐ Sorry, did I come
at a bad time for you?

72
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,606
‐ No, I was, I was just
about to get out anyway.

73
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,031
I’ll head out now Miss Mina.

74
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:14,082
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I’m so
sorry Miss Mina, I’m sorry.

75
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,088
(faucet drips)

76
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,734
(gasps)

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,639
‐ Hey.

78
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,600
What is it?

79
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,400
‐ Oh, it’s nothing, really.

80
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,652
‐ [Mike] No, I don’t
buy that for a second.

81
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,395
(Karen sighs)

82
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,319
I can see it right on your face.

83
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:54,711
You know Karen, you saw
how Mina was acting, right?

84
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,254
Don’t forget, if
there’s anything

85
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,835
you would like to
say to us, then‐

86
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,249
‐ [Karen] I know that.

87
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,958
I know that, so‐

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,339
‐ [Mike] So?

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,934
‐ But I’m a completely
different person from this Mina.

90
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,643
I’m me, I’m unique.

91
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,644
My name is Karen Onodera.

92
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,137
‐ [Mike] What are
you talking about?

93
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,688
Of course you are.

94
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,060
That’s not what I
was trying to say.

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,107
‐ [Karen] (sobs)
I’m not Miss Mina!

96
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,074
‐ Karen?

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,620
‐ [Karen] I’m not Miss Mina.

98
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,454
‐ [Mike] Karen.

99
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,789
‐ [Karen] I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

100
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,586
I didn’t mean to say
something like this.

101
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,750
‐ No, I’m sorry.

102
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,758
‐ [Karen] I’m going to go
walk outside for a bit.

103
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,841
I’ll make sure to come back,
so please don’t worry about me.

104
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,550
‐ Hey!

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,025
(whines)

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,484
‐ [Mina] How did it go?

107
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,535
‐ I have no idea, but I’m sure
there’s something going on.

108
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,825
‐ I see.

109
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,906
‐ There’s just one thing though.

110
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,662
I really don’t know
how girls feel.

111
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,410
‐ [Mina] That’s not true, Mike.

112
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,208
Actually, a girl’s feelings
are a whole lot simpler

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,344
than you probably
think they are.

114
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,091
See, we worry about things

115
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,091
because we’re too
simple, you know?

116
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,013
‐ Is that so, huh?

117
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,054
‐ Uh‐huh. For instance,
what would you do

118
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,969
if you found your mother, Mike?

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,024
You already know the
answer to that, right?

120
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,354
‐ [Mike] Yeah, but I’d
still ponder about it.

121
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,358
‐ [Mina] It’s the
same thing as that,

122
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,570
although I really hate to see
her all sullen and worried,

123
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,863
and I am very concerned
about her and her well‐being,

124
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,368
I’d like to trust
that Karen’s fine.

125
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,031
I’m sure she’ll work it out.

126
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,331
‐ Guess you’re
right, she’s fine.

127
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,498
Yeah.

128
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,378
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
What am I gonna do

129
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,637
when I can no longer
say that anymore?

130
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,466
Because...

131
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,104
because the answer
is already out.

132
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,939
I know that Miss Mina is
really worried about me,

133
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,238
and I also know how Mr.
Mike feels about things too.

134
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,698
And so, I’ll become,
I’ll become stronger.

135
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,708
Karen Onodera will become
stronger, and walk with a smile.

136
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,379
And then...

137
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,089
and then...

138
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,676
(dramatic music)

139
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,294
We will be disbanding.

140
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,211
Miss Mina,

141
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,563
I’m going to disband
our love alliance.

142
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,188
‐ I went and put my work on hold

143
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,199
in order to come all the
way out here for this.

144
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,822
I’m gonna hate it if
it’s some sort of prank.

145
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,368
‐ [Karen] I’m sorry to
keep you waiting, Mr. Mike.

146
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,949
‐ Karen!

147
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,248
‐ I’m sorry, it took me a
little bit of time to get ready.

148
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,843
‐ That’s okay, but that dress.

149
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,959
‐ Yes, it’s the one that
you bought for me, Mr. Mike.

150
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,637
(giggles) How does it look?

151
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,349
‐ Um well, it looks great.

152
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,061
‐ [Karen] Thank you very much.

153
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,182
‐ Oh yeah, Karen. About
this letter that I got.

154
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,769
‐ Right, I sent that to you.

155
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,364
‐ Why go to the
trouble of all this?

156
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,070
‐ I have a favor to ask you.

157
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,322
Could you please go
out on a date with me?

158
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:35,995
‐ A date?

159
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,490
‐ [Karen] Yes, a date.

160
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,407
A date between Karen Onodera
and Mike Kamishiro. (giggles)

161
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,752
(calm, upbeat music)

162
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,961
‐ [Mike] Hey, what’s with
this all of a sudden?

163
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,207
What’s it all about?

164
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,220
‐ Is it bad for us
to go out on a date?

165
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,182
‐ Well, I’m not
saying that, but‐

166
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,510
‐ Then I think it’s
perfectly all right,

167
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,096
because after all, we
just might be strangers.

168
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,645
‐ [Mike] Karen, you
really shouldn’t say‐

169
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,686
‐ [Karen] I’m sorry, but I,
I just wanted to go on a date

170
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,192
because this’ll
be the first date

171
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,744
I’ll have been on in my life!

172
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,898
(calm, upbeat music)

173
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:51,942
‐ [Mike] Here.

174
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,733
‐ Oh, thank you very much.

175
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,821
‐ [Mike] We’ve
walked quite a bit.

176
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,243
‐ [Karen] Yes.

177
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,399
‐ [Mike] Did it seem
enough like a date for you?

178
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,658
‐ [Karen] Well yeah,
of course it did.

179
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,582
‐ [Mike] Good. But to
tell you the truth,

180
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,289
it didn’t feel
like a date to me.

181
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,787
In fact, it wasn’t any different

182
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,461
from when the three
of us go out together.

183
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,630
‐ [Karen] It was
different, it was.

184
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,844
I’m sure that it was.

185
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

186
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,810
‐ So Karen, looks like
you found the answer.

187
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,846
‐ Um yes, yes I have.

188
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,436
‐ [Mike] I see,
then it’s all right.

189
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,060
You don’t have to say anything.

190
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,817
If you’re satisfied with the
answer, then it’s fine with me.

191
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,837
(bell rings)

192
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,225
Karen, I‐

193
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,531
Karen?

194
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,374
(gasps) Karen!

195
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,872
‐ Please let me say this.

196
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,875
I know the answer, and so...

197
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,502
Mr. Mike, are you listening?

198
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,796
I love you.

199
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,387
Oh, I love you, Mr. Mike.

200
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,679
And not only that,
I’m in love with you.

201
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,063
‐ Karen, oh Karen.

202
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:02,188
‐ [Karen] It’s, it’s
only natural that I
love you, Mr. Mike.

203
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,397
It was bound to happen.

204
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,910
(gasps) And that’s because

205
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,242
you’re my one and only
big brother, Mr. Mike.

206
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,950
(Mike gasps)

207
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,120
Mr. Mike, you and
I are, we’re twins.

208
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,418
Brother and sister, family.

209
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,180
We now know that no matter
how much I love you,

210
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,222
you and I will
never have a romance

211
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,597
because we’re blood related,
because we’re twins.

212
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,096
Because we’re siblings.

213
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,440
I’m very happy that we’re
related, I really am.

214
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,112
I really‐ (sobs)

215
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,155
‐ [Mike] Karen.

216
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,682
‐ I’m so sorry.

217
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,512
I probably shouldn’t
have told you how I feel,

218
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,888
but I couldn’t, I
couldn’t help it.

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,690
I just couldn’t help it!

220
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,691
(sobs)

221
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,083
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
I see, I get it now.

222
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,079
It seems it’s true that
Karen and I are twins,

223
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,418
and that the girl in this
photograph is, no, no way!

224
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,848
Hey, you know what, Mother?

225
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,855
You abandoned me.

226
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,647
After 16 years, I’ve finally
become my own person.

227
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,025
Then Mina came along
and Karen came along.

228
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,612
And then the three of us
started to live together.

229
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,446
Good things were about
to get started, until‐

230
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,907
‐ Just don’t leave, put this
stupid stuff behind you.

231
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,801
(Mina hums)

232
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,104
‐ Oh.

233
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,638
‐ Ah!

234
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,055
‐ I’ll give you
pretch later, okay?

235
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,646
‐ [Karen] I’m home.

236
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,729
‐ Hi, welcome back!

237
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,735
I was getting worried, what
were you doing out so late?

238
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,528
And you’re all dressed up like
you’re going out on a date.

239
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,612
(laughs) You weren’t
by any chance

240
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,619
off breaking love alliance
rule number one, were you?

241
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,407
‐ [Karen] Love alliance rule
number three, to be exact.

242
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,828
‐ What?

243
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,754
‐ Miss Mina, Mr. Mike’s sibling
has turned out to be me.

244
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,999
‐ Huh?

245
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,417
‐ Mr. Mike is actually
my older brother.

246
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,935
‐ That means that you and Mike

247
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,434
are really the twins
in the picture?

248
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,345
‐ Uh‐huh.

249
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,095
‐ You found out.

250
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,096
‐ Uh‐huh.

251
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,567
‐ Wow, I just can’t believe it!

252
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,649
Oh my goodness gracious,
that changes things.

253
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,397
I guess I’ll have
to move out of here.

254
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,607
‐ [Karen] What are you
talking about, Miss Mina?

255
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,120
There’s no way that Mr. Mike

256
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,201
would ever kick you
out of this house.

257
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,875
You know that’s true,
don’t you Miss Mina?

258
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,794
‐ Yes, Karen.

259
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,376
‐ This house is home
for all three of us.

260
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:53,091
You belong here Miss Mina,
just as much as I belong here.

261
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,474
We belong together.

262
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,886
‐ Do you, do you really mean
that I’m not related to Mike?

263
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,480
‐ That’s right, you’re free.

264
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,811
You’re finally free to
fall in love with him.

265
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,863
It’s all right for you to, to
tell him exactly how you feel.

266
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,328
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
I’ll head home first.

267
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,416
Mr. Mike, I’ll head
head home first.

268
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,171
I’m sorry to have given
you so many worries.

269
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,010
Have you had a chance to read
from our mother’s diary yet?

270
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,295
It’s about our mother
and about the two of us.

271
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,563
I’m going to tell
Miss Mina myself.

272
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,353
We promised each
other a while ago

273
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,274
that whoever found out which
one of us was the relative

274
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,194
would tell the other
one right away.

275
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,532
I’m sure that Miss Mina will
be confused by all of this,

276
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,863
so please, Mr. Mike,
please be kind to her.

277
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,872
Please surround her with warmth.

278
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,328
To my dear brother, love, Karen.

279
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,844
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
Nothing is gonna change.

280
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,759
I won’t let it no
matter what happens.

281
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,418
I’m not gonna let things change.

282
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,384
We won’t‐

283
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,338
‐ [Karen] Miss Mina?

284
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,221
Miss Mina!

285
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,177
‐ Karen!

286
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,557
‐ Mr. Mike, it’s Miss Mina.

287
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,773
‐ What’s wrong?

288
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,064
‐ She’s not at home,
and her bags are gone.

289
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,268
‐ What? Mina!

290
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,948
(Mina sobs)

291
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,869
Hey Mina!

292
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,804
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Why, why Miss Mina?

293
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,592
You can stay here and
fall in love with him.

294
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,468
‐ Mina!

295
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,435
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Why?

296
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,274
‐ Come back Mina, please!

297
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,060
‐ Nice to meet you.

298
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,275
I know you’ve never heard of me,

299
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,766
but I’m actually
a blood relative.

300
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,484
‐ See, here it is.

301
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,689
I have the same photo.

302
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,165
‐ They really are, we’ve
got the same eye color.

303
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,659
‐ [Mike] What matters is now!

304
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,248
You can stay here, it’s all
right to stay here, really.

305
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,794
Senpai, there was something
that I always wanted,

306
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,296
and it suddenly appeared right
in front of me, like magic,

307
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,171
and I don’t know
why that happened.

308
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,717
So why, why is that?

309
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,013
Why did that happen?

310
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,604
Mina!

311
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,570
(singing in Japanese)
