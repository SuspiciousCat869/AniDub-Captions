1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,597
(dog barking)

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,517
‐ [Miina] Hey, don’t you think

3
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,767
you should call the
police or something?

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,357
‐ You’re kidding me, right?

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,242
I finally got permission
from the orphanage

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,531
to live on my own.

7
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,452
If they see any problems
at all they’ll just come

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,361
and take me back.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,820
‐ You could have a problem.

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,408
‐ [Mike] Yeah,
because of you guys.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,045
(Miina yawns)

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,205
‐ I’m getting really sleepy.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,040
Do you have a spare futon?

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,207
‐ Do you think a
young guy living alone

15
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,246
would have a spare futon around?

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,050
‐ Don’t tell me that!

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,303
‐ I’m the one who wants to cry.

18
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,554
You’re better off,

19
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,637
at least you can
sleep next to her.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,800
‐ Oh, you’re so right.

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,846
Excuse me.

22
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,191
(door scrapes)

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,110
(upbeat pop music)

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,910
‐ [Mike] Geez, did I do
anything wrong to deserve this?

25
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,418
(singing in a foreign language)

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,583
(light orchestral music)

27
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,917
‐ I’ve been waiting for
all this time to find

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,175
the twin brother that’s
in the photograph with me.

29
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,968
He might be a bit
older than I am

30
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,722
or he may be younger than I am.

31
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,345
And I believe that I would
be able to meet him someday.

32
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,272
Maybe he’s someone like this,

33
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,941
or he could be someone a
little bit more like this.

34
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,731
‐ [Boy] Karen, Karen.

35
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,357
‐ You, who may be
my older brother

36
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,695
or even my younger brother.

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,492
(Karen yelps)
(towel whooshes)

38
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,247
(Mike chuckles)

39
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,877
(Karen screams)

40
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,927
(Miina groans)

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,722
(Karen screams)

42
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,509
(door slams)

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,388
‐ What’s the matter?

44
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,766
Are you guys okay?

45
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,772
(Karen grunts)

46
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,605
(birds chirping)

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,735
(Miina moans)

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,070
‐ Nyu.

49
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,158
‐ Nyu?

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,083
‐ Nyu.

51
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:10,877
(Miina grunts)
(girls thud)

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,589
(birds chirping)

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,130
‐ I’m terribly sorry about this.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,926
I’m sure I’ve caused
a lot of trouble.

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,880
You see I,

56
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,854
I have this habit of passing
out when I get too excited.

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,182
Oh yeah, before
we talk about that

58
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,098
I should probably
introduce myself.

59
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,398
How do you do?

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,150
My name is Karen Onodera.

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,733
‐ My name is Miina Miyafuji.

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,860
And the guy next to me is‐‐

63
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,114
‐ I don’t wanna be rude

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,856
but that doesn’t
matter right now.

65
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,617
The problem we all have
to consider right now is

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,080
that there are three
copies of this photograph.

67
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,214
‐ Maybe somebody made
some extra copies.

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,249
‐ What I wanna know is why
the two of you have ’em.

69
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:56,304
‐ Well, apparently this
photograph was handed over

70
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,299
to the orphanage on the
day my mother gave me away.

71
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,683
At least that’s what I was
told by my foster parents

72
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,973
who raised me.

73
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,764
‐ That’s the same
thing I was told.

74
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,887
‐ [Mike] So, what was
your mother’s name?

75
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,484
‐ I have no idea.

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
‐ We are the same
on that front too.

77
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,476
Just like best buddies.

78
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,016
‐ I guess that’s true.

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,359
‐ Don’t get so chummy.

80
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,784
The problem is that
the three of us

81
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,240
have a photograph,

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,200
and that there are only two
little kids shown in it.

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,163
‐ Maybe the third
one is out of frame.

84
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,333
‐ [Mike] I’m sure
that’s impossible.

85
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,002
What this means is that one
of you is a complete stranger.

86
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,921
‐ Maybe you’re the
stranger here, Mikey.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,920
‐ Hey, don’t call
me Mikey, got it?

88
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,502
(Karen yelps)

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,300
I’ve gotta go to school now.

90
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,427
We’ll finish this
when I get back.

91
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,184
You can stay here
in the meantime

92
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,516
and eat whatever’s around.

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,020
But listen, don’t
set one foot outside.

94
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,653
And don’t answer the
door, no matter what.

95
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,360
And don’t touch my computer
under any circumstances.

96
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,742
And that’s final!

97
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,201
‐ Why so bossy?

98
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,489
‐ I’m the master of this
house and I am the boss.

99
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,204
‐ You’re right, sorry.

100
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,238
‐ [Mike] I’m going now.

101
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:14,872
‐ [Karen] Um.

102
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,634
‐ [Mike] What?

103
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,376
‐ I hope you don’t mind but
I’d really appreciate it

104
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,005
if you would tell me your name.

105
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,304
‐ Mike.

106
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,717
My name’s Mike Kamishiro.

107
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,726
(cicadas chirping)

108
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,191
(upbeat music)

109
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,152
‐ [Karen] I used your shampoo.

110
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,534
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,741
‐ No problem.

112
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,162
Hey, Karen, what’d
you think about him?

113
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,909
‐ [Karen] What do you mean?

114
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,413
‐ [Miina] What was your
impression of Mike Kamishiro?

115
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,624
‐ Actually, I found him to be
more than a little bit scary.

116
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,249
‐ [Miina] Really?

117
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,424
‐ I’ve only gone to
all girls schools.

118
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,844
I don’t have much experience

119
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,761
when it comes to
dealing with males.

120
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,931
‐ You really don’t have to
be afraid of him, you know?

121
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,931
Mike is pretty rough with words

122
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,263
and likes to act tough
but, let’s face it,

123
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,807
he’s letting us stay
in his house right now.

124
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,603
I’m beginning to think that
he’s a pretty good guy.

125
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,935
Besides, he’s a little
bit on the clumsy side.

126
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,524
Trust me on this.

127
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,937
(laughs)

128
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:22,937
‐ [Karen] Oh yeah?

129
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,068
How do you know?

130
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,283
(Miina screams)

131
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,874
(Miina thuds)

132
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,043
(Karen shrieks)

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,970
(chalk tapping)

134
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,756
‐ [Teacher] Now, in
this sentence we can see

135
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,427
how the ancient Japanese
grammar is used to express

136
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,347
the word bloom.

137
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,556
‐ You left your schoolbag?

138
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,694
That’s a pretty dumb
thing to forget.

139
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,773
Don’t you agree?

140
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,145
‐ Just shut up.

141
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,153
‐ Is something going
on back at home?

142
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,355
‐ Would you shut up?

143
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,565
‐ When we’re like this,

144
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,575
don’t you think we
look just like lovers?

145
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,987
‐ Don’t talk to me.

146
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,037
‐ Anyone?
(breath whooshes)

147
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,621
‐ Oh wow, I’m getting kinda wet.

148
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,835
‐ Back off!

149
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,378
(teacher gasping)

150
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,673
‐ Kamishiro you’re that way?

151
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,505
‐ No way, you can’t believe him.

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,182
(upbeat music)

153
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,472
‐ [Matagu] Wow, Haruko,

154
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,846
the lunches you make
are so delicious.

155
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,525
‐ [Haruku] But I get
them ready‐made, brother.

156
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,772
‐ [Matagu] Oh, so that’s
why they’re all so tasty?

157
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,075
‐ [Haruku] I won’t bring
them for you anymore.

158
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,230
‐ [Matagu] No, wait, I’m sorry.

159
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,029
(Mike slurping)

160
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,863
‐ Senpai, I’m really sorry.

161
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,620
I promise I’ll pay
you back tomorrow.

162
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,291
‐ So, what happened anyway?

163
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,659
‐ Nothing, I just forgot
my wallet at home.

164
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,497
‐ [Tsubaki] Would
you like a bite?

165
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,832
I don’t mind.

166
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,746
‐ No, thank you.

167
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,206
I never really liked pumpkin.

168
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,046
(Mike slurps)

169
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,052
‐ [Miina] Hey, Mike!

170
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,093
There you are!

171
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,045
‐ Hmm?

172
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,102
‐ We’ve looked
everywhere for you.

173
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,640
(Mike spits)

174
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,734
(Tsubaki groans)

175
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,057
‐ Who’s that?

176
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,195
‐ Dunno.

177
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,824
‐ Here, you forgot
your bag this morning.

178
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,952
I also thought you’d be
hungry so I made you lunch.

179
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,412
Here, it’s my very
own special, toasty,

180
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,452
warm, pumpkin box lunch.

181
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,076
‐ Stop harassing me!

182
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,501
‐ So, you don’t like it?

183
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,080
‐ Who are these girls?

184
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,545
‐ Mr. Kamishiro.

185
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,549
(camera shutter snapping)

186
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,557
I need to ask you why your‐‐

187
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,904
‐ Duties as the student
body president‐‐

188
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,019
‐ Duties as student
body vice president.

189
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,728
‐ I understand.

190
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,738
‐ Wow, she bought that.

191
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,399
‐ Would you just be quiet?

192
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,277
‐ Mr. Kamishiro, you do
know that it’s a violation

193
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,066
of the school regulations
for you to bring

194
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,578
outsiders onto
this campus, right?

195
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,161
‐ [Mike] Yes, it was a mistake.

196
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,537
‐ Mr. Kamishiro, just
exactly how are you related

197
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,464
to those girls?

198
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,463
‐ I was just about to ask that.

199
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,505
‐ Those two are your
girlfriends, right?

200
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,840
‐ They’re not, senpai.

201
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,635
‐ [Tsubaki] So they
are your girlfriends!

202
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,876
‐ I just said they’re not!

203
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,298
And I really don’t
understand why

204
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,547
that’s any of your
business anyway!

205
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,308
(Tsubaki gasps)

206
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,515
‐ Whoa, that boy is dense.

207
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,194
‐ Yeah, you really think so?

208
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,152
‐ So, Mr. Kamishiro, what
exactly is the truth about them?

209
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,403
‐ [Miina] They...

210
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,494
They’re distant
relatives of mine.

211
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,320
The other day there was a
tragedy in their household

212
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,986
and I was the only person
they could turn to so.

213
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,788
‐ [Ichigo] That’s a lie.

214
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,000
‐ [Tsubaki] That’s a lie.

215
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,211
(Miina sighs)

216
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,461
‐ So, that’s what’s going on?

217
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,672
On top of living alone

218
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,343
you have to take care
of these two mow.

219
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,672
‐ [Both] Oh brother,
she bought it.

220
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,966
‐ You’re a wonderful person.

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,510
If you have any problems at
all don’t hesitate to call me.

222
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,427
I want to support
what you’re doing.

223
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,766
‐ Okay.

224
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,730
Thanks a lot.

225
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,312
‐ This teacher is a total ditz.

226
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,685
‐ Oh, you really think so?

227
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,404
(upbeat music)

228
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,697
‐ [Tsubaki] What?

229
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,950
You’re saying one of those
girls is your twin sister?

230
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,571
‐ Well, there seems to
be a strong possibility.

231
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,370
‐ How can you really be certain?

232
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,163
Maybe they’re just trying to
fool with you or something.

233
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,076
‐ Well, there’s nothing
they can take from me

234
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,537
by lying about this.

235
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,209
Senpai, I’m going to
try to do something

236
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,594
about this situation on my own,

237
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,552
so please don’t tell
anyone about it.

238
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,089
‐ Sure.

239
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,049
‐ [Miina] That was a pretty
modern school, don’t you think?

240
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,348
‐ [Karen] Yeah, you’re right.

241
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,272
‐ [Miina] What’s the matter?

242
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,892
‐ [Karen] Well, he
scolded us again.

243
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,898
‐ Mike can be a little
too short tempered.

244
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,822
I really wouldn’t
worry about it.

245
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,779
‐ No, I think anyone
would be upset.

246
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,572
He was living an ordinary life

247
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,735
and suddenly two total
strangers show up

248
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,872
and get in the way.

249
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,783
‐ We’re not just strangers.

250
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,000
There’s a pretty strong
possibility that we might be

251
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,499
related to Mike by blood.

252
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,870
‐ But it’s also
possible that we’re not.

253
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,458
At the very least I
think that’s going to

254
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,884
end up being the
case for one of us.

255
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,552
‐ [Miina] Can I
ask you something?

256
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,590
Are you regretting meeting Mike?

257
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,094
‐ [Karen] I don’t really‐‐

258
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,795
‐ [Miina] Was he different
from what you imagined?

259
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,597
‐ [Karen] Oh, no,
that’s not what I meant.

260
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,511
I mean, he is different but‐‐

261
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,268
‐ But you had a reason
to come here, didn’t you?

262
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,774
You knew this would happen,

263
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,435
but there was a reason you
went ahead and came anyway.

264
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,780
Am I right?

265
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,534
‐ Yes.

266
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,572
But, yeah, I understand.

267
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,947
‐ That we both have our reasons

268
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,295
and we just can’t
be so reckless.

269
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,409
I guess I knew that but...

270
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,786
When I thought Mike
might be my relative

271
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,706
I wanted to be spoiled.

272
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,293
‐ Yeah, me too.

273
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,804
‐ Hey, do you think
our mother lived here?

274
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,723
Do you think she gazed
across this lake too?

275
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,723
‐ Well, I don’t know about that.

276
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,636
But, it’s wonderful here.

277
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,480
‐ Then I think we should
take a good look at it.

278
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,651
We should engrave
the image in our eyes

279
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,654
and make memories of it.

280
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,702
I know.

281
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,657
(calm piano music)

282
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,204
‐ Great, I wonder where
they wandered off to.

283
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,330
They should be here.

284
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,502
Fine, who cares?

285
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,173
(keys clicking)

286
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,006
(calm orchestral music)

287
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,472
(thunder rumbles)

288
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,806
(rain patters)

289
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,349
(light orchestral music)

290
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,669
(Karen knocks)

291
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,505
‐ Excuse me, it’s Karen.

292
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,840
Mr. Mike, can I come in?

293
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,811
This won’t take
up too much time.

294
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,430
I’d like you to listen
to me for just a minute.

295
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,725
I’ve decided that I’m
going to go back home.

296
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,146
Ms. Miina told me that she
was going to go back home too.

297
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,656
I’m really sorry if Ms. Miina
and I caused you any trouble.

298
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,080
But I’m glad I got to spend
the night in the house

299
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,332
from the picture.

300
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,425
And I’m happy that I
got to meet somebody

301
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,709
who might be a relative.

302
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,170
Is it all right with
you if I come in?

303
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,177
Since there’s a
chance we’re related

304
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,849
I would like to
say goodbye to you.

305
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
(heavy piano music)

306
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,196
(Karen gasping)

307
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,914
Little Wonder.

308
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,247
(heavy piano music)

309
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,215
‐ I’m sorry, Mike.

310
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,762
Sorry, I’m just sneaking out.

311
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,795
It’s just that I’m no
good at saying goodbye

312
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,097
and I never have been.

313
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,233
(heavy piano music)

314
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,561
(door slides)

315
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,233
‐ Ms. Miina!

316
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,278
(Karen gasping)

317
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,612
(scooter hums)

318
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,237
Ms. Miina, look out!

319
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,164
(Mike gasps)

320
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,912
(tires screech)

321
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,078
‐ Why don’t you watch
where you’re going?

322
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,376
‐ What were you doing there?

323
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,289
‐ Huh?

324
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,085
‐ What’s this?

325
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,594
Are you going somewhere?

326
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,143
‐ Mm‐hmm.

327
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,103
‐ [Mike] You just showed up
here, did as you pleased,

328
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,773
and now you’re sneaking away?

329
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,601
Don’t you think
that’s a bit much?

330
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,310
‐ I’m sorry for barging
in and staying here.

331
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,820
But just a little bit.

332
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,823
I thought I wanted
to rely on you

333
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,525
but I guess that was wrong.

334
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,621
See ya.

335
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,738
(scooter humming)

336
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,787
(light piano music)

337
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,257
‐ Why did my mother abandon me?

338
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,300
(Miina grunts)

339
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,846
When I was young I thought
about that all the time.

340
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,600
I really wanted to find out why.

341
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,233
But now, I just don’t care
about all that stuff, you know?

342
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,770
It’s not like I’m
gonna go and change

343
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,813
anything about my
life at this point

344
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,477
just because I find out
the reason why she left me.

345
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,653
‐ [Miina] What do you mean?

346
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,236
‐ So your saying
you don’t get it?

347
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,991
‐ No, I don’t get it!

348
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,204
‐ What matters is now!

349
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,043
(dramatic orchestral music)

350
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,329
You see, if the two
of us are actually

351
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,627
related by blood somehow,

352
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,209
I just don’t wanna let you go.

353
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,304
I don’t wanna abandon
someone I’m related to.

354
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,094
‐ Even though we
might be strangers?

355
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,846
‐ There’s a chance that
you’re a relative, right?

356
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,849
‐ That’s different than what
you were saying this morning.

357
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,395
(vibrant piano music)

358
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,770
So it’s all right?

359
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,687
‐ [Mike] Yeah.

360
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,686
‐ Do you really mean it?

361
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,107
‐ You’re rubbing it in now.

362
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,736
‐ I really wanna...

363
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,159
I really wanna thank you.

364
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,215
Thank you very much.

365
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,708
Thank you for doing this.

366
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,670
(Miina sobbing)

367
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,342
(vibrant orchestral music)

368
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,803
‐ This is all gonna work
out for the best, Ms. Miina.

369
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,466
‐ [Mike] I have work so
I’m going back to my room.

370
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,676
I’m leaving getting dinner ready

371
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,265
and all that stuff to you.

372
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,772
‐ Okay, me too?

373
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,563
‐ Same for you, all right?

374
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,765
‐ All right.

375
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,516
‐ [Mike] We might
be related too.

376
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,816
(light orchestral music)
(scooter hums)

377
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,945
‐ You know what?

378
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,078
I think Mr. Mike was
out looking for us.

379
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,005
‐ I’m kind of upset though.

380
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,463
‐ Why do you say that?

381
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,805
‐ ’Cause he acted all cool.

382
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,420
‐ (laughs) I take
back anything I said

383
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,416
about him seeming a bit scary.

384
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,138
He’s not good at communicating
but he is very kind.

385
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,471
I found that out tonight.

386
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,310
‐ You did?

387
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,141
‐ Yes.

388
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,215
I saw it in his room.

389
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,274
‐ Mike!

390
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,444
I’m coming in!

391
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,317
‐ Why don’t you try
knocking instead?

392
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,152
(Miina chuckles)

393
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,316
What is it?

394
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,277
‐ I’ve come here to
pick up the lunch box.

395
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,536
(Miina giggles)

396
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,449
Oh, there it is.

397
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,251
Looks like you ate all of it!

398
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,805
(Mike groans)
(Miina laughs)

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,630
Hey, I thought
you hated pumpkin.

400
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,798
‐ Yeah, I do.

401
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:42,634
‐ Was it tasty?

402
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,138
‐ It was terrible.

403
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,800
‐ Whoa, you’re horrid!

404
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,519
(laughs) Just kidding.

405
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,312
(Mike grunting)

406
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,979
‐ [Mike] I told you
it was horrible.

407
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:55,904
‐ [Miina] But you ate it.

408
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,861
You ate all of it.

409
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,152
There’s not a crumb left.

410
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,114
‐ [Mike] I didn’t
wanna waste it.

411
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,403
‐ [Miina] Wasn’t it tasty?

412
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,646
‐ [Mike] I’m telling
you it was horrible.

413
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,489
‐ [Miina] You’re
not being honest.

414
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,993
‐ [Mike] I am too.

415
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,324
‐ [Miina] Oh, no, you’re
going to eat me, aren’t you?

416
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,277
‐ [Mike] What are
you talking about?

417
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,987
‐ [Miina] Danger, danger!

418
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,488
‐ [Mike] Shut up!

419
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,253
(singing in a foreign language)

420
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,911
‐ [Karen and Miina] Next
episode, more twins!

421
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,629
‐ [Miina] I, Miina Miyafuji,
had a dream about Mike.

422
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,304
I was worried about Mike’s
senpai who came to visit.

423
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,133
It’s that because
I’m his relative?

424
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,588
Or because I’m a stranger?

425
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,889
‐ [Karen] I, Karen Onodera,
had a really good reason

426
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,722
for coming all the way
here to Mr. Mike’s house.

427
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,388
I had a vague idea about it

428
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,187
but I was way too
afraid to confirm it.

429
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,770
And that reason is‐‐

430
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,605
‐ [Miina] Please
Twins! episode three,

431
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,280
We Might Be Strangers.

432
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Be sure to watch it!

433
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,615
Next episode, more twins!
