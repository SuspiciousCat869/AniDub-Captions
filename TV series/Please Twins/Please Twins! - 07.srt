‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Love Alliance.

4
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,283
Rule number one, until
we find out for sure

5
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,538
who is the relative,

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,579
neither one of us
may ask Mr. Mike out.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,205
[Miina Voiceover] Number
two, if one us learns

8
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,542
we’re relatives with
Mike, we inform the other

9
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,456
right away.

10
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,715
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Number three.

11
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,506
The relative will
support the other’s

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,759
romantic relationship
with Mr. Mike.

13
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,548
‐ [Miina] Number four,

14
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,388
with the help and
permission of each other,

15
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,263
we will try to keep
any other girls

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,350
who come onto Mike
away from him.

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,604
(upbeat pop music)

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,188
‐ [Both Voiceover] Number five,

19

21
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:13,534
(upbeat pop music)
(singing in Japanese)

22
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,458
‐ The other boys
are no good, no.

23
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,883
I have to find a great
romance for myself this year.

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,424
Its going to be with a
beautiful elegant boy

25
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,667
from the city.

26
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,508
(laughs)

27
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,525
Wow!

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,429
Look at that guy, he’s hot.

29
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,518
I feel like he’s instantly
stolen my heart away.

30
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,524
Is it cause its
summer or true love?

31
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,607
Its because he’s too wonderful.

32
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,614
‐ [Karen] Hi, Mr. Mike.

33
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,705
Sorry to make you wait.

34
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,869
(wails)

35
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,247
is it okay if I buy that?

36
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,964
‐ Farewell.
‐ I think so.

37
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,672
‐ Farewell my love!

38
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,797
‐ Oh wow, look at the sea.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,050
Oh and smell that air.

40
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,014
Amazing.

41
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,928
‐ It’s a wonderful place.

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,643
Thank you for winning us
in the drawing, Mr. Mike.

43
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,684
‐ Do you really think
this was alright?

44
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,637
If we sold the tickets we’d won,

45
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,228
wouldn’t we have been a
little bit better off?

46
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,982
‐ Gees, we’re
already here, Mike,

47
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,654
why don’t you just relax?

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,153
‐ But that’s not.

49
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,074
‐ Mr. Mike.

50
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,493
The money you’ve saved goes away

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,650
when you finally use it

52
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,738
but memories will last forever.

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,281
‐ That’s what this is about?

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,580
‐ [Both] That’s right.

55
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,504
‐ [Miina] Alright, let’s play.

56
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,581
(sultry rock music)

57
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,892
‐ [Kousei] Summer in
Okinawa is so hot.

58
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,970
‐ [Girl] Yes, it is.

59
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,894
‐ Amazing.

60
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,055
Okinawa’s great.

61
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,734
‐ Ah yes, you’re right.

62
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,024
‐ Mike, what a surprise.

63
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,148
‐ What a coincidence
running into you here.

64
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,034
‐ Hey, what are the
two of you doing here?

65
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,862
‐ Well there’s no
coincidence here.

66
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,567
I think Mike and I are tied by

67
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,656
a red thread of fate.

68
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,487
‐ Don’t be disgusting!

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,750
You little creep.

70
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,672
‐ So why are you here, Sinpai?

71
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,041
‐ There was extra money in
the student council budget

72
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,668
so we thought we’d use it by
organizing a training camp.

73
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,875
‐ Training camp?

74
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,256
‐ There’s no need for
the student council

75
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,511
to do that.

76
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,554
Wait, why would you set
up a training camp here?

77
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,219
‐ Why not, isn’t it nice?

78
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,930
‐ I can’t really counter that.

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,359
‐ You know, Mike.

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,530
The scenery is
beautiful over there.

81
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,819
‐ Hey, let go of me.

82
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,702
‐ Come on, let’s go right now.

83
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,201
‐ Hey, wait a minute.

84
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,411
Where do you think you’re
going with Kamishiro?

85
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,744
‐ Into a sensual world.

86
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,828
‐ You’re not making sense.

87
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,371
Give Kamishiro back right now!

88
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,420
‐ Mr. Mike is not an object.

89
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,882
‐ That’s right, he’s not.

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,050
(groans)

91
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,343
(sighs)

92
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,094
‐ [Sinpai] Get away
from Kamishiro.

93
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,297
‐ [Miina and Karen]
No, you get away.

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,940
(laughs)

95
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,731
‐ Its so good to be young.

96
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,329
‐ Man that was so horrible

97
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,786
but you think it was okay to
leave Sinpai and Shimazaki

98
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,545
behind on the beach?

99
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,295
‐ We have to finish
checking in, right?

100
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,379
‐ Well yes, that’s true

101
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,053
but I still don’t...

102
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,631
‐ Alliance rule number four.

103
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,928
‐ Huh?

104
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,891
‐ They can stay on
the beach forever.

105
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,759
(groaning)

106
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,057
‐ Oh Mike, oh Mike I...

107
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,941
(groaning)

108
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:16,939
(laughing)

109
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,150
‐ You’re creepy, you know that?

110
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,111
‐ Sorry to keep
you guys waiting.

111
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,771
‐ Were you able to check us in?

112
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,150
‐ [Karen] Yes, but there
was one little tiny hangup.

113
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,953
‐ What is it?

114
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,331
Its just one room?

115
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,955
‐ I’m so sorry.

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,330
When I made the reservation,

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,588
I told the man that
we were a family.

118
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,249
‐ But Karen.

119
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,173
We’re all in one room.

120
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,260
‐ Hi, Mike.

121
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,263
‐ Mr. Mike.

122
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,312
‐ [Both] Ta da.

123
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,352
‐ [Mike Voiceover] They
might be relatives.

124
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,675
They might be relatives.

125
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,190
They might be relatives.

126
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,771
They might be relatives.

127
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,694
‐ Wow, what a great view.

128
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,985
‐ Yes, its just beautiful.

129
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,529
It’s really very beautiful.

130
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,991
‐ But the really beautiful
one around here is you, Karen.

131
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,116
I really mean it.

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,740
‐ Not true, Mr. Mike.

133
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,794
‐ Karen.

134
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,003
Just don’t forget
about rule number on.

135
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,626
‐ Of course, I’d never forget.

136
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,297
‐ Don’t you guys ever rest?

137
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,717
‐ This is a nice trip we’re on.

138
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,677
Resting would be a waste.

139
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,927
‐ It’s alright.

140
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,227
You can watch pretty
girls in swimsuits

141
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,691
if you want.

142
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,189
‐ You sound like
some middle aged man.

143
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,692
‐ Kamishiro, is
that you over there?

144
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,529
‐ Ms. Kasami.

145
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,863
‐ What a surprise.

146
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,161
I’m here with my
husband on a trip

147
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,584
to celebrate our second
wedding anniversary.

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,500
‐ Oh.

149
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,133
‐ Actually, we stayed in this
hotel for our honeymoon trip.

150
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,050
I have so many wonderful
memories about this beach

151
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,972
and today I was reminded
of so many new things.

152
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,890
And my heart races when
I think about tonight.

153
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,972
I can’t believe what
I’m saying to a student.

154
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,716
‐ I see.

155
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,388
‐ Is something wrong?

156
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,230
‐ No.

157
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,233
‐ Nothing.

158
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,984
‐ Hey hey everyone.

159
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,476
‐ Oh, hi Ms. Kasami.

160
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,698
‐ It seems the destined
reunion happens here,

161
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,239
my friends.

162
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,372
‐ What a coincidence.

163
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,079
‐ You’re so right.
‐ I was really fooled.

164
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,662
‐ What are you talking about?

165
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,327
(shouts)

166
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,997
‐ Haruko, have you
heard the legends?

167
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,296
This place fulfills
romantic dreams.

168
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,421
My best friend, Yoski,
discovered his maturity

169
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,048
after only one
night in this hotel.

170
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,974
‐ = okay, if you say so.

171
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,006
‐ Haruko, cause we’re
all alone on this trip

172
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,018
something might actually happen.

173
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,485
‐ It’s Miina and Karen.

174
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,613
Hi guys.

175
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,437
‐ I’ve got no luck.

176
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,947
Kamishiro and Shimazaki, right?

177
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,124
Nice to meet you.

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,580
I’m Matagu Shido, 12th grade.

179
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,161
‐ Yeah, how do you do.

180
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,077
‐ Nice to meet you.

181
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,004
‐ You really don’t need
to be so nervous, fellas.

182
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,045
Let’s just be frank
about a few things.

183
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,957
‐ You’re pretending
to be a good Sinpai.

184
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,375
‐ It’s fine, I really
am a Sinpai to them

185
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,304
and I’m a good person.

186
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,134
That’s right, I have one thing

187
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,140
that I want to tell
the both of you.

188
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,300
‐ What is it?

189
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,598
‐ No matter how cute Haruko is

190
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,272
keep her hands off
her, understand?

191
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,311
‐ Actually.

192
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,234
‐ That’s no problem.

193
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,149
(laughing)

194
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,316
‐ Seeing Miina and Karen here
in Okinawa is so exciting.

195
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,655
This is so fun, you know?

196
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,531
‐ Yeah, it is.

197
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,948
‐ I agree.

198
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,334
‐ Haruko is so cute that
whenever I look at her.

199
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,623
‐ I’m so happy.

200
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,916
I was here all alone
with my big brother

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,210
so I was bored.

202
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,634
I was really really bored!

203
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,342
(crying)

204
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,174
‐ Death.

205
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,629
‐ What a pitiful guy.

206
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,547
‐ Yeah really.

207
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,928
(laughing)

208
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,148
‐ oh, Ms. Miina, I
think we’re cursed.

209
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,859
‐ Yeah, you’re right.

210
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,025
(clock ticking)

211
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,835
(shouts)

212
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,746
‐ Gees!

213
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,294
‐ That was the pits.

214
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,958
Why are there so many
people we know here?

215
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,008
‐ You could say it was fate.

216
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,889
‐ Right now I thought that
Mike and I would be...

217
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,564
‐ Miina.

218
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,642
‐ Yes, Mike?

219
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,359
‐ Ms. Miina, that
fantasy of yours

220
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,399
is getting awfully close
to breaching love alliance

221
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,614
rule number one.

222
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,242
‐ I’m, I’m just kidding really.

223
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,282
The three of us should
just enjoy the rest

224
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,025
of this trip, okay?

225
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,365
‐ Sure.

226
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,200
(doorbell rings)

227
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,247
‐ [Sinpai] So the
barbecue starts at seven.

228
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,713
See you at the beach.

229
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,791
‐ [Mike] Okay, you got it.

230
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,038
‐ I look forward to it.

231
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,426
‐ Why did you make
such a promise?

232
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,760
‐ You idiot, put
some clothes on.

233
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,305
‐ This is a trip
for the three of us.

234
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,221
‐ Its alright, the
more the merrier.

235
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,188
We’re meeting down on
the beach at seven.

236
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,230
‐ Yeah well, I’m not going.

237
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,443
‐ But Ms. Miina.

238
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,114
‐ [Miina] I said I’m
not going and I’m not.

239
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,823
‐ Suit yourself.

240
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,613
I’m gonna go walk for awhile.

241
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,656
I’ll join up with the
rest of them on my own.

242
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,571
‐ Mr. Mike.
‐ Mike.

243
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,954
‐ Oh what’s up with him?

244
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,548
‐ Well to all your hot
rendezvous on the beach.

245
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,795
‐ Why are you running
the show, Shido?

246
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,467
‐ What, was I not supposed to?

247
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,716
(mumbles)

248
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,640
That is so cruel, you guys.

249
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,849
You know that’s how you
always leave me out...

250
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,320
(cheers)

251
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,779
‐ A teacher isn’t really
wanted in a chat among students

252
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,691
is she?

253
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,991
‐ I tried.

254
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,699
I really tried to
get her to come.

255
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,459
‐ Leave her alone.

256
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,289
‐ But I.

257
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,213
‐ It’s alright.

258
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,586
Oh by the way.

259
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,749
‐ Yes?

260
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,507
‐ Don’t drink this.

261
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,799
‐ What, why?

262
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,722
‐ Because.

263
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,465
(laughing)

264
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,553
‐ I’m kind of feeling good.

265
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,559
‐ Yeah me, too, Haruko.

266
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,177
‐ This isn’t what I
think it is, is it?

267
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,348
‐ No, don’t worry.

268
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,146
Its just some super
juice that I got

269
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,859
from my best friends boyfriend.

270
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,021
‐ I see.

271
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,701
‐ You know, Shimazaki,
are you really gay

272
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,199
like everyone thinks you are?

273
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,281
‐ Its much more mysterious of me

274
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,908
if I keep that a secret.

275
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,714
‐ Kousei, that’s a lie.

276
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,538
A lie.

277
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,708
‐ Cha ching.

278
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,666
(grunts)

279
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,256
‐ What’s with him?

280
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,683
He’s such an idiot.

281
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,602
Why?

282
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,223
Why?

283
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,018
I wanted the three
of us together.

284
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,647
‐ Oh Kamishiro, come over here.

285
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,571
‐ Oh Mike, come over here.

286
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,991
(shouts)

287
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,872
‐ This is no time
for me to sulk.

288
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,582
(groaning)

289
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,249
(laughing)

290
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,264
‐ You guys are wonderful.

291
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,432
‐ Mr. Mike.

292
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,929
‐ Hey.

293
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,559
‐ Aren’t you going to go
back to where the others are?

294
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,725
‐ I’m not used to that
kind of atmosphere.

295
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,904
Don’t like it much.

296
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,692
‐ Then why did you
suggest that we all go?

297
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,703
‐ I didn’t want the three of
us to be alone in one room.

298
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,372
‐ Why, Mr. Mike?

299
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,543
Do you dislike us that much?

300
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,044
‐ [Mike] Its nothing like that.

301
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,956
‐ [Karen] I don’t understand.

302
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,634
‐ [Mike] Well that’s alright.

303
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,884
‐ But its not.

304
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,298
Its not alright.

305
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,552
Please tell me.

306
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,267
Please tell me,
in your own words.

307
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,651
Mr. Mike.

308
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,937
‐ You guys get on my
mind when I’m with you.

309
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,146
I’m a guy and I’m young

310
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,276
so I can’t control
myself that much.

311
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,326
‐ Does that mean that
we really on your mind

312
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,252
all the time?

313
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,206
‐ No, that’s not it.

314
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,836
What I said just now is not‐‐

315
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,882
‐ Mr. Mike.

316
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,678
Mr. Mike, I won’t forget

317
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,345
the words you just
said, Mr. Mike.

318
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,351
I’ll keep them in
my heart forever

319
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,768
because I...

320
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,188
Because I...

321
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,658
‐ Morena Sinpai, do
you know where Mike is?

322
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,910
(soft romantic music)

323
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,122
‐ [Mike Voiceover] She
may be my relative.

324
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,038
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
But then again

325
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,127
he might not be.

326
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,893
‐ Karen remember
rule number one!

327
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,763
‐ Ms. Miina.

328
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,687
‐ What were you doing?

329
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,230
‐ We weren’t doing anything.

330
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,653
‐ Yes, that’s right.

‐ Ms. Miina.

334
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,739
‐ Why’d you trip?

335
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,945
You’re so stupid.

336
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,949
‐ Are you hurt, Ms. Miina?

337
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,328

it’s not too bad.

340
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,262

to the hotel ahead of us

341
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,259
and call for a doctor.

342

‐ You take care now.

347
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,073
‐ Thank you very much, doctor.

348
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,407
‐ It’s a good thing that
it wasn’t anything serious.

349
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,161
You just stay put and
get some rest, okay?

350
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,036
Geez, I shouldn’t of
carried you in such a hurry.

351
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,622
‐ You really don’t have
to put it that way.

352
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,748
‐ You were heavy too.

353
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,880
‐ [Miina] Oh Mike,
you’re an idiot.

354
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,130
Today was the worst day.

355
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,505
‐ Oh come on, please
cheer up, Ms. Miina.

356
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,765
If you do, I’ve got
some great news.

357
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,295
‐ [Miina] Great news?

358
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,388
‐ Yes, Mr. Mike told me that
the reason he left the room

359
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,485
was because he’d have us
on his mind if we were here

360
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,062
all alone together.

361
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,645
‐ Idiot, what are
you talking about?

362
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,192
‐ That is what you meant,
Mr. Mike, wasn’t it?

363
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,316
That you couldn’t
control yourself.

364
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,451
‐ What, what I
meant by that was...

365
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,525
That stuff that I drank earlier

366
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,000

‐ Miscalculation.

373
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,942
I wonder what I should
do with all of this?
