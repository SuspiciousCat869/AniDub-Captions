1
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,681
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,738
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
I, Karen Onodera,

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,664
although it was
totally by accident,

4
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,752
experienced a kiss with
Mr. Mike Kamishiro,

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,830
who just may be my relative.

6
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,535
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
I, Miina Miyafuji,

7
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,375
couldn’t hold my feelings back

8
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,885
and forcefully kissed
Mike Kamishiro,

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,090
who just may be my relative.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,400
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
Mike Kamishiro.

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,520
I...

12
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,573
(gasping)

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,917
‐ Good morning.

14
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,671
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Just
because of one accident,

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,928
our relationship
has changed so much

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,390
in such a very short
amount of time.

17
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,353
‐ [Miina Voiceover] It’s true.

18
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,905
At least two of us
here may be relatives.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,936
But right now, we’re as close

20
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,435
to being strangers
as you can get.

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,988
(upbeat music)

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,111
‐ [Mike Voiceover] Can I,
can we keep thinking that

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,570
the people living right in front

24
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,908
of us are really our relatives?

25
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,541
‐ [All Voiceover]
Well, perhaps not.

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,340
(upbeat techno music)

27
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,427
(singing in foreign language)

28
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,548
‐ Ando.
‐ Here.

29
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,049
‐ Uwahara.
‐ Here.

30
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,933
‐ Eto.
‐ Here.

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,880
‐ Kamishiro.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,720
Kamishiro.

33
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,017
Does anyone know where he is?

34
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,179
‐ Yes, ma’am.

35
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,767
I thought Kamishiro
was suspended.

36
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,694
‐ Yes.

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,980
That’s right.

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,233
I guess I forgot.

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,743
‐ [Kousei Voiceover] Oh,
Mike, you’re probably

40
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,861
with those girls
right now, aren’t you?

41
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,661
Oh, I’m so lonely,
Mike, so lonely.

42
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,415
(pleasant music)

43
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,246
‐ [Mike Voiceover] What I ate
for breakfast, how it tasted,

44
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,340
what conversation we had,
I don’t remember at all.

45
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,761
That’s how disturbed I was.

46
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,476
And so, once again, I
need to remind myself

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,060
why I came to this town.

48
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,732
Is it because I want to see
my mother who abandoned me?

49
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,613
No.

50
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,448
I had a faint expectation
that I might be able

51
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,245
to see my relative that
I’m in the photograph with.

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,499
See if I were able to meet her,

53
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,585
I would never make
her face misfortune.

54
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,128
That’s right.

55
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,214
That’s what I thought
when I came here.

56
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,628
Miina Miyafuji.

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,970
Karen Onodera.

58
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,675
‐ Nice to meet you.

59
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,927
I know you’ve never heard of me,

60
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,306
but I’m actually
a blood relative.

61
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,233
They really are.

62
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,151
We’ve got the same eye color.

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,480
‐ Apparently, this
photograph was handed over

64
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,187
to the orphanage on the
day my mother gave me away.

65
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,199
At least, that’s what I was
told by my foster parents.

66
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,492
(sobbing)

67
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,158
‐ [Mike Voiceover] The
two of them are relatives.

68
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,003
They may be my relatives.

69
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,136
And so I...

70
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,313
I...

71
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,194
‐ Oh, what do you think we
should do now, Ms. Miina?

72
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,784
I’m so nervous, I don’t think
that I can look Mr. Mike

73
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,531
in the eye anymore, let alone
talk to him about anything.

74
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,196
‐ Yeah, I know the feeling.

75
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,543
But I think we should try
not to dwell on it too much.

76
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,451
You know, that kiss was more

77
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,408
like an accident
than anything else.

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,380
‐ Yes, but it was my
very first time, ever.

79
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,385
To think that my first kiss
would be with Mr. Mike.

80
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,389
And there’s a chance that
Mr. Mike may be my relative.

81
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,557
Ms. Miina?

82
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,720
‐ What?

83
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,558
‐ [Karen] Is
something the matter?

84
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,563
‐ Mm‐mm.

85
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,186
Hey, you know, I think that it

86
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,521
would be all right if
Mike was your relative.

87
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,397
See, it’d be a kiss of
affection for your family.

88
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,157
‐ That’s very true.

89
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,369
It’s all right for relatives
to hug and kiss each other.

90
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:56,328
But if we’re really strangers,
if we’re really strangers,

91
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,752
then what I did with
Mr. Mike was, was...

92
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,256
‐ You know what, you’re cute.

93
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,103
You heard me, you’re cute.

94
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,050
‐ Ms. Miina?

95
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,466
‐ So do you love Mike, huh?

96
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,731
‐ I don’t know,
it’s all confusing.

97
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,226
But Mr. Mike’s always,
always there on my mind.

98
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,857
If you’re saying that what
I’m feeling now is love,

99
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,035
then I guess I just might.

100
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,033
‐ Is that as a stranger
or as a relative?

101
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,374
‐ I just don’t know that either.

102
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,753
But I want to be with Mr. Mike.

103
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,753
I want to be with Mr. Mike
together in this house

104
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,464
that my mother used to live in.

105
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,206
‐ [Miina] Yeah, I
know what you mean.

106
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,798
I want to be here too.

107
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,969
But, Karen, we get to stay here

108
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,556
because we may be
relatives, right?

109
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,480
And that makes it okay.

110
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,388
‐ Yes.

111
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,732
‐ If strangers is what we are,

112
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,983
then we would be allowed
to fall in love with Mike.

113
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,316
But we’d no longer have a reason

114
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,283
to keep living in this house.

115
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,162
(somber music)

116
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,201
‐ [Karen] You’re right.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,786
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
If we are strangers,

118
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,372
we can’t continue
living in that house.

119
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,922
Even if we were invited to stay,

120
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,174
I’m sure that it would
get more and more awkward.

121
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,337
It’d become impossible
to live there.

122
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,102
I know that that’s what
will eventually happen,

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,269
but I’m in no position to be
saying any of this to Karen.

124
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,231
‐ [Mike Voiceover] Is there
really a big need in life

125
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,983
to forcefully clarify
our relationships?

126
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,031
Who is the relative?

127
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,647
And who is the stranger?

128
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,955
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I can’t
seem to control my own feelings,

129
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,703
just like Karen can’t
control hers right now.

130
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,209
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
What am I gonna do

131
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,330
if I find out that
she’s a stranger?

132
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,545
‐ [Miina Voiceover] If Mike
is really my relative...

133
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,876
‐ [Mike Voiceover] I...

134
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,719
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I...

135
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,719
‐ Miina.

136
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,226
‐ Oh, Mike.

137
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,516
‐ [Miina Voiceover] Feelings.

138
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,896
‐ Miina.

139
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:26,864
Last night.

140
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,783
I...

141
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,617
‐ [Miina Voiceover] My
feelings, my feelings.

142
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,410
‐ So, um...

143
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,416
‐ I’m sorry.

144
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,805
About yesterday, surprised?

145
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,586
See, I should explain.

146
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,349
This was all just a big test.

147
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,599
‐ A big test?

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,060
‐ Well, you know the
rumors that are going

149
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,271
around school about you

150
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,311
and Shimazaki having
kind of a thing?

151
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,106
I was running a test on
you to check out the rumor.

152
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:07,942
‐ Huh?

153
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,436
‐ But you passed.

154
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,107
If it was on your mind this
much, you must be normal.

155
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,147
(giggling)

156
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,529
Wow, what a relief.

157
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,784
I’m so glad that someone who

158
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,025
might be my relative
isn’t really gay.

159
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,292
‐ Hey, wait a second.

160
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,910
Does that mean you
thought I was‐‐

161
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,746
(giggling)

162
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,961
‐ It was a perk, right?

163
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,381
(giggling)

164
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,212
(chuckling)

165
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,506
‐ Oh, I see.

166
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,922
So that’s what it was.

167
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,683
Oh well, I guess.

168
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,643
I’m irritated, but
I’m also relieved.

169
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,604
You’re sure that’s
really what it was?

170
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,944
‐ Yep, that’s what it was.

171
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:45,979
‐ [Mike] Just don’t
do things that

172
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,062
can be taken the
wrong way, okay?

173
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,478
‐ Sorry.

174
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,896
‐ [Mike] And if you’re
gonna have to apologize

175
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,994
for it later, then don’t do it.

176
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,151
‐ [Miina] Hm.

177
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,198
‐ [Mike] I’m gonna
go home and work now,

178
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,163
don’t you be slacking off.

179
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,792
Go do what you need to do.

180
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,749
‐ [Miina] Mm‐hmm.

181
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,749
‐ Oh, by the way,
Miina, I’m straight.

182
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,082
You just remember that.

183
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:07,917
(giggling)

184
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,131
‐ Understood.

185
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,670
‐ And try not to doubt me.

186
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,506
(giggling)

187
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,598
‐ I’ll be all right.

188
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,849
I’m fine.

189
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,392
I’m used to it.

190
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,845
It’s like my whole life.

191
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,102
I’m used to pulling
back like this.

192
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,558
I do it all the time.

193
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,025
So I’m fine, I’m fine.

194
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,862
I mean, I think I’m fine.

195
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,792
No.

196
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,499
I can’t do this.

197
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,789
I can’t do it.

198
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,582
I just can’t.

199
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:01,972
‐ Mr. Marie.

200
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,890
Oh, Mr. Marie, I
have Prech for you.

201
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,899
(babbling)

202
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,279
You’re a selfish little one.

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,241
(Marie squeaking)

204
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,415
(Marie babbling)

205
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,751
Mr. Mike.

206
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,674
‐ Karen.

207
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,757
‐ Mr. Mike, I wanna
say, I mean I...

208
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,507
‐ Karen, you know, I...

209
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,434
I’m sorry, Karen.

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,765
I’m apologizing for whatever
happened in the locker room.

211
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,769
Even if it was just an accident,

212
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,106
I thought it may
have meant something

213
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,691
much more important to you.

214
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,398
And so I wanted
to say something.

215
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,201
I’m sorry.

216
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,363
‐ Mr. Mike?

217
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,777
‐ It may be impossible for you,

218
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,289
but I hope you can
forget about this.

219
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,662
I’ll try to do the same.

220
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,998
Since we might be relatives,

221
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,295
I don’t want us to be thinking
of each other in that way,

222
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,629
if you know what I mean.

223
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,757
We’re still students, but
we have to live on our own,

224
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,262
and we don’t have the
luxury of diverting

225
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,433
our attention to other things.

226
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,012
Even if our situation
were different,

227
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,270
we’d still have to live
each and every day.

228
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,693
So then, I think...

229
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,653
‐ Mr. Mike.

230
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,649
Oh, Mr. Mike, about
yesterday, it was an accident.

231
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,276
So please don’t worry about it.

232
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,822
I won’t worry about it either.

233
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,198
It’s already forgotten.

234
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,155
Because there’s a very
good chance that you

235
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,368
and I may be relatives.

236
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,377
‐ Karen.

237
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,343
Please don’t.

238
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,166
‐ I’m sorry.

239
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:06,049
(somber music)
(sobbing)

240
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,064
‐ [Mike Voiceover] Karen.

241
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,857
‐ [Miina Voiceover] Karen.

242
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,569
(sobbing)

243
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,244
We may be relatives.

244
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,504
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
We may be strangers.

245
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,624
‐ [Mike Voiceover] Are we just
gonna keep on tossing around

246
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,917
in some strange
abstract relationship?

247
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,052
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I wanna
straighten out my relationship

248
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,343
with Mr. Mike.

249
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,967
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
But when that happens,

250
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,223
one of us will no longer be
able to stay in this house.

251
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,061
If we’re not relatives,

252
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,103
we will be leaving
this house someday.

253
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,772
‐ [Mike Voiceover] I don’t want
them to face that situation.

254
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,702
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
If I am a relative,

255
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,029
I can stay in this house.

256
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,825
I can be next to Mr. Mike.

257
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,163
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
If I am a stranger,

258
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,496
I can’t stay in this house.

259
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,956
‐ [Karen Voiceover] But...

260
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,755
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
I can fall in love.

261
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,969
‐ [Karen Voiceover] If I was
a relative of Mr. Mike’s,

262
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,596
if I was a stranger
to Mr. Mike...

263
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,227
(tapping)
(gasping)

264
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,101
‐ [Miina] Karen, can I come in?

265
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,611
‐ Sure.

266
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,822
Could you just wait
a moment, please?

267
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,031
Um, okay, come in.

268
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,411
‐ Thanks a lot.

269
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,962
This is a real nice bath.

270
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,666
‐ Uh‐huh.

271
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,222
‐ You know, we always
take a bath together,

272
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,800
so why are you distant
and starting without me?

273
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,140
‐ I’m sorry.

274
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,104
‐ I’m not angry or
anything like that.

275
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,139
‐ I see.

276
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,984
‐ [Both] Um, oh.

277
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:23,937
‐ What is it?

278
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,955
‐ No, go ahead, Ms. Miina.

279
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,781
‐ Well, Karen, I...

280
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,198
You see, I, I kinda,
I kissed Mike.

281
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,043
That’s right, I
really kissed Mike.

282
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,838
‐ But, Ms. Miina...

283
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
‐ I’m in love with Mike.

284
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,756
But he might be my relative.

285
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,643
Great, huh?

286
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,719
I’m so stupid.

287
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,060
I know I shouldn’t,
but I can’t help it.

288
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,602
I really don’t remember
how it started.

289
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,859
Maybe it was when he
talked me into staying.

290
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,726
Or when he was in my dreams.

291
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,316
I don’t know.

292
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,903
I don’t know but I...

293
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,204
Oh, Mike.

294
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,832
To me, Mike is everything.

295
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,915
I also knew how you felt,

296
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,496
Karen, but I just
couldn’t help myself.

297
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,460
I, I...

298
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,287
‐ Oh, please don’t cry.

299
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,246
‐ [Miina] I’m sorry, Karen.

300
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,628
‐ Oh no, please don’t apologize.

301
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,213
It’s the same for me.

302
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,220
I feel exactly the same way.

303
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,392
I’m in love with Mr. Mike too.

304
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,889
‐ Yeah, that’s right.

305
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,931
I’m in love with him.

306
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,926
‐ And I’m in love with Mr. Mike.

307
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,267
‐ I love Mike.

308
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,274
‐ I love Mr. Mike.

309
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,074
‐ Yeah, but we can
never tell him.

310
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,568
‐ Right.

311
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,070
And I don’t ever want to know
which of us is his relative.

312
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,495
‐ If we knew, then we’d have

313
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,782
to be split apart
from each other.

314
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,077
‐ But I don’t wanna
be separated from you.

315
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,579
‐ I want to be with Mike
and I want to be with Karen.

316
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,375
‐ I want to be with
you too, Ms. Miina.

317
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,627
(sobbing)

318
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,941
These are...

319
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,444
‐ [Miina] Roasts?

320
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,276
‐ Mr. Mike.

321
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,071
‐ Maybe he’s just
being nice to us.

322
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:35,986
‐ I’m sure he is.

323
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,238
‐ Yeah, but you don’t think
it’s gotten kinda cold?

324
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,657
‐ He really is awkward.

325
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,117
‐ [Miina] Yeah, but
that awkward part

326
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,246
is another part of him
that I really like.

327
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,505
‐ [Karen] Yeah, me too.

328
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,129
(pleasant music)

329
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,551
(birds chirping)

330
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,409
(gasping)

331
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,699
‐ Morning, ladies.

332
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,659
‐ Hi, Mike, good morning.

333
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,580
‐ Good morning, Mr. Mike.

334
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,459
‐ Yeah.

335
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,665
(pleasant music)

336
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,725
‐ [Karen] So, a
love alliance, huh?

337
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,891
‐ Yep, a love alliance
between the two of us,

338
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,340
the people who love Mike.

339
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,218
‐ Okay.

340
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,597
We should form an alliance.

341
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,726
But, once it’s formed, what
are we actually gonna do?

342
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,306
‐ Hm, well, let me think.

343
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,361
‐ [Karen] Love Alliance,
rule number one,

344
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,155
until we find out for
sure who is the relative,

345
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,528
neither one of us
may ask Mr. Mike out.

346
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,946
‐ [Miina] Number two.

347
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,704
If one of us learns we’re
relatives with Mike,

348
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,158
we inform the other right away.

349
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,457
‐ [Karen] Number three.

350
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,920
The relative will support

351
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,671
the other’s romantic
relationship with Mr. Mike.

352
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,925
‐ [Miina] Number four.

353
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,216
We get rid of any other
girls who come onto Mike,

354
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,048
even if we have to
use brute force.

355
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,716
‐ [Karen] Isn’t that just
a little too extreme?

356
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,015
‐ [Miina] You think so, huh?

357
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,479
Okay, so that’s
Miina Miyafuji and...

358
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,441
‐ [Karen] Karen Onodera’s...

359
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,483
‐ [Both] Love Alliance.

360
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,361
(chattering)

361
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,662
‐ Mike, how’s it going?

362
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,077
‐ Hi, Kamishiro.

363
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,076
‐ I’m sure you’ve been
working real hard, Mike.

364
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,539
‐ Ah, shut up.

365
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,457
‐ It was getting a
little bit lonely

366
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,458
when you weren’t
around here, Kamishiro.

367
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,927
‐ Oh, is that so?

368
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,471
‐ Hey come on, Mike.

369
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,815
‐ If we don’t hurry up,
we’re gonna be really late.

370
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,221
‐ Hey, what’s going on?

371
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,178
What are you guys doing?

372
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,887
‐ We’re doing rule number four.

373
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,598
‐ Yeah, that’s
right, number four.

374
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,940
‐ I’m really getting confused.

375
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,194
What’s this all about?

376
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,364
‐ [Miina] Never
mind, let’s hurry.

377
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,942
‐ [Karen] Yeah, let’s hurry up.

378
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,988
‐ [Mike] Yeah, I got it.

379
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,741
Hey, don’t pull so hard.

380
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,861
What’s gotten into you two?

381
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,818
(chuckling)

382
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,529
‐ I think I’ve just been dumped.

383
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,794
‐ Those two girls.

384
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:28,622
‐ Huh?

385
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,456
(pleasant music)

386
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,421
‐ [Tsubaki] They’re in love.

387
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
(gasping)

388
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,254
‐ [Student] They were
walking arm‐in‐arm.

389
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,974
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
I’m in love with Mike.

390
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,895
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I’m
in love with Mr. Mike.

391
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,694
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I can’t
tell him my feelings for now.

392
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,063
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
But I don’t mind

393
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,897
if that’s how it has to be.

394
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,863
‐ [Miina Voiceover] As long
as I have these feelings.

395
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,698
‐ [Karen And Miina
Voiceover] These feelings.

396
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,334
(rhythmic music)

397
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,083
(singing in foreign language)

398
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,249
Next episode, more twins.

399
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,245
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
We won a drawing

400
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,916
and got to go to
a southern island.

401
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,633
That’s when I went to the
beach all alone with Mike.

402
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,086
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Ms.
Miina, please don’t forget

403
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,625
about the romantic
alliance rule number one.

404
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
Oh I know, but‐‐

405
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,098
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Never mind that,

406
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,559
Ms. Miina, we have
a huge problem.

407
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,349
Ms. Senpai and Ms. President
are here on the island.

408
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,733
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
What, but why?

409
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,059
I don’t know.

410
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,274
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
I don’t know,

411
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,935
but this could turn
into one big mess.

412
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:00,862
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
Please Twins,

413
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,230
episode seven, Making Memories.

414
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,437
Be sure to watch it.

415
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,526
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Next
episode, more twins.
