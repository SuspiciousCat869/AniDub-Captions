1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,223
(gentle music)
‐ The one thing I had with me

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,850
when I was abandoned
by my mother and
entered the orphanage,

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,687
was this photograph
showing me when I was a kid

4
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,983
and this girl who I
thought was my relative.

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,026
Even though I hold this
photo dear to my heart,

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,655
I’m not overly
obsessed about the past

7
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,871
and I’m really not emotional
enough to cherish something

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,412
that I have absolutely
no memory of.

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,672
But I had the fait hope
that I might be able

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,790
to meet the girl that I
took this picture with,

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,168
that I might be able to
meet a real relative.

12
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,377
That’s why when I
got into high school,

13
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,889
I decided to live alone
here near this lake

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,562
where the photograph was taken.

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,313
It didn’t take long to find
that house in the picture.

16
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:07,027
The place was all torn up
and it was very cheap to rent

17
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,489
so I didn’t hesitate
signing a rental agreement.

18
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,412
This is where I will be living,

19
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,778
in this beautiful
place that is so calm,

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,409
it gives me this
wonderful illusion

21
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,914
that time is just
standing still.

22
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,755
But then, as both my
work and school life

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,585
were starting to get settled,

24
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,999
something drastic happened,

25
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,015
I met them, the girls
who may be my relatives,

26
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,103
Miina Miyafuji,

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,350
Karen Onodera.

28
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,445
These two girls had the exact
same photograph as I did

29
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,654
and both of them had the
same color eyes as me.

30
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,897
I instinctively felt

31
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,785
that one of these two
girls was my relative,

32
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,994
a real relative bound by blood.

33
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,123
But there were three of us.

34
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,953
There were only two
people in the photograph,

35
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,368
but there were three of us here.

36
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,827
One, a stranger.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,999
One, a blood relative.

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,089
In that very strange
relationship,

39
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,013
all three of us started to
live under the same roof.

40
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,854
Summer had begun.

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,391
From that day, when I met Miina,

42
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,518
from that moment
when I met Karen,

43
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,483
our summer had begun.

44
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,819
Our strange, uncertain summer,

45
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,532
swaying between a
relative and a stranger.

46
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,205
(upbeat music)

47
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,248
(sighing)

48
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,077
‐ Miss Miina, I don’t know
if it’s such a good idea

49
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,749
to bring job opportunity
booklets into the bath.

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,587
‐ But the businesses in this
area aren’t offering many jobs

51
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,225
and you need to be 18 or
older to get most of them.

52
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,761
If I find anything, I
have to call right away.

53
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,225
‐ Yeah, that may very
well be the case but‐‐

54
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,426
(water splashing)

55
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,097
‐ Hey, Karen, tell me the truth,

56
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,725
do you think I look 18?

57
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,347
‐ Not really.

58
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,071
‐ [Miina] You’re so cruel!

59
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,279
How could you say that to me?

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,820
‐ I’m so sorry.

61
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,073
‐ And with your chest,

62
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,533
you’re the last person
I wanna hear that from.

63
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,374
‐ Why are you so mean?

64
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,949
That really bothers me.

65
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,285
‐ It’s all right, Karen, flat
has it’s way of being wanted.

66
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,831
But being halfway in between

67
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,786
is really the worst
place you ca be.

68
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,497
‐ [Karen] Really, is that so?

69
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,917
‐ Well, yeah.

70
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,093
(gasp) Wow!

71
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,801
‐ [Karen] What is it?

72
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,803
‐ [Miina] Oh I see, you’ve
already found someone, huh?

73
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,930
I understand, sorry
to bother you, bye.

74
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,138
I missed out.

75
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,599
‐ Huh?

76
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,729
What’s this?

77
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,944
(sighing)

78
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,444
(whimpering)

79
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,027
‐ [Miina] No, Mike, you idiot!

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,078
You pervert, you sicko!

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,422
‐ A job, you say?

82
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,959
‐ Yeah, of course,
let’s face it,

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,132
we can’t rely on you
forever, right, Mike?

84
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,131
‐ I feel the same
way as Miss Miina.

85
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,173
‐ [Miina] Do you any
good leads for jobs?

86
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,468
‐ No, of course, I don’t.

87
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,470
I only just moved here
a couple of months ago

88
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,852
and I really don’t know that
many people around here.

89
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,850
‐ Oh, gee, why am
I not surprised?

90
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,354
‐ [Mike] Hey, shut up.

91
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,643
Anyway, Miina, what
about high school?

92
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,687
‐ High school?

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,150
‐ [Mike] Don’t you wanna go?

94
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,360
‐ (laughing) Well, you
know, I’m kinda dumb

95
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,073
so that’s really impossible.

96
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,903
‐ Miss Miina, is it possible
that you haven’t attended

97
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,109
high school, at all?

98
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,077
‐ Well, um, it’s
kind of complicated.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,700
‐ I know you don’t
wanna talk about it

100
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,117
but at least tell us
if you’ve ever been

101
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,203
to high school or not.

102
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,659
‐ [Miina] I was planning to go,

103
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,037
but things sort of fell through.

104
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,545
‐ So, what happened?

105
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,498
‐ No comment, I’m sorry.

106
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,895
‐ So, you’re looking for
leads for part‐time jobs, huh?

107
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,563
‐ That’s right.

108
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,098
‐ You know, the very
fact that you would

109
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,517
come to me looking for help

110
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,564
is such a pleasant surprise.

111
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,897
‐ Look, it’s the top
two cute freshman guys,

112
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,403
Shimazaki and Kamishiro.

113
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,896
Oh, a beautiful couple
is such a nice thing.

114
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,407
‐ I’d say Kamishiro
has to be the cat,

115
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,491
I’m certain of it.

116
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,244
‐ A cat, wait, I don’t get it.

117
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,658
‐ (gasp) I can’t believe
it, my little Haruko.

118
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,667
My little sister’s
about to begin her climb

119
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,579
up the long ladder of maturity.

120
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,089
‐ A part‐time job?

121
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,960
Don’t you think that’s
a little strange?

122
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,917
‐ [Mike] What?

123
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,215
‐ Oh, come on now, Mike,

124
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,008
you’re already working
as a programmer.

125
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,261
‐ Hey, wait a minute, how
do you know about that?

126
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,095
‐ Oh, I know everything
about you, Mike.

127
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,930
(smack)

128
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,435
‐ [Mike] I’ll smack you.

129
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,386
‐ [Shimazaki] Yeah, well my
head’s already throbbing.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,188
So then, what kind of
jobs are you looking for?

131
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,440
‐ [Mike] Ones that
girls could do.

132
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,484
‐ I see, these leads
are for those relatives

133
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,608
that have recently
moved into your house.

134
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,745
‐ I’m asking you, how
do you know about that?

135
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,030
‐ Yes, and I’m telling you,

136
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,663
I know everything about you.

137
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,492
(smack)

138
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,696
‐ [Mike] I’ll smack you.

139
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,834
‐ [Shimazaki] Yeah, my head.

140
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,793
Mike?
‐ Hm?

141
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,958
‐ If what you want is money,

142
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,289
I’ll give you as
much as you want

143
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,334
if you’ll just spend
a night with me.

144
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,329
(smack)

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,300
‐ [Mike] I’ll smack you.

146
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,959
‐ That was the
third time already.

147
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,338
‐ [Auburn Haired Girl] Look,

148
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,676
the cute couple is
flirting with each other.

149
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,631
‐ [Brunette Girl]
But when Kamishiro

150
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,718
is on the aggressive side,

151
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,933
it’s not as fun.

152
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,762
‐ I really don’t get
what’s going on at all.

153
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,348
‐ Oh, my Haruko.

154
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,635
(sobbing)

155
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,656
‐ The scenery is so beautiful.

156
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,663
It’s easy to feel peaceful here.

157
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,245
‐ You think so?

158
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,330
Of course, no matter
how peaceful or
pretty the scenery is,

159
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,668
it doesn’t give us
any money to live on.

160
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,922
‐ Miss Miina, how
about you try choosing

161
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,345
whether you’re gonna
read that paper or eat.

162
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,875
(gasp)

163
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,509
What’s the matter?

164
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,223
‐ [Miina] The high
school that Mike goes to

165
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,465
is looking for an
office assistant.

166
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,348
‐ An office assistant?

167
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,186
Are you really going to go
apply for that, that job?

168
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,864
‐ [Miina] You think I shouldn’t?

169
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,033
‐ I really don’t know
but looking at this ad,

170
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,440
it says that you’ve
got be at least

171
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,398
a high school graduate to apply.

172
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,490
‐ [Miina] That’s okay, I’ll
make up some bogus resume.

173
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,795
‐ [Karen] But, isn’t
that a bad thing to do?

174
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,119
‐ [Miina] We’ll be
a burden on Mike

175
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,833
if we don’t make some money.

176
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,333
‐ [Karen] Yeah, I
suppose so, but‐‐

177
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,668
‐ So, what do you think?

178
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,552
Do I look like I’m 18 now?

179
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,215
‐ I really don’t know
about you being proud

180
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,010
of stuffing your bra.

181
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,552
‐ Why are you just
sitting there?

182
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,215
Hurry up and go put
on a decent outfit.

183
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,215
‐ Huh?
‐ That’s right, for Mike.

184
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,176
‐ For Mr. Mike?
‐ Yeah.

185
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,556
‐ For Mr. Mike.

186
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,055
(sweet music)

187
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,607
‐ I’m shocked, to think
that you of all people

188
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,441
would actually come
to work at my school.

189
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,606
‐ But does it trouble
you that I took the job?

190
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,896
‐ Why would it?

191
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,157
I’m thrilled that you’ll
be at school every day,

192
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,579
because then we can
always be together, Karen.

193
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,747
‐ [Simpi] Kamishiro.

194
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,830
‐ Simpi, please, stop that.

195
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,246
‐ Hey, Simpi, back off!

196
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,425
You shouldn’t be trying
to seduce underclassmen!

197
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,045
‐ Okay, I won’t do it anymore.

198
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,431
‐ (sigh) Oh, Miina, thank you.

199
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,931
Oh, Miina, you saved me.

200
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,602
‐ I did it just for you, Mike.

201
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,851
(sighing)

202
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,598
‐ Miss Miina, I’ll do
my best, I promise.

203
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,939
‐ Yeah, me too.

204
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,278
‐ [Simpi] Leads
for part‐time jobs?

205
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,689
‐ [Mike] Don’t you have any?

206
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,107
I’m helping out with the
student counsel work and all.

207
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,318
I’m not saying it’s
in exchange for that,

208
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,828
but if you have any leads,
please, let me know.

209
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,331
‐ It’s for those
two girls who are

210
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,702
staying over at your
place, right, Kamishiro?

211
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,460
‐ [Mike] Well, yeah, it is.

212
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,171
But please don’t tell
everyone about it.

213
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,263
‐ Don’t worry, I’m one to
keep my mouth shut. (chuckles)

214
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,049
You doubt me, don’t you?

215
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,263
That’s a shame.

216
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,592
I was about to
introduce you to a lead.

217
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,098
‐ Really, that’s great!

218
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,519
‐ Yes, my best friend’s family
runs a local grocery store.

219
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,021
She has entrance exams
to study for this year

220
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,604
so she was looking for someone
to help out with the store,

221
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,398
in her place.

222
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
‐ That’s great!

223
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,731
Please, introduce me to her.

224
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,822
(bells ringing)

225
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,951
(door opens)

226
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,418
‐ I’m so sorry to
have kept you waiting.

227
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,129
The one in charge of
hiring is absent today.

228
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,420
I’ll be filling in for him

229
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,173
and conducting the
interview instead.

230
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,217
I’m one of the teachers
here and my name is Kazami.

231
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,602
I’m sorry, is something wrong?

232
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,519
‐ [Both] No, nothing
at all, Miss Kazami.

233
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,719
‐ Oh, I see.

234
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,235
‐ [Miina] Oh, it looks lik
she didn’t recognize us.

235
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,853
‐ [Karen] That’s a good thing.

236
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,608
‐ I’ve only been able
to take a quick look

237
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,980
at your resumes.

238
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,976
You are Miss Kikoko Inowe

239
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,898
and Miss Yayoi Inowe.

240
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,659
You have the same last name?

241
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,489
‐ Yes, you see, we’re twins.

242
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,284
‐ We have the same
eye color too.

243
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,367
‐ Oh wow, very impressive.

244
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,544
Both of you graduated from
Tokyo University Magnet School?

245
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,503
‐ [Karen] Miss Miina, there’s
no such school in Tokyo.

246
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,134
‐ [Miina] What, really?

247
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,502
‐ Is something the matter?

248
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,128
‐ [Both] Nothing at
all, Miss Kazami.

249
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,006
‐ Wait a second, you
two look familiar.

250
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,012
Have I met you somewhere before?

251
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,974
‐ [Both] No, I don’t
believe you have, mam.

252
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,725
‐ Really, are you sure?

253
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,058
‐ Yes, mam.

254
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,229
‐ [Loud Speaker] Miss Kazami,
you have a telephone call.

255
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,785
Please, come to the teacher’s
office as soon as possible.

256
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,032
‐ I’m sorry, would you mind

257
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,201
if I stepped out
for a few minutes?

258
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,409
I won’t be long.

259
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,279
‐ [Both] Yes, please, go away.

260
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,577
‐ What did you say?

261
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,410
‐ [Both] Oh, nothing.

262
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,155
(gasp)

263
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,406
Oribe and Kamishiro.

264
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,879
‐ Mam.
‐ Hello, Miss Kazami.

265
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,079
‐ It’s Mr. Mike.

266
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,300
‐ And I’ve heard that
voice somewhere before.

267
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,262
It’s that Simpi that came
to our house the other day.

268
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,514
‐ [Karen] I don’t get it.

269
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,933
What is Mike doing
all alone with her?

270
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,683
What’s the meaning of all this?

271
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,773
‐ Listen, Kamishiro, regarding
that thing we talked about?

272
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,521
‐ [Mike] Yeah, I was gonna
have a chat about that

273
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,981
a few minutes ago, but
I got a great answer.

274
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,774
I’m planning on visiting
the parents later

275
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,975
and giving them my greetings.

276
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,437
‐ What does he mean, greetings?

277
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,825
‐ What does he mean, parents?

278
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,613
‐ So they’re that important?

279
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,156
Kamishiro, you just met
them a few days ago,

280
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,321
these people may
be total strangers.

281
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,989
‐ That’s true but they
could be my real relatives.

282
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,039
‐ [Miina] Can you hear them?

283
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,620
‐ [Karen] Yeah, barely.

284
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,875
‐ Look, you really don’t know
enough to be certain, do you?

285
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,577
How about you have
them take a blood test

286
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,917
and then you can
find out for sure

287
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,002
if they’re really
relatives or not.

288
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,959
‐ Simpi, I’ve already done
some research about that.

289
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,590
The only way to know
for sure is DNA analysis

290
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,796
and that cost 100,000 yen.

291
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,848
I don’t have that kind of
money laying around anywhere.

292
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:27,813
Besides.

293
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,522
‐ Yeah, besides what, Kamishiro?

294
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,313
(angelic music)

295
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,322
‐ It’s like this, I
have something right now

296
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,993
that I’ve wanted my whole life

297
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,118
and it amazingly appeared
right in front of my face.

298
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,332
‐ Oh, Kamishiro, I‐‐

299
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,122
‐ Stop, right there!

300
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,541
All interior relationships
are forbidden!

301
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,825
‐ Miss Miina, no!

302
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,206
‐ [Miina] And when I
say it’s forbidden,

303
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,505
I mean it’s forbidden!

304
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,087
‐ Who was that?

305
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,591
‐ [Miina] I’m a teacher!

306
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,262
‐ I don’t know any teach
here who sounds like that.

307
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,842
‐ Hey, this is kinda suspicious.

308
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,848
‐ It was coming from
that room, wasn’t it?

309
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,178
‐ [Mike] Should
we open the door?

310
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,935
‐ Of course, we need
to inform the teachers

311
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,935
if there’s someone
suspicious in there.

312
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,847
‐ [Miina] This isn’t good.

313
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,806
‐ Well, no, of course it isn’t.

314
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,766
‐ Who is it?

315
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,685
(whimsical music)

316
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,530
Simpi, there they are!

317
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,789
‐ [Simpi] Escaping
from the window

318
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,499
makes them all the
more suspicious.

319
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,209
‐ Miss Miina,
didn’t we come here

320
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,539
so that we could interview
for a job opening?

321
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,795
‐ You don’t mind my
framing you here?

322
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,547
‐ No, that’s unacceptable.

323
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,590
‐ Then you better keep running.

324
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,424
(whimpering)

325
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,339
‐ [Karen] Miss
Miina, what’s wrong?

326
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,887
‐ I think I twisted my foot.

327
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,561
Don’t worry, I’m all right.

328
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,851
‐ All right, I’m back.

329
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,063
I’m sorry to have kept
you waiting so long.

330
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,815
(sighing)

331
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,703
‐ [Both] One, two, three, four.

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,620
Two, two, three, four.

333
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,530
Three, two, three, four.

334
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,196
‐ They’re not in there.

335
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,744
‐ They’re not over here either.

336
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,748
I better go inform the
student body president

337
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,581
about all this.

338
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,504
‐ I’ll go with you.

339
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,254
‐ Looks like we were
able to fool ’em.

340
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,706
‐ I can’t believe we
stole these gym clothes.

341
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,425
(sobbing) I’m turning more
and more into a bad girl.

342
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,682
‐ Someone stole all my gym
clothes out of my locker.

343
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,602
‐ Someone took mine too.

344
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,431
‐ Mine are all right, see?

345
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,937
‐ What happened, Haruko?

346
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,440
(girls gasp)

347
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,727
(screaming)

348
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,437
It’s a misunderstanding,
I was just!

349
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,778
‐ [Female Student]
Two suspicious people

350
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,324
are running around campus?

351
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,778
A couple of freshman girls
had their gym clothes stolen?

352
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,239
‐ [Male Student] I heard
one guy got caught.

353
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,448
‐ [Female Student] And
I heard the other one

354
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,830
is still on the loose.

355
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,286
‐ [Girls] Oh no!

356
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,288
‐ Call out the Manners
Committee Members,

357
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,918
you’re to work together
with the teachers

358
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,305
to blockade every entrance
and exit to this school.

359
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,512
‐ You really think we need to
go that far, Madam President?

360
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,295
‐ I do, we need to be
thorough about this.

361
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,805
(dramatic music)

362
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,405
‐ [Female Student] Should we
check this room just in case?

363
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,831
‐ [Male Student] Yeah, I got it.

364
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,740
‐ What do you see, Miss Miina?

365
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,116
What’s going on now?

366
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:35,953
‐ [Miina] It looks
like they’re doing

367
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,197
a search at the school.

368
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,160
‐ Oh no, this isn’t happening.

369
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:44,248
We’re really gonna
end up as criMiinals.

370
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,378
‐ Na!
(gasp)

371
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,339
Mr. Marie.

372
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,761
‐ Now, how did this
one get in here?

373
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,346
‐ Na, na, na, na‐‐

374
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,726
‐ I don’t get it,
what’s it doing?

375
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,152
‐ It always moves
around in strange ways.

376
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,357
‐ So you girls were here?

377
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,074
(gasp)

378
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,785
‐ But how, when
did she get here?

379
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,074
‐ You mean, how
did she get here?

380
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,660
(giggling)

381
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,414
(bells ringing)

382
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,589
‐ [Student] So what did
happen to their gym clothes?

383
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,546
‐ [Simpi] Kamishiro.

384
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,337
‐ Good work today, Simpi.

385
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,548
See you later.

386
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,770
‐ Oh, so I gather you’re
not going to help me?

387
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,140
‐ No, I have something
I need to do.

388
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,096
‐ Oh, I see, are they really
that important to you?

389
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,309
‐ They are, now if
you’ll excuse me.

390
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,032
‐ Oh, Kamishiro.

391
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,240
‐ [Kazami] Here you go.

392
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,816
‐ [Karen] Thanks,
I’ll have some too.

393
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,078
‐ To think that the two of you
would go to all the trouble

394
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,040
of dressing up and
writing false resumes

395
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,711
just so you could come
to a job interview

396
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,459
to be office assistance.

397
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,209
Do you really want to be
with Kamishiro that much?

398
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,416
‐ Well, uh.
‐ I guess.

399
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,335
‐ I see, but if he had found out

400
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,636
that you guys were
doing all of this,

401
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,931
don’t you think he
might have gotten angry?

402
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,597
Of course, deep down, he
might be happy about it.

403
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,437
You see, I was able to learn
quite a lot about Kamishiro

404
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,443
from the headmaster of
the government orphanage

405
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,817
that he had been in
most of his life.

406
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,114
Apparently, he didn’t make
any friends while he was there

407
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,278
and spent most of
his time all alone.

408
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,948
Although, he’d always be nice
and cordial and say hello,

409
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,996
he would never play together
with any of the other orphans.

410
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,209
Even after he started
coming to this school,

411
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,965
he would always try to be
alone as much as possible.

412
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,592
But you see, the real
reason why Kamishiro

413
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,046
behaves the way he does,

414
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,046
is so that he doesn’t
have to feel responsible

415
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,308
for showing any
kindness to anyone.

416
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,982
He can’t possibly
abandon the people

417
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,272
who become deeply
involved in his life.

418
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,686
That may come from the fact

419
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,725
that his parents
had abandoned him.

420
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,989
But then you two appeared and
were suddenly in this life

421
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,611
that Kamishiro had built.

422
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,027
Suddenly, after being
alone for all this time,

423
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,198
relatives showed up.

424
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,909
In other words, now
that he knows you,

425
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,165
Kamishiro will never
be able to abandon you.

426
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,380
I know he may act king of
cold or aloof towards you

427
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,342
but I’ll bet you anything that
he’s accepted both of you.

428
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,009
That’s the way which
he shows his kindness.

429
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,931
Do you understand?

430
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,851
You two are the ones
that opened the door

431
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,430
to the kindness that’s
been hiding inside of him.

432
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,982
It looks like it’s safe
for you to go home now.

433
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,612
You make sure you wash and
return those gym clothes, okay?

434
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,571
‐ [Karen And Miina] Yes, mam.

435
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,780
(train rumbling)

436
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,663
‐ [Miina] Uh‐oh,
the door is locked.

437
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,030
‐ [Karen] But, Mr.
Mike’s motorbike is here.

438
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,329
‐ [Miina] Well,
the lights are on,

439
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,751
so Mike has gotta
be inside, right?

440
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,211
‐ Hey, who’s out there?

441
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,627
‐ Oh, it’s me, Miina.

442
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,500
‐ And Karen, too.

443
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,877
‐ [Mike] Where
have you guys been?

444
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,634
Just wandering around
for all this time?

445
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,087
‐ Well, I.

446
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,388
‐ [Mike] Have you guys
never thought about

447
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,601
the feelings of those
who worry about you?

448
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,136
‐ But nobody has ever really
been worried about me before.

449
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,058
‐ [Karen] Oh, Miss Miina.

450
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,018
‐ Idiot!

451
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,149
Well, there’s someone
worried about you right now.

452
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,494
I’m worried about you.

453
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,569
If I’m being pushy,
just tell me,

454
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,914
and I won’t care anymore.

455
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,580
(somber music)

456
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,865
‐ No, Mike, you’re
not being pushy.

457
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,254
‐ Yeah, I don’t think
you’re being pushy at all.

458
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,292
‐ Thank you for looking
out for the two of us.

459
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,338
‐ I like it when people
are a little pushy.

460
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,551
‐ [Miina] I’m sorry, Mike.

461
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,420
‐ [Karen] I apologize.

462
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,093
‐ Then while I’m being pushy,

463
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,967
I guess I’ll let you know
that I managed to find

464
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,755
a couple of jobs
for both of you,

465
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,517
store clerks for a nearby market

466
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,889
called Harry Kouwa Groceries.

467
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,766
They know about
our situation too.

468
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,824
‐ Oh, Mike.

469
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,860
‐ Mr. Mike.

470
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,986
‐ Also, I made it so that you
work in the late afternoon.

471
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,452
You two will be going to
school during the day.

472
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,446
You fine with that?

473
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,906
(gasp)

474
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,155
Why are you dressed like that?

475
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,999
(sobbing)

476
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,955
Could it be that the strangers
who were at my school today

477
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:36,965
were you two?

478
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,456
‐ [Karen] I’m so sorry.

479
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,089
‐ What were you idiots doing?

480
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,054
Why at school of all places?

481
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,144
‐ We went there
for job interviews

482
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,471
and while we were there, Mike,

483
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,314
we saw you flirting
with that Simpi.

484
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,969
‐ Wait a second, what
are you talking about?

485
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,639
‐ [Miina] You were
flirting with her!

486
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,807
Right?
‐ Yes.

487
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,897
‐ Hey, I wasn’t
doing any such thing.

488
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,190
‐ [Both] Yes, you were!

489
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,065
‐ [Mike] Look, don’t try
to change the subject.

490
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,650
I want you to explain to me
why you’re dressed like that.

491
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,148
‐ [Karen] It’s kind
of complicated.

492
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,819
‐ [Miina] Hey, you’re the
one tryna change the subject!

493
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,238
‐ [Mike] Answer my question!

494
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,495
(smooth music)

495
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,751
‐ [Karen And Miina] Next
episode, more twins.

496
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,883
‐ [Miina Voiceover] We
ended up transferring

497
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,839
into the same school as Mike.

498
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,300
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
I’m a bit nervous,

499
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,011
this is the first time I’ve
attended a coed school.

500
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,379
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
All that aside,

501
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,676
I heard from someone in my class

502
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,259
that Mike always
seems to be clinging

503
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,255
onto one of his guy friends.

504
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,427
And he doesn’t show any signs

505
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,515
of being a guy living
with us, either.

506
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,099
Could it possibly be that
Mike is actually gay?

507
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,436
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
That is a big problem.

508
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,232
We gotta do something about it.

509
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,114
‐ Please Twins, episode five.

510
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,442
Do you like girls?

511
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,815
Make sure to watch it.

512
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,154
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Next
episode, more twins!
