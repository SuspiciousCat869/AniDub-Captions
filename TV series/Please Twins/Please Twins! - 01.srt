1
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,863
‐ [Mike Voiceover] I found
out about its existence

2
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,743
when I saw the
news about the UFO.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,571
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
The topic of the news

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,446
wasn’t at all what
caught my eye.

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,486
‐ [Karen Voiceover] It was
the strangely familiar scenery

6
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,326
that was shown on the TV.

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,541
‐ [Mike Voiceover] That house,

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,331
which I only knew
from that photograph.

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,535
‐ [Miina Voiceover] That house,

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,795
which looked exactly
like in the photograph.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,545
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
That was the house

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,050
that was shown on the screen.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,676
‐ [Mike Voiceover] I
wanted it to the beginning.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,220
‐ [Miina Voiceover] I
wanted to cling on to it.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,516
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I
wanted to find my memories.

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,689
‐ [Mike Voiceover] So.

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,733
‐ [Miina Voiceover] So.

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,107
‐ [Karen Voiceover] So.

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,534
(upbeat cheerful music)

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,440
(birds chirping)

21
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,987
‐ [Mike Answering Machine]
Hi, this Mike Kamishiro.

22
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,536
I’m not home right now.

23
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,621
Please leave a message if
you have one after the beep

24
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,374
and I’ll get back to you.

25
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,998
For matters concerning programs

26
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,794
you can also reach
me by fax or email.

27
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,047
(beeping)

28
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,181
(engine revving)

29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,680
(soft music)

30
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,371
‐ [Announcer] We are now
approaching the next station.

31
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,457
Please exit through the
door further forward

32
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,041
in the first car.

33
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,546
The second car and
the rear of the train.

34
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,639
‐ [Karen] Eyes the
same color as mine.

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,687
(upbeat rock music)

36
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,621
‐ Help me!

37
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,205
No, I don’t want to, stop it.

38
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,578
‐ [Driver] Come on, don’t
make a big deal out of it.

39
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,747
‐ He’s trying to rape me.

40
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,541
(groaning)

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,298
‐ [Driver] Hey, what are
you doing, you idiot?

42
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,264
My car.

43
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,435
‐ You, you pervert.

44
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,598
‐ [Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen,

45
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,516
we are arriving at the station.

46
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,977
Please exit through the
door further forward

47
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,896
in the first car.

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,106
‐ The West Beach exit?

49
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,448
You’re almost there already.

50
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,873
That guy tricked you, huh?

51
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,952
That was pretty
unfortunate for you.

52
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,447
It’s too bad you had
to go through it.

53
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,750
So what are you
doing around here?

54
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,792
It’s not a holiday.

55
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,786
Are you in the middle of
trying to find yourself

56
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,008
by hitchhiking around
the country or something?

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,960
‐ [Miina] No.

58
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:58,968
‐ [Mike] Then what?

59
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,636
‐ Something much more desperate.

60
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,682
‐ Oh, sorry.

61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,476
‐ We have the same color eyes.

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,515
‐ Oh, yeah.

63
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,357
Are colored contacts
really popular?

64
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,283
‐ I was born with this color.

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,110
‐ Really?

66
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:19,994
Well, so was I.

67
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,450
‐ Is that so?

68
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,490
‐ Hey, you don’t
have to get so close.

69
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,745
‐ I didn’t mean it
that way, you know.

70
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,577
‐ Yeah, I know, but.

71
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,045
(bells ringing)

72
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,634
Oh, no.

73
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,801
I’m terribly sorry, ma’am.

74
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,846
‐ Kamishiro, you’ve
been tardy a lot lately.

75
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,271
Seven times this month.

76
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,353
Now don’t you think
that’s a bit much?

77
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,845
‐ There’s a lot going
on in my life right now.

78
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,438
‐ I’ve got a lot going on too.

79
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,154
‐ I guess that’s true.

80
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,815
‐ You find it hard
living all alone?

81
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,914
It must be quite inconvenient.

82
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,321
‐ That’s not what I meant.

83
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,702
All of my stuff’s unpacked

84
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,117
and the living
conditions at my home

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,703
are starting to become normal.

86
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,425
‐ Are you eating?

87
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,383
‐ I’m getting by.

88
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,805
‐ Aren’t you eating
out all the time?

89
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,421
I know, yeah.

90
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,719
Why don’t I make
you dinner tonight?

91
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,301
‐ No, it would just
inconvenience your husband.

92
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,889
(sneezing)

93
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,516
Anyway, thanks for the offer.

94
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,561
I promise that I’ll
do better tomorrow.

95
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,399
‐ But Kamishiro.

96
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,573
‐ Please excuse me, ma’am.

97
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,395
(sighing)

98
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,069
‐ So, Mike.

99
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,906
Did you know that commuting
here by motorcycle

100
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,583
is a violation of school rules?

101
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,542
‐ Yes, senpai.

102
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,081
‐ If you’re going to hide it,

103
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,334
just put it where it’s not
so easy to find next time.

104
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,631
‐ Can we keep this quiet, huh?

105
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,339
‐ Of course.

106
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,426
‐ That’s a big help.

107
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,218
‐ I have a favor to ask.

108
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,057
‐ It figures.

109
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,440
‐ You’re a lifesaver.

110
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,151
‐ And these are?

111
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,572
‐ [Tsubaki] Documents
used to decide

112
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,359
all the clubs budgets
for this term.

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,902
‐ Wait, you don’t mean?

114
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,275
‐ [Tsubaki] Yeah, I’m
trusting you with.

115
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,202
‐ Ah, don’t you think
it’s just a bit too much

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,372
for this to be part of the deal?

117
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,621
‐ Okay, I’ll throw in two
weeks of lunches made by me.

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,004
How’s that?

119
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,872
Or you can take
me out on a date.

120
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,918
‐ Take you out?

121
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,545
‐ Which will it be?

122
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,798
‐ Which will it be?

123
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,219
If you don’t mind I’m
going to take the lunches.

124
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,016
‐ [Ichigo] You’ve
been shot down.

125
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,023
(gasping)

126
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,895
‐ [Tsubaki] President.

127
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,771
‐ So he’s Mike Kamishiro
the one you’ve been after.

128
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,945
The freshman with
the deep blue eyes.

129
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,238
One of his parents
was a foreigner.

130
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,822
He lives all alone
in a house he rents.

131
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,620
He earns his money as a
programmer working from home.

132
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,793
He’s focused on work
but goes to school.

133
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,502
And he has no particular
girlfriend, right?

134
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,455
‐ You know a lot.

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,249
‐ [Ichigo] And now I know
he commutes by motorcycle.

136
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,968
‐ Oh, please be
quiet about that.

137
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,891
‐ Because you’re in love?

138
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,813
‐ Oh no, nothing like that.

139
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,059
See, he’s a brilliant
boy and I thought,

140
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,556
I thought that he would
make a great addition

141
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,976
to our student council.

142
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,021
Could you please stop
that strange chuckle.

143
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,190
It’s kind of weird.

144
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,712
(whining)

145
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,227
‐ Oh, Little Wonder.

146
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,191
Would you like to have a prech?

147
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,862
You don’t want one?

148
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,823
(keyboard tapping)

149
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,914
(phone ringing)

150
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,286
‐ Yeah, yeah.

151
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,132
Kamishiro here.

152
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,005
‐ [Kokichi] Hello, this
is Kokichi from IND.

153
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:52,972
‐ Oh yeah, hi.

154
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,763
How come you’re calling?

155
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,394
I thought I still had a bit
of time before the deadline.

156
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,772
Are there changes in
the specifications?

157
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,431
‐ [Kokichi] I really
hate to do this to you

158
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,439
but its the deadline.

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,440
‐ What, the deadline?

160
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,983
No way.

161
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,437
You’re not going to tell me

162
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,606
it’s the end of this week
or something, are you?

163
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,985
‐ [Kokichi] Ah,
that’s exactly it.

164
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,533
‐ [Mike] You’re ruthless.

165
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,744
‐ [Kokichi] Oh, please.

166
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,873
You signed a lucrative
programming contract
with us, right?

167
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,294
And you can live alone

168
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,713
thanks to the advance
payments from that contract.

169
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,962
‐ Alright, it’s fine.

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,173
I’ll do it.

171
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,344
‐ [Kokichi] I knew
you would, Mike.

172
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,382
Love you.

173
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,924
(beeping)

174
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:38,007
‐ That’s one love
that’ll never bear fruit.

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,600
Jeez, all they do is
take advantage of me.

176
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,064
(doorbell ringing)

177
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,364
Great, what is it now?

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,361
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,695
Yes, what can I do for you?

180
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,150
(gasping)

181
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:55,988
You’re‐‐

182
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,532
‐ What a coincidence.

183
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,237
Why are you here?

184
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,195
‐ [Mike] Why?

185
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,996
Because this is my house.

186
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,829
‐ Really?
‐ Really.

187
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,254
So what is it you want?

188
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,126
‐ This has got to be fate.

189
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,469
Have you seen this
photograph before?

190
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,507
‐ How did you get this picture?

191
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,506
‐ So it’s true after all.

192
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,469
‐ [Mike] What?

193
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,847
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,813
‐ There really was one,
and I really met him.

195
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,648
I can’t believe it.

196
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,194
‐ Impossible.

197
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,817
‐ Hello, I’m Miina Miyafuji.

198
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,825
(gulping)

199
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,616
‐ I’m Mike Kamishiro.

200
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
‐ You’re Mike?
‐ Yeah.

201
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,866
‐ Nice to meet you.

202
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,076
I know you’ve never heard of me

203
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,748
but I’m actually
a blood relative.

204
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,998
Isn’t it wonderful?

205
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,207
You and I are twins.

206
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,589
‐ [Mike] Twins with me?

207
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,505
You’re my sister?

208
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,757
‐ Yeap.

209
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,218
‐ [Mike] I hate
pranks like that.

210
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,307
‐ [Miina] But it’s true.

211
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,186
Hey, open the door.

212
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,783
‐ [Mike] See, here it is.

213
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,991
I have the same photo.

214
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,205
‐ I heard that was all I had
with me when I was adopted.

215
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,243
‐ So I guess that means,

216
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,959
looking at this gender‐wise,
this must be me.

217
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,961
‐ [Miina] And the
other one is me.

218
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,213
‐ [Mike] Hm, I see.

219
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,095
‐ You understand now?

220
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,426
‐ Yeah, I understand, but I
still don’t know it’s true.

221
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,639
It’s just one little photograph.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,101
‐ But we have the
same color eyes.

223
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,060
‐ Yeah, can’t deny that.

224
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,640
Wait, regardless of all that,

225
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,597
how can you suddenly
decide to show up now?

226
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,978
‐ Because of a news report
I saw two years ago on TV.

227
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,575
‐ You mean the one
about all the UFOs?

228
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,110
‐ Yeah, the house I was born in

229
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,567
and that I’ve been looking
for this whole time was on it.

230
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,198
So I was finally able to save
enough money and here I am.

231
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:10,963
‐ Yeah, same here.

232
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,995
‐ I can take a little look
around the house, right?

233
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,470
‐ Yeah, there’s nothing
in it, but go right ahead.

234
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,715
You know, this house was
all tattered when I got it.

235
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,465
Of course, thanks to that,
the rent was really cheap.

236
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,154
It took me two
months to fix it up.

237
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,526
This is the only room
I’m using at the moment.

238
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,331
‐ So, ehm.

239
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,543
‐ [Mike] What is it?

240
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,872
‐ Can I look at the
room over there?

241
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:52,828
‐ Sure.

242
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,211
(laughing)

243
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,167
‐ It’s so spacious in here.

244
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,417
And I can’t believe
how clean it is.

245
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,177
‐ I don’t have furniture yet,

246
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,889
but I’m planning on
making this the guest room

247
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,351
when I get some.

248
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,009
‐ This might be just right.

249
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,517
‐ What are you talking about?

250
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,267
Why are you putting
your stuff down there?

251
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,649
‐ I felt like it.

252
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,032
‐ That looks like
it’s kind of heavy.

253
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,991
‐ It’s got all of
my stuff in it.

254
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,365
I’ll bet it’s
inconvenient for a boy

255
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,659
to live alone, isn’t it?

256
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,740
‐ Not really.

257
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,335
‐ Come on, it’s not?

258
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,253
‐ Not really.

259
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,170
‐ But it is.

260
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,632
‐ Don’t make assumptions.

261
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,552
‐ You know, I’m good
at lots of stuff.

262
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,135
Like cooking and cleaning up.

263
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,892
And I’m more
reliable than I look.

264
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,233
I’m just trying to
appeal to you, alright?

265
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,727
‐ Well, you don’t appeal to me.

266
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,115
But you plan on living
here, don’t you?

267
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,234
‐ Mhm.

268
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,738
‐ No way.

269
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,860
‐ It’s all right,
you and I are family.

270
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,317
Twins, remember?

271
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,817
‐ Look, no offense, Miina,

272
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,988
but we really don’t know if
that’s true or not, okay?

273
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,577
‐ If you’re gonna say that,
I can say the same thing.

274
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,214
I really don’t know whether
or not you’re my relative,

275
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,120
not for sure.

276
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,206
‐ There’s no way to know.

277
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,254
I was abandoned
right after birth.

278
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,838
My birth certificate
and my profile

279
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,094
were made up when I was found.

280
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,426
‐ Basically I can
say the same thing.

281
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,426
‐ That’s all the more reason

282
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,724
why we can’t be
living under one roof.

283
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,268
Now listen, try to understand.

284
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,985
This house belongs to me.

285
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,905
It belongs to me
’cause I pay the rent,

286
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,652
because it’s my home.

287
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,105
‐ Yeah, but this is the
house I was born in.

288
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,946
I feel the same way as you do.

289
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,699
Here’s the photograph.

290
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,206
I grew up my whole
life looking at it.

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,710
This is my house too.

292
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,746
If I’m a child of this house,

293
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,297
I should have the right
to live here, should I?

294
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,932
I’m sorry, I know this reckless,

295
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,814
but I’m just feeling
sort of desperate.

296
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,848
(birds chirping)

297
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,150
(pan sizzling)

298
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:32,236
‐ Wow.

299
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,826
(munching)

300
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,418
Okay, I can see that
you’re good at cooking.

301
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,547
‐ [Miina] Good enough to
be the deciding factor?

302
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,925
‐ [Mike] I’m thinking about it.

303
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,767
So, where have you been
living up till now?

304
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,600
‐ [Miina] I lived
in foster homes.

305
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,475
‐ [Mike] You lived in
them all your life?

306
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,152
‐ [Miina] Someone
did try to adopt me

307
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,691
somewhere in all those years,

308
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,649
but a lot of things happened.

309
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,858
‐ [Mike] Of course.

310
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,159
A lot of things are
expected to happen

311
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,871
when your parents abandon you.

312
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,041
I had a lot of
things happen too.

313
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,199
‐ [Miina] But don’t you think

314
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,457
you’re pretty
amazing considering?

315
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,209
‐ [Mike] What’s so
amazing about me?

316
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,420
‐ [Miina] For one thing,

317
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,382
you’re renting this
house and everything.

318
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,502
‐ [Mike] Yeah, well,
it’s no big deal.

319
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,417
I work as a programmer.

320
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,468
‐ [Miina] What,
you mean computers?

321
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,510
Is it shady work, is it porn?

322
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,803
‐ [Mike] No, you idiot.

323
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,216
It’s legitimate work.

324
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,756
I studied my ass
off for this job

325
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,179
so I could rent this
house and live on my own.

326
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,689
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
What am I gonna to do?

327
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,317
An I gonna let her live here?

328
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,739
This is just too surreal.

329
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,156
I’m barely making enough
money to live alone.

330
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,496
But if she really
is my twin sister.

331
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,930
‐ [Mike] You know,
I was just thinking.

332
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,103
‐ Yes.

333
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,235
I hope you don’t mind, I
went ahead and bathed first.

334
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,563
‐ I don’t care about that.

335
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,687
It’s how you dressed.

336
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,568
‐ Oh, sorry.

337
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,697
You know, since we’re twins
I don’t mind if you see me.

338
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,534
‐ Even twins don’t show their
bodies to each other, okay?

339
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,618
‐ Oh, so that means you’re
finally starting to believe me?

340
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,545
‐ No, it doesn’t.

341
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,419
‐ They really are.

342
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
We’ve got the same eye color.

343
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,128
‐ Well, yeah.

344
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,683
‐ [Miina] Please,
let me stay here.

345
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,692
‐ Damn, she’s wrecking
my usual pace.

346
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,650
She’s already invading.

347
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,487
‐ [Miina] Hello, would you like
me to scrub down your back?

348
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,663
‐ I’m fine.

349
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,911
‐ [Miina] Since you’re
letting me stay,

350
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,580
I have to provide
some extra service.

351
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,489
‐ I didn’t say you could
stay, you got that?

352
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,998
‐ [Miina] Yeah.

353
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
‐ Man, what is
that girl thinking?

354
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,004
(doorbell ringing)

355
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,168
‐ [Miina] Coming.

356
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,125
‐ Idiot, don’t answer
the front door.

357
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,304
Alright, what do you
think you’re doing?

358
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,888
‐ Oh, you’re soaking wet.

359
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,604
‐ I don’t care about that, okay?

360
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,773
Just don’t answer the door.

361
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,141
‐ How come?

362
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,688
‐ Because what if it
was someone from school?

363
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,362
I’d have a big problem.

364
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,532
‐ But it would be
alright, we’re twins.

365
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,439
‐ Oh yeah?

366
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,527
How are we gonna prove it?

367
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,321
‐ But we can’t.

368
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,575
(yelling)

369
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,712
‐ Sorry.

370
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,672
‐ It fell.

371
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,169
‐ What did?

372
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,252
‐ [Miina] The towel.

373
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,218
‐ Don’t stare at me like that.

374
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,260
(doorbell ringing)

375
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,724
Just let me take care of this.

376
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,972
You stay back there.

377
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,563
‐ Okay, but try not
to drop your towel.

378
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,559
‐ Shut up.

379
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,515
Hello there, who is it?

380
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,232
If you’re selling
newspaper subscriptions,

381
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,442
I’m not interested.

382
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,444
Also I’m not interested
in opening the door

383
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,688
to any girls who have come here

384
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,147
so they can barge
in, take a bath

385
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,737
and claim this is their home.

386
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,448
‐ [Karen] So I came
here for nothing?

387
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,696
(gasping)

388
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:50,076
You see, I believe
that this is my house.

389
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,790
‐ [Miina] Wait a minute,
what does that mean?

390
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,594
‐ Hey, don’t open the door.

391
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,590
‐ But.

392
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,845
(gasping)

393
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,814
Her eyes.

394
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,595
Oh wow, look, they’re the same.

395
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,268
But how, I don’t get it.

396
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,729
(screaming)

397
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,494
‐ [Karen] Ewe.

398
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,494
(screaming)

399
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,116
‐ It’s not what you think.

400
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,832
Look, I don’t want
any misunderstandings.

401
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,793
‐ [Karen] Ewe.

402
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,633
‐ She fainted.

403
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,919
‐ Alright, you bring her in,

404
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,546
and I’ll go spread
out the futon.

405
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,224
‐ Hey.

406
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,512
‐ By the way where is the futon?

407
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,138
‐ Never mind that.

408
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,223
Would you listen?

409
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,685
‐ [Miina Viceover]
Miina Miyafuji.

410
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,024
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
Mike Kamishiro.

411
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,944
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Karen Onodera.

412
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,824
‐ [Mike Voiceover] It
was about to begin.

413
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,238
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
Right here in our house.

414
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,285
‐ [Karen Voiceover]
Our very own summer.

415
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,291
(upbeat cheerful music)

416
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,793
‐ [Girls] Next
episode, more twins.

417
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,920
‐ [Miina] There are two people
shown in the old photograph.

418
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,093
‐ [Karen] But there are
three of us in this house.

419
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,133
‐ [Miina] Two of us
are blood relatives.

420
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,585
‐ [Karen] And one
of us is a stranger.

421
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,097
‐ [Miina] And even if
that fact were to change.

422
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,760
‐ [Karen] It’s true that
we’re causing Mr Mike

423
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,428
a lot of trouble that
he wasn’t counting on.

424
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,478
‐ [Miina] But the
place I can go back to.

425
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,734
‐ [Karen] The place
I can go back.

426
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,685
‐ [Miina] Please
Twins, episode two.

427
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,276
‐ [Karen] We might be related.
