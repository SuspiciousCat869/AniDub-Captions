1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,517
(students chattering)

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,231
‐ [Mike] We eat our
meals together back home

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,154
so don’t you think that
eating together here

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,361
is a little much?

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,230
‐ But food tastes better
when we’re together.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,530
‐ You don’t want to eat with us?

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,744
‐ It’s not that I don’t want to,

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,204
I’m just worried
about all the staring.

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,873
From over there too.

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,666
(Kousei slurps)

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,050
‐ Those girls are being so
open about their feelings.

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,549
‐ [Ichigo] That
makes me wanna smile.

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,721
‐ What are you talking
about, Madame President?

14
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,721
You, who has an information
network as good as the Echelon

15
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,473
should certainly know by
now that one of those girls

16
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,476
has no blood relation
to Kamishiro at all!

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
‐ Yes, of course
I know all that.

18
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,774
‐ If you leave them all alone

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,395
there could be some
sort of mishap.

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,522
And, in fact, I
guarantee there will be.

21
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,067
‐ [Ichigo] Are you jealous?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,282
‐ I really don’t care if you
want to think of it that way.

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,575
‐ All right then.

24
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,366
I agree to help you out.

25
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,869
If you’re saying
you won’t regret it.

26
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,542
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,801
(singing in a foreign language)

28
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,712
(birds chirping)

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,330
(bell chimes)

30
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,382
‐ [Student Announcer]
An announcement

31
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,842
from the Student Council.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,801
Mike Kamishiro in 1‐B,

33
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,046
please report to the Student
Council office immediately.

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,046
If you don’t come soon I’ll
do something really dreadful.

35
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,099
(speaker buzzes)

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,350
‐ What was that?

37
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,933
‐ [Student] Hurry up, Kamishiro.

38
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,016
I heard President Morino’s
something really dreadful

39
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,773
is something really dreadful.

40
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,943
‐ Okay.

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,571
(upbeat music)

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,985
So let me get this straight,

43
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,898
for the duration of
the ballgame festival

44
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,698
you want me to be on
the executive committee

45
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,862
as an interim member?

46
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,068
‐ That’s right.

47
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,489
I think very highly
of your work ethic

48
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,325
and your information
handling capabilities.

49
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,542
‐ Look, I appreciate that
but I already have a job.

50
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,003
‐ Yes, I know.

51
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,923
We’re prepared to pay you
a very generous salary

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,383
fitting your work.

53
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,461
It will pay better than writing
computer programs at home.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,720
‐ I’ll do my best for you.

55
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,352
‐ Good, I’m counting on you,
Kamishiro. (laughs dryly)

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,600
(students chattering)

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,225
‐ I’m Tsubaki Oribe,
committee member.

58
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,067
‐ I’m Mike Kamishiro,
an interim member.

59
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,565
(bell rings)
Wait,

60
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,367
are there really only two
of us on this committee?

61
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,449
‐ Everyone’s short
of people these days.

62
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,866
‐ Come here, froggy!

63
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,412
Come here, froggy!

64
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,455
‐ You know, I just
can’t believe that.

65
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,751
What in the world‐‐

66
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,752
‐ President Morino has
left us her orders.

67
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,634
She wants this ballgame
festival to be organized

68
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,423
and held in secret.

69
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,376
‐ Well, that’s stupid.

70
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,174
Why hold a festival in secret?

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,087
‐ [Tsubaki] Oh, I
don’t really know.

72
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,762
‐ I thought something was
fishy so I came over here.

73
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,346
‐ Oh, Ms. Miina, I think
the situation falls

74
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,182
under Love Alliance
rule number four.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,637
‐ We’ve gotta stop them.

76
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,639
‐ I’m right with you.

77
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,060
‐ [Ichigo] You can’t.

78
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,766
‐ [Miina and Karen]
Starting council president!

79
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,818
‐ The student council
office forbids entry

80
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,941
of those other than
committee members.

81
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,778
‐ What?

82
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,073
That’s not fair.

83
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,244
‐ Then Ms. Miina and
I want to volunteer

84
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,242
to serve on the
committee, right now.

85
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,164
‐ Request denied.

86
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,123
‐ Why?

87
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:44,991
I don’t understand.

88
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,198
‐ Feng shui.

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,076
Dr. Kopa told me about it.

90
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,083
‐ That is not a valid reason!

91
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,135
‐ [Ichigo] Then I’ll make
it a presidential order.

92
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,709
If you violate my order
I’ll do something dreadful.

93
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,965
‐ Dreadful?

94
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,546
What exactly are you
planning on doing?

95
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,421
‐ The school forbids
part time jobs

96
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,048
for its students.

97
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,604
The Jomon‐style roasts
at Harikawa Grocery
are rather tasty.

98
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,969
You know what I mean?

99
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,926
(girls gasp)

100
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,136
I’m glad the two
of you understand.

101
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,688
‐ How ’bout we switch this
one with that one over here.

102
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,653
‐ Oh yeah.

103
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,152
That’ll work out a lot better.

104
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,403
‐ [Tsubaki] Of course.

105
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,323
‐ [Mike] How ’bout
we take this one

106
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,282
and group them altogether?

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,490
‐ [Tsubaki] That’s great.

108
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,071
I knew you’d do a
good job, Kamishiro.

109
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,114
(Kousei groans)

110
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,197
(crickets chirping)

111
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,035
‐ [Miina] You are not going
to quit the committee?

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,700
‐ But why aren’t you, Mike?

113
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,329
‐ Because no matter
what the work is,

114
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,543
I still need the money.

115
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,545
We used up quite a bit
of it on that last trip

116
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,997
we took, you know?

117
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,795
‐ So, you wanna hang out
with the vice president, huh?

118
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,208
‐ It’s not that.

119
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,338
‐ [Miina] You’re being fooled
by a woman’s seduction.

120
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,376
‐ That’s right because
it’s really true

121
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,800
that boys prefer girls with
good figures, isn’t it?

122
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,677
‐ Please don’t jump
to conclusions.

123
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,176
Senpai and I are
just doing paperwork.

124
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,267
I’ll have to be staying at
school late from now on.

125
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,773
So make sure both of
you get to work on time.

126
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,726
You got that?

127
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,477
(girls huff)

128
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,488
(light orchestral music)

129
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,572
‐ Oh, Miina, what do
you think we should do?

130
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,829
It’s a big crisis for
the Love Alliance.

131
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,199
‐ I guess we have to
count on Mike being stoic

132
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,037
through it all.

133
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,501
‐ Yeah, you’re right.

134
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,581
Mr. Mike would be the last
person to make a big mistake.

135
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,458
‐ But if we just do nothing

136
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,883
then something like that
might really happen.

137
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,338
‐ I’ve never felt
this way before.

138
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,724
I’ve gotta have you.

139
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,432
I can’t stand just
working together with you.

140
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,893
My heart races every day.

141
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,472
But I want it to race even more.

142
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,064
‐ Senpai, no.

143
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,402
‐ I love you.

144
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,016
‐ That’s not good at all.

145
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,188
‐ We need to keep an
eye on him after all.

146
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,487
‐ We can’t, we have a
job we have to go to,

147
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,571
don’t you remember?

148
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,445
(Marie humming)

149
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,407
(girls gasp)

150
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,367
‐ [Marie] Huh?

151
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,505
‐ [Both] Yeah, that’s it!

152
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,130
(Marie coos)

153
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,383
‐ [Mizuho] Marie is gone.

154
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,593
I wonder if he’s at
Kamishiro’s house again.

155
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,974
(birds chirping)

156
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,013
‐ [Tsubaki] You think it’s
all right for the 12th graders

157
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,675
to stand on the west side?

158
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,848
‐ That’s kind of
close to the tent

159
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,433
where all the teachers
will be resting.

160
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,267
Do you think they
might complain?

161
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,104
‐ You’re right.

162
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,598
Maybe it’d be better if

163
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,768
we thought about moving
the teacher’s tent as well.

164
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,186
(Marie coos)

165
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,029
‐ I wonder if Mr. Marie
is keeping a good watch

166
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,738
on them right now.

167
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,788
‐ We have to have faith in him.

168
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,172
We don’t have a choice.

169
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,209
(bright orchestral music)

170
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,300
(monitor beeping)

171
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,886
(bright orchestral music)

172
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,388
(crickets chirping)

173
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,274
(Marie warbling)

174
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,597
‐ Oh, that’s good,

175
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,979
it looks like Mr. Mike
was all right again today.

176
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,905
I just wish the ballgame
festival would arrive soon.

177
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,694
Right?

178
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,777
Don’t you agree?

179
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,736
‐ Huh?

180
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,787
Oh.
(water splashes)

181
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,911
Yeah, you’re right.

182
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,539
(students chattering)

183
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,456
‐ [Student] Here goes!

184
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,086
(Marie coos suspiciously)

185
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,211
‐ Sorry to make you wait.

186
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,717
Look, I bought you some.
(Marie shrieks)

187
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,380
Let’s rest for awhile.

188
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,388
(monitor beeps)

189
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,259
‐ Oh, thank you.

190
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,056
‐ I hope that was
what you wanted.

191
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,099
‐ Yeah, it is.

192
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,774
(Marie groans)

193
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,481
‐ Hey, Kamishiro, how’s life
going with those two girls

194
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,317
you’re living with?

195
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,611
‐ What?

196
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,612
Well, there are a lot
of things that go on.

197
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,737
But I feel like we’re
getting by somehow.

198
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,123
‐ Isn’t it stressful?

199
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,951
‐ Yeah, sometimes it is.

200
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,044
But it’s a different
kind of stress

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,700
than I used to experience.

202
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,368
You know, senpai,

203
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,877
not that I wanna go into
a lecture about this,

204
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,460
but I faced a lot of
hardships in my life.

205
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,126
I was in a facility I hated,

206
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,416
and did everything
I could think of

207
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,797
to try and get thrown out.

208
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,593
And I’ve been living
my life until now

209
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,847
thinking that I was
living only for myself

210
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,721
but then, after they came here,

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,676
I think something inside
of me changed somehow.

212
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,769
‐ I think you’re
just getting soft.

213
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,984
‐ I can’t really tell
about that, you know?

214
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,991
‐ Well, I can tell if you can’t.

215
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,411
‐ You’re being fooled
by a woman’s seduction!

216
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,245
(light orchestral music)

217
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,175
‐ Kamishiro, you’re really
a different kind of guy.

218
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,171
‐ [Mike] Huh?

219
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,420
What do you mean by that?

220
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,171
‐ [Tsubaki] You’re
mature for your age.

221
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,715
‐ That’s not true.

222
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,548
I’m just a kid, desperately
holding back what I wanna say

223
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,844
or what I wanna do.

224
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,969
And what I really wanna do is

225
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,971
say everything that I
feel inside my heart.

226
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,518
(light orchestral music)

227
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,816
(Marie cooing angrily)

228
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,204
(Tsubaki screams)

229
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,957
(can clinks)

230
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,710
Senpai, are you okay?

231
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,223
(Tsubaki gasps)

232
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,849
‐ No!
(hand cracks)

233
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,889
So you’re the type of guy that
does that kind of stuff too?

234
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,105
Idiot!

235
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,065
(door slams)
(Tsubaki stomping)

236
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,557
(Marie coos)

237
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,237
(cicadas chirping)

238
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,410
(chair rattles)

239
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,372
‐ [Kousei] Mike.

240
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,618
‐ [Mike] Shimazaki.

241
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,255
‐ What did you do to her?

242
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,173
‐ [Mike] What?

243
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,251
‐ What did you do to Tsubaki?

244
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,093
‐ Huh?

245
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,262
‐ [Miina] Mike, you pervert!

246
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,176
‐ [Karen] Mr. Mike,
you’re disgusting!

247
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,513
‐ Hey, what’s going
on with you two?

248
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,098
‐ Oh, now he’s just
gonna play dumb.

249
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,436
‐ Mr. Marie was
watching all day.

250
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,981
Right?
(Marie grunts)

251
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,025
‐ Something happened
at school, didn’t it?

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,267
‐ [Mike] Yeah, it did.

253
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,493
But it’s nothing like what you
guys are probably thinking.

254
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,782
It’s nothing like that.

255
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,162
(cicadas chirping)

256
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,449
‐ [Kousei] I see, it
was an accident, huh?

257
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,868
I’m sorry, Mike, I shouldn’t
have gotten so awfully excited.

258
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,958
‐ It’s all right.

259
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,464
But I’m just a
little bit curious,

260
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,634
did something happen
with you an senpai?

261
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,634
‐ Yes, Mike, about
six months ago.

262
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,297
‐ When Kousei came to the campus

263
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,256
while preparing for
his entrance exams,

264
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,814
someone introduced me to him.

265
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,218
For awhile I would just
give him basic advice

266
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,978
about what he should
do in preparation.

267
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,649
And then, after a few
weeks, I began to tutor him.

268
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,610
‐ Then you guys started
to see each other?

269
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,859
‐ That’s right.

270
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,402
‐ And so, I went on a
few dates with Tsubaki

271
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,744
to take a breather
from all the studies.

272
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,320
But then one day.

273
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,911
‐ No, Kousei, I can’t here,

274
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,663
it’s too embarrassing
in a place like this.

275
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,576
‐ But I just can’t hold back.

276
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,253
‐ [Tsubaki] Kousei.

277
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,805
(light orchestral music)

278
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,929
(Tsubaki gasps)

279
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,895
‐ No!
(hand cracks)

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,350
You idiot.

281
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,898
And because of that incident

282
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,611
I started to keep my
distance from Kousei.

283
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,914
‐ You are an idiot.

284
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,704
Why have you never told me this?

285
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,747
‐ There are times when
a guy just hold back

286
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,251
and I guess I was embarrassed,

287
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,463
but I guess it’s true that
I’ve hurt Tsubaki’s feelings

288
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,881
and I was wrong.

289
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,301
And so I’ve tried to hold back

290
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,839
and suppress any interest or
feelings I’ve had toward woman,

291
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,054
and made myself believe
deep in my heart

292
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,216
that you were much more
to me than just a friend.

293
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,894
‐ [Mike] Well, that seems
to be succeeding for you.

294
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,733
‐ [Kousei] Well, it’s
the fruit of my labor.

295
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,231
‐ So are you in love

296
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,193
with senpai?

297
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,902
(light orchestral music)

298
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,656
‐ I suppose you’re probably

299
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,910
still in love with
Shimazaki, right?

300
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,244
‐ Not anymore.

301
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,949
Mike Kamishiro is
who I currently‐‐

302
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,909
‐ [Ichigo] Liar.

303
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,754
Kamishiro is a serious guy

304
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,083
and would never
lay a hand on you.

305
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,670
That’s why you were able
to approach him so easily,

306
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,174
wasn’t it?

307
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,176
But let’s face it,
that’s not love.

308
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,679
‐ [Tsubaki] President Morino.

309
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,800
‐ If you keep acting out
on your mistaken emotions

310
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,139
you’ll come to a standstill.

311
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,144
I was so close to you, Tsubaki,

312
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,230
and yet I couldn’t see through
to your true inner feelings.

313
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,784
I still have a
ways to go myself.

314
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,317
‐ You mean all of that.

315
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,575
‐ Happened in the past?

316
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,487
‐ That’s right.

317
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,736
And you guys were so worried.

318
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,117
In the first place I.

319
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,503
‐ You what?

320
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,753
‐ What were you saying?

321
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,963
‐ Nevermind.

322
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,094
‐ [Miina] What?

323
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,289
Now you’ve got me curious.

324
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,500
‐ [Karen] Please
tell us, Mr. Mike.

325
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,799
‐ [Mike] I said, nevermind.

326
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,763
‐ Aw.

327
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,548
‐ [Mike] Shimazaki,

328
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,387
you’ve got to catch the
one you love, right?

329
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,643
I really understand
how that feels.

330
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,306
But a feeling can sometimes
break up a relationship

331
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,267
with that person.

332
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,575
I won’t do it.

333
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,689
I don’t wanna let go.

334
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,700
Because this house has
what I’ve wanted so much.

335
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,334
(birds chirping)

336
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,328
(pencil scraping)

337
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,675
(door scrapes)

338
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,047
(Tsubaki gasps)

339
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,345
‐ Kamishiro, I’m
sorry about yesterday.

340
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,098
‐ [Student] What happened
yesterday was an accident.

341
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
‐ Yes, I know.

342
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,935
‐ Mike didn’t mean to
touch you in that way.

343
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,861
I want you at least
to understand that.

344
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,361
‐ [Tsubaki] Why are
you here, Kousei?

345
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,534
It’s awfully early in
the morning for you.

346
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,701
‐ It seems I’m an interim
committee member now too.

347
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,326
I got the permission of the
student council president.

348
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,793
‐ Oh, that president.

349
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,711
‐ Tsubaki, do you
mind if I sit here?

350
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,711
‐ Just as long as you don’t
try to get any closer.

351
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,705
‐ Of course.

352
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,206
I understand.

353
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,338
(light piano music)

354
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:59,035
(moves into bright
orchestral music)

355
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,585
I’m sorry I’ve hurt you.

356
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,212
‐ Yes, I was hurt.

357
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,134
‐ I’ll never do it
again, I promise.

358
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,719
‐ I don’t believe you.

359
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,722
‐ So, you don’t have
feelings for me anymore?

360
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,441
Does that mean that
you’re in love with Mike?

361
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,271
‐ What if I said that I was?

362
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,185
‐ I wouldn’t do anything.

363
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,114
‐ I see.

364
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,397
‐ But there’s just one thing.

365
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,277
I’m still in love
with you, Tsubaki.

366
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,117
‐ It’s a little late.

367
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,290
‐ I can never figure out

368
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,871
why you thought you had
to slap me like that.

369
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,705
I thought that it was all
right if we loved each other.

370
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,421
‐ [Tsubaki] It was embarrassing.

371
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,671
It was really embarrassing.

372
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,263
‐ I’m sorry.

373
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,170
‐ You see, it was my first kiss.

374
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,550
I always dreamed it
would be more gentle.

375
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,468
I hate you for what
you did, Kousei.

376
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,557
I hate you.

377
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
‐ [Kousei] Don’t pout.

378
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,982
‐ I’m not pouting, I.

379
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,149
‐ Please don’t.

380
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,111
(cicadas chirping)

381
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,487
Let me start from the beginning.

382
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,162
From a simple kiss
that got so confused.

383
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,827
‐ No fair.

384
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,453
‐ You’re right about that.

385
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,868
I’m sorry.

386
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,868
‐ Okay.

387
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,579
I forgive you, Kousei.

388
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,538
Because I’ve always.

389
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,590
(cicadas chirping)

390
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,886
(Tsubaki moans)

391
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,311
(hand slaps)
Idiot!

392
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,140
(door slams)

393
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,354
Kousei, you pervert!

394
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,525
You can’t be delicate at all!

395
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,398
‐ Senpai, are you?

396
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,073
(upbeat music)

397
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,820
Hey, Shimazaki, what
did you do to her?

398
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,529
‐ Well, Mike, it
seems I did it again.

399
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,623
I’m a guy who can’t
suppress any desires.

400
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,916
‐ Go after her and stop
acting like a jerk!

401
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,331
‐ She just slapped me again.

402
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,038
‐ So, go after her anyway.

403
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,708
If you love her, chase her!

404
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,222
(upbeat music)

405
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,389
‐ I can’t brush you
aside, Shimazaki.

406
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,399
(camera shutter snaps)

407
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,571
Oh well, I guess this is
all right the way it is.

408
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,281
(upbeat music)

409
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,073
Tsubaki, you should accelerate

410
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,081
straight into the
right direction.

411
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,794
‐ I’m so sorry, Tsubaki, really.

412
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,463
‐ Don’t touch me,
you sick pervert.

413
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,008
‐ Tsubaki.

414
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,009
‐ You really are the worst
of the worst, you know that?

415
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,262
‐ Hey, senpai!

416
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,561
All lovey‐dovey, huh?

417
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,560
‐ Yeah, you guys look cute.

418
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,192
‐ [Tsubaki] Are you mocking me?

419
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,439
‐ Of course not.

420
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,020
‐ [Both] We’re both
jealous of you.

421
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,362
‐ I don’t get it.

422
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,566
‐ You’ve gotta be more
honest with yourself.

423
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,452
‐ Or your love will run
away from you. (laughs)

424
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,295
‐ [Kousei] I can’t win.

425
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,084
‐ Oh, Kousei.

426
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,292
Next time try to
keep things proper.

427
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,045
(bright orchestral music)

428
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,807
‐ [Miina] I’m jealous that
they can be so honest.

429
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,232
‐ [Karen] I’m jealous that
their love can bear fruit.

430
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,479
‐ [Miina] Oh, Mike.

431
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,985
‐ [Karen] Mr. Mike.

432
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,244
‐ [Miina] Tell me,
where is our love?

433
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,452
‐ [Karen] Where is our
love headed towards?

434
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,670
(singing in a foreign language)

435
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,247
‐ [Miina and Karen] Next
episode, more twins.

436
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,590
‐ [Miina] I went out into town
with Mike and Karen today.

437
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,999
‐ [Karen] The three of
us are together, but.

438
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,338
‐ [Miina] It’s all
right if I pretended

439
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,013
I was on a date
with Mike, right?

440
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,261
‐ [Karen] It’s all right
if I pretended too, right?

441
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,764
‐ [Miina] Hey, Mike, Karen,
where did you guys go?

442
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,306
‐ [Karen] Where are you,
Mr. Mike, Ms. Miina?

443
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,142
‐ [Miina] I don’t
want this to happen.

444
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,226
I don’t wanna be alone.

445
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,310
‐ [Karen] I don’t
wanna be alone.

446
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,357
‐ [Miina] Please
Twins! episode nine.

447
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,819
‐ [Karen] Don’t Leave Me Out.

448
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,021
‐ [Miina] Be sure to watch it.

449
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,188
Next episode, more twins.
