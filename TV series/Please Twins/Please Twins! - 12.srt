1
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,144
‐ [Karen Voiceover] On the
night that I told the truth

2
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,056
to Mr. Mike.

3
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,862
Ms. Miina left our
house without telling us

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,321
where she was going or anything.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,530
She just disappeared.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,447
Mr. Mike spent the entire
night out looking for Ms. Miina

7
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,875
and when he came back.

8
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,003
‐ I’m sure she’ll come back,

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,369
as soon as she gets hungry.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,876
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Well,
at least that’s what he said

11
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,459
but it was painfully
obvious to me

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,345
that he was just acting tough.

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,089
Ms. Miina, what’s going on?

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:55,098
Mr. Mike and I, I mean
my big brother and I

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,812
are really worried about you.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,730
So would you please
please come back home?

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,725
Please?

18
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,569
(upbeat pop music)

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,044
‐ Karen!

20
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:27,342
(upbeat pop music)
(singing in Japanese)

21
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,344
‐ Hey Miina, you
really had us worried.

22
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,012
You leave us wondering
where you are

23
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,341
and then you just
pop up at school

24
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,677
like nothings happened.

25
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,471
Can you at least look at us?

26
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,234
So what is it?

27
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,414
What, what do you mean?

28
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,985
Hey, Miina.

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,370
Fine, suit yourself.

30
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,211
‐ Ms. Miina.

31
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,464
But, it was a good thing.

32
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,626
‐ Karen, what are
you talking about?

33
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,885
(insects chirping)

34
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,767
‐ Ms. Miyafuji?

35
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,273
‐ Oh hello.

36
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,107
‐ What’s wrong?

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,071
Your face is all red.

38
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,151
‐ Oh, its nothing, really.

39
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,396
‐ Perhaps you asked
Kamishiro to go steady?

40
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,571
‐ No I didn’t!

41
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,698
‐ You don’t have to
get so upset about it.

42
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,577
‐ This is just about the
worst time for all this.

43
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,918
‐ I don’t get it.

44
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,592
What’s up with her?

45
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,879
‐ I have a very strong feeling

46
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,422
love is in the air.

47
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,676
(soft romantic music)

48
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,525
‐ What the heck is going on?

49
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,865
Miina decided that she
would ignore me all day

50
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,610
until she left school.

51
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,280
‐ Well I’m sure she had
a good reason for it.

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,530
‐ What kind of reason?

53
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,195
‐ I really don’t know.

54
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,163
Girls can get
rather complicated.

55
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,288
‐ No kidding, what she
says and what she does

56
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,500
are two totally
different things.

57
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,082
While we’re on the subject,

58
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,955
where’s Miina staying?

59
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,172
‐ She’s staying with
one of her classmates.

60
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,464
Her name is Haruko Shido.

61
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,757
‐ Haruko?

62
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,180
‐ Yeah, she’s just a
girl who’s in her class.

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,970
She has a rather
unique big brother.

64
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,010
‐ I’ll be really nice.

65
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,559
I promise to do
everything you want!

66
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,524
‐ No!

67
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,187
‐ I’m bringing her back.

68
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,904
‐ What is it that you
were just imagining.

69
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,526
‐ I really can’t say it.

70
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,863
‐ Please wait, Mr. Mike.

71
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:03,738
I’ll do it.

72
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,704
I think it would be best

73
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,701
if I just go and see Ms. Miina.

74
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,915
At times like this,
its often better

75
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,325
to keep things just
between us girls.

76
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,715
‐ You have a point.

77
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,632
‐ Haruko, I’m sorry
to barge in like this.

78
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
‐ It’s perfectly alright.

79
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,971
In fact, I’m really
happy because it feels

80
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,345
like I have a sister.

81
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,232
‐ And I’m happy
cause I feel like

82
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,600
I’ve got a new little sister.

83
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,978
It just feels like it, you know.

84
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,323
It just feels like it.

85
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,109
‐ Haruko, do you
think that maybe

86
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,744
I could stay here
for a little while?

87
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,901
‐ Oh great, that’s perfect.

88
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,030
This will be so fun.

89
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,908
‐ Just pretend that
this is your house

90
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,374
and then do whatever
you want to do

91
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,293
and then I’ll do the
same as well, okay.

92
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,254
Well, I will stay within
certain boundaries.

93
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,925
‐ [Woman] Haruko, you
have another friend here

94
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,095
to visit you.

95
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,631
I’m sending her in.

96
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,586
‐ Okay.

97
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,890
‐ Wow.

98
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,099
Now there are three
little sisters.

99
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,471
‐ Oh its alright, Karen,
don’t worry about him.

100
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,559
My big brother won’t
act on what he says.

101
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,097
‐ Hey, you brought me
a change of clothes.

102
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,059
Thanks a lot.

103
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,438
‐ You’re welcome.

104
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,824
Ms. Miina, can we go
somewhere and talk for awhile?

105
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,067
‐ Sure, Karen.

106
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,624
Why did we come
to a public bath?

107
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,617
‐ You know what they
say, naked people

108
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,115
bear their hearts right?

109
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,377
Besides, whenever I’ve
had a really important

110
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,839
conversation with you,
it’s almost always

111
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,092
been in the bathtub.

112
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,336
‐ It was like our own
secret room where Mike

113
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,046
couldn’t hear what
we were saying.

114
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,094
‐ Yeah.

115
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,473
‐ So you seem like
you’re doing okay.

116
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,564
I thought you’d be
depressed because

117
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,060
of what’s been happening
over the last few days.

118
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,982
‐ I am depressed, Ms. Miina.

119
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,311
But there’s a part of me that’s
really happy I found out.

120
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,069
That I’m the one
related to Mr. Mike.

121
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,650
‐ Yeah.

122
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,317
‐ And then last night when
you left the house, Ms. Miina,

123
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,947
I realized something.

124
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,332
I love Mr. Mike like
a little sister should

125
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,831
and I really love
having you as my friend

126
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,962
and I love the three of us.

127
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,372
I love us all together.

128
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,675
‐ Karen.

129
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,247
‐ I want the three
of us together.

130
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,798
I want us all together
living in that house.

131
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
‐ Thank you.

132
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,015
‐ Would you mind telling me?

133
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,350
What made you decide
to leave the house?

134
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,852
‐ I left because I’m a stranger.

135
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,309
Its not my home.

136
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,357
‐ If you really meant that,
you wouldn’t of chosen

137
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,902
Haruko’s house to run to.

138
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,896
I think you would of
gone much farther away.

139
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,859
You have another
reason, don’t you?

140
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,409
‐ Well I.

141
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,872
‐ You know that you
can stay in the house

142
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,751
and you can stay in love
with Mr. Mike if you want.

143
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,121
You can even tell him
you’re in love with him.

144
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,376
Right now, Ms. Miina,
you’re not even talking

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,290
to Mr. Mike.

146
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,965
Oh my, that’s not
because of me, is it?

147
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,509
‐ Its not that.

148
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,392
Well, part of me may think that.

149
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,510
But that’s really
not the reason.

150
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,557
‐ But Ms. Miina, love
alliance rule number three

151
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,561
is still fully active.

152
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,853
Whoever ends up being
related to Mr. Mike

153
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,268
must support the others
romance with him.

154
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,147
‐ But, Karen.

155
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,449
‐ I wouldn’t want anyone else
to be Mr. Mike’s girlfriend

156
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,412
but you.

157
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,700
You’re the one for my brother.

158
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,909
‐ Thanks Karen, I appreciate it.

159
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,288
But can you hold off on
the idea of me going back

160
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,087
to the house for a bit?

161
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,591
‐ Why do you want that?

162
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,012
‐ Well because.

163
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,799
‐ Please tell me.

164
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,426
Ms. Miina?

165
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,932
‐ I can’t look.

166
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:56,934
‐ What?

167
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,393
‐ I can’t look at him.

168
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,063
Ever since I found out that
Mike wasn’t my brother,

169
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,392
I haven’t been able to
look him in the face.

170
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,608
Its strange but I can’t.

171
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,028
My heart just starts to
race when he talks to me.

172
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,779
I can’t believe I’m
feeling this way.

173
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,322
I just, I just can’t see
anyone other than mike

174
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,617
but if we, if I.

175
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,537
‐ Ms. Miina.

176
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,755
‐ Both of them are so innocent.

177
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,885
Its so cute.

178
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,001
‐ Yeah it is.

179
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,089
‐ Its so nice to be young.

180
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,132
(laughing)

181
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,337
‐ You sound like an old woman.

182
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,337
‐ You.

183
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,598
I’ll do something dreadful.

184
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,219
(screaming)

185
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,255
‐ [Haruko] I’m sorry.

186
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,268
Somebody help me.

187
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,309
I’m in trouble.

188
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,564
Stop it.

189
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,104
‐ Tsubaki, I’m so
lonely here without you.

190
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,186
Who is that?

191
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,073
‐ [Mike] So it didn’t
work out with Miina, huh?

192
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,487
‐ [Karen] I’m sorry, but
she said she’d come back

193
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,986
so she’s not gone forever.

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,660
‐ Well, its’ alright.

195
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,826
As long as we know where she is.

196
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,705
We’ll be fine.

197
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,626
To think that ruined
house had records in it

198
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,251
that answered questions
about our past.

199
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,588
You know, Karen, the weird thing

200
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,263
its so run down it
doesn’t look like anyone’s

201
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,341
been living there for
at least 20 years.

202
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,183
‐ There’s no way.

203
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,853
According to the information
in our mother’s notebook,

204
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,564
the house that the
three of us lived in for

205
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,524
the first couple years of
our lives was this one.

206
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,984
So this really is our house.

207
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:30,904
‐ Yeah.

208
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:31,984
Guess you’re right.

209
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,531
You know even after we
read that entire diary,

210
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,532
we still have no real
idea of who our mother is

211
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,196
but the diary should serve
us some sort of clue.

212
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,085
So if you want me to, I
can begin a full search

213
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,085
for our mother.

214
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,078
‐ I don’t know, Mr. Mike, what
do you think we should do?

215
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,590
‐ I think we
shouldn’t do anything.

216
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,336
‐ You’re right,
I agree with you.

217
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,764
‐ So it doesn’t bother you?

218
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,932
‐ I’d be lying if I said
it didn’t bother me at all.

219
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,685
But I think that you
said it best, Mr. Mike.

220
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,937
All that really
matters is now, right?

221
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,732
You and I, in that house.

222
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,273
Miina, you and I in that house,

223
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,239
the three of us living
together as a family,

224
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,993
that would be my perfect now.

225
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,164
‐ But that’s not
the case for Miina.

226
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,492
‐ But Mr. Mike.

227
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,866
‐ Isn’t that right?

228
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,713
As soon as she found out
that she wasn’t related

229
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,539
she put a lot of distance
between her and us.

230
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,755
I don’t care if she’s a
relative or a stranger

231
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,495
but I guess it must
be important to her.

232
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,378
‐ No that’s not it.

233
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,005
I promise you that Ms.
Miina isn’t worried

234
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,012
about any of that at the moment.

235
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,264
She’s looking at
what’s happening now.

236
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,596
I can tell, I’m sure of it.

237
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,392
‐ Alright then, what
is now for Miina?

238
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,523
‐ That’s really not for
me to say, I’m sorry.

239
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,476
But please don’t stop
believing in her.

240
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,449
Right now, Ms. Miina is.

241
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,489
‐ You know, now I know for
sure that I’m your twin brother

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,235
but it really
hasn’t sunk in yet.

243
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,751
From my standpoint, you
and Miina act a lot more

244
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,619
like your twins
then we ever have.

245
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,252
‐ But we are twins.

246
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,293
‐ Oh?

247
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,998
‐ Even though we’re not related.

248
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,298
She and I are
still twin sisters.

249
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,130
‐ Karen!

250
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,303
‐ Haruko, what’s wrong?

251
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,717
‐ Karen.

252
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,595
Mii, Mii, it’s Miina.

253
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,181
‐ What’s wrong with Miina?

254
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,059
(soft instrumental music)

255
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,476
‐ Miina said she
was leaving town.

256
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,856
I tried to talk her out of it

257
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,193
but she wouldn’t listen

258
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,488
and before I knew it,

259
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,609
she had disappeared
from our house.

260
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,486
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
Why damn it, why?

261
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,163
‐ Mr. Kamishiro.

262
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,116
‐ Ms. Kasami.

263
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,203
Have you seen Miina around here?

264
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,710
Miina Miyafuji?

265
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,331
‐ Yes, I was just going
to tell you all about it.

266
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,839
I saw her, she was walking
towards Umino Kutchi station.

267
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,340
Did something happen to her?

268
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,471
‐ [Mike Voiceover] Miina.

269
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,180
‐ Miina!

270
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,136
‐ Its Mike.

271
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,386
Why is he here?

272
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,726
‐ Hey where do you think
you’re going, Miina?

273
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,239
Tell me why.

274
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,071
Why aren’t you coming back home?

275
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,606
Why aren’t you talking to me?

276
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,736
Its pretty strange.

277
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,576
Don’t you think
its strange, Miina?

278
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,711
The fact that you’re not
related to us bothers you.

279
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,578
Did you think we’d kick you out?

280
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,499
Do you really think
I’m that narrow minded?

281
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,797
Even if we’re not
related by blood,

282
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,011
even if we’re strangers,
we can still be a family.

283
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,683
You and I could just go
somewhere and get married,

284
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,972
then there’d be no
reason for you to leave.

285
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,565
‐ Oh Mike.

286
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,063
Are you proposing to me?

287
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,151
‐ Well no.

288
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,441
Its an example, you
know, just an example.

289
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,364
‐ I’m happy, I’m so happy.

290
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,695
‐ I, oh Miina.

291
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,198
‐ But I’m scared.

292
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,414
‐ Scared?

293
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,906
What’s with being scared?

294
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,155
What are you scared of?

295
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,918
‐ I want to be in that house.

296
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,752
I’m more than
happy to stay there

297
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,087
but I’m scared that
there may come a day

298
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,803
when we won’t be able to
communicate with each other.

299
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,594
If that happens, I won’t
be able to stay there.

300
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,758
I won’t be, be able to...

301
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,718
‐ Miina.

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,310
Miina, you’re worrying way
too much about the future.

303
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,977
I told you, the only thing
that really matters is now.

304
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,517
If you don’t concentrate on now,

305
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,438
there will be nothing
for you later.

306
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,863
So what do you want to do now?

307
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,777
Answer me.

308
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,780
‐ I want to stay.

309
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,288
I want to be with you.

310
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,624
I want to be with you
and Karen, all together

311
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,747
in that house.

312
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,789
‐ Then lets do that.

313
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,304
‐ What about?

314
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,475
‐ We’ll talk about
us another time.

315
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,015
(soft romantic music)

316
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,565
‐ No, stop, you can’t do that.

317
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,479
Stop wait.

318
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,193
‐ Karen?

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,490
(screams)

320
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,454
(groans)

321
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,499
(shouts)

322
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,619
‐ Oh my.

323
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,836
‐ You sure know how
to entertain us.

324
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,338
Hats off to you.

325
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,470
‐ Oh, Mr. Kamishiro.

326
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,517
‐ This is sure to
get you suspended.

327
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,312
‐ I think I’d rather
pretend as if I hadn’t

328
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,563
seen anything.

329
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,024
‐ Shimazaki, Senpai,
madam president.

330
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,228
I don’t understand.

331
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,687
‐ What are you all doing?

332
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,741
‐ Well, you know me.

333
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,902
I’m pretty much always
on the side of girls

334
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,200
who are in love.

335
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,871
‐ That’s not really
a reason to be here.

336
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,700
What does this all mean?

337
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,996
‐ Don’t ask me what it means.

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,119
All I know is that Haruko
told me I should come here

339
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,116
and wait for a little while.

340
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,128
‐ I’ve been busted.

341
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,170
‐ Come on everyone,
let’s go home.

342
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,513
‐ Hey, not so fast!

343
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,835
What did you think
you were doing.

344
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,217
Damn you.

345
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,143
‐ [Shimazaki] Ouch
that hurts, Mike.

346
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,641
Why are you attacking just me?

347
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,062
‐ [Mike] I can’t possibly
raise my hand against senpai

348
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,390
or my teacher.

349
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,637
You’re the representative
for all of them.

350
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,437
‐ [Shimazaki] Help me, Tsubaki.

351
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,653
‐ [Tsubaki] I’m sorry, Kousei.

352
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,225
‐ [Kasami] I’ll just
pretend I’ve never

353
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,728
seen any of this either.

354
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,408
‐ You’re wonderful, Kamishiro.

355
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,319
‐ Kousei.

356
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,741
‐ I envy them.

357
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,286
I want to fall in love, too.

358
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,161
‐ No way, you can’t
do that, Haruko.

359
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,537
‐ My big brother is a, well
he’s a really big time loser.

360
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,432
(soft romantic music)

361
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,521
‐ Gees, what were
those guys thinking?

362
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,640
I don’t believe them.

363
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,603
‐ You’re so cruel, Karen.

364
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,647
I thought you were going to
support me in my romance.

365
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,645
‐ Oh but I do, Ms. Miina.

366
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,857
Of course, I hope you’ll
try and understand

367
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,446
that Mr. Mike is my new
big brother after all.

368
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,544
I want to be babied by him
for a little bit longer.

369
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,949
(laughing)

370
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:42,868
‐ What are you doing?

371
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,455
‐ Well I’m your little sister.

372
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,790
Its alright if I walk arm
in arm with my big brother,

373
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,877
don’t you think?

374
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,381
‐ Yeah, well you know.

375
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,763
‐ Mike.

376
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,009
(giggling)

377
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,932
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

378
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,103
‐ You’re acting like
a newly wed wife.

379
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,259
‐ Is that bad?

380
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,557
‐ Of course it is.

381
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,180
Mr. Mike is my big
brother and mine alone.

382
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,640
‐ Yeah but he’s my Mike.

383
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,060
‐ So what, he’s my big brother.

384
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,517
‐ Does anyone here
care what I think?

385
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,242
‐ Yeah, what is it Mike?

386
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,069
What do you think we should do?

387
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,074
‐ That’s right, please
tell us, big brother.

388
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,067
‐ Well I think.

389
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,867
That’s something pretty obvious.

390
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,040
We’re gonna live in
that house, our house,

391
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,038
all three of us together.

392
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,720
‐ [Miina] Oh gees, that’s
not what we’re talking about.

393
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,183
‐ [Karen] But its just
like you to say, Mr. Mike.

394
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,683
(soft romantic music)

395
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,176
‐ [Karen Voiceover] I’m sure
there will be many things

396
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,687
up ahead for the three of us.

397
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,349
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
But for right now.

398
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,517
We’re all going
back to our house.

399
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,686
‐ [Mike Voiceover] The
three of us are going

400
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,654
to live together

401
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,191
and if we keep repeating it.

402
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,447
Someday we’ll be a real family.

403
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:04,084
(soft instrumental music)

404
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,782
Hey Miina, did you know?

405
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,529
‐ [Miina Voiceover] Know what?

406
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,825
‐ [Mike Voiceover] That photo
from when we were babies

407
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,867
it was actually you and
me in the little pool.

408
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,873
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Apparently
I was off taking a nap.

409
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,656
‐ [Mike Voiceover] So
Miina, even back then

410
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,290
the three of us were together.

411
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,504
So, that’s how it is now

412
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,169
and how its gonna
be from now on.

413
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,348
‐ [Both Voiceover] We’ll
continue to be twins forever.
