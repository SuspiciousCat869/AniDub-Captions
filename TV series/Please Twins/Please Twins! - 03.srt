1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,684
‐ [Mike] What really matters
to us is the present,

2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,017
not the past.
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,862
Miina, if you and I are
truly related by blood,

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,034
then I don’t ever wanna let
you go, Miina, understand?

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,901
I don’t ever wanna
abandon a relative.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,200
‐ But, Mike, what
if it turns out

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,875
we’re nothing but strangers?

8
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,203
What would you do then?

9
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,039
(gasps)

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,043
‐ You know what I’d do.

11
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,293
‐ Mike, no, this
is embarrassing.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:43,918
‐ It’s all right.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:44,884
‐ But.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,128
‐ [Mike] All right.

15
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,554
‐ [Miina] There.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,435
Stop it!

17
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,055
Oh.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,349
(eyes clicking)

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,520
It was a dream, a
silly little dream.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,060
But to have a dream
like that, I must.

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,064
Oh.

22
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:02,935
Ew!

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,733
(gasps)

24
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,727
I’m sorry!

25
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,027
I was having a strange dream!

26
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,901
I don’t swing that way!

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:11,908
Really.

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,570
(popping)
(gasping)

29
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,778
That’s a.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,577
I’m so sorry, I’m
sorry, I’m so sorry.

31
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,582
I gotta get a hold of myself!

32
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,964
(grunting)

33
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,079
‐ Shut up!

‐ One set of futons
are the minimum items

51
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,822
needed for everyday
life, 43,560 yen.

Total, including
sales tax, 45,738 yen.

53

The two of you can pay me back
for all that by taking care

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,867
of all the household chores
for as long as you stay here.

55

You can decide between
yourselves who’s
gonna do what chore.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,670
And I will use the time you
guys are doing your chores

57
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,974
to get all of my
programming work finished.

58
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,429
Any questions?

59
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,051
‐ No, none at all.

60
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,797
‐ None over here.

61
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,137
‐ Okay, I’ve got
one more condition,

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,643
we call each other by
first name, no titles.

63
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,648
I just don’t want anyone
making a big deal about this.

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,730
‐ In other words, "Karen"
and "Mike" and nothing else?

65
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,450
‐ Yeah, that’s exactly it, good.

66
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,201
And I’ll just call you
"Miina" and "Karen."

67
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,578
‐ Oh, I, I mean, I get it.

68
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,412
Miss Miina, Mister Mike.

69
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,748
‐ Lose the Miss and Mister part.

70
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,504
‐ I’m sorry.

71
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,754
‐ What’s that on your neck?

72
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,126
‐ Oh, that’s just something
that you shouldn’t ask about.

73
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,427
(laughs)

74
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,589
‐ Right, whatever.

75
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,258
Well, I’ll be up
workin’ in my room.

76
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,559
I’ll just leave you
two deal with the rest.

77

Oh, I forgot to tell you.

78
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,942
If the phone rings,
don’t answer it.

79
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,074
‐ Whatever you say.

80
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,109
(phone ringing)

81
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,032
(gasping)

82

(phone ringing)

83
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,945
‐ I got it!

84
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,243
Coming!

85
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,705
‐ I just told you
not to answer it!

86
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,625
‐ Oh.

87
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,198
‐ Yes, I know that.

88
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,208
I’ll make sure to
send the data today.

89
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:52,962
Yes.

90
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,713
Yes, goodbye, and thank you.

91
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,005
(beeping)

92
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,549
Guess I should start.

93
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,681
‐ I just made some coffee,
would you like some?

94
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,141
‐ I’d really
appreciate it if you

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,680
would knock before coming in.

96
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,274
And you don’t need to bring
me coffee and stuff like that.

97
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,809
‐ Okay, but since I went
ahead and made you a cup

98
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,393
I can leave it here
for you, right?

99
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,848
‐ Sure, fine.

100
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,266
‐ What kinda program is that?

101
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,228
(softly gasps)

102
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,148
‐ You wouldn’t
understand if I told you.

103
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,658
‐ Why do you have to be so mean?

104
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,531
‐ You know, I’ve really got
a lotta work to get done.

105
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,372
‐ Oh.

106
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,045
‐ Miina, why are you
blushing like that?

107
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,253
‐ Uh, what, it’s
nothing, really!

108
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,502
Nothing at all.

109
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,005
I’m sorry I bothered you
while you were working.

110
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,046
I promise it’ll
never happen again.

111
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,010
‐ What was that all about?

112
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,052
(ice cubes rattle)
(gasps)

113
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,931
(sips)

114
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,175
(softly gasps)

115
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,138
This is good.

116
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,104
‐ This can’t be, I’m.

117
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,688
That’s impossible!

118
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,491
Oh.

119
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,118
You didn’t happen to be there
watching for a while were you?

120
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,411
‐ Uh, yeah, pretty much.

121
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,327
U‐Um, Miss Miina,
about Mister Mike.

122
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,465
(gasps)

123
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,211
‐ It’s, It’s not what you think!

124
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,383
This is the first
time I’ve met a

125
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,672
relative and I’m
just on cloud nine.

126
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,554
See, I had a lot going on,

127
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,762
and I haven’t had a lot of
happy things happen to me.

128
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,386
Well, it is true that
I think Mike is a

129
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,222
rather dependable guy,
and I’ve got to admit,

130
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,228
I was really surprised when
he showed up in my dreams,

131
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,902
but it’s not at all
what it sounds like!

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,730
It’s nothing like that at all.

133
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,227
‐ There’s a chance Mister
Mike may be your relative.

134
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,149
‐ Yeah, that’s right.

135
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,776
‐ But, then again, he
might be just a stranger.

136
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,986
‐ Uh.

137
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,703
‐ Miss Miina, if Mister
Mike was a stranger,

138
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,624
what would you do?

139
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,704
‐ Oh, well, I don’t know.

140
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,327
‐ Your mind is set, isn’t it?

141
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,036
‐ I haven’t even
thought about it!

142
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,957
‐ But if we are strangers,
we’re gonna have

143
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,298
to leave this house right away.

144
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,594
(spring bouncing)

145
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,796
‐ I get it.

146
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,598
Our conversations
aren’t meshing.

147
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,759
‐ What isn’t meshing?

148
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,849
(doorbell ringing)

149
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,602
(gasping)

150
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,602
‐ Coming!

151
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,605
‐ I’ll get that.

152
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,857
Wait a second, what
are you guys doing?

153
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,610
‐ Well, uh.

154
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,111
‐ A secret meeting.

155
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,533
(doorbell ringing)

156
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,322
‐ Hello there,
who’s at the door?

157
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,537
‐ It’s Senpai.

158
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,700
‐ Kamishiro, can I come in?

159
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,289
(cicadas singing)
(bell chiming)

160
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,421
Kamishiro, the promise we
made about those club budgets

161
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,716
was that you would have
them done last week.

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,720
I remember we were
really clear about that.

163
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,973
So I was wondering if something
might be wrong with you.

164
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,852
‐ I’m sorry, my paid job
has got me kind of busy.

165
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,689
Is there any way at
all it could wait?

166
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,483
I could have it Monday evening.

167
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,896
‐ That’s fine, I really
don’t mind waiting.

168
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,984
‐ That’s a big help.

169
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,898
‐ Uh, who?

170
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,701
‐ Hm.

171
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,663
‐ Oh, I’m so sorry.

172
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,371
My name is Tsubaki Oribe,

173
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,621
and I’m one year
ahead of Kamishiro.

174
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,992
So are you getting accustomed to

175
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,158
life here, Miss Miina Miyafuji?

176
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,579
‐ Hey, wait a second,
how do you know my name?

177
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,668
‐ [Tsubaki] Our student
body president has

178
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,462
an amazing information network.

179
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,297
It’s a secret as to why
it’s so amazing, though.

180
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,256
‐ I’d really appreciate
it if you would

181
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,354
tell President Morino
to take it easy on me.

182
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,472
(laughs)

183
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,887
‐ Okay, Mike, I’ll tell her.

184
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,137
‐ Excuse me, can I assume you’re

185
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,187
done with your business here?

186
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,361
‐ Yes.

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,360
‐ Good, ’cause Mike has
a lot of work to do.

188
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,363
‐ So it’s just Mike is it?

189
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,105
‐ Hey, it’s all right because
Mike and I are relatives.

190
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:51,947
Right?

191
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,202
‐ Not so close!

192
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,084
‐ It’s all right, if you
really are his relative.

193
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,287
But there’s a chance that
you’re just a stranger.

194
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,673
And if you’re just a
stranger, then Miss Miyafuji,

195
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,501
it seems that all
you’re doing is unfairly

196
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,297
imposing yourself
onto Kamishiro.

197
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,460
‐ Oh.

198
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,218
That’s, that’s
really not the case!

199
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,222
‐ So you say.

200
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,390
‐ Anyway, if you’re
through her then‐‐

201
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,723
‐ Um, I thought everyone
might be a little thirsty.

202
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,398
‐ Oh, don’t mind me, but
since you so kindly offered,

203
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,610
I’ll be happy to
have some, I guess.

204
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,902
(groans softly)

205
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,115
‐ Oh, sure, of course.

206
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,195
There really isn’t
very much to it.

207
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,951
‐ Is something wrong
with your neck?

208
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,835
(gasps)

209
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,830
‐ That’s something you really
shouldn’t ask me about.

210
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,583
Miss Miina, your face
looks very scary.

211
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,077
‐ Well, I was born this way!

212
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,747
‐ Oh, I see, I’m sorry.

213
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,421
‐ What the heck are they doing?

214
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,257
‐ That’s delicious.

215
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,892
Wow, what’s the source
of this mineral water?

216
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,259
‐ It’s nothing but
plain tap water.

217
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,218
‐ That’s right,
’cause we’re poor.

218
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,097
‐ Yeah, ever since
you two moved in.

219
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,936
(dinging)
‐ Uh.

220
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,191
‐ Wait, Kamishiro,
that’s just not

221
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,191
something that you say
to a potential relative.

222
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,074
Well, maybe they’re
strangers after all.

223
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,283
(groans)

224
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,704
‐ U‐Um, I know, how about
something nice to snack on?

225
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,040
I’ve already eaten a bit of it,

226
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,659
but would you like to try some?

227
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,947
‐ [Tsubaki] Oh, Prech?

228
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,958
‐ Yes, it’s an old
favorite of mine.

229
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,083
(whining)

230
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,668
Uh, Little Wonder!

231
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,463
‐ Where did this
thing come from?

232
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,758
It’s so cute!

233
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,801
‐ Yeah, he sure is.

234
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,144
‐ How is it you’re
so familiar with it?

235
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,432
This is strange, in fact,
this is really strange!

236
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,525
‐ Oh, come on, you
don’t know about it?

237
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,653
This little thing appears all
the time around this area.

238
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,109
‐ Don’t make it sound so simple.

239
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,019
‐ Well I’d expect nothing less

240
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,570
from a place that
had a big UFO craze!

241
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,952
‐ I’ve heard that everyone
at school calls it "Marie."

242
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,240
‐ So it’s Mister Marie.

243
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,084
(whining)

244
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,039
‐ Oh, it reacted!

245
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,161
‐ This is absurd,
don’t you think so?

246
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,787
‐ Oh, I don’t know.

247
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,794
‐ It’s holding a floater!

248
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,916
‐ Yeah, so what,
it’s still cute.

249
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,593
‐ But it’s eating Prech!

250
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,461
‐ He must be an omnivore.

251
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,378
‐ A what?

252
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,338
Oh, no, I gotta work!

253
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,258
‐ Kamishiro, I’m fine, you
don’t have to worry about me.

254
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,978
‐ But first I’ve gotta deal
with this strange thing.

255
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,189
‐ But, Mike, you’re
gonna miss your deadline.

256
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,361
‐ Yeah, I know that.

257
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,034
(whining)

258
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,779
Don’t wave at me!

259
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,701
Dammit.

260
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,158
(cicadas singing)

261
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,201
‐ I guess Mike has
gone back to work.

262
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,908
‐ I suppose that means
you’ll be going home now/

263
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,709
‐ Oh my, I’d nearly forgotten.

264
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,383
When my mother heard I was
coming here to visit Kamishiro,

265
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,882
she insisted that I bring
these buckwheat noodles.

266
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,095
‐ Oh, I see.

267
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,925
Thank you, that’s very nice.

268
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,380
Well, then.

269
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,509
‐ She also wanted the noodles
cooked in a special way.

270
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,346
(sighs)

271
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,470
‐ She planned this.

272
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,056
‐ What was that?

273
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,271
‐ Oh, nothing.

274
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,475
‐ Miss Miina, isn’t that nice?

275
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,062
It’s a free lunch!

276
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,059
(laughs)

277
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:12,858
‐ So it is.

278
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,071
(typing)

279
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,570
‐ Man, I only have
one hour left.

280
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,030
But what’s goin’ on downstairs?

281
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,994
(phone ringing)

282
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,995
What now, another bad day?

283
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,201
Yeah, hello, Kamishiro here.

284
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,999
Wait a minute, are you possibly?

285
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,095
(crunching)

286
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,382
(whining)

287
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,802
(playful music)

288
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:45,886
‐ Hm.

289
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,478
Miss Morino, is that
you standing there?

290
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,449
‐ Oh, hi, Miss Kazami.

291
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,951
‐ What are you doing here,
and what’s with the telescope?

292
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,538
‐ Just doing some bird watching.

293
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,790
‐ [Kazami] Ah.

294
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,132
Hold on, that’s a lie, right?

295
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,839
‐ [Morino] Yes, of course.

296
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,511
(cicadas singing)

297
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,138
‐ Thank you, we’ll gladly
take all these noodles,

298
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,602
but I really insist on
doing all the cooking.

299
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,391
‐ You know, I was
taught a really tasty
way of cooking them.

300
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,645
‐ Are you trying to imply
that my cooking is awful?

301
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,899
‐ Oh, are you good at cooking?

302
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,691
‐ Not to brag or
anything, but Mike

303
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,146
ate my cooking yesterday
and the day before,

304
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,775
and he said it was tasty!

305
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,492
‐ Oh, is that so?

306
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,702
‐ Lose the "I wasn’t
expecting that" look.

307
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,325
‐ Well, you don’t
have to get so mad.

308
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,082
It’s almost as if you were
kinda jealous or something.

309
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,623
‐ Well, even if
that was the case,

310
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,826
what’d be the big deal anyway?

311
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,036
‐ There’s a chance you
might be his relative,

312
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,919
wouldn’t that make this a
dangerous train of thought?

313
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,175
‐ It’s all right.

314
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,258
There’s also a chance
we could be strangers.

315
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,552
‐ Well, it wouldn’t
be right for you

316
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,926
to live in this
house as a stranger.

317
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,222
‐ It’s just as likely
we’re relatives.

318
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,178
‐ Which way would you prefer?

319
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,806
‐ Before I answer that,
why don’t you tell me

320
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,353
which way you would
prefer, Senpai?

321
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,857
‐ Well, who really knows?

322
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,649
‐ It’s obvious that this
is getting us nowhere

323
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,613
so why don’t we just split
the noodles in half, okay?

324
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,904
(electric shocking)

325
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,859
‐ [Tsubaki] Sure, that’s fine.

326
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,028
Do you have a pot
that I can use?

327
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,870
‐ All we have is that
little one there.

328
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,754
‐ Well, I only need to
make enough for one.

329
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,214
‐ Um, ’scuse me.

330
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,038
‐ What?
‐ What is it?

331
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,008
(roaring)

332
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,049
‐ Nyu.

333
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,471
Nyu.

334
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,379
Nyu.

335
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,549
‐ Hey, come on, hey.

336
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,218
Haruko, I can come
with you, right?

337
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,767
I mean, that’s okay with you?

338
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,022
‐ Sorry, Matagu.

339
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,562
I’m going to a friend’s
house today, so nope!

340
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,069
‐ Why don’t you have dipping
sauce for the noodles?

341
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,689
‐ Maybe because we’re poor.

342
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,067
‐ [Matagu] Come on,
don’t be so stubborn.

343
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,073
‐ [Haruko] No means no!

344
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,491
(groans)

345
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,985
(knocks softly)

346
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,327
‐ Um, uh.

347
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,542
‐ [Mike] Who is it?

348
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,661
‐ It’s Karen, may
I please come in?

349
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,288
‐ Sure, good timing anyway.

350
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,128
Karen, I.

351
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,462
‐ Um, see.

352
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,336
Oh, Mister Mike, your
Senpai and Miss Miina

353
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,133
are cooking your noodles
in a very worrisome way!

354
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,100
I see auras of a
tiger and a lion!

355
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,429
‐ What are you talkin’ about?

356
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,926
‐ I’m telling you, it’s
a tiger and a lion.

357
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,016
‐ There aren’t any lions
or tigers around here.

358
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,102
‐ I suppose that’s true, but.

359
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,939
‐ Look, just calm down a bit.

360
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,402
I wanna talk to you.

361
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,862
Why don’t you sit
down over here.

362
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,822
‐ Okay, excuse me.

363
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,987
(chair squeaking)

364
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,164
‐ Now, you know, Karen,
you called and gave the

365
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,244
telephone number to your,
uh, what do you call them?

366
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,748
Oh yeah, to your foster
parents, is that right?

367
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,291
‐ Yes, I found a pay
phone yesterday and

368
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,627
called my uncle and
told him where I was and

369
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,802
then I gave him the phone
number for this house.

370
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,881
Was that a bad thing?

371
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,546
‐ Karen, he called.

372
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,974
(gasps)

373
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,302
I said that your uncle
called the house.

374
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,968
‐ [Karen] Are you
sure it was my uncle?

375
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,477
‐ Yeah.

376
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,401
He said he wanted to talk
to me, so I took the call.

377
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,899
‐ Mm.

378
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,270
‐ [Mike] I heard the basic
gist of things from him.

379
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,477
Your uncle’s company
is in trouble, right?

380
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,532
(laughs)

381
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,066
‐ Don’t you hate recession?

382
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,117
‐ Yeah, really.

383
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,709
So I finally understand
why you came here

384
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,791
mid‐semester despite
the fact that you

385
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,345
had attended a private
all‐girls school.

386
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,132
‐ I should have
told you, I’m sorry.

387
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,345
‐ [Mike] There’s no
need to apologize.

388
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,757
‐ But.

389
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,643
‐ Look, I don’t
think that your uncle

390
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,010
told you everything
he should have.

391
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,388
This is a lousy
way of putting it,

392
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
but your uncle has
gotten into trouble

393
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,605
trying to keep his
company afloat.

394
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,941
Apparently he sent you
here because he was afraid

395
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,607
that his troubles might
become your troubles, too.

396
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,200
‐ I thought it had to be,
or something like that.

397
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,035
See, my uncle always
said it was too dangerous

398
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,711
for me to travel too far
from home all by myself.

399
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,502
He said I walked
around in a daze.

400
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,996
(laughs)

401
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,048
But then he changed his mind
and let me come, so I did.

402
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,098
‐ [Mike] He told me that
he was leaving home and

403
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,642
that he trusted me with you.

404
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,808
He also said he would do
whatever he could to‐‐

405
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,523
‐ [Karen] Mister Mike, my uncle.

406
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,192
‐ Don’t worry yourself, Karen.

407
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,074
He said to tell you
that he was all right.

408
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,361
‐ I understand.

409
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,744
‐ [Mike] But he also
said that he might

410
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,492
not be able to
call here anymore.

411
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,116
‐ But why?

412
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,754
He can’t.

413
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,750
‐ One more thing.

414
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,787
He said sorry.

415
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,464
‐ I don’t believe it.

416
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,666
Uncle’s gone.

417
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,049
(sobbing)

418
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,811
(piano playing)

419
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,609
‐ Your uncle, was he a kind man?

420
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,948
I’m sure this isn’t very
convincing, but it’s all right.

421
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,150
It’ll be all right.

422
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,282
You can stay right here.

423
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,794
It’s all right for you to stay.

424
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,673
‐ Yeah, but, what
if we’re strangers?

425
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,580
There’s still that chance.

426
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,587
‐ Yeah, well, I suppose
that’s true, but.

427
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,965
You and I have the
same eye color, Karen,

428
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,096
so it’s all right.

429
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,969
It’s all right for
you to stay here.

430
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,686
(sobbing)

431
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,778
I won’t, I won’t abandon you.

432
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:14,993
Never.

433
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,497
‐ Mike.

434
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,621
‐ Kamishiro.

435
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,671
‐ Uh.

436
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,001
(crashing)

437
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,261
‐ Wha?

438
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,339
‐ What is going on here?

439
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,586
‐ Yeah, I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

440
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,007
You didn’t knock first and
then you dropped all the food.

441
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,807
‐ What do you expect?

442
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,969
(moaning)

443
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,017
(shouting)

444
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,062
(sniffling)
‐ I’m sorry.

445
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,018
Oh!

446
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,904
Nyu!

447
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,225
(steam releasing)

448
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,190
‐ Huh, hey!

449
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,527
‐ Kamishiro.
(dramatic music)

450
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,325
‐ What were you two doing?

451
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,908
‐ Wait, you gotta
let me explain this!

452
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,374
‐ Yeah, she was crying.

453
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,325
‐ You didn’t force her.

454
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,536
‐ Now. wait, would you just
listen to me for a second?

455
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,377
Senpai!

456
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,381
Miina!

457
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,594
(gasps)

458
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,674
‐ I can’t believe it!

459
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,586
I can’t believe that you of all

460
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,126
people would do such a thing!

461
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,047
‐ I feel so stupid that I
ever thought highly of you!

462
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,718
‐ [Mike] Would somebody
please listen to me!

463
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,229
‐ (together) No!

464
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,901
(cicadas singing)

465
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,729
‐ Kamishiro, you’re wonderful.

466
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,442
(laughs)

467
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,437
(groans)

468
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,739
(humming)

469
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,827
(cicadas singing)

470
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,249
(splashing)

471
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,413
‐ Boy, I really
was surprised about

472
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,210
what happened this afternoon.

473
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,922
But then when I
really think about it,

474
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,752
there just couldn’t be
something like that going on.

475
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,298
‐ No, of course there couldn’t.

476
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,263
‐ That’s so true.

477
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,131
‐ Uh.

478
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,222
(splashing)

479
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,015
‐ Hey, cheer up, okay?

480
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,518
‐ Sure.

481
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
‐ I think it’s a good thing
Mike’s letting you stay.

482
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,438
‐ Yeah.

483
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,602
(splashing)

484
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,980
‐ Well, I guess the
same goes for me.

485
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,898
‐ Miss Miina, there’s
a chance Mister Mike

486
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,446
might be a relative, right?

487
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,237
‐ Could be, for one of us.

488
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,165
(piano playing)

489
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,445
‐ So he might be a stranger.

490
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,785
(laughs)

491
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,456
‐ Oh, is that you, Miss Kikuchi?

492
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,464
It’s Mike Kamishiro.

493
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,216
Um, about the data I was
supposed to send today,

494
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,179
can it wait until
tomorrow morning?

495
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,257
No, I’ve been really
doing my best trying

496
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,426
to get it done for
you, but there’s this

497
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,645
one part I’m having a
little trouble with.

498
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,023
I am working hard on it!

499
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,015
And, no, I am not goofing off!

500
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,977
Look, you are the one who...

501
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,476
[Mike Voiceover] We might be.

502
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,856
[Miina Voiceover] Relatives.

503
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,818
[Mike Voiceover] But.

504
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,237
[Karen Voiceover] We
might be strangers.

505

520
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,251
(playful music)

521
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,923
‐ Miss Miina, you
know that you and I

522
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,923
can’t keep relying on
Mister Mike forever.

523
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,263
‐ Oh, look at this magazine
with part‐time job listings

524
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,840
The school that Mike goes
to has a part‐time opening!

525
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,046
‐ But you don’t qualify.

526
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,755
They’re looking for
people who are over 18.

527
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,597
‐ Don’t worry,
I’ll be all right!

528
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,890
‐ [Karen] Where does all
that confidence come from?

529
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,064
‐ [Miina] Wait, what
do you mean by that?

530
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,022
‐ [Karen] Oh,
nothing, nevermind.

531
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,692
