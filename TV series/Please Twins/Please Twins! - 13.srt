1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,101
(bird chirping)

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,525
‐ [Man] What are
you doing Karen?

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,490
‐ Just laying here with you.

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,788
It’s perfectly alright
because we’re twins.

5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,540
I don’t understand why
you still act so distant.

6
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,377
After all, it’s
already been two weeks

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,212
since we found out
we were related.

8
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,969
‐ Not already, but
only two weeks.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,890
‐ By the way, when
do you think we’ll be

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,760
able to start taking
baths together?

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,387
‐ What are you talking about?

12
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,065
That just isn’t normal.

13
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,231
Are there any brothers and
sisters who actually do that?

14
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,062
Have you even seen it on TV?

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,395
‐ FCC regulations keep
that stuff off of TV.

16
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,066
Okay, how about a wake up kiss?

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,065
‐ No.

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,237
‐ If you won’t,

19
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,867
then I guess I’ll just have
to intrude on your bath.

20
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,582
‐ You know, your
personality has changed.

21
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,503
‐ That’s because I wanna be
pampered by my big brother.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,330
‐ Oh brother.

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,167
Miina.

24
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,878
‐ You two sure seem
to get along well.

25
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,837
‐ Well we are twins you know.

26
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,297
‐ Oh yeah?

27
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,969
Well even twins have their
limits, you know what I mean?

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,767
‐ What are you
yelling at me for?

29
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,979
‐ Because you give
her the opportunity!

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,351
‐ So it’s my fault?

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
I’m sorry.

32
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,283
‐ You can’t get into
that mood you guys!

33
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,414
Big brother is my big
brother and mine alone!

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,699
(man yells)

35
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,622
‐ [Man] Hey!

36
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,122
‐ Big brother!
‐ Wait!

37
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,413
‐ Karen, wait a sec.
‐ Karen?

38
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,704
‐ Hey!
‐ Get off of me!

39
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,407
‐ [Girl] Watch where
you’re touching him!

40
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,286
‐ [Man] Hey!

41
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,922
(upbeat music)

42
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,563
‐ I see.

43
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,653
In other words Mike.

44
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,269
(long beep)

45
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,227
‐ Meow!

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:53,983
Meow.

47
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,897
Meow!

48
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,073
Meow, meow, meow.

49
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,543
‐ That’s how it is
with Karen right now,

50
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,409
and it’s started to affect
your ability to do your work?

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,707
‐ Yeah.

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,080
You pretty much got
it all down Kousei.

53
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,919
‐ You’ve still got
tons of problems,

54
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,593
even though you’ve figured
out who your relative is.

55
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,877
You’ve got a lot
going on Kamishiro.

56
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,087
‐ That’s true.

57
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,928
Karen’s really
happy about all this

58
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,893
and I understand how she feels.

59
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,605
I’m pretty happy about
finding a relative

60
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,393
that I never thought
I’d meet too,

61
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,267
but you guys know
that we have to

62
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,767
make our own living, right?

63
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,863
Well, if I can work as much as
I can during summer vacation,

64
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,784
it’ll be easier on us later.

65
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,075
‐ Alright then.

66
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,696
We’ll just have to do
something about that.

67
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,953
‐ What?

68
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,624
‐ Just leave it to us.

69
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,452
(birds chirping)

70
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,845
(girls yelling and giggling)

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,961
‐ Hey, wait!

72
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,338
‐ So I found all
the ingredients and

73
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,805
made a very special dish,

74
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,143
just for my big brother
and he loved it.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,470
‐ Cool!

76
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,725
‐ [Boy] I’m jealous.

77
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,605
‐ And I also get
to scrub down his

78
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,221
back in the bath, you know.

79
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,308
‐ Wow!

80
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,062
‐ [Boy] I’m really jealous!

81
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,154
‐ And at night, we sleep
together in the very same bed.

82
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,652
‐ Amazing!

83
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,152
‐ [Boy] It’s just too much!

84
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,324
I can’t resist it anymore!

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,242
‐ [Girls] Resist what?

86
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,071
‐ You know, stuff.

87
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,486
‐ [Woman] Karen’s
clinging all over

88
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,077
Kamishiro every day then?

89
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,171
‐ I understand that
Karen is happy now,

90
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,171
but it’s affecting
Mike’s ability to work

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,172
so I thought something
needed to be done.

92
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,762
‐ Is that all?

93
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,051
‐ Is what all?

94
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,139
‐ Well let’s see,

95
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,009
Karen is clinging
all over Kamishiro,

96
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,597
and so you haven’t
asked him out yet.

97
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,852
Let’s face it,

98
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,063
isn’t that why you’re
getting irritated Miina?

99
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,568
‐ That may be right.

100
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,111
‐ Well you need to hurry
up and ask him out.

101
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,533
You should go for it.

102
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,116
‐ [Girl] What if
I don’t know how?

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,634
‐ Wow!

104
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,838
This is great!

105
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,171
It’s got all the basics.

106
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,127
I could absolutely get
all of my work done here.

107
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,758
‐ [Girl] You’d get worried
about Miss Miyafuji

108
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,717
and Miss Onodera if you
were too far away, right?

109
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,427
That’s why I set it up
relatively close to your house,

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,100
and it won’t cost you any
money because it’s a tent.

111
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,019
‐ You guys are lifesavers.

112
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,516
‐ Of course,

113
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,688
I was the one who got all
the equipment together.

114
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,896
‐ Thanks Shimazaki.

115
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:43,898
I owe you one.

116
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,116
‐ [Girl] I’m worried.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,530
Mike is late.

118
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,447
‐ [Girl] Maybe he’s
just really busy.

119
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,987
‐ Then I have to
make sure to soothe

120
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,788
and comfort him
when he gets back.

121
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,004
‐ Karen, you’re making
too big a fuss over Mike.

122
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,543
‐ You think so?

123
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,587
‐ I do.

124
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,462
I’m holding back the urge to
fawn all over him too you know.

125
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,013
‐ You can’t!

126
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,262
The only one who
can hang all over

127
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,675
my big brother is
me, his sister!

128
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,103
‐ Yeah, yeah, so you said.

129
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,272
Geez, I guess you’ve
forgotten all about

130
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,101
the rules of the love alliance.

131
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,812
‐ Rule number three,

132
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,649
the relative will
support the other’s

133
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,364
romantic relationship
with Mr. Mike.

134
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,613
You see, I still
remember that Miss Miina.

135
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,526
‐ Well then?

136
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,948
‐ But Miss Miina,
don’t you remember?

137
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,953
We disbanded the love alliance.

138
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,906
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
Someone who I’d thought

139
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,537
was a friend yesterday is
now acting more like a foe,

140
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,715
or rather like a
wicked mother in law.

141
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,634
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Big
brother is my big brother

142
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,674
and mine alone and that’s that!

143
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,798
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
It’s me who can be

144
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,884
romantically involved with Mike.

145
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,138
‐ [Karen Voiceover] Oh yeah?

146
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,639
Well it’s up to him to
answer to your feelings

147
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,892
or not Miss Miina, and not me.

148
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,433
‐ [Miina Voiceover]
You just said something

149
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,386
you shouldn’t have.

150
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,635
(doorbell rings)

151
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,938
‐ It’s Mike!
‐ Big brother!

152
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,310
‐ [Girls] Hi, welcome back!

153
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,654
‐ I’ve got some information that

154
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,485
I’m sure you two will
find very interesting.

155
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,661
(girl laughs evilly)

156
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,325
(boy yawns)

157
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,708
‐ I got a lot of
stuff done yesterday.

158
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,835
If I can just finish
that module today.

159
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,301
What?

160
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,895
When did this get here?

161
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,722
‐ Hooray!

162
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,636
It’s up, it’s up!

163
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,852
The tent is up!

164
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,643
My little tent is
up and standing!

165
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,645
Isn’t it great?

166
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,886
‐ I’m so hard.

167
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,229
‐ You’re kidding, but why?

168
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,685
‐ [Man] Alright, it’s done!

169
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,566
‐ [Boy] Magumo senpai?

170
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,902
‐ Oh!

171
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,857
Hey Kamishiro.

172
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,694
‐ Hey, good morning Mike.

173
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,609
‐ [Woman] Oh Mr. Kamishiro!

174
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,698
‐ [Boy] Miss Kazami.

175
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,334
‐ Mike!

176
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,410
Big brother!

177
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,208
‐ Wait, you guys too?

178
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,829
‐ Morning Mike.

179
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,415
‐ [Boy] Shimazaki?

180
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,210
‐ I don’t get all this senpai.

181
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,635
What’s going on?

182
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,713
‐ I’m really sorry Kamishiro.

183
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,798
I just don’t know how it
could’ve happened but,

184
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,394
somehow that person
found out about this.

185
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,221
‐ That person?

186
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,815
‐ [Girl] Now, let’s start
the fun little summer camp

187
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,391
sponsored by the
student council.

188
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,727
(girl laughs evilly)

189
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,234
‐ Sorry I’m late!

190
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,192
Hey, what’s wrong with him?

191
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,107
‐ It’s nothing really.

192
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,317
(girl laughs evilly)

193
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,249
(couple giggling)

194
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,499
(upbeat guitar music)

195
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,886
‐ [Mike Voiceover] What was I
doing kicking back like that?

196
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,275
I got a lot of work to do, work!

197
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,856
‐ He’s hold up in
there big time.

198
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,862
‐ I’m just gonna
go check up on him.

199
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,652
‐ Karen, don’t bother him now.

200
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,777
‐ But Miss Miina,

201
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,033
you were playing with him until

202
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,866
just a few minutes ago yourself.

203
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,531
‐ I know, that’s true.

204
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,039
‐ Now, now, why
don’t we just leave

205
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,583
him alone for a little while.

206
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,714
‐ Okay.

207
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,554
‐ Alright everybody,

208
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,012
you’re free now to
do what you want.

209
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,631
I suggest that you
work hard to make

210
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,758
wonderful memories this summer.

211
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,887
(girl laughs evilly)

212
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,894
‐ That was a pretty
suggestive announcement.

213
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,687
‐ I was planning on doing
that from the very start.

214
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,770
‐ Yosuke, you’re so
silly, you know that?

215
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,438
‐ Madam President,
is it really alright?

216
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,607
‐ Yes.

217
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,065
‐ However, as a student
council President.

218
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,535
‐ Subaki, if you’re going to
be all worried about Kamishiro,

219
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,994
then you should spend
more time with Shimazaki.

220
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,041
(girl laughs evilly)

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,250
‐ [Boy] Come on Kaede.

222
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,328
(girl giggles)

223
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,576
(boy giggles)

224
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,748
‐ Hey Haruko, let’s
head back to our tent.

225
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,666
‐ What about Mike?

226
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,255
‐ But Mike, big brother.

227
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,012
‐ [Girl] It’s alright.

228
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,262
‐ Shall we Miss Kazami?

229
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,765
‐ [Girl] Yes, let’s.

230
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,676
‐ [Girl] Let’s go Kousei.

231
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,015
‐ [Boy] Subaki.

232
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,939
‐ [Girl] Koishi,
you can go visit

233
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,110
Mr. Himaru right now you know.

234
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,441
‐ [Woman] What are
you talking about?

235
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,864
I know you’d be
lonely by yourself.

236
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,613
(girl chuckles)

237
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,954
(girls giggling)

238
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,657
‐ My big brother.

239
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,619
‐ Are you gonna keep
whining about that Karen?

240
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,168
‐ Miina, Karen, I almost
forgot, have you heard?

241
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,504
‐ Heard what?

242
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,048
‐ Well I heard that
there’s a ghost out here

243
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,512
that appears every night.

244
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,934
‐ What?

245
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,181
‐ There’s a ghost?

246
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,183
‐ I wonder if
everybody out there

247
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,850
is going at it right about now?

248
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,268
‐ We’ll find out later.

249
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,151
Oh nothing at all.

250
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,322
(girl laughs evilly)

251
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,569
‐ [Boy] Miss Kazami.

252
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,195
‐ Yes Kei?

253
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,744
Let’s make a memory, shall we?

254
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,959
‐ Yeah.

255
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,252
‐ Now!

256
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,845
Study, study, study!

257
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,843
Go to Tokyo University!

258
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,585
(boy laughs)

259
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,505
‐ [Girl Voiceover] Good
memory of the summer, huh?

260
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,893
‐ I won’t try anything.

261
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,190
I give you my word.

262
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,069
Trust me, please.

263
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,322
‐ Hey, Kousei.

264
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,201
You’ve gotta understand,

265
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,029
it’s not that I’m afraid
of being touched by a man,

266
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,198
but since it’s my first time,

267
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,079
I want it to be a
wonderful memory.

268
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,504
A memory I could carry
my whole life, you see?

269
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,169
Would you be gentle with me?

270
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,048
‐ Subaki.

271
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,764
Yeah, I promise.

272
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,385
I promise.

273
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,889
‐ Then it’ll latch
on to a guy and

274
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,807
won’t let go no matter what.

275
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,226
After that, it just sucks
the life out of the guy.

276
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,318
‐ Oh my!

277
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,481
‐ What is the ghost like?

278
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,688
Is it horrid looking?

279
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,241
‐ I’d heard that
she’s really pretty

280
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,412
with long flowing hair, a
beautiful face, and glasses.

281
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,704
I also heard that
her skin is so white

282
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,156
it’s practically
transparent and that

283
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,326
her build is slender yet
she’s really got big boobs.

284
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,097
‐ A gorgeous older
woman with glasses!

285
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,683
‐ Oh yeah, for some
reason she only goes after

286
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,307
younger boys who
are the loser type.

287
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,096
(boy yells)

288
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,268
Oh no, Karen!

289
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,939
‐ [Girl] That voice.

290
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,275
‐ Hyosuke, I heard
a strange voice.

291
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,533
‐ [Boy] I’m sure
it’s just Matagu

292
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,072
making a big fuss again
’cause he’s lonesome.

293
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,987
(couple giggling)

294
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,292
‐ No, don’t.

295
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,332
‐ [Girl] But it’s
dangerous Miina.

296
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,038
‐ I’m just gonna go
look around the area.

297
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,706
Please take care of Karen.

298
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,176
(girl yells)

299
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,136
Mike!

300
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:15,893
‐ Sorry.

301
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,805
Did I frighten you?

302
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,480
‐ No, I’m alright.

303
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,062
Did you hear that strange
voice a few minutes ago?

304
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,518
‐ Yeah.

305
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,109
I got worried and went to
look around for a little bit,

306
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,993
but I didn’t see
anything out there.

307
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,822
You know, I’m sure
it’s just Shidou senpai

308
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,116
making a fuss again.

309
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,157
‐ Okay.

310
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,125
I got it.

311
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,919
I guess that means you’re
going back to work, right?

312
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,755
Okay.

313
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,969
‐ Miina!

314
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,719
You wanna have some
coffee with me?

315
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,049
‐ Really?

316
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,259
‐ For the moment,
work has settled down.

317
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,807
I’m taking a break right now.

318
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,933
‐ Then I’d be
happy to come over.

319
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,242
‐ [Girl] I’ve been able
to get a lot of fun shots,

320
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,787
but the climax
has yet to happen.

321
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,999
(girl laughs evilly)

322
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,538
‐ [Mike] How’s Karen doing?

323
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,499
‐ When she heard that scream,

324
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,208
she had one of her
fainting spells.

325
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,048
‐ [Mike] Uh oh, is she alright?

326
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,345
‐ Haruko is staying
with her right now.

327
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,298
‐ [Mike] Okay.

328
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,598
Then it’ll be alright.

329
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,888
‐ Worried about
your little sister?

330
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,655
‐ [Mike] Don’t put it that way.

331
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,730
I’m just worried in
general, you know?

332
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,072
‐ Sorry.

333
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,863
I didn’t mean it
to sound that way.

334
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,453
I have so many other things
that I wanna say to you Mike.

335
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,294
You know, it’s
probably inappropriate,

336
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,588
but I’m really
thankful there was

337
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,919
all that commotion earlier.

338
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,705
‐ [Mike] Why is that?

339
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,087
‐ Because it gave
me the chance to

340
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,045
finally be alone here
with you tonight.

341
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,603
‐ [Mike] Miina, we
live in the same house.

342
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,059
‐ That’s not it.

343
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,259
You see Mike,

344
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,558
there’s something that I really

345
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,771
wanna tell you, and just you.

346
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,608
(slow piano music)

347
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,776
I decided a long time ago,

348
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,116
and I’m prepared to
take the consequences.

349
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,410
The only thing left is to
tell you how I really feel!

350
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,457
‐ [Mike] You can’t!

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
‐ And why not?

352
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,798
‐ ’Cause I’m saying it.

353
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,468
Sorry.

354
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,931
I knew how you were feeling and

355
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,389
I actually know how I feel now,

356
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,139
but I’ve been
really reluctant to

357
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,894
talk about it with you Miina.

358
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,930
‐ But why?

359
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,440
Because Karen’s around?

360
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,980
‐ No.

361
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,484
The thing is Miina,

362
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,475
you and I are living
together in the same house.

363
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,738
If I told you how I felt and we

364
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
ended up in that kind
of a relationship,

365
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,948
I wasn’t sure if I
could hold myself back.

366
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,497
‐ [Miina] Mike.

367
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,344
‐ Are you okay?

368
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,050
‐ Yeah.

369
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,638
Where’s Miss Miina?

370
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,184
‐ She stepped out for awhile.

371
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,189
(girl yells)

372
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,229
‐ [Mike] Hey Miina.

373
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,445
‐ Tell me Mike.

374
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,773
Tell me how you feel.

375
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,740
I won’t regret it.

376
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,030
If it’s with you,

377
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,072
I don’t mind what we
do with each other.

378
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,237
It’s alright.

379
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,949
Tell me, please Mike.

380
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:10,293
‐ Miina I feel like what
I’m trying to say is‐.

381
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,206
‐ No!

382
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,917
Miss Miina!

383
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,546
You can’t do that!

384
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,352
You can’t Miss Miina.

385
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,482
Don’t take my big brother
away from me, please.

386
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,064
Big brother is my big
brother and mine alone.

387
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,648
That’s absolutely,
definitely how it is.

388
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,483
‐ But why Karen?

389
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,147
Why can’t I be with him?

390
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,566
You don’t think we’d
make a good couple?

391
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,775
Do you hate me now?

392
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,066
I just don’t understand.

393
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,909
‐ No that’s not it.

394
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,873
See, if you become my
big brother’s girlfriend,

395
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,584
he’ll cherish you
over everyone else

396
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,084
and he’ll even
forget about the fact

397
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,287
that he has a little sister.

398
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,798
His girlfriend will be the
nearest and dearest to him

399
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,920
and all family will
come a distant second.

400
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,877
I couldn’t take that.

401
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,851
‐ Karen, do you honestly
think that would happen?

402
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,520
‐ And is that the
reason why you’ve

403
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,979
been so clingy to me lately?

404
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,227
‐ Idiot.

405
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,149
‐ [Mike] Yep.

406
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,113
You’re an idiot.

407
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,953
You know Karen, both my
family and my girlfriend

408
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,660
are dear to me at the same time.

409
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,452
More than one thing can
be dear to my heart.

410
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,196
Understand Karen?

411
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,871
‐ Karen, Mike is a big brother
to you and you alone but,

412
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,787
if you can, could you maybe
make him our Mike too?

413
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,883
The three of us are one when
we’re all together, right?

414
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,545
You were the one who said that.

415
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,467
‐ I’m so sorry Miss Miina.

416
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,137
Please forgive me, but I
was so worried Miss Miina.

417
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,146
I was really, really worried.

418
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,599
I’m sorry!

419
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,558
Miss Miina!

420
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,820
(man yells)

421
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,243
‐ Hot, hot, hot!

422
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,903
(girls yell)

423
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,857
‐ Mr. Mike!

424
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,571
‐ What is it?

425
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,658
‐ What’s going on?

426
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,790
‐ Miss Miyafuji,
your attire is...

427
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,752
(girl yells)

428
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,838
‐ Is there something
wrong, well Mr. Kamishiro?

429
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,389
‐ I think that was a great
punch line Kamishiro.

430
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,185
(girl laughs evilly)

431
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,808
‐ President Morino, why
do you have a camera?

432
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,314
What are you photographing?

433
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,686
‐ [Girl] Everything that
you guys have been doing.

434
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,655
‐ No way.

435
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,863
‐ Wait, that means.

436
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,784
(girl laughs evilly)

437
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,612
‐ A wonderful summer memory.

438
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,083
‐ [Mike] Madame President?

439
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,702
‐ [Karen] What’s
the matter with her?

440
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,706
‐ What the?

441
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,210
‐ What just happened?

442
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,962
(boy chuckling)

443
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,877
‐ This is just so perfect!

444
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,388
Glasses, all the woman, the
forbidden play of the masochist!

445
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,399
‐ A dramatic photo of the ghost

446
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,608
on the shore of Lake Kazaki has
been revealed to the public.

447
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,192
We have proceeded
with an undercover

448
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,115
investigation to verify
its authenticity.

449
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,066
After overcoming many obstacles,

450
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,906
we are pleased to
be able to introduce

451
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,450
you to a special guest,

452
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,915
the beautiful high
school girl who

453
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,415
managed to capture the
sinister ghost on film

454
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,367
as it was assaulting a
boy, Miss Ichigo Morino.

455
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,588
(girl laughs evilly)

456
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,257
‐ [Group] What a
summer break this is.

457
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,934
(upbeat music)

458
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,893
‐ [Boy] Hey, did you
see that horror special

459
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,774
on TV over summer vacation?

460
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,349
‐ [Boy] Yeah, the one where
our student council President

461
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,936
took a photo of
the ghost, right?

462
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,690
‐ [Girl] I heard that Haruko’s
big brother was the victim.

463
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:28,192
‐ [Girl] Yeah, and I heard that
he’s still in the hospital.

464
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,448
(girl yawns)

465
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,159
‐ I’m so sick of it.

466
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,239
Everyone in town is
talking about it.

467
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,949
‐ What is it Miss Miina?

468
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,036
‐ It’s Mike.

469
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,038
‐ [Karen] Who’s that
girl he’s with I wonder.

470
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,045
‐ [Miina] I don’t know.

471
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,038
I can’t really see her but,

472
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,878
he’s just accepted a letter.

473
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,845
‐ [Karen] No way!

474
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,763
‐ Karen.

475
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,342
‐ Miss Miina.

476
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,887
‐ [Girls] It’s time to
reform the love alliance.

477
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,722
‐ [Miina] Hey!

478
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,886
That’s my Mike!

479
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,476
‐ [Karen] And that’s
my big brother!

480
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,519
‐ [Girls] You better not
lay one finger on him!
