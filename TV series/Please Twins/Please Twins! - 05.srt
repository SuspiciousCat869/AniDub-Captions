1
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,775
(soft whimsical music)

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,520
‐ My dearest uncle, I
know that its been awhile

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,855
but I’m finally writing.

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,898
By the way, this
is Karen Onodera.

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,033
Right now I am happy
and doing well,

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,188
living in Mr. Mike’s house.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,739
Its very nice here.

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,282
During the day, I’ve
spending my time

9
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,665
studying for entrance
exams with Ms. Miina

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,082
so that we can transfer
into the same high school

11
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,703
that Mr. Mike goes to

12
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,038
and then in the afternoon,

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,672
I have a job working at a store

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,249
called Harikawa Groceries

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,206
that’s not too far
from our house.

16
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,626
Of course, Ms. Miina
is with when I work.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,013
I think Mr. Mike might of
taken on too many programming

18
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:54,222
jobs because he looks like
he’s very busy all the time.

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,814
There are so many things
that I’m not used to here

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
and I do make mistakes sometimes

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,395
but please rest assured
that I’m doing my very best.

22
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,271
Uncle, although I am writing
this to you right now,

23
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,029
I don’t think you
will ever receive it

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,529
but I just had to write
something to someone.

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,570
(low electronic music)

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,834
Because from today on,

27
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,424
to the school that
Mr. Mike attends,

28
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,052
the three of us
will go together.

29
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,644
(upbeat electronic music)

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,769
(singing in Japanese)

31
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,684
‐ Well um, uh.

32
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,555
Transfer students.

33
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,435
Try to be nice to them.

34
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,772
‐ I’m Miina MiyaFuji.

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,864
How do you do?

36
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,526
‐ Um, my names Karen Onodera.

37
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,204
(kids shouting and cheering)

38
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,410
‐ Very cute is right.

39
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,825
(low tense music)

40
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,633
‐ Hey, Mike, heck of a
greeting their getting,

41
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,711
isn’t it?

42
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,627
Are you worried?

43
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,424
‐ I’m worried they
might cause problems,

44
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,759
that’s all.

45
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,553
‐ Oh I see.

46
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,717
(bell ringing)

47
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,887
(kids shouting)

48
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,104
‐ Mr. Yamada!

49
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,557
(bell ringing)

50
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,016
‐ Um I uh, hi hi hi.

51
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:49,984
Hey there.

52
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,436
So, where you guys from?

53
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,147
If you need anything, just ask.

54
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,525
I’ll help you out.

55
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,406
‐ You know, my house
is real close to here

56
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,741
so you guys‐‐
‐ Now you guys

57
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,244
leave them alone.

58
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,825
‐ [All] Welcome to our school.

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,330
‐ My name is Akina Sagawawa.

60
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,702
‐ I’m Futaba Mashita.

61
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,748
‐ And I’m Haruko Shidou.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,170
‐ Nice to meet you.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,171
‐ I’m very happy to
meet you as well.

64
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,428
‐ Hey wait, MiyaFuji
and Onodera,

65
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,261
you’re the two girls
who are somehow related

66
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,224
to Mike Kamashiro
over in the next class

67
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,475
aren’t you?

68
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,768
‐ Yeah that’s right.

69
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,351
‐ Wait, how do you
guys know that?

70
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,815
(giggling)

71
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,647
‐ Well the entire school
knows about it by now.

72
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,824
‐ Well then, there’s
something I would like

73
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,981
you to tell us.

74
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,609
It’s about Kamishiro
and Shimazaki.

75
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,034
Do they hang around at home too?

76
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,112
‐ Shimazaki?

77
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,284
‐ What do you mean by that?

78
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,196
‐ I mean the two of
them are always together

79
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,115
and they always seem to be
having such a good time,

80
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,295
you know?

81
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,622
‐ We couldn’t help
fantasizing about them.

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,877
‐ Hey guys, we’re
not fantasizing.

83
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,499
They’re gay!

84
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,628
‐ [Both] No!

85
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,969
‐ No way.

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,470
‐ I don’t get it.

87
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,139
‐ What?

88
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,550
Am I couple with Shimazaki?

89
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,064
You mean you guys
called me out here

90
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,730
just to ask an idiotic
question like that?

91
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,560
‐ Well yeah, the girls in my
class were spreading rumors.

92
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,476
Right?

93
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,481
‐ Yes.

94
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,815
‐ This is stupid.

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,240
Its totally untrue, of course.

96
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,989
‐ But Mike, don’t be silly.

97
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,242
There is no smoke where
there is no flame burning.

98
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,285
‐ Don’t just show up
here out of nowhere

99
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,659
and start saying
things that add fuel

100
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,745
to the fire.

101
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,040
‐ So there really is a flame?

102
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,165
‐ No there isn’t.

103
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,125
‐ Hey, are you the one?

104
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,839
‐ I’m afraid that I’m the guy

105
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,635
that’s rumored to have a
special relationship with Mike.

106
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,178
I’m Kousei Shimazaki.

107
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,473
‐ How do you do?

108
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,056
I’m Miina Miyafuji.

109
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,022
‐ And I’m Karen Onodera.

110
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,901
‐ A pleasure and no need
sticking to formalities,

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520
you can just call me Kousei.

112
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,613
‐ Sure.

113
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,605
I mean.

114
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,693
‐ Nice to meet you, Shimazaki.

115
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,952
‐ Just what I expected
from Mike’s relatives.

116
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,913
When it comes to
not being honest,

117
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,655
you’re all alike.

118
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,405
‐ What do you mean by that?

119
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,039
‐ I mean that its pretty
obvious to me, Mike,

120
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,166
that these two are
in love with you.

121
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,092
‐ What?

122
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,761
‐ Stop saying ridiculous
things like that.

123
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,222
I mean it.

124
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,970
Hey, I want you two to
stop blushing right now.

125
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,802
(girl meows)

126
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,967
Ah, stop with the mews.

127
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,969
‐ Well I trust
that the two of you

128
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,057
will take good care of him.

129
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,523
‐ Don’t you ever
listen to anyone?

130
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,444
‐ As long as you two girls
are living here with him

131
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,075
I can finally relax.

132
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,070
It will keep anyone
strange from approaching

133
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:42,992
our little Mike.

134
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,414
‐ What are you talking about?

135
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,372
‐ About the future,

136
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,121
the one between you and me.

137
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,083
‐ I should just.

138
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,826
‐ We can’t.

139
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,037
People are watching.

140
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,799
‐ [Mike] Don’t you understand?

141
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,921
‐ [Shimazaki] Of course I do.

142
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,167
‐ [Mike] Stop that.

143
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,416
‐ You know, this
is the first time

144
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,049
I’ve seen someone like
that in real life.

145
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,845
‐ And this is the first
time I’ve seen one

146
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,349
outside comic books.

147
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,726
‐ [Girl] Wait, do you mean
Mike Kamishiro in class B?

148
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,939
‐ [Girl] Yeah.

149
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,441
‐ [Girl] Well I do think
he’s really attractive

150
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,903
but you know, he can be
rather hard to approach.

151
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,033
I even think Shimazaki
may be his only friend

152
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,031
at this school, so all in all.

153
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,776
From what I’ve heard,

154
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,787
he doesn’t accept
any gifts from girls

155
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,041
and has never even
been seen with a girl.

156
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,961
So maybe those rumors
about him are true.

157
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,515
‐ You know I think its just
like what Mike’s homeroom

158
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,132
teacher was saying
the other day,

159
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,547
he lives sort of an
outlaw life at school.

160
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,046
‐ But maybe.

161
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,097
‐ Maybe what?

162
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,603
Karen?

163
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,813
‐ Well um, maybe Mr.
Mike isn’t interested

164
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,025
in girls at all, if
you know what I mean?

165
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,900
‐ What?

166
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,322
‐ I mean, boys are always
flirting with girls right

167
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,611
and they’re always trying
to get girls to notice them?

168
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,285
‐ Well I think that’s
right but I’m not sure.

169
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,245
‐ On TV, boys are always trying

170
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,655
to steal the girls laundry
and peek into their baths

171
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,826
to see them naked.

172
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,657
‐ But that’s against the law.

173
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,791
‐ Oh no, Mr. Mike.

174
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,086
He may not be a
normal boy anymore.

175
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,220
‐ Well I think Karen’s
really starting to lose it.

176
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,930
‐ [Girl] Kamishiro.

177
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,434
‐ Ms. Miina, no
please you can’t.

178
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,175
I’m just not mentally ready yet.

179
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,653
‐ Hey you, over here.

180
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,685
‐ Oh, hi Sinpai, are
you on the swim team?

181
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,029
‐ No I’m not.

182
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,488
‐ You see, this
afternoon the pool area

183
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,034
has been rented out just
for the student council.

184
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,294
‐ Hey wait, that’s a total
abuse of power isn’t it?

185
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,581
You sure its alright?

186
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,671
‐ Its perfectly fine.

187
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,791
I gave them permission.

188
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,548
‐ Ah, Ms. Kasumi, hello.

189
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,800
= what’s wrong?

190
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,005
‐ Well I.

191
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,393
I guess I’m starting to think

192
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,971
that I just can’t believe
in you anymore, ma’am.

193
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,556
‐ Really?

194
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,890
Really?

195
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,685
‐ He seems to be having
a normal conversation

196
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,230
and like you said before,

197
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,984
poor Mike may not
be a normal boy.

198
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,405
‐ Its bad to have a
normal conversation?

199
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,404
‐ Look at who he’s talking to.

200
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,238
I hate to say this
because it irritates me

201
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,164
but he’s talking to
a high school girl

202
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,991
with a great figure.

203
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,077
(sultry rock music)

204
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,249
A beautiful teacher with
tons of sexy adult charm.

205
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,428
And a super Lolita
that could easily pass

206
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,260
for a grade school girl.

207
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,223
He’s surrounded
by beautiful women

208
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,478
of the same caliber as
the three sacred trashers

209
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,942
but he shows no interest.

210
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,653
‐ Oh my goodness, this
really is a problem.

211
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,154
‐ I know.

212
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,275
‐ Ms. Miina, I think we
should do whatever we can

213
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,701
to help Mr. Mike rediscover
the normal feelings

214
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,320
of being a boy.

215
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,868
‐ How do we do it?

216
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,120
‐ It doesn’t matter how.

217
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,831
Working hard for the
sake of a relative

218
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,463
is just what families do.

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,340
‐ You know you’re right.

220
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,341
‐ And so?

221
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,802
‐ And so?

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
‐ And so could you please
come up with a plan?

223
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,260
‐ Hey, Kamishiro, would
you care to join us

224
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,795
in the swimming pool?

225
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,638
‐ No, thank you.

226
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,265
I don’t have a swim suit.

227
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,603
‐ We can lend you
one if you like?

228
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,035
‐ Thanks a lot but I got to go.

229
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,905
‐ You don’t have to swim
if you don’t want to.

230
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,738
‐ No thanks.

231
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,662
I have work to do.

232
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,199
‐ Well.

233
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,157
‐ You got to admit,
Kamishiro’s a tough opponent.

234
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,418
‐ As a teacher here, I
would just like to say that

235
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,341
he’s a serious guy.

236
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,881
‐ Calm down, calm down.

237
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,006
Calm down.

238
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,185
(giggles)

239
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,430
‐ Oh.

240
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,061
Dear Mike, my heart
races at the thought

241
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,851
at just how stoic you are.

242
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,361
(soft instrumental music)

243
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,072
‐ [Miina] We will
execute these plans

244
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,403
the day after tomorrow.

245
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,568
‐ We’re really doing
this, Ms. Miina?

246
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,872
‐ Yes, for Mike.

247
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,407
‐ yeah, this is for mike.

248
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,289
I’ll do it.

249
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,383
I’ll do it for Mr. Mike.

250
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,182
‐ If I can keep this up.

251
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,049
‐ Mike.

252
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,892
‐ What do you want?

253
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,105
‐ I start swimming
classes tomorrow.

254
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,806
So I thought I’d try it on.

255
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,814
What do you think?

256
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,400
How do I look?

257
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,360
‐ I, I think that you
look perfectly normal.

258
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,739
‐ Oh I’m glad.

259
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,915
‐ Calm down, I just
said it was normal.

260
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,120
‐ Mr. Mike, would you
tell me what you think

261
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,125
about mine?

262
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,747
‐ There’s nothing
strange about it.

263
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,592
‐ Oh thank you so much.

264
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,761
‐ Karen, did you know your
strap is flipped over?

265
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,681
‐ Ms. Miina, could
you please fix it?

266
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,980
‐ [Miina] Wow Karen, your
skin is so white and smooth.

267
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,313
‐ [Karen] Wait a minute,
if you lower it too far.

268
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,768
‐ [Miina] Maybe I’ll
touch something important.

269
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,527
‐ [Karen] No, don’t.

270
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,690
‐ Hey!

271
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,108
Please do things like that
back in your own room, alright?

272
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,533
‐ Hey, Ms. Miina, I
think I’m starting

273
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,117
to get sleepy.

274
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,292
‐ Oh then lets take a nap.

275
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,213
‐ Okay.

276
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,127
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
It’s not even noon yet.

277
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,592
Damn it.

278
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,960
‐ [Miina] Goodnight, Mike.

279
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,012
‐ What?

280
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:20,973
Wait?

281
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,802
You are not sleeping in my bed.

282
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,306
‐ What?

283
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,640
What’s the matter?

284
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,141
‐ [Mike] Get out.

285
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,647
You’re interrupting my work.

286
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,650
‐ Mike, wait a minute.

287
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,652
‐ Mr. Mike.

288
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,652
‐ [Mike Voiceover]
Just calm down.

289
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,237
(soft instrumental music)

290
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,172
(grunting)

291
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,022
(soft instrumental music)

292
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,821
(groaning)

293
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,119
‐ I’ve about had it.

294
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,707
I can’t believe all
the embarrassing things

295
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,882
we’ve had to go through

296
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,381
and Mike hasn’t reacted
to a single one.

297
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,844
‐ Ms. Miina, I’m
no longer confidant

298
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,053
that I’ll lead a
normal life as a woman.

299
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,345
‐ Yeah, well.

300
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,136
Our plan didn’t work
out like we thought.

301
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,800
We need a drama.

302
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,888
Something that will
heighten his emotions.

303
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,175
‐ Drama?

304
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,516
Are you sure?

305
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,231
‐ Yes, a drama.

306
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,311
‐ Hello, can I buy this?

307
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,727
‐ We’ll go through with
it at school tomorrow.

308
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,897
‐ Um, yes.

309
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,608
‐ Hello?

310
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,369
‐ One of thems a relative.

311
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,910
One of thems a relative.

312
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,163
One of thems a relative.

313
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,369
(groaning)

314
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,630
‐ Oh Mike, you look exhausted

315
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,927
or are you sexually frustrated?

316
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,058
‐ I beg you, just
leave me alone.

317
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,555
‐ As you wish.

318
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,812
‐ Girls from Class A
are having swim class

319
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,266
fourth period.

320
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,266
‐ [Boy] I can’t wait to
see those transfer students

321
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,436
in swimsuits.

322
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,945
(overlapping chatter)

323
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,451
‐ Alright ladies, since
the phys ed teacher

324
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,788
is home sick with the flu today,

325
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,462
I will be teaching the class.

326
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,794
‐ Do you get the feeling
that there are really only

327
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,916
two teachers working
this high school?

328
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,803
‐ Yeah, very much so.

329
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,224
‐ Why don’t we take this
time to freely play around

330
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,130
in the swimming pool?

331
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,510
(blows whistle)

332
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,477

(kids laughing)

333
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,237
‐ Okay, me first.

334
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,407
‐ Hey, what are you
doing over there?

335
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,496
‐ [All] Crap, crap.

336
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,920
‐ What am I doing here
is the real question.

337
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,513
‐ Yup, yup you’re
so cute, Haruko.

338
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,843
(groaning)

339
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,847
You’re so cute, Haruko.

340
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,691
(bell ringing)

341
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,157
‐ I’m so tired right now.

342
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,243
I want to go home.

343
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,237
‐ Mr. Mike!

344
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,248

would you leave me alone?

345
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,385
‐ Ms. Miina’s been hurt.

346
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,214
‐ What happened, Karen?

347
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,375
Is Miina alright?

348
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,475
‐ Ms. Miina was accosted
by one of the boys.

349
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,641
(somber instrumental music)

350
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,311
And she was dragged
into the locker room.

351
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,481
I couldn’t move.

352
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,849
I was just so scared.

353
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,945
‐ Are you serious?

354
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,901
Damn it!

355
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,114
Miina!

356
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,987
(somber instrumental music)

357
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,414
Are you okay?

358
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,083
Miina.

359
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,661
‐ Hi, Mike.

360
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,544
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

361
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,498
‐ Are you hurt anywhere?

362
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,043
Miina, did they do
something to you?

363
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,297
‐ It was awfully close but no.

364
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,011
I fought, I fought
as hard as I could.

365
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,221
‐ I see.

366
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,761
I’m really glad.

367
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,755
Yeah, I’m glad that you’re okay.

368
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,181
‐ Mike.

369
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,476
‐ Yeah, I’m really glad
that you’re alright.

370
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,482
Oh Miina, I’m so glad.

371
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,860
‐ Mike, I, I wanna.

372
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,031
‐ It’s alright.

373
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,689
You don’t have to say anything.

374
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,446
‐ I’m sorry.

375
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,874
‐ Miina, why are
you apologizing?

376
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,791
‐ Because I didn’t think
you’d be so worried.

377
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,826
I didn’t realize.

378
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,425
I’m so sorry.

379
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,209
‐ Miina?

380
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,634
‐ Mike I, I just.

381
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:02,313
I want.

382
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,428
‐ Uh I.

383
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,524
(gasps)

384
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,938
‐ No, you got to stop.

385
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,534
Don’t go any further than that.

386
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,033
(shouts)

387
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,235
(groaning)

388
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,414

389
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,131
‐ No.

390
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,463

394
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,639
‐ What’s the matter, Mike?

395
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,556
‐ [Miina] No!

396
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,112
‐ What is the meaning
of all this, Mike?

397
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,820
I thought you
understood you have me.

398
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,784
‐ That’s not the point, Kousei,

399
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,651
so why don’t you be quiet?

400
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,698
Mike Kamishiro, these young
girls are your relatives.

401
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,245
Its a crime what you’re doing.

A big crime.

403

just an accident.

404

(mews)

405
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,132
‐ Yeah but, she looks
like she’s really happy.

406
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,593
‐ But I don’t know why.

408
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,065

What kind of excuse

414
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,661

orphanage director?

fate that made it possible

425
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,571
for me to finally meet
Mr. Mike like I did.

426
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,454

sheer luck that I met Mike

427

431

selfish feeling this way?
