1
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,765
You know, this all started when you got here.

2
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:31,830
People are going missing.

3
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,897
Do you know anything about this?

4
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:38,195
What is it you've been doing on
the side when you're not working?!

5
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,708
Aha!

6
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,295
This is it, Ogimoto House.

7
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,776
Now, then, answer me.

8
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:21,835
Who was it that you were writing
all of these little letters to?

9
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,534
What was your name?

10
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,161
Oh, I remember.

11
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:29,739
It's Makio, isn't it?

12
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:36,377
Answer me at once, Makio.

13
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:51,253
I almost forgot why I came here in the first place.

14
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:56,115
I'm supposed to be looking for
Mr. Uzui's wife, Ms. Hinatsuru.

15
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,814
Playing the shamisen and koto
probably won't help much with doing that.

16
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:05,332
But it's not like anything else is happening here.

17
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:07,835
I've been all ears since I arrived,

18
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,611
and I still haven't heard a word about Ms. Hinatsuru.

19
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,691
Then again, the owner of this house died two days ago,

20
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,332
which makes sense why everyone is somber around here.

21
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,111
Get that for me, will you?

22
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,568
I can't find my belt!

23
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:26,281
I'm starving here!

24
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,257
Has the hairdresser arrived yet?

25
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,310
That's no good.

26
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,429
A young girl is crying.

27
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,669
Huh?

28
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,257
Someone is coming this way.

29
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:45,550
Ogimoto House certainly has no shortage of headaches.

30
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,127
I've got to find a way to let
Lord Tengen know what happened...

31
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:51,938
before it's too late.

32
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,030
If you cause a scene,

33
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:03,140
I'll have your insides ground up into a bloody pulp.

34
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,233
That must be the food that woman left for her,

35
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,704
which means that room must be Makio's.

36
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:15,900
It's weird.

37
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,771
Her food's still there.

38
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,455
Is she sick or in trouble?

39
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,208
I can't tell.

40
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,165
Something creepy's going on. That's for sure.

41
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,545
Here I am, sittin' around, doing nothing!

42
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,391
That's not my style!

43
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,907
There's wind,

44
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:49,355
even though the windows are closed.

45
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:52,801
The attic.

46
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,046
Hey, coward!

47
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:57,751
I'm onto you!

48
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:01,891
What the...

49
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:06,097
Now I just have to catch the
damn thing before it gets away.

50
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,965
It's a demon for sure.

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,597
But where's it heading?

52
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,110
I can hardly keep up.

53
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,481
Get out of the way!

54
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:19,971
Get back here!

55
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:23,354
What's going on?!

56
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,408
It's daytime, so it has to stay up there.

57
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,614
But it's gotta come down using the walls at some point.

58
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,068
Like right now!

59
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,010
Where are you off to in a rush, good-look...

60
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:48,491
Did you knock him out?!

61
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,190
Damn it. That was too early.

62
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:55,015
Now it's headed downstairs.

63
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:56,500
This way!

64
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,319
No, wait. This way?

65
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,089
I can't tell.

66
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,261
It's hard to get a feel for it.

67
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,683
Where is that thing?!

68
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,645
I can't believe I lost it!

69
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,558
Those idiots got in my way!

70
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,720
Hey! What the hell happened here?!

71
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:23,898
Seriously! Your room's a mess!

72
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,466
Wait! Did you get in a fight?

73
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,708
Are you okay? Who did this?!

74
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:32,525
Uh...

75
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,789
hey, don't cry.

76
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,595
What's going on? You all right?

77
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:40,507
Sorry I yelled like that.

78
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,475
I wasn't angry or anything, I swear.

79
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,105
It's just I was surprised. That's all.

80
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,426
You there...

81
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:53,339
what do you think you're doing in my room?

82
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,081
That sound...

83
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,858
that's not a human standing behind me.

84
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,301
That's a demon.

85
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:08,139
I didn't even notice she was
there until she started speaking.

86
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,000
How is that possible?

87
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,455
This sound is bad news.

88
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:15,492
I've never heard one so ominously quiet before.

89
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,162
Which means...

90
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,720
this is an Upper Rank demon.

91
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,217
What's wrong?

92
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,805
Are you hard of hearing or something, girl?

93
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:31,509
Uh...

94
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,864
please wait, Oiran Warabihime.

95
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:38,341
That girl is brand-new. She just
started here the day before yesterday.

96
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,224
And? So what if she's new?

97
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:49,604
Forgive me if I intruded.

98
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:53,587
I saw this room was a mess,
and I heard a girl crying in here.

99
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,089
Why are you so damn hideous?

100
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,249
My goodness.

101
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,499
Looking at you makes me ill.

102
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,256
Girls like you are better off dead.

103
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,193
Also, what's with that hair color?

104
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,881
You look like a sore thumb.

105
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,602
In any case, you're right,

106
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,625
This room is still in shambles, isn't it?

107
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:20,722
If I'm not mistaken, I told you to clean it up.

108
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:25,773
Shut your mouth!

109
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:29,250
Stop all that screaming and start cleaning, brat!

110
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,890
I'm sorry! Forgive me, Oiran!

111
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:35,209
I'll clean it all up! Just please let go!

112
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,642
What's this?

113
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:45,937
Please...

114
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,018
take your hands off her.

115
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:24,635
All done! I made sure to scrub down all of the hallways.

116
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,527
Oh, right! The flowers...

117
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:27,715
they're all prepared.

118
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,902
What, already?

119
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,419
Anything else I can do to help?

120
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,802
Well, let me think.

121
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:34,975
Um...

122
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:38,412
Here's a fresh cup of tea.

123
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,539
What's next?

124
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,378
You didn't have to do that.

125
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,375
No problem.

126
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,775
So what's next? I wanna help.

127
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,280
So what's next?

128
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,300
I wanna help! So what's next?

129
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,002
Would you be quiet and hold on a second?!

130
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:56,480
You're a quick worker and well behaved.

131
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,887
That girl is out of control.

132
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,431
She smashed a hole right through the wall.

133
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:14,432
It looks like I need to teach
that one a hard lesson or two.

134
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,574
Listen, Inoko!

135
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,376
What on Earth are you doing?!

136
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:23,628
Even if I focus, I can't sense it at all.

137
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,611
Where the hell did that thing go?

138
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:30,927
Hmph!

139
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,760
What did you say to me?

140
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:46,154
I dare you to say that again.

141
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,528
Please, take your hands off of her.

142
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:51,743
Up close...

143
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,912
you're even uglier than I thought.

144
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:55,595
Take your...

145
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,288
Who do you think you are?

146
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:59,699
How dare you touch me?

147
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,094
Stop all this madness at once!

148
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,500
What do you mean?

149
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:22,812
The ones here who committed ashinuke

150
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,516
did so to escape your vile cruelty.

151
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,545
If that weren't enough,

152
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:30,581
some have even been driven to take their own lives.

153
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,227
Enough is enough.

154
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:38,079
That is quite a serious accusation, Madam.

155
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,282
You really think I'm the one to blame?

156
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:46,903
Help me to understand how it's not their
fault for irritating me in the first place.

157
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:52,297
Until now, I've looked the other
way more times than I can count.

158
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:55,514
But you're far too much trouble to just ignore.

159
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,650
There's no excusing it.

160
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:02,549
You forget yourself in my presence.

161
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:07,975
Whose earnings do you think allowed this house
to prosper the way it has for years, you hag?

162
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,213
Those eyes of yours,

163
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:14,250
they remind me of a story I've heard.

164
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,656
An old lady from the teahouse
told it to me when I was young.

165
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,370
Her memory was beginning to decline,

166
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,912
but she would talk about a certain oiran,

167
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,813
an oiran who was as beautiful as she was twisted.

168
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,473
The old lady said she'd seen
such women when she was a child

169
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,935
and again when she reached middle age.

170
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,742
These oirans were fond of
assuming names ending with "hime,"

171
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,721
and if anything were to irritate them,

172
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:47,222
they'd cock their heads to the
side and stick their nose up at you.

173
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:50,571
That was a unique habit that they shared.

174
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,077
Who are you?

175
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,858
What are you?!

176
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:56,920
Could it be...

177
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,000
That's it!

178
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,543
You're not even human to begin with, are you?!

179
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:13,041
Perhaps it wasn't obvious, but that's the sort of thing

180
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,905
you should keep your mouth shut about when you realize it.

181
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,089
That's the smartest way to live, don't you think?

182
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:23,090
That's how everyone's survived, including me.

183
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:28,712
But it looks like you're far
stupider than I could have imagined.

184
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:33,689
And now you're staring death in
the eye for that same stupidity.

185
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,186
It's such a pity, O-Mitsu.

186
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:40,677
What are you scared of?

187
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,757
There's no need for you to be afraid.

188
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:46,907
The dried-out flesh of old hags like you tastes revolting.

189
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,314
And you're hideous.

190
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,848
Why would I eat you?

191
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:52,581
I'm actually offended you assumed I would.

192
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,800
Goodbye, O-Mitsu.

193
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,520
Please, stop!

194
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,225
What just happened?!

195
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:07,850
Did you see that?

196
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,230
She's dead!

197
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:11,283
She fell! Who is it?

198
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,081
It can't be!

199
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,480
Isn't this the madam?

200
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,023
She's bleeding!

201
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:17,878
Somebody, help!

202
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:18,916
We need some help here!

203
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,176
How are you doing, my dear?

204
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,546
L-Lord Muzan!

205
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,700
I see you've devoured a multitude of humans.

206
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:35,919
You've grown far more powerful than I anticipated.

207
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:38,117
You should be proud.

208
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,158
Yes, sir!

209
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,330
But you mustn't let your guard down.

210
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,852
When things go your way, they're more
likely to slip through your fingers.

211
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,353
Understood, Lord Muzan!

212
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,405
A skilled Demon Slayer Corps member,

213
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,327
like a Hashira,

214
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,275
could recognize us as demons in mere seconds.

215
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,370
However, we on the other hand,

216
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:03,198
are quite different from capable Hashira

217
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:08,157
and cannot see any stark differences
between humans at a glance as they do.

218
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,098
We can still distinguish them, though,

219
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:12,311
by their blood type,

220
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:16,041
as well as the diseases they
carry and their genetic makeup.

221
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:19,777
Daki.

222
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:21,652
Yes?

223
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,074
Yes, Lord Muzan?

224
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,804
You know that I have high hopes for you in particular.

225
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,133
No one compares to your beauty and strength, Daki.

226
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:37,281
That's seven Hashira now that you've killed.

227
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,067
Mark my words.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,510
From here on out, you're going to become even stronger,

229
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,641
a ruthless killer.

230
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,527
You are an extraordinary demon.

231
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,675
How dare you lay a finger on me?

232
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:08,481
Keep your hands to yourself, rotten little brat!

233
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:11,931
Someone needs to discipline you, and harshly.

234
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,408
I'm more than happy to volunteer.

235
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,023
Oiran Warabihime...

236
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,217
I beg of you, please,

237
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,845
please find a way to forgive her.

238
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:28,310
Customers will be arriving very soon, and we need you.

239
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:32,329
I'll see that she's reprimanded harshly. You have my word.

240
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,189
I'm begging you.

241
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,723
I'll be humiliated tonight without you.

242
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:47,316
I suppose I was just a bit too
harsh, seeing as she's a newcomer.

243
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:49,842
See that her wounds are looked at.

244
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:53,843
And please, Master, raise your head and stand up.

245
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,151
I'm the one who should be apologizing right now.

246
00:17:57,565 --> 00:18:01,739
Lately, so many things have left me irritated, you see.

247
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:06,824
I'm heading off to work, so get this place tidied up.

248
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:08,258
Yes! Of course!

249
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:11,087
Call for some help and get this room in order!

250
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:15,114
Don't do anything that would
get on Oiran Warabihime's nerves.

251
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:19,691
That little brat.

252
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,941
Even though that girl is knocked out cold over there...

253
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,259
her injuries are only minor,

254
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:30,977
which must be a result of the defensive falling technique.

255
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:33,038
She's no civilian.

256
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,490
I bet she's with the Demon Slayer Corps.

257
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:40,478
That said, she doesn't have the skill of a Hashira.

258
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:55,289
It might have taken a bit longer than I expected,

259
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:58,005
but it seems they've finally taken the bait.

260
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,917
Let's see what you've got, swordsmen.

261
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:05,362
I'd be more than happy to devour every one of you.

262
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:19,360
What an unsettling smell.

263
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:22,918
At night, in this city...

264
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,298
there's a murky scent in the air.

265
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,695
Zenko!

266
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,268
Zenko!

267
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,042
Thank goodness.

268
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:14,102
Are you all right, Zenko?

269
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:16,448
Uh...

270
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:17,570
uh...

271
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,342
What just happened?

272
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,380
After you got punched, you blacked out, Zenko!

273
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:24,744
We were worried sick!

274
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,505
Oh. That's right.

275
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,515
I'm just a bit dizzy is all.

276
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,606
I had the weirdest dream I had become a man.

277
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:36,022
We brought you some food, Zenko, so eat up!

278
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,926
And use this to keep the swelling down.

279
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:41,461
Ow, ow, ow.

280
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,895
You gonna be okay?

281
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,726
Yeah. It's not as bad as it looks...

282
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:47,586
I think.

283
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,235
Thank you for earlier.

284
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:50,978
Huh?

285
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,942
This only happened because you defended me.

286
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:56,739
Well, of course I did.

287
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:00,362
Any man would rescue a girl in need. Isn't that right?

288
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,785
Not that I'm a man or anything!

289
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,332
Just that any human would do it!

290
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,570
Especially if you're the eldest daughter,

291
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:07,795
uh, like I am!

292
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:11,105
That's why I can't just stand
by while a younger girl is crying!

293
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:13,108
But that's not true at all.

294
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:14,937
Everyone here's busy,

295
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:17,546
just trying to take care of themselves each day.

296
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,724
This is the very first time we've met someone kind as you.

297
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,127
See you around the house, Zenko!

298
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,710
Please take care of yourself.

299
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:30,420
And get lots of rest, okay?

300
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,564
Right. Thank you so much.

301
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:51,442
Junior High and High School...

302
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,366
"Kimetsu Academy Story: Christmas Arc."

303
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:56,969
At last!

304
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:58,942
Today's the day I've been waiting for.

305
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,780
I've invited Nezuko to the Christmas party.

306
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,523
Thanks to my keen planning,

307
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,956
we can proceed straight from the party to the wedding.

308
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:09,924
That must be her! Nezuko's here!

309
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,385
I've been waiting for... you.

310
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,791
Thank you for the party invite.

311
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:16,460
You're lucky I showed up.

312
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,938
Merry Christmas.

313
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:21,917
So what is Christmas, anyway? Tell me!

314
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,110
Hey, I never even invited you guys!

315
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:25,785
And what's with those outfits?!

316
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,983
Talk about ruining my plans, you jerks!

317
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:31,292
None of you have ever been invited
to a Christmas party, am I right?

318
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:34,027
Stop fooling around! Everyone except Nezuko, go home!

319
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:35,038
What did you say?!

320
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,885
Tell me what Christmas is, damn it!

321
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,306
Shut up, idiot!
