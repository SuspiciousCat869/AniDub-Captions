1
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,165
Mr. Rengoku...

2
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:37,806
Rengoku.

3
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,576
Rengoku!

4
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,197
I...

5
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,602
I will see my duty fulfilled!

6
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:55,564
No matter what it takes, no one shall die here!

7
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,077
Flame Breathing.

8
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,878
Esoteric Art!

9
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,152
Set your heart ablaze.

10
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,562
Rengoku!

11
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,521
Set your heart ablaze.

12
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:43,525
Mr. Rengoku.

13
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,217
Mr. Rengoku.

14
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:53,167
Mr. Rengoku. Mr. Rengoku.

15
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,788
Stop that crying, will you?!

16
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,109
And, you...

17
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,527
snap out of it and get back on your feet!

18
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:03,740
We all have to train!

19
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:05,348
You hear me?!

20
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,758
Is that so?

21
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,038
Tanjiro said that?

22
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,727
I'm not done with you, coward!

23
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,441
Turn and face me!

24
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:05,053
Don't forget that the Demon Slayer Corps is
always fighting you demons in the dead of night,

25
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,896
where you have the advantage!

26
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:09,563
Don't run away, you bastard!

27
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,277
You're a coward, a coward!

28
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:23,638
Then our newfound duty is to carry on his will.

29
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:29,423
My, he certainly seems like a bright young child.

30
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:34,349
Indeed! I admit not being able to
bear children was difficult for us,

31
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:38,647
but taking care of such a fine boy has been a blessing.

32
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,644
Each day is so blissful.

33
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,149
I couldn't be happier.

34
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,385
He's such a kind little fellow

35
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,548
and very considerate toward the servants.

36
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:07,510
I have never come across a child
his age who was so well mannered.

37
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:12,270
Don't underestimate the influence
of parental affection and a good home.

38
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,822
I may have that boy take over my business one day.

39
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,878
Ah, I'd be lying if I said I weren't jealous.

40
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,415
I wish I could trade our useless son for him.

41
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:26,406
He's a fine young lad. There's no doubt.

42
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,193
That being said...

43
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,800
the poor boy suffers from a rare skin disease,

44
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:34,424
so he can't go outside during the day.

45
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,675
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

46
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:42,662
I'm hoping we can figure out a way to develop
a miracle elixir for him over at my company,

47
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:44,295
the sooner, the better.

48
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,915
Reporting in as you requested...

49
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,159
Lord Muzan.

50
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,177
Were you able to find what I asked for?

51
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:09,311
I looked into it, but came up empty-handed.

52
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:11,735
I couldn't find the Blue Spider Lily.

53
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:15,962
There wasn't even a trace of its existence.

54
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,466
And?

55
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,956
I will try to live up to your expectations.

56
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,987
Forgive my unworthy efforts.

57
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:30,780
But as you ordered, I was able
to eliminate one of the Hashira.

58
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,864
Rest easy knowing that much.

59
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:41,084
It seems like you have the wrong
idea about how things work here, Akaza.

60
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,851
I'm curious.

61
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:48,582
Did you expect praise?

62
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:51,910
All you did was dispose of a mere cockroach.

63
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,284
A demon beating a human is an underwhelming conclusion.

64
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,410
What I want is for the Demon Slayer Corps to be wiped out.

65
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,108
Squeeze the life out of every last one of them,

66
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:09,185
and never let another one enter my line of sight again.

67
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,008
It's hardly a complicated task,

68
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,967
and yet I am still waiting for it to happen.

69
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,942
Now, what do you make of that?

70
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,791
You return here boasting of your
infantile triumph over a Hashira.

71
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:28,348
All the while, three other Demon
Slayers survived the confrontation.

72
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,396
Why did you not kill them when you had the chance?

73
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:36,375
And after I made a point of sending you to
that location because you happened to be nearby.

74
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,036
Akaza.

75
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,667
Akaza.

76
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,388
Akaza.

77
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,810
Akaza!

78
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,280
You have disappointed me so.

79
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:56,656
To think you suffered a blow by
someone who isn't even a Hashira.

80
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,805
How far you have fallen, Upper Three.

81
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,451
You're dismissed.

82
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,412
What's all the commotion up here?

83
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,012
Are you all right?

84
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,333
You coward!

85
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,165
You coward!

86
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:54,125
Make no mistake. I'll remember your face,

87
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,222
and when we meet again,

88
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,086
I'm going to savor tearing you limb from limb!

89
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,407
Hmm?

90
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:50,078
I never thought I'd live to see the day where
even Tanjiro couldn't bring himself to smile.

91
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,352
It makes sense, though.

92
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,807
We were powerless compared to Mr. Rengoku,

93
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:00,370
and even he found himself at death's door.

94
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,483
I don't blame him.

95
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,251
That would break anyone.

96
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,760
I mean, just look at Inosuke.

97
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:12,220
I didn't even know he could cry.

98
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,032
He must have been so frustrated

99
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,958
that his burning rage turned to helpless tears.

100
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:22,899
Even so, There's no point in cowering forever.

101
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,304
The strong get back up on their feet time and time again.

102
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:29,301
I know Mr. Rengoku was that way.

103
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,745
I could hear that in him.

104
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,304
He was a little odd at times,

105
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,715
but his heart was strong and kind.

106
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,358
Tanjiro, I snagged us bean-paste buns! Let's eat!

107
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:43,484
Help!

108
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,825
Mr. Tanjiro has gone missing!

109
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,025
Oh, no!

110
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,494
Mr. Zenitsu!

111
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,804
I'm so sorry!

112
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,654
Don't worry about it.

113
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,008
I'll be okay...

114
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,536
eventually.

115
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:58,317
You look like you just got hit by a train!

116
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,337
Please forgive me, sir,

117
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,045
but Mr. Tanjiro can't be found!

118
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,630
Even worse, his wounds haven't
healed, and he's training again!

119
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,271
Miss Shinobu told him he should be resting in bed,

120
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:12,413
but he didn't listen, and now
we don't know what we should do!

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,515
So he's training with that stomach wound?

122
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,421
Is he dumb?!

123
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:34,064
Mr. Rengoku's Crow, thank you.

124
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:38,332
He's carrying out his master's
will by guiding me to his house.

125
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:02,640
Are you Senjuro?

126
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:03,080
Huh?

127
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:14,170
I take it you know about Mr. Rengoku.

128
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,424
I'm so sorry.

129
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:21,048
Before he died, he asked for some messages
to be delivered to you and your father.

130
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:24,052
I've come to pass them on.

131
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:31,176
From my brother? Thank you, but I'm
already well aware of what happened to him.

132
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,178
What's wrong?

133
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,631
Your face...

134
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,481
it looks as pale as a ghost.

135
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,234
Knock it off!

136
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:43,522
Whatever message he left means nothing anyway.

137
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:48,118
Why would he become a swordsman
when he had no talent to begin with?

138
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,882
It's no wonder he died!

139
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,508
He's worthless!

140
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:55,069
He was a fool of a son from the start!

141
00:14:57,217 --> 00:15:00,358
A person's potential is determined the day they're born.

142
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:03,949
Only a mere handful have any talent.

143
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,835
The rest are just dregs of society.

144
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,476
You're either born a genius or someday killed by one!

145
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,107
It's clear which one Kyujuro was.

146
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,895
He had no future to begin with.

147
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,208
No surprise he got killed.

148
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,329
Give me a break!

149
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,585
The funeral is over, Senjuro.

150
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,030
It's high time you move on with your damn life.

151
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:32,360
Just a moment.

152
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,950
Don't you think you're being a bit too harsh?

153
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,881
Please show some respect for your son.

154
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:40,538
And just who the hell are you?

155
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:44,659
Answer me or get off of my property!

156
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:45,805
I'm with...

157
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,523
the Demon Slayer Corps!

158
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:53,530
You're what?

159
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,836
I get it now.

160
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,082
That means...

161
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,997
you're a Sun Breathing user, aren't you?

162
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,648
Am I right?

163
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,287
Sun Breathing?

164
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,235
What do you mean by that?

165
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:08,090
Hey!

166
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,264
He's fast...

167
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,565
and those were no amateur moves.

168
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,723
Father, please stop!

169
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,833
Take a good look at his face!

170
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:20,418
Can't you see he's in pain?

171
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:22,035
Keep your mouth shut!

172
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,412
Don't you dare lay a hand on him, you monster!

173
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,405
Huh?

174
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:36,800
Why are you acting so hostile
like this in the first place?

175
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,867
Insulting your own child who lost his life?

176
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,640
And striking your son?

177
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,350
What's the matter with you?!

178
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:46,482
Despicable.

179
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:50,497
You intend to mock us after
everything we've been through?!

180
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,478
What makes you say that?

181
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,618
I don't know what you're talking about!

182
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,135
I'm here to help!

183
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,774
A Sun Breathing user would never help people like us.

184
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,209
I know all about those earrings of yours!

185
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,349
It was in that book.

186
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,463
Sun Breathing sounds familiar.

187
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,091
Is he talking about Hinokami Kagura?

188
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,756
The Sun Breathing technique,

189
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:17,349
not only is it the first one ever to be created,

190
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,689
it's the most powerful one as well.

191
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:24,389
Every technique, no matter how
diverse, came from Sun Breathing.

192
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:27,987
Which means all the others

193
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,769
are just cheap imitations of Sun Breathing.

194
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,337
They can try to copy the original,

195
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,379
but they'll never be as powerful.

196
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:39,309
Fire, Water, Wind, all of them!

197
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:41,711
What does he mean?

198
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,887
We've always been charcoal burners.

199
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,036
It's in our blood.

200
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:49,592
Sun Breathing...

201
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,688
Hinokami Kagura...

202
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:57,073
No. Never mind all that.

203
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,294
There's something more important.

204
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:04,399
Don't get cocky just because you're a Sun Breathing user!

205
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,679
I can still put you in your place, boy!

206
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:12,643
How can I feel cocky after all that's happened?!

207
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:17,011
I would give anything at all for strength
like that, but I'm burdened by my own weakness!

208
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,491
You bastard!

209
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,470
So shut up!

210
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:22,308
He's powerful! Be careful!

211
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:26,717
How dare you badmouth, Mr. Rengoku? You monster!

212
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,204
He's a former Hashira!

213
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,356
Please, Father, have mercy!

214
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,179
Why, then...

215
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,505
if Hinokami Kagura is a Sun Breathing technique...

216
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,604
then that day...

217
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,049
why wasn't I strong enough to save him?

218
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,106
Why?

219
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:53,183
Why?

220
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,412
Why couldn't I save him?!

221
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,398
I feel like I've made a grave mistake.

222
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:19,764
Please, sir, have some tea.

223
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,439
Ohh. Thank you very much.

224
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,786
I hope you can forgive me

225
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,173
for head-butting your father and all.

226
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,294
He's okay, right?

227
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,111
Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.

228
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:37,524
I mean, after all, he's back to getting sake already.

229
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:40,024
What a relief.

230
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,281
You have my thanks.

231
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,794
Huh?

232
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,834
For standing up to him.

233
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,384
I was too scared to,

234
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,509
even when he badmouthed my brother like that.

235
00:19:57,374 --> 00:20:00,734
Tell me, what were my brother's last moments like?

236
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,115
I see.

237
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,649
So he was brave to the end.

238
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:17,451
Thank you for sharing.

239
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,265
Please, don't thank me.

240
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:23,571
Instead, forgive me.

241
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,151
I wasn't enough.

242
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,063
There's no need to blame yourself.

243
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,646
It's not your fault, and he knows that too.

244
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:45,811
What you said reminded me of
something in a book my father often read.

245
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,358
I'm fairly certain this is it.

246
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:54,011
Uh...

247
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,531
thank you very much!

248
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:59,409
Let me know if what you're looking for is in those pages.

249
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:04,421
What?

250
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,128
Look at this!

251
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,057
What happened?

252
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:25,777
It's ripped to shreds.

253
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,664
I can't read it.

254
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:30,167
Was it like this when he got it?

255
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:33,389
Not at all. That's not even possible.

256
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,707
The Flame Hashira Chronicles

257
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,282
are stored with the highest degree of care.

258
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,998
Which means it must have been my father who tore them.

259
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:43,992
I hope you'll forgive me.

260
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,923
Don't worry. It's not like it's your fault, Senjuro,

261
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,442
so don't beat yourself up over it.

262
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,972
But you traveled all this way for it, didn't you?

263
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:56,513
The secrets of Sun Breathing,

264
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,635
I thought for sure I had the answers for you,

265
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:00,331
but I was no help.

266
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,272
You helped plenty.

267
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:05,308
This confirmed what I thought I needed to do.

268
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,732
I have to train harder.

269
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:13,100
While I know how to perform the dance,

270
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,252
when it comes to Hinokami Kagura,

271
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,879
I still haven't managed to master it.

272
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,812
What is it that's stopping you?

273
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:25,908
When using Hinokami Kagura with Total Concentration,

274
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:28,777
I can't yet move my body the way I want.

275
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:31,812
But it's my own fault.

276
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,053
Right now, my body can't keep up.

277
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:39,238
I've improved thanks to Total Concentration, Constant,

278
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,205
but it's not enough.

279
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,747
Maintaining Constant should allow me to
gradually improve my stamina with each passing day,

280
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,340
so I won't get stronger overnight.

281
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:54,936
That day, I felt utterly weak.

282
00:22:55,962 --> 00:23:00,954
I longed for there to be a way to instantly
become strong enough to save Mr. Rengoku.

283
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,164
I tried to find one...

284
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:08,441
but no such remedy exists.

285
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:10,977
No shortcuts to be taken.

286
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,601
That's reality.

287
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,496
Even so, I'll keep moving forward,

288
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:17,636
keep training...

289
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,732
no matter how grueling or frustrating things might get.

290
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,643
Mark my words.

291
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:29,441
I will become a powerful Hashira just like Mr. Kyojuro.

292
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,618
That's a promise.

293
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:44,630
You know, my brother didn't have a Tsuguko.

294
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:52,947
Normally, I would have followed in
his footsteps and become his Tsuguko,

295
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:55,963
which would mean training as a Hashira reserve.

296
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:03,333
Unfortunately, my Nichirin Sword
failed to ever change its color.

297
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:11,942
I was well aware that they don't change color
until you've acquired a certain level of sword skills.

298
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,440
Yet no matter how much training I underwent,

299
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:19,100
nothing happened.

300
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:25,384
Not everyone can be born talented.

301
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,742
So I'm going to forget about becoming a swordsman

302
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:34,149
and find another way to be useful.

303
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,483
I know this will break the line of Flame Hashira

304
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,483
and damage its long history,

305
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,712
but I'm sure if he were still here,

306
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:47,189
that my brother would forgive me.

307
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:55,675
Walk down the path that you know to be true.

308
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,539
And if anyone gives you grief about it,

309
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,643
then I'll head-butt them!

310
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,066
I don't think that's a good idea.

311
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:12,442
The Flame Hashira Chronicles, I'll restore them myself,

312
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,772
and I'll look for other books as well.

313
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,376
My father might know where to look.

314
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:19,715
If anything turns up, I'll send word through our Crow.

315
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:23,550
I'm glad I got to talk with you.

316
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,606
Thank you for coming all this way.

317
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,837
Oh, please. You've got it wrong.

318
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,532
I should be thanking you.

319
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,784
Oh, there was one more thing.

320
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,001
Here. Please take this.

321
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,717
It's my brother's Nichirin Sword guard.

322
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,867
There's no way.

323
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,667
I can't accept this.

324
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:49,893
I can't!

325
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:52,898
No, I want you to have it.

326
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:56,631
Someday, I know it'll protect you.

327
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:12,374
I'll cherish it.

328
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,045
Excuse me.

329
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:29,543
Are you feeling better?

330
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:31,801
It seems our visitor left.

331
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,780
Shut up!

332
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,306
I don't give a damn.

333
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,337
Get out!

334
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,266
But what about Brother's message?

335
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:39,549
It's worthless!

336
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:43,001
It's probably just his final complaints about me.

337
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,648
I can already guess.

338
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,487
Now give me some peace and quiet.

339
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:52,845
Very well, father.

340
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:03,680
"Please take care of yourself."

341
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,596
Those are the only words

342
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,144
he chose to leave behind for you, Father.

343
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,345
Farewell, Father.

344
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:17,405
Take care now.

345
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:22,940
Eh?

346
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,047
Kyojuro...

347
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:46,936
Do I have a fever?

348
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,309
I can't breathe.

349
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,148
Don't worry, Nezuko.

350
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:03,373
The Butterfly Mansion's not too far.

351
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:18,897
Mr. Haganezuka!

352
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,601
You lost your sword?!

353
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:23,138
Are you out of your mind, you fool?!

354
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:26,224
You deserve nothing less...

355
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:30,136
than the horrible sting of 10,000 deaths!

356
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,168
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

357
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:34,306
I promise I'm truly sorry!

358
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:50,142
Eh? Eh? Huh?

359
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:56,664
He says that he got chased by
Mr. Haganezuka until close to daybreak.

360
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,332
So that's why you're not touching your food?

361
00:28:59,628 --> 00:29:00,585
More for me!

362
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,943
This way, quickly!

363
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,802
I'm sorry!

364
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,472
Oh, man.

365
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,326
If Miss Aoi hadn't calmed him down for me,

366
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,865
he would have kept chasing me 'til noon.

367
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,197
Would anyone like seconds?

368
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,226
Would you like some more?

369
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:31,105
Hell yeah!

370
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:32,703
Thank you...

371
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:34,219
for yesterday.

372
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,850
You too, Sumi, Kiyo, and Naho.

373
00:29:39,462 --> 00:29:41,124
There's no need for thanks.

374
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,754
Speaking of Haganezuka, what's he up to now?

375
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:52,021
Last I saw him, he was out sitting
on the veranda, eating rice dumplings.

376
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:56,291
And it seems like he's finally back in a good mood.

377
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,562
Thank goodness.

378
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,714
I bet you didn't know

379
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:04,155
rice dumplings are his favorite food in the world.

380
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:07,606
So if he's upset, you should try and buy him some.

381
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,007
Get me some while you're at it!

382
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,720
How's this?

383
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,342
I'll get you your own later.

384
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,666
Arms hurt!

385
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,743
Gonna die!

386
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,820
100 more!

387
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:43,257
Nearly four months had gone by since Mr. Rengoku's death.

388
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:48,229
Day in and day out, we trained our very hardest.

389
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:53,178
In the meantime, we continued
receiving assignments by crow.

390
00:30:56,264 --> 00:30:59,537
All of us would take down
demons whenever it was necessary.

391
00:31:00,874 --> 00:31:03,210
Zenitsu would no longer throw fits,

392
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:05,755
even when he had to go on solo missions.

393
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,658
If you give me a small lock of Nezuko's hair,

394
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:09,982
I'll give it my all!

395
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:14,610
Inosuke somehow became even more
of a hothead than he already was.

396
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:17,287
We better be running until our bones shatter,

397
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:19,202
'cause I'm not settling for less!

398
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,296
I'm grateful, really...

399
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:25,403
You're almost there.

400
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,289
Come on!

401
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:28,043
Nezuko.

402
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,612
...that I'm not training alone.

403
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,989
For Nezuko!

404
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:36,799
North-northwest!

405
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,484
North-northwest!

406
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:43,053
Your task is to eradicate the demon
that's lurking about the mountain shrine!

407
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,817
North-northwest! North-northwest!

408
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,024
Nezuko, are you all right?

409
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,108
You getting soaked from the rain?

410
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:15,753
Mm-mmm!

411
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,790
The demon should be around here somewhere.

412
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:50,306
Ready? Let's go!

413
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:08,978
Damn it, I messed up.

414
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,529
He's headed straight toward the village.

415
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,312
That bastard.

416
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:39,256
Who the hell does that guy think he is,

417
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,835
trying to take on a demon like me?!

418
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:49,648
This is it.

419
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:51,395
It's over for you.

420
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:53,951
Sorry about this.

421
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,485
I don't need your pity...

422
00:33:57,825 --> 00:33:59,159
you scum!

423
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,806
Total Concentration. Water Breathing.

424
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:05,623
Fourth Form...

425
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:12,828
Striking Tide!

426
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,622
Well, that's weird.

427
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,716
I know I heard something over here.

428
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,019
I'm exhausted.

429
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:53,303
Hey, we'll be reaching the Butterfly Mansion soon.

430
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,062
Let me go at once!

431
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:06,483
Meanie!

432
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,323
Please! I'm begging you!

433
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:12,088
Let go! This girl is...

434
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,661
Put me down already!

435
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:13,641
Quit your yapping.

436
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:15,102
Damn, you're loud.

437
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:16,718
Let go of her, jerk!

438
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:19,553
I can't watch this anymore!

439
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:22,486
Please, do something!

440
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,283
Mission. Order.

441
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,407
Shinobu. Superior.

442
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,988
Aoi. Naho. Hashira.

443
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,452
Coin. Order.

444
00:35:30,763 --> 00:35:31,456
Coin.

445
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:34,457
Coin! I'll decide by flipping a coin.

446
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:39,669
Just follow your heart.

447
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:43,824
Kanao!

448
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:45,970
Miss Kanao!

449
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:54,903
Kanao, you...

450
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,901
Oh, Miss Kanao.

451
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:02,280
You're not being very flashy.

452
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:05,584
Need I remind you of the orders you received?

453
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:11,877
If you're gonna be unflashy, then say something!

454
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:15,314
Ch-Charge him at once!

455
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:16,787
Charge him at once!

456
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,026
Charge!

457
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,538
Huh?

458
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,903
Hey, cut it out!

459
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,468
Get off me, you brats!

460
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:26,638
How dare you treat little girls like that!

461
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:27,951
Let go of them, jerk!

462
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:34,388
Wait. Are they swarming this guy

463
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:36,155
or being held captive by him?

464
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:37,223
I can't tell.

465
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:40,147
He's kidnapping those girls!

466
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:41,832
Hurry and rescue them!

467
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:42,979
Why, you--

468
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,499
Shut your mouth!

469
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:00,758
Are you all right?

470
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:01,727
Yes.

471
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,511
You're a fool.

472
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:10,164
I'm Lord Tengen Uzui, a former shinobi...

473
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,715
a man known around here for his resplendency.

474
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,205
Did you really think I'd fall
for one of your vulgar head-butts?

475
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:21,819
You let those girls go! Lousy kidnapper!

476
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:23,408
Yeah, what he said!

477
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:25,729
You have no business doing this!

478
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,482
Dirty man! Dirty man!

479
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:29,138
Show some respect!

480
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,850
Who do you think you're talking to?!

481
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:32,134
I'm your superior!

482
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:34,033
I'm a Hashira, damn it.

483
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:37,503
Well, I don't acknowledge you as a Hashira! Hmph!

484
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,598
Don't give me that face!

485
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:41,998
And why should I care if you don't acknowledge me?

486
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,277
You bottom feeder!

487
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:45,423
Did your brain fall out your head, or what?!

488
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:49,458
I'm taking these two, because I
need female Corps members for a mission!

489
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:52,772
And I don't need permission to
take anyone who's not a Tsuguko!

490
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,278
Naho isn't even a member of the Corps!

491
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,413
Look! She's not wearing the uniform!

492
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:01,921
Never mind.

493
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:04,231
Whoa!

494
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,554
What kind of brute just throws people?!

495
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,527
Ow! He dropped me hard!

496
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,359
For now, I'm just gonna take this one on my mission,

497
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,416
not that she looks very strong.

498
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:18,611
But somehow she is a Corps member, at least.

499
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,396
Everyone has their own personal strengths,

500
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,420
so don't be so insensitive and make comments like that!

501
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,380
Give us back Miss Aoi!

502
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:31,202
Good grief. You're really that lame.

503
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:34,622
No wonder the Demon Slayer
Corps is getting weaker and weaker.

504
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:37,368
They're recruiting wimps like
you who whine about everything.

505
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:46,185
What if we were to go in place of Miss Aoi?

506
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,151
What do you mean, "We"?

507
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:09,091
Who the hell are you two?

508
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:10,724
Got something to say?

509
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,464
I may have just got back from training,

510
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:15,585
but I've got plenty of power to spare.

511
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,809
I'm ready for whatever you got.

512
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:21,581
If you know what's good for you,
you'll let Ms. Aoi go, you hear me?

513
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:25,393
You may be a giant muscular monster, but I'm... not...

514
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:28,022
gonna... back down, nuh-uh!

515
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:34,610
All right, fine.

516
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:37,248
I guess I'm taking you three with me instead.

517
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:42,098
Well, that didn't take much convincing.

518
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:46,378
But only if you three obey my every command.

519
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:58,875
Mr. Tanjiro.

520
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,484
He's huge.

521
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,667
Okay, so where are we going, old man?

522
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,669
The flashiest spot in Japan that's
teeming with lust and desire...

523
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:30,294
...a hotbed for demons, the Entertainment District.

524
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:36,372
Nin-nin!

525
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:46,784
I'm glad things are finally underway!

526
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:51,330
I hope you all know what you signed up for,
'cause this mission is gonna be very spicy.

527
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:53,843
By the way, who the hell even are you all?

528
00:44:53,874 --> 00:44:56,456
I demand you introduce yourselves at once!

529
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,048
I'll go first!

530
00:44:58,379 --> 00:44:59,952
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

531
00:45:00,009 --> 00:45:01,686
I love fatsia sprouts.

532
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:03,769
This is my sister, Nezuko.

533
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,776
She adores konpeito.

534
00:45:07,516 --> 00:45:09,638
My name is Zenitsu Agatsuma,

535
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,338
and I crave sweets all the time.

536
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,118
Not to mention pricey eel!

537
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:15,823
Who cares about any of that crap?!

538
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:19,771
I want to know what you can do to fight
off demons, not what kinda snacks you like!

539
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:23,472
The demons in the Entertainment District are crazy strong.

540
00:45:23,548 --> 00:45:25,798
No! I don't wanna die!

541
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,151
I don't wanna die! What do I do?!

542
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:30,350
Just kill the demons before they kill you.

543
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,413
I don't want to have to fight any more demons!

544
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:34,832
I still haven't done anything with Nezuko yet!

545
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:36,396
I can't die before that!

546
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,337
This guy needs to shut up!

547
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,184
Well, I'm Inosuke Hashibira!

548
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:43,835
If you want to hear about me,

549
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:46,409
you'll have to fight me one-on-one first!

550
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:54,152
Well, now I know this guy has issues.

551
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:55,279
What'd you say?

552
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,291
It's the perfect time for today's Taisho-era secret!

553
00:45:58,345 --> 00:46:00,853
Let me tell you a little bit more about myself.

554
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:03,547
So I was born into a clan of shinobi,

555
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:08,101
and growing up there, I led a
completely unflashy life in the shadows.

556
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:09,529
Really?

557
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:10,556
No way!

558
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:12,014
Lying is bad, you know.

559
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,582
I'm not lying, damn it!

560
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:18,019
My pent-up anger from back then exploded,
turning me into a vibrant young man.

561
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:21,797
Or it could be I was always like this from the very start.

562
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:24,961
You all better have some flashy moves in store, you hear?

563
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:29,728
I'm picking up the scent of a
strong will residing within him.

564
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:32,417
I think we can trust him.

565
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:35,349
What's with that smirk on your face, kid?

566
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:38,586
Next time: "Infiltrating the Entertainment District."

567
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:41,296
What do you think? Are all of you ready to go?

568
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:42,809
Yeah!
