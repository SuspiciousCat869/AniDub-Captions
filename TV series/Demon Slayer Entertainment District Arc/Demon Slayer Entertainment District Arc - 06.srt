1
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,155
I'm growing tired of it,

2
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,722
so I'm putting an end to you now.

3
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,108
Hinokami Kagura!

4
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,654
Raging Sun!

5
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,235
Flame Dance!

6
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,338
That was underwhelming, but...

7
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:29,051
so typical.

8
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,385
He's gone?

9
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:34,967
Hinokami Kagura.

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,608
Fake Rainbow.

11
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:40,379
I can do this!

12
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:42,287
Hinokami Kagura!

13
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:43,549
Fire Wheel!

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,336
Quickly! Recovery Breathing.

15
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,232
I can do this.

16
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:19,236
I can take on an Upper Rank Demon!

17
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,266
That's enough... you ugly brat!

18
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,183
Wait, what?

19
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,097
The belts are entering her body!

20
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,540
No, it's more like the ones that were split off

21
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,575
are now returning to her.

22
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,421
Stand your ground, get your breathing under control...

23
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:02,644
and strike!

24
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,358
I knew it.

25
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,770
She's gone.

26
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,466
It seems I was right.

27
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,586
A Hashira really did show up!

28
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,196
How magnificent.

29
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:20,459
I can't even imagine how pleased my master will be!

30
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,308
She just transformed.

31
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:26,645
Her scent couldn't be more ominous.

32
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:29,086
It's making me sick already...

33
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,389
which means she gained even more power.

34
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,770
But if Uzui really is with
Inosuke and the others right now,

35
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,919
then I can rest easy.

36
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,067
Keep it down out there, will you?!

37
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,851
Is that a sword in your hand, kid?!

38
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,769
You've got a lot of nerve, picking
fights out in front of my House!

39
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,678
What kind of mischief is this?!

40
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:52,262
We made too much noise, and now people are in danger.

41
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:58,050
I'll have you know that this Hanamachi is only
viable because we and our clients all follow the rules,

42
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,221
so if you're gonna cause trouble, you're not welcome here!

43
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,449
Get the hell out of my sight!

44
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,242
You should keep your mouth shut.

45
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,346
This is bad.

46
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:14,821
Please, sir! Don't come this way!

47
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:15,440
Huh?

48
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,183
Stay back, please!

49
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,245
It's too dangerous! Get back inside!

50
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:49,242
Hiro, please. Get up! We have to run! Come on!

51
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,426
Stay calm.

52
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,113
Sir, you're going to survive this...

53
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,422
but your arm...

54
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,805
you need to stop the bleeding.

55
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:07,614
Get back here.

56
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,780
I won't let you get away with this,

57
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:12,577
not after what you just did!

58
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:14,636
What's wrong?

59
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,490
You still have something to say?

60
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,970
Your efforts are useless, and you're hideous.

61
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,627
There's no reason to let ugly people like yourself live,

62
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,755
so do us a favor and die alongside them.

63
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,163
Hiro, wake up!

64
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,480
We have to leave!

65
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:35,553
Help us!

66
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,670
Somebody help us, please!

67
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:39,647
Everyone get back inside!

68
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,117
It's too dangerous to stay out here!

69
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,854
Dear Kamado...

70
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,838
I know now that I wronged you.

71
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,985
Thank you for shedding the tears
I couldn't over my son Kyojuro.

72
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:11,791
And if I'm not mistaken, you've been exchanging
letters with Senjuro for the past four months or so.

73
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,250
He seems to be in a much better place now.

74
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:22,754
I'm horribly ashamed that our first
meeting went the way that it did.

75
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:27,292
At a time when my own incompetence had left me shattered,

76
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,669
things went from bad to worse when
my beloved wife succumbed to illness.

77
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,461
Since then, I've done nothing but
drink myself into a stupor and wallow.

78
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,155
I've been a useless father.

79
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:43,479
Thankfully,

80
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,774
Kyojuro somehow turned out to be a fine son.

81
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,584
Even after I abandoned him as an instructor and a father,

82
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:54,613
he pushed forward, studying the Guide to Flame Breathing,

83
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:56,218
and became a Hashira.

84
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,204
Although there were only three volumes.

85
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:05,037
He must have more of his mother Luca's blood in him.

86
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,398
Both Kyojuro and Senjuro are fine boys.

87
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,513
But, Kamado...

88
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:16,574
you are just as exceptional, if not more, young man.

89
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,908
Rumor has it that those who
are chosen to wield Sun Breathing

90
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,862
are born with the same red mark
on their forehead that you have...

91
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,313
so I'm sure that you will...

92
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,900
No, You're wrong, Mr. Shinjuro.

93
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,891
I wasn't born with this scar to begin with.

94
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:42,327
Originally, it was just a burn mark from when I
protected my younger brother from a falling brazier.

95
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:46,230
After that, I was injured during Final Selection,

96
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,749
which is how it ended up the way it is now.

97
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:52,858
I was told that my father was born
with a faint mark on his forehead,

98
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,500
but that wasn't the case with me,

99
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:00,964
which means I must not be one of the
chosen wielders that you're talking about.

100
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,920
But that doesn't matter right now.

101
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,307
Even if I'm not one of the chosen ones,

102
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,550
even if I'm not up to the task...

103
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:17,327
there are times like this where I can't just back down!

104
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:22,470
Because in this world, there are those
that lack any trace of a human heart...

105
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,477
killing innocent people without any hesitation

106
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,713
and moving on without any regret!

107
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,729
She is that kind of evil,

108
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,267
but as long as I live,

109
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,953
I won't allow it!

110
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:45,714
Those lost lives will never return.

111
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,911
They can't just regenerate.

112
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,085
That's a luxury only demons have.

113
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:56,835
Why do you kill?

114
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,805
Why trample over the lives of the innocent?

115
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,507
I feel like I've heard these same words before.

116
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,812
Such disregard for human life.

117
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,593
What's so amusing about this?

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,472
So tell me then, what is the
weight of a human life to you?

119
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,219
Wait, who was that?

120
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:20,122
Why can't you understand?

121
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,394
How could you ever forget?

122
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,169
Something's not right.

123
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,124
I don't remember this.

124
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:30,708
These aren't my memories at all.

125
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,260
It must be the cells.

126
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,865
They're Lord Muzan's memories.

127
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,010
Muscle! Muscle!

128
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,757
Mus-cle!

129
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:01,569
Hey, you!

130
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:02,201
Hmm?

131
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:05,526
That Worm Belt just flew through that hole and escaped!

132
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,473
Shut up!

133
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:11,286
I saved everyone who was trapped
in here, so what's the issue?!

134
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,928
You should be on your knees worshipping me right now!

135
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,123
We'll talk about the other thing later!

136
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:20,238
Lord Tengen, if you don't go after
it, there'll be even more bloodshed!

137
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,188
Don't worry about us and get
over there before it's too late!

138
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,518
Whoa!

139
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,125
You heard what they said.

140
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,455
Get ready. We're giving chase!

141
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,238
Pick up the pace, boys!

142
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,997
Get out of my way,

143
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:39,245
'cause Lord Tengen is coming through!

144
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,476
How the hell is he so fast?!

145
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,257
What is it? Spit it out.

146
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,570
You were once a human. Isn't that right?

147
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,092
Which means you shed tears and suffered
like any other normal human would.

148
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,560
Just when I thought you couldn't get any more annoying.

149
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:06,246
Luckily I don't remember anything about the past.

150
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,610
I'm a demon now, so who cares about my human past?

151
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:11,614
Life is better like this.

152
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,753
Us demons don't have to buy food or grow old...

153
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,524
or get sick or die.

154
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,842
We have nothing to lose.

155
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:28,442
Not to mention, beautiful, powerful
demons can do anything we want!

156
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,459
I see.

157
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,403
That's enough.

158
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,059
Blood Demon Art.

159
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:42,946
Eight-Layered Obi Slash!

160
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:47,535
Let's see how an idiot like you stops an attack like this,

161
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,705
a cross-blow leaving you with nowhere to run,

162
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:55,335
using the parts of my body that were
split off to take control of this area.

163
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,380
Now that I'm whole again...

164
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,828
my speed is in a class of its own.

165
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,387
Seeing as you could barely hold your own against
my non-Blood Demon Art, it's all over for you.

166
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:10,846
So, hideous boy, I'm going to cut
you and that decrepit sword into pieces.

167
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:17,362
Now then, I'll be making my way to that Hashira.

168
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,400
Hinokami Kagura.

169
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,475
Burning Bones, Summer Sun.

170
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,200
This pain.

171
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,843
What just happened?

172
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:31,860
It feels like I've just suffered
burns where I received that slash,

173
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,157
which means I can't regenerate.

174
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,592
But his wounds must be deep too.

175
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:41,809
Making such violent motions should have
instantly ruptured everything within his body.

176
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,711
What? How is he able to slice my belt?

177
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,010
Something's not right here.

178
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,263
My fingertips...

179
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,510
are trembling?

180
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,018
This isn't like me.

181
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,708
Lord Muzan?

182
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,786
Damn it! Why is he faster than before?

183
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,680
None of this makes any sense!

184
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,325
Don't you feel any pain?!

185
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,060
Are you human?

186
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:20,850
As if someone like you

187
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,847
could ever hope to decapitate a demon as strong as me.

188
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:28,822
It's soft...

189
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,963
too soft for me to cut through.

190
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:34,155
It was able to blunt my slash by bending.

191
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,557
I won't let you get away,

192
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,934
you hideous, vile scum!

193
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,418
There are more belts now,

194
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,778
13 of them.

195
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:47,045
If I dodge them, they might wreak even more havoc.

196
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:49,804
But for some reason...

197
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:53,110
they're moving so slowly.

198
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,737
Just try and cut me now. You can't!

199
00:14:56,853 --> 00:15:00,201
That last exchange of ours was nothing more than a fluke!

200
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,803
What? He gathered all of my belts in one spot.

201
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,800
You think that's enough to stop me?

202
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,161
It'll take more than that!

203
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,844
You might be able to pull them
tight enough to cut through,

204
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:24,421
but I can loosen them all again in the blink of an eye.

205
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,010
So unless you can close the distance
between us faster than that, you...

206
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,195
What? He slashed them.

207
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:38,883
He's fast.

208
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,051
It's simple, really.

209
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,107
I just had to bring my sword down
faster than they could start bending.

210
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,982
I can decapitate her this time.

211
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,396
It's over.

212
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,646
Brother, please!

213
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:56,940
Brother, please!

214
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,907
You have to breathe! Hurry!

215
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:17,136
You humans never cease to amaze
me with how pathetic you all are.

216
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,722
If that really was the best you could do, then I might
actually be starting to feel a little bit bad for you.

217
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,710
I can't stop coughing.

218
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,235
It's so hard to breathe.

219
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,265
Which means I must've gone
well beyond my stamina threshold.

220
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,276
My vision's going dark.

221
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:37,480
All I can hear is the sound of my heartbeat.

222
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,000
Since you're human,

223
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm afraid your wounds won't be healing anytime soon.

224
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,184
Blame your own flesh and blood.

225
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,611
Stand up.

226
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,237
Wield your sword.

227
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:55,196
But I'll do you a favor and show
you how to decapitate your enemy.

228
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,704
You have some nerve doing that!

229
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:29,070
Wait a second.

230
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,534
That filthy traitor, it's you, isn't it?!

231
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:35,574
The one he was talking about has to be you!

232
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:42,912
Daki, there's a demon out there
that managed to slip from my grasp,

233
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,820
just as Tamayo did.

234
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:48,605
I need you to find and dispose of her.

235
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,055
You're the only one I can turn to.

236
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,494
It shouldn't be hard to recognize her.

237
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:58,313
She's a girl clad in a hemp-leaf-pattern
kimono and a checkered belt.

238
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,599
Lord Muzan...

239
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:09,927
I will happily eviscerate this hideous little runt.

240
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,452
Prepare to die, scum.

241
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,902
Is kicking the only thing you know?

242
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,070
You bottom feeder!

243
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:37,444
Could you be any weaker?

244
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:39,827
You've barely consumed any humans.

245
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,104
It's a miracle you were able to escape Lord Muzan.

246
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,327
Aw, you poor thing!

247
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:49,975
Your torso and lower body went their separate ways.

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,224
I wouldn't try moving if I were you.

249
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,775
After all, there's no way a
half-developed demon like yourself

250
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,300
could possibly regenerate
quickly enough to continue fighting.

251
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:03,947
But since we're both demons,
I'll quit toying around with you,

252
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,384
and instead I'll absorb you into my belt
and expose you to the sun in the morning.

253
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,480
Like I'd waste my time finishing
you off when I have a Hashira to kill.

254
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,846
Huh?

255
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,480
What's going on?

256
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,974
She's regenerated her leg.

257
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,662
Never mind her leg. How is she able to stand?

258
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,556
I'm sure I severed her in half.

259
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

260
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:36,544
There's no way I missed.

261
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:44,917
I didn't expect this.

262
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,534
Her healing and regeneration speed
is on par with Upper Rank Demons.

263
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,633
What is this intimidating
presence that's radiating from her?

264
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,706
Her whole demeanor's changed.

265
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,759
Brother...

266
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:26,284
you and Sister sure do take after one another.

267
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:30,825
You're gentle, but scary when you get mad...

268
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:32,989
like Sister.

269
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,390
When that scary grown-up bumped into a kid and hurt him,

270
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,780
she got in his face, demanding he apologize.

271
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:44,586
I mean, luckily there were tons of adults around,

272
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,347
but it still made me nervous.

273
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,772
People who get mad at others don't tend
to have any regard for their own safety.

274
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:58,775
Because of that, they risk losing so much,

275
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,437
which... well...

276
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:02,490
it scares me.

277
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,488
Another kick?

278
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,770
There goes two of your limbs.

279
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:15,992
Now for your neck!

280
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,810
Nin-nin!

281
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:07,776
Monjiro! We're coming to save you,
so don't croak before we get there!

282
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:11,826
How can you run while you're sleeping?

283
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:15,756
Can you see ahead of you?

284
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,503
Is this any better?

285
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,455
Whoa. That's pretty good for you.

286
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,638
Hey, where'd the God of Festivals go?

287
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,385
You two better pick up the pace!

288
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,755
God of Festivals!

289
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,025
We're out of time, so there's no Taisho-era secret today!

290
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,876
Next, Episode Seven, "Transformation."

291
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,314
Now quit goofing off. Let's go!
