1
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:50,822
Kamado!

2
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:55,362
Kamado! Get up!

3
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:56,387
It's not over yet!

4
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,085
What... What is he saying?

5
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:02,390
Does it mean...

6
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,985
I didn't cut off his head?

7
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,626
Mr. Uzui is...

8
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:11,052
...saying something.

9
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:14,682
You gotta run!

10
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,462
Nezuko.

11
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:26,962
How awful.

12
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:29,318
Everything's destroyed.

13
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,499
Mm?

14
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,781
You saved me, didn't you, Nezuko?

15
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,382
I owe you one.

16
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,781
Hold on. What about the others?

17
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:47,092
I can't move my body.

18
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,196
Wait...

19
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:51,071
how am I able to move at all?

20
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,186
How am I alive?

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,428
Wasn't I poisoned?

22
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,511
Tanjiro!

23
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,076
I hear Zenitsu.

24
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:03,426
Tanjiro!

25
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:06,216
Help me!

26
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,532
Tanjiro!

27
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,666
I woke up, and my body hurts all over!

28
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,742
Are both of my legs broken?!

29
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:21,302
What's going on?! Who did this to me, Tanjiro?!

30
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,715
I'm in so much pain! It hurts so bad, I can't look!

31
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,492
Oh, good. You're okay, then!

32
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,287
I'm anything but okay!

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,721
I deserve pity too, but Inosuke's in even worse shape!

34
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,862
The sound of his heartbeat is getting fainter and fainter!

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,103
Inosuke! Where is he?

36
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:42,278
He's right over there, but you better get to him fast!

37
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,634
Inosuke!

38
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,405
Inosuke, just hang in there, all right?!

39
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,038
Stay with me!

40
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,044
I can feel his heart growing weaker by the second.

41
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:02,487
I've gotta neutralize the poison.

42
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,976
I know. What about sunlight?

43
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,057
Daybreak's too far, though.

44
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,601
What do I do? What do I do?

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,489
Send a crow to Ms. Shinobu?

46
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,211
No, there's not enough time.

47
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,795
If I don't something right now, Inosuke's going to die.

48
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,702
Why was my life the one that was spared? Why me?

49
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,985
His skin damaged by the poison...

50
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:34,545
it's starting to heal.

51
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,592
I'm starving.

52
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,096
Give me something to eat!

53
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,438
Inosuke!

54
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,140
Knock it off!

55
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,929
You're creeping me out!

56
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,652
No!

57
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,562
Please don't die on us!

58
00:04:57,612 --> 00:05:01,535
You can't just leave us all alone like this, Lord Tengen!

59
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,662
Not after we managed to survive!

60
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,603
Not after we won the fight!

61
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,034
Not here! Not here!

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,509
The antidote still isn't working!

63
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,435
How are we supposed to deal with demon poison?!

64
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:18,210
Why is God so cruel?! Why?!

65
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:24,684
Listen closely, for these are my last words.

66
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,932
My life, up until this very moment...

67
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:32,126
If you let Lord Tengen die, then
I'm never gonna pray to you ever again!

68
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:35,692
There's no way I'll ever forgive you! Do you hear me?!

69
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,572
Would you just shut up, already?!

70
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,832
Lord Tengen is giving us his final words!

71
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,982
I'm gonna stuff your mouth with rocks, you moron!

72
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:45,109
You both need to quiet down!

73
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:49,811
I can't do that if Makio keeps bullying me like this!

74
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:50,967
Shut up, idiot!

75
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,340
You're kidding.

76
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,921
Am I gonna die without saying my last words?

77
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:57,372
That's enough, you two!

78
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:00,333
The poison's starting to make my tongue stiff.

79
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,458
What am I supposed to do?

80
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:03,187
Don't spit it out!

81
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,310
I could've left those last words, but...

82
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,031
Why are you putting rocks in my mouth?!

83
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,302
Seriously?

84
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:10,536
Huh?

85
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:11,656
What?

86
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:14,378
Hmm?

87
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:18,734
Hey!

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,302
Just what do you think you're doing?!

89
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:22,755
And who are you, anyway?!

90
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,377
Isn't this a little early to be cremating him?!

91
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:28,351
Look at him! He's not even dead yet!

92
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,361
Who does something like that?!

93
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,123
You deserve a spanking, young lady!

94
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:33,282
Hold on a second.

95
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,292
Huh?!

96
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,636
What on Earth is happening to me?

97
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,288
She removed the poison.

98
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,238
Lord Tengen!

99
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,540
Thank goodness. You're safe!

100
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:59,618
Sorry, you three, for making you worry.

101
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:03,123
Nezuko's Blood Demon Art,

102
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,612
it must have burned away all of the poison.

103
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:08,249
Not that I'm really sure how any of it works.

104
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,837
Please take it easy, though.

105
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,487
It didn't heal your wounds.

106
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:14,789
I'm so glad you're safe.

107
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,526
But how can this even be possible?

108
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,321
I'm totally lost.

109
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:20,712
Hey, wait.

110
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:21,826
You need to rest too.

111
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:22,568
Look at you.

112
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,500
Thank you!

113
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,995
I'm gonna go search for the demons' heads.

114
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,224
I have to find them, or I can't rest easy.

115
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,932
Nezuko, head that way!

116
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,647
I can smell demon blood.

117
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,862
That must be what I smelled.

118
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,030
Is it a pool of demon blood?

119
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,225
All right. It won't be attacking anymore.

120
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,442
I collected the blood of an Upper Rank demon!

121
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:12,019
Take this to Ms. Tamayo.

122
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:18,186
I'm counting on you.

123
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,525
There's no one in sight.

124
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,933
Makio and the others must have
managed to evacuate everyone.

125
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:31,127
What a relief.

126
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,189
Nezuko, that way.

127
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,035
Let's head over there.

128
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,548
The demon scent is getting stronger.

129
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:47,297
I can't believe you got beheaded by a couple of amateurs!

130
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,232
So you were watching after all!

131
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,415
Why didn't you save me, then, huh?!

132
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:55,176
I was too busy battling a Hashira!

133
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,447
I don't care if you were!

134
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:58,972
You should have finished him off when you had the chance!

135
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,936
You could have just split his head wide open!

136
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,476
And I was about to!

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,182
Yeah, right!

138
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:06,197
But that kid with the earrings was somehow still alive,

139
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,442
so I figured I should kill him off first!

140
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:11,443
Since you weren't doing a damn thing to help out,

141
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,341
you should have been the one to finish off the Hashira!

142
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,752
Well, maybe you should have just
controlled me so I could do that!

143
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:21,431
But instead you went and let your guard down as usual!

144
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:22,622
Shut your mouth!

145
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,000
They're still alive?

146
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,002
Not only that, but they're arguing.

147
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:27,422
You should at least be able to handle...

148
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:30,342
It also looks like their bodies
are starting to disintegrate.

149
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:32,034
You're the only idiot here!

150
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,452
What'd you say?!

151
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:41,926
A hideous person like you

152
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:45,293
couldn't possibly be my brother.

153
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,652
I mean, just look at you.

154
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:52,297
I bet we're not even related by blood,

155
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,330
not with how ugly you are!

156
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,532
And now you're useless!

157
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,013
Your one saving grace is your strength!

158
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,923
And that's all you ever had!

159
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,272
You're completely useless if you end up losing,

160
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:07,546
so you're just a worthless, ugly freak now!

161
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,477
Don't give me that crap!

162
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:17,303
If you were on your own, you'd be dead now!

163
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,291
How many times have I saved you?!

164
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:23,117
You're the worthless one, and you know it.

165
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,425
You're too weak to stand on your own two feet.

166
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:31,654
I can't believe I wasted my entire
life protecting someone as useless as you.

167
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:36,704
If it hadn't been for you, maybe I
would have done something with my life!

168
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,550
Maybe I wouldn't be dying right now!

169
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:44,291
If only I didn't waste all of my
time cleaning up after your messes.

170
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,779
You should have never been born in the first pla...

171
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:51,948
That's not true.

172
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,205
I know you don't really feel like that.

173
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:57,842
You don't mean it.

174
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:01,416
Think it over.

175
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,312
You two have no one but each other.

176
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,628
There's no one who will forgive you for what you've done.

177
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:14,728
You'll be resented, despised, and
denounced by everyone you've killed.

178
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,272
Nobody will ever be on your side.

179
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:21,467
So quit cursing each other out like this,

180
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,803
because all you have is each other in this world.

181
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,274
Why don't you mind your own damn business?!

182
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,929
What gives you the right to sit there and lecture us?!

183
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,364
As if a brat like you knows anything!

184
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,392
Do us all a favor and get lost!

185
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,929
I can't believe this is happening.

186
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:53,783
I'm not ready to die yet.

187
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,192
Please do something!

188
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,105
Do something, Brother!

189
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:00,699
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!

190
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,434
Help me, Brother!

191
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,609
Help me, Brothe...

192
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,008
Ume!

193
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,070
That's right.

194
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,380
My little sister's name was never Daki.

195
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,426
It was Ume.

196
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:19,467
Daki's a godawful name.

197
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,475
To be fair, "Ume" was pretty bad too.

198
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:36,299
It's hard not to hate it, since you were named
after the very disease that killed our mother.

199
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:40,738
The Rashomon Riverbank,

200
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,766
the lowest class of the Entertainment
District where we were born.

201
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:50,287
Children here were seen as extra mouths
to feed, so we were cursed for being born.

202
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:54,582
My mother nearly killed me more
than once while I was in her womb.

203
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:57,842
She also tried to kill me after I was born,

204
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,851
since I was nothing but a burden.

205
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,352
And yet, I survived.

206
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:06,907
My body was weak, like a withered leaf,

207
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:10,205
but I clung to life with the strength I had left.

208
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,078
Worm, moron, cretin...

209
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:17,239
coward, good-for-nothing, dead weight.

210
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,482
I was mocked for my ugly voice and appearance.

211
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:23,286
Sometimes, they'd even throw rocks at me for it.

212
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:31,582
It felt like every insult in the world
was created to leave an emotional scar on me.

213
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:35,491
Not only was I hideous,

214
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,292
I was filthy too,

215
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,042
covered in grime from head to toe

216
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,665
and giving off the stench of death.

217
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:47,765
It didn't help that I lived in the Entertainment District,

218
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,995
where beauty was the measure of your value.

219
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:53,564
I was treated like a monster.

220
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,232
Whenever I would get hungry,

221
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,229
I would eat mice and insects.

222
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:03,887
My only toy was a sickle a customer left behind.

223
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,952
Soon though, things started to change for me...

224
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:12,625
after Ume was born.

225
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:17,567
Ume...

226
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,591
you were my pride and joy, you know.

227
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:28,327
Even at a young age, people couldn't help
but marvel at the sight of your beautiful face.

228
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:36,788
I quickly discovered I was good at fighting
and started working as a debt collector.

229
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:41,040
I might have revolted everyone, but they feared me too,

230
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:44,242
and that brought me pure joy.

231
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,162
My ugliness became my source of pride,

232
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:53,897
and because I had such a gorgeous sister,

233
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,665
my sense of inferiority was washed away as well.

234
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,632
Call it wishful thinking, but I really had the feeling

235
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:07,713
that we were on the fast track to a better life.

236
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,728
Until you turned 13.

237
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,753
She stabbed a customer in the
eye with a hairpin in self-defense.

238
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:32,498
When news got out that it was a samurai,

239
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,522
her hands and feet were bound,
and then she was burned alive.

240
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,285
I wasn't there.

241
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:42,652
By the time I got home from work,

242
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,668
you were burnt to a crisp.

243
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,135
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

244
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,917
What did I do to deserve this?!

245
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:04,480
You're taking her away after so
long of not giving me anything?!

246
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,502
I won't forgive you!

247
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:08,817
I'll never forgive you!

248
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:11,534
Bring my sister back now, damn it!

249
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,344
If you don't, I'll kill every one of you!

250
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,796
None of the gods are safe from my rage!

251
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:27,438
Is this the one causing you trouble?

252
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,753
Oh, yes. That's the one, all right.

253
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:31,342
Thank goodness.

254
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:34,367
You've done everyone a favor getting rid of that nuisance.

255
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:36,569
He was nothing but a savage.

256
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:41,307
All he did was cause trouble and severely
injure the people he was collecting from.

257
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:44,929
I suppose it's a shame that we lost Ume,

258
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:48,112
but as soon I find another cute girl, she's all yours.

259
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,342
So, um, about the money you owe...

260
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:51,815
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,032
After I finish him off.

262
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:04,533
Huh?

263
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,328
Look at you.

264
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,012
That's a fine kimono you're wearing, isn't it?

265
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:15,460
You're clean, and you have such smooth skin as well.

266
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:22,193
I bet someone like you lives pretty comfortably,
with plenty of food and a nice clean bed.

267
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:27,192
That kind of life is all you've ever known, isn't it,

268
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:31,032
living in a house that shelters
you from the rain and wind.

269
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,790
Good for you.

270
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:37,895
Good for you!

271
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:44,502
But when you've got it as good as
you do, you don't get to complain.

272
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:48,494
Losing one of your eyes is nothing,
compared to what we go through every day.

273
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,643
It's almost laughable, really.

274
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:07,522
No one ever offered to help us.

275
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,432
No surprises there.

276
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:13,502
That was just the story of our daily lives.

277
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:17,742
No one batted an eye to our suffering, even at its worst.

278
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,405
And then it would start to snow.

279
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:31,022
Day in and day out, we were neglected
and denied any bit of mercy from bystanders.

280
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,173
Why was that?

281
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,417
So much for "fortune and misfortune are intertwined."

282
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:44,300
Our entire lives were filled
with tragedy, pain, and suffering.

283
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:49,065
You two don't look so good.

284
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,931
Aw, you poor things.

285
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:56,327
You're lucky someone as
kindhearted as me stumbled upon you.

286
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,211
I hate to say it,

287
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,775
but that girl is nearly dead.

288
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,626
How 'bout I give you some blood?

289
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,413
What do you think of that?

290
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:12,291
That way, you can become demons, if he chooses you.

291
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,160
Life is far too sacred to let it go to waste,

292
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:21,911
and you should treasure it while you can.

293
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:27,553
Now, then, can you become worthy demons?

294
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,903
Maybe you'll be a Twelve Kizuki like me

295
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,232
and rise to the Upper Ranks.

296
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,609
I wonder.

297
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,112
To be honest,

298
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,591
I don't regret becoming a demon.

299
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,765
No matter how many times I'm reborn,

300
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,877
I'll become a demon every time

301
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:51,057
if that's what it takes to enact vengeance.

302
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:55,212
I'll never show mercy to anyone
who has a better life than me.

303
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:57,796
However...

304
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,501
there is one thing I regret that continues to haunt me.

305
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:10,874
Ume, had I never taught you my way of
life, you might have turned out differently.

306
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:19,125
Had you only worked at a better House,
you might have become a respectable Oiran.

307
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,730
And if you'd been born to normal parents,

308
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,365
maybe then you could have lived a normal life.

309
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:35,026
Who knows? If you'd been born into a good family,
maybe you would have become a well-bred young lady.

310
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:41,425
You do have a very impressionable personality, you know.

311
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:46,057
Maybe you only turned out this way
because I was the one who raised you.

312
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,260
"Take before someone takes from you,"

313
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:50,964
that's what I taught you,

314
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,471
which led to you stabbing that samurai in the eye.

315
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,305
But if you'd done as he said,

316
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,539
maybe you could have actually
made a better life for yourself.

317
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,440
My only regret as a human...

318
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:16,268
it was you, Ume.

319
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:27,925
Where exactly am I?

320
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,848
Is this place Hell?

321
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:31,923
Is that you, Brother?

322
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:32,630
Eh?

323
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,587
Wherever we are, I wanna leave!

324
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,294
It's awful here.

325
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,043
Please take me home. I'm begging you!

326
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,340
Look at you.

327
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,204
Why are you in a place like this?

328
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:51,786
Is the exit that way?

329
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,290
Please, Ume.

330
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:57,903
You don't have to follow me anymore.

331
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,786
What do you mean, Brother?

332
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:02,663
Of course I do! I've always...

333
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,194
Don't follow me!

334
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,575
Are you mad about what I said?

335
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,682
I'm sorry for saying that stuff!

336
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:14,061
I promise you I don't think you're ugly at all, Brother!

337
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:17,192
I was just bitter! I was bitter because we lost!

338
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:21,213
I said it because I didn't want to
admit that it was my fault it happened!

339
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,992
I'm sorry for not putting up more of a fight against them!

340
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,072
I'm sorry I wasn't useful enough!

341
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:33,048
I'm sorry I caused us to end up
here, that I'm always dragging you down!

342
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,421
Forgive me! Please!

343
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:42,206
From here on out, you're not my sister anymore.

344
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:43,338
You're nothing to me.

345
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,758
Do what you want, but don't follow me.

346
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:51,404
It's time we go our separate ways.

347
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:53,966
You walk towards the light.

348
00:22:58,591 --> 00:22:59,450
Stop!

349
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,599
Brother, please!

350
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,152
Please don't leave!

351
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:06,702
You can't! I won't let go!

352
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:09,392
We're always going to be together!

353
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:14,922
No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'll always be your sister, no matter what!

354
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,334
Please don't hate me or scold me.

355
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:22,009
Please don't leave me here all by myself!

356
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,251
I'll never forgive you if you leave me behind!

357
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,907
You said we would always be together!

358
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,703
How could you? How could you?

359
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't you remember the promise we made?

360
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,368
Have you forgotten?

361
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,058
If we're together, nothing can shake us...

362
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:58,850
cold or hunger doesn't bother us at all.

363
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,100
I promise you we'll always be together.

364
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,462
I will never leave your side.

365
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:07,388
See?

366
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:10,412
You're not afraid of anything now, are you?

367
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:00,917
Did they make up?

368
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:02,997
I hope so.

369
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,106
It's finally over.

370
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:16,337
I've never been so tired.

371
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:22,088
Hmm? I see.

372
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:23,752
Really now?

373
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:25,718
Upper Six, eh?

374
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,975
Unfortunately that would be the lowest of the Upper Ranks.

375
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:36,360
Well, Six or not, you still defeated an Upper
Rank, so I believe congratulations are in order.

376
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,953
Though it was Six...

377
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:42,411
I guess you've earned some praise.

378
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:45,712
I don't know if that was a compliment or not, but thanks.

379
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:46,832
What he said!

380
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:48,851
You took your sweet time getting here.

381
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:51,684
Y-Y-Yeah, you showed up after all the fighting!

382
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:52,931
How convenient!

383
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:55,907
Scary!

384
00:25:56,368 --> 00:26:00,372
What exactly do you plan on doing now
that you've lost your left hand and left eye,

385
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:03,798
and how long will it take you
to return to duty after this?

386
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,922
You'll need a replacement in the meantime.

387
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,048
Any ideas of who can fill in for you until then?

388
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,656
I'm actually retiring.

389
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,969
There's just no way that I can still fight.

390
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:17,110
I'm sure the Master will understand that much.

391
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,462
Don't be ridiculous.

392
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,089
I don't allow it.

393
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,961
Too many swordsmen have fallen
for you to consider retiring.

394
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:28,942
We still haven't filled the
Hashira spot that Rengoku left behind.

395
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:32,512
Even being in your present condition
is better than nothing at all.

396
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:34,862
You'll fight until you perish.

397
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:35,954
Nah...

398
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,635
I know just the young swordsman to replace me.

399
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,500
Do you remember that new kid that you love to hate?

400
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,199
What?

401
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:49,186
You're joking.

402
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,672
You mean he survived?

403
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:53,920
A battle like this?

404
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,875
Tanjiro Kamado survived?

405
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:05,481
You're positive?

406
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,923
They defeated them, two Upper Rank demons?

407
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,811
You have my thanks, Tengen,

408
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:16,070
Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke!

409
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:20,433
Master Kagaya.

410
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,867
One hundred years.

411
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:26,315
It took 100 years for something to finally change,

412
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,406
and it actually happened.

413
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:30,114
Amane...

414
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,268
Yes?

415
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:38,592
Don't you see? This must be an omen.

416
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,537
Fate is about to take a dramatic turn for us.

417
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,359
The effects will be widespread.

418
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:48,469
Everything will be shaken to its core.

419
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:53,041
And eventually he will feel it as well.

420
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:56,118
Muzan Kibutsuji...

421
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,306
we will defeat you.

422
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:02,516
Our generation will put an end to you without fail,

423
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:05,611
and then you, the sole blemish of my family,

424
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:06,750
will be gone.

425
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:11,873
Children, quick, boil some water.

426
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,132
Go fetch his medicine and get some towels.

427
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:15,374
Quickly!

428
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:16,134
Father!

429
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:17,342
Father!

430
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:18,375
Father!

431
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,652
The alternate dimension...

432
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:34,133
The Infinity Castle.

433
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,596
The fact I was summoned here can only mean one thing.

434
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:43,181
They managed to kill an Upper Rank.

435
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:51,865
Damn it!

436
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,545
It really hurts.

437
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,513
Thank goodness.

438
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:59,354
Oh, Lord Tengen, I'm so relieved that you're okay!

439
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,227
Yeah, no kidding.

440
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,512
You really had us worried there.

441
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:09,414
And, hey, all four of us are returning still intact.

442
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:11,417
You're right.

443
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:12,937
Now let's go home...

444
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,245
in a flashy way!

445
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:21,311
We all survived!

446
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,525
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,109
We did it,

448
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:34,850
and we all lived to see it too.
