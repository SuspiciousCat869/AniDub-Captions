1
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:03,427
Oiran! Oiran!

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:05,954
Come on. Let's play! Let's play!

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:07,648
All right, then.

4
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:08,765
Oiran!

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:09,350
Huh?

6
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:12,003
Can you read me a story?

7
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,715
Well, certainly.

8
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:15,112
Which should I read?

9
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,813
Let's see. How about...

10
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:19,057
This one!

11
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,315
Can you read me this story?

12
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:24,271
When I finish reading hers, all right?

13
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,407
I promise I'll get to yours after.

14
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:28,823
You can just read mine later.

15
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,336
Read mine later!

16
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,071
Why are you always copying me?

17
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,637
Well, uh...

18
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,049
Now, now, you two.

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,845
Oh, that reminds me.

20
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,647
Come see.

21
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,480
I have something to give you two.

22
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:44,677
What is it?

23
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,603
What are you giving us, Oiran?

24
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:54,950
Oh, wow!

25
00:00:56,592 --> 00:00:57,620
But why?

26
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:01,104
These are really special treasures
of yours, aren't they, Oiran?

27
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,662
It's all right.

28
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,314
Don't you worry about that.

29
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,616
You're also very special to me,

30
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:08,742
which is why I'm giving them to you.

31
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,291
Thank you, Oiran!

32
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,944
Oiran, Oiran, put this comb on me.

33
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:19,538
Hurry! Hurry!

34
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,476
Okay, okay. One at a time.

35
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:02,757
Nowhere to be found?

36
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,897
That's right. Uh...

37
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:06,578
the one with yellow hair.

38
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,098
Zenko, maybe?

39
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:11,174
She had fainted, so we put her to bed to rest.

40
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:13,074
Now she's not in her room.

41
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,962
Should we look for her?

42
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:16,882
Don't bother.

43
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,797
I'm sure that the girl is fine.

44
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:21,537
It's ashinuke. What do I care?

45
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,844
She left, so it's not our business.

46
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:25,493
Just forget it.

47
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:27,407
What?! But, Master...

48
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,153
Shut the hell up!

49
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,315
Dismissed!

50
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,868
Don't ever mention Zenko's name again.

51
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,328
Tell the others not to, either.

52
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:47,305
This wouldn't have happened if they
hadn't got on Oiran Warabahime's nerves.

53
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,737
Both Zenko and O-Mitsu.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,455
I told you!

55
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:58,680
There's a demon at my house, all right?!

56
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,927
Really?

57
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,707
I'm telling you, it looked like this!

58
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,504
You know what I mean. Like this!

59
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,347
Yeah. I totally believe you.

60
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,449
Just hold on a second.

61
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:13,127
Like this? Now you see what I'm saying?

62
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:17,597
Yeah. Anyway, Mr. Uzui and Zenitsu
should be coming to check in soon.

63
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:19,132
And it was like this!

64
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,227
I couldn't be any clearer here if I tried!

65
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,425
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

66
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,580
Zenitsu won't be coming.

67
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,201
There's no doubt.

68
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:31,129
This guy's the real deal!

69
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,884
He didn't make a sound,

70
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,464
not even the slightest puff of air.

71
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,552
Wait, Zenitsu's not coming?

72
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,080
What do you mean by that?

73
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:44,457
I feel bad now about putting you all through this.

74
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,650
It seems I was so desperate to rescue my wives in time

75
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:52,119
that I made some poor decisions regarding the mission.

76
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,217
As it stands, Zenitsu is missing.

77
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,557
There's been no contact since last night.

78
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,353
You two should leave now.

79
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,221
You're ranked too low for this.

80
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,423
If the demon here turns out to be an Upper Rank,

81
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,792
you'll be dead weight.

82
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,607
If you vanish from here, they'll
just assume that you're dead.

83
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,617
Therefore, I'm continuing on my own.

84
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,900
Please, Mr. Uzui! We can help...

85
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,053
Don't be ashamed.

86
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,937
Life is all about survival,

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,737
so take this chance and get out.

88
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:31,627
Get back here, old man!

89
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:38,184
Maybe he's not able to put his trust in us.

90
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,579
Is it because we're the lowest rank?

91
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,518
We're not the lowest rank now.

92
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,865
We're Kanoe. We did get promoted.

93
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:46,525
Huh?

94
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,955
Did you forget the rankings?

95
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,720
We used to be Mizunoto, at the very bottom right?

96
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,377
Well, now we're fourth from the bottom, Kanoe!

97
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,068
Wait, what?! You guys actually caught up to me?!

98
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,302
Eat it, you pissant crybaby!

99
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,247
We'll be moving past you in no time!

100
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,357
Say that again, you stupid boar!

101
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,024
I'll do you one better!

102
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,008
You ready? Watch this.

103
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,278
Show me my current ranking.

104
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,650
Cool, huh?!

105
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,531
What was that?

106
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:30,892
What? They messed with your
hand on Wisteria Mountain, right?

107
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,322
I think I remember that, but
I'm not sure. I was so exhausted.

108
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,598
Wisteria Flower Engraving.

109
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,811
You have to say that phrase and
flex your muscles to invoke it.

110
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,157
I had no clue we could do stuff like that.

111
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,359
It proves we're Demon Slayer Corps.

112
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,824
Come on now. Cheer up!

113
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,827
That's right!

114
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:53,625
We don't have time to mope around!

115
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,784
I'll head over to your Ogimoto House

116
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,832
once night falls, so wait for me 'til then.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,050
It's too risky to make a move on your own.

118
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,757
Why should I wait for you?!

119
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,679
I still need to finish investigating my own house!

120
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,578
I already told you the demon's at
my house, so quit wasting our time!

121
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:11,765
Wait 'til night?!

122
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,169
How stupid are you?!

123
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,114
Do they ever shut up?

124
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,578
That's not what I meant!

125
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,471
Huh?!

126
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:23,822
Mr. Uzui was patrolling outside of
our houses during the night, right?

127
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,537
Ow, ow, ow!

128
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,772
Even so, Zenitsu still disappeared,

129
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:31,203
and the demon over at your place
is nowhere to be seen right now!

130
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:35,677
Inosuke, can you please stop smacking me around?

131
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,257
Which leads me to believe

132
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,644
there's a passage that leads into the building.

133
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,497
Eh? Passage?

134
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,234
That's right.

135
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,209
And it hasn't been spotted going in and out of the house,

136
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:50,051
which means the demon is probably working from the inside.

137
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,753
If that is what's happening here

138
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,817
and it's cleverly disguising itself as a human,

139
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,292
then it would kill its victims carefully.

140
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,342
Makes sense, right?

141
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,309
Yeah, it does.

142
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,632
Cleaning up after a murder would be a real hassle.

143
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:08,429
Washing bloodstains is no easy task.

144
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,944
This is a nightlife district,

145
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,567
which can be convenient for demons,

146
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,323
but also an obstacle.

147
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,897
They've gotta work at night after all.

148
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:20,366
It'd be odd if they weren't around.

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,127
You're right.

150
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,231
I think Zenitsu and Mr. Uzui's wives

151
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:27,746
are all still alive,

152
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,732
so I'll proceed with that in mind,

153
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,609
and I will rescue them.

154
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,786
I want you to take action with that in mind too, Inosuke.

155
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,910
But at the same time, I don't want you to die.

156
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,777
Is that all right with you?

157
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,517
I think everything you said just now...

158
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:53,449
is exactly what I was about to say myself!

159
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,423
Oiran, we brought you your tea.

160
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,462
Why, thank you. I can do the rest of it myself.

161
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:05,928
You two go on and have dinner.

162
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,242
All right!

163
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,238
We'll be going on ahead, then.

164
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:13,307
Don't be long!

165
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,380
Huh?

166
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,295
I love you, Oiran Koinatsu!

167
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,222
I love you too, Oiran!

168
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:24,582
How sweet.

169
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:26,337
I love you both as well.

170
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,472
Now get to dinner, you two.

171
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,499
Okay!

172
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,642
Oiran looked happy, didn't she?

173
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,888
She did!

174
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,769
Those girls are something else.

175
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,302
Miss Koinatsu?

176
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,950
O-Sumi?

177
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,050
It's you?

178
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,434
Forgive me for intruding just now.

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,204
However, I have a favor to ask.

180
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,201
I'm leaving the Tokito House after this.

181
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,453
Would you give Master my payment for lodging?

182
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,541
What's going on?

183
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,458
And why are you dressed so...

184
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:13,686
I had to dress as a woman for my mission,

185
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,314
but I'm actually a guy.

186
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,287
Oh, I already knew that.

187
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:21,061
Your voice gave it away. Sorry.

188
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:23,756
What?

189
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,177
Well, it was obvious from the start.

190
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:28,785
I've known the whole time.

191
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,875
I admit I was a bit curious as to what you were up to.

192
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,180
I guess I was busted from the beginning.

193
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,607
But you have your reasons, right?

194
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,092
Were you worried about Suma for real,

195
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:45,258
or was that a lie?

196
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,605
No! I was telling the truth!

197
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,277
I would never lie like that!

198
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,487
As for everyone that vanished,

199
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,256
I promise I'll rescue them.

200
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,040
Why, thank you.

201
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,108
I think I needed to hear that.

202
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:03,549
Because you see, I'm actually
leaving this district for good tomorrow.

203
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:05,547
No way. Are you, really?

204
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:07,437
You must be ecstatic about that!

205
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:11,448
It seems there's someone who
would want even me as his wife,

206
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,082
which makes me so happy.

207
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:16,249
But...

208
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,326
that could be why I've been worried
sick lately about those I'm leaving behind.

209
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,291
Even if I thought I knew something was wrong,

210
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,988
I'd have no way of even looking into it.

211
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,756
But that isn't your fault.

212
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:33,778
Please don't worry about it.

213
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,751
All you can do is move forward.

214
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,146
And you too.

215
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,622
I don't want you to disappear either, Sumi.

216
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,275
Be careful.

217
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:54,416
Now, then, I'll be off.

218
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,809
I wish you the best.

219
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,295
Thank you, Sumi. Best of luck to you.

220
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,472
And I'm counting on you to save Suma.

221
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:07,712
Right.

222
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:24,452
Eh?

223
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:27,179
Oh, did you forget something?

224
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:30,717
No, but thank you.

225
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:34,324
However, I really should devour you before I do forget.

226
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,182
Since tonight happens to be your last night here,

227
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,629
you can't leave without saying goodbye.

228
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,782
Not good. The sun's almost done setting.

229
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,053
I've got to get to Inosuke's place fast.

230
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:03,940
There's a scent.

231
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:06,187
It's faint, but it smells sweet.

232
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,167
It's a demon! It has to be!

233
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,990
And it's nearby. This is bad.

234
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,477
He's late!

235
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,416
It's almost nightfall, and he's still not here yet!

236
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,638
Way to mess things up, Souichiro!

237
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:37,608
I'll just take action by myself with the
spirit of "comin' through" flowing within my heart!

238
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:41,354
Yaah!

239
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:44,461
Come on out, mice, and bring my swords!

240
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,884
Oh, man.

241
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,974
Uzui's something else, huh?

242
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:55,717
Muscle! Muscle! Muscle!

243
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,010
I gotta thank him for setting me
up with these Muscular Mice of his.

244
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,227
I wanna boss around some ninju too!

245
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,456
Muscle!

246
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:06,492
Muscle!

247
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:08,399
Muscle! Muscle!

248
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,560
It's time to vanquish a demon!

249
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,129
Make way...

250
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,935
'cause I'm comin' through!

251
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,239
What happened to Zenko and Hinatsuru?

252
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:33,572
Give me the short version.

253
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,120
And don't even think about asking questions.

254
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,677
Zenko just disappeared.

255
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:48,422
Hinatsuru fell ill, and so she was sent to the Kirimise.

256
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,918
Tell me everything that you think might be relevant.

257
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,329
Who is it that you suspect?

258
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,014
You can trust me.

259
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:05,882
You have my word that I'll kill whoever it is.

260
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,395
I'll get revenge for you.

261
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,469
O-Mitsu.

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,008
It was an Oiran whose name is Warabahime.

263
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,454
You'll find her on the north side.

264
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,520
She lives in the room that has no light.

265
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:39,735
Not here.

266
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,519
She must be on the prowl for humans.

267
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,139
I'll head to Hinatsuru while I
try to pinpoint the demon's presence.

268
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,117
If she's still alive,

269
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,780
she might have some information.

270
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,141
Either way,

271
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:58,658
the demon should be back here by daybreak.

272
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,387
Then I can dispose of it with my own two hands.

273
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,922
The scent is strong.

274
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,370
There's no question.

275
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,413
Miss Koinatsu!

276
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:30,434
Are you a demon hunter?

277
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,997
Glad you came.

278
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,627
So how many of you are there?

279
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:40,087
I know there's at least two of you now
that I found that yellow-haired, ugly brat.

280
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,487
Is there a Hashira with you,

281
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,345
or is he on his way now?

282
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,427
I can tell you're not a Hashira.

283
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,394
You seem far too weak.

284
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,937
I have no use for anyone who's not one.

285
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:56,119
Understood?

286
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,674
I'm too late.

287
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,160
But what's going on?

288
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,177
I can't see Miss Koinatsu's body.

289
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,817
She's not bleeding.

290
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:06,700
There's not even a scent of blood.

291
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,997
In case you're wondering, I don't devour dirty people

292
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,047
or anyone ugly for that matter.

293
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,770
There's no doubt.

294
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:19,357
She's Upper Rank Six!

295
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,667
Let that poor woman go!

296
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:26,397
Just who the hell do you think you're talking to?

297
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:27,617
How dare you?

298
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,320
She's so fast, I didn't even see her move.

299
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,862
This is an Upper Rank.

300
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,607
I have no strength left in my limbs,

301
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,660
and my body's numb.

302
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,502
Calm down.

303
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,377
My body's responding fine.

304
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:04,547
Otherwise, I wouldn't even be alive right now.

305
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,942
The only reason I can't put strength behind my attacks

306
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,788
is because I'm afraid.

307
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,347
And I just slammed into that
wall, so obviously my body is numb.

308
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:23,873
That demon's weapon is her belt
that has supernatural abilities.

309
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:26,550
She can absorb humans inside of it.

310
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,954
That's why, no matter how hard
I searched inside the building,

311
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:33,907
I couldn't find a secret path
that a human could fit through.

312
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:38,860
All she needs to abduct humans is
a space big enough for that belt!

313
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,562
Are you still alive?

314
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:43,043
Well...

315
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,894
looks like you're tougher than I thought.

316
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:50,328
And those eyes of yours are lovely, aren't they?

317
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,255
Hmm.

318
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:55,413
So lovely I might just have to
gouge them out and gobble them up.

319
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,605
The box.

320
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:04,930
It's not broken.

321
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,232
But the next time she attacks me,

322
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:08,961
it's sure to be destroyed.

323
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,707
Sorry, Nezuko. The shoulder strap broke.

324
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,577
I can't carry you while I fight.

325
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,810
Don't leave that box...

326
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,658
unless you feel that your life is in danger.

327
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,555
Water Breathing.

328
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:33,908
Fourth Form...

329
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:38,290
Striking Tide, Turbulent!

330
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,708
Color me impressed.

331
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:21,098
Your aerial combat isn't half-bad,

332
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:25,249
and you carefully cut away Koinatsu from my belt.

333
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,096
Very fine sword-work indeed.

334
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,867
Ugly as you are, that was very cute of you.

335
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,270
I think I'm starting to grow fond of you.

336
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,591
Want to know why?

337
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,783
'Cause you're like a rat on the brink of death.

338
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,122
Upper Rank Six.

339
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,409
Can I do it without Mr. Uzui, Zenitsu, or Inosuke here?

340
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,837
Can I really do this alone?

341
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:06,555
No...

342
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,105
it's not a matter of if I can do it.

343
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,236
I have to!

344
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,812
Nin-nin!

345
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,618
Thanks for your hard work, everyone!

346
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,372
Muscle!

347
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,480
Who the heck are all these little guys?

348
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:07,557
They're ninju...

349
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,570
my very own Muscle Mice!

350
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:12,332
They go into tight spaces where we can't fit...

351
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,017
Muscle.

352
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,186
And help vanquish demons behind the scenes!

353
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,067
Muscle! Muscle!

354
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:18,817
You could say they're the Shadow Demon Slayer Corps.

355
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,647
And now time for a Taisho-era secret!

356
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:25,900
We took care to assemble only the most
passionate mice to train as Muscle Mice,

357
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,845
but they must also be narcissistic enough
to fall in love with their own muscles.

358
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,757
In other words, they have to have a flair for flashiness.

359
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,919
Things are gonna get real flashy,

360
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:36,327
next in Episode 5!

361
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:37,666
Muscle!

362
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,960
These guys are the real deal.
