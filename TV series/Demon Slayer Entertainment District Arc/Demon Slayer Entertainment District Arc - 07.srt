1
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:35,177
How is this possible?

2
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:38,953
I know I chopped her leg off,
but it's piercing my back now.

3
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,597
She regenerated it already?

4
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,844
No way.

5
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:46,323
If that's true, that would
make your regenerative powers...

6
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,173
greater than my own!

7
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:06,630
Brother!

8
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,164
Brother...

9
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,150
please help her!

10
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:18,894
If you don't...

11
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,835
she'll never be the same!

12
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,382
Get off me, you brat!

13
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:45,670
I'll chop you into pieces and stuff you into my belt!

14
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,540
She stopped it...

15
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,083
with her severed limbs?

16
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:02,224
No, her coagulated blood is keeping them connected.

17
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,259
Her blood, it's burning me!

18
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,728
Just like that day!

19
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,757
Fire. Fire!

20
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,205
Nezuko!

21
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:57,911
No, don't!

22
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,253
You have to stop it!

23
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,274
Listen to me!

24
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,737
You can pull through this!

25
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,151
Please forgive me!

26
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,740
It's my fault you had to fight!

27
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,794
This whole area reeks of Nezuko's blood now.

28
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:22,376
I can tell just how badly she was
wounded during the time I was passed out.

29
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,399
It hurt you, didn't it?

30
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,860
I know you suffered! I'm sorry! But it's all right now!

31
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:32,147
I promise I won't let anyone hurt you ever again!

32
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,643
You've got to go to sleep, Nezuko!

33
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:36,796
Go to sleep so you can heal yourself!

34
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,821
Nezuko!

35
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,050
Please!

36
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:49,353
What's going on?!

37
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,815
I don't know! They just burst through the floors!

38
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,123
Ne... zu... ko...

39
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:56,429
just sleep.

40
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,173
You've got some nerve...

41
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,792
doing that to me.

42
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:09,155
So you can use Blood Demon Art as well?

43
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,240
I've never heard of a Blood
Demon Art that only burns demons.

44
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,744
Whatever you did is taking me forever to heal from.

45
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,806
You're starting to irritate me like no other.

46
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,813
I'm through playing around.

47
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:23,788
This is bad.

48
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:26,323
There are people here that I have to protect.

49
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,295
I have to think and take action.

50
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,209
Her attack will come any second now,

51
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,080
which will shred this whole building!

52
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,015
I can't just let go of Nezuko.

53
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,788
But if I don't...

54
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,221
these people will get hurt!

55
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,048
Hey.

56
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,180
So is this Nezuko Kamado?

57
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,469
Quite the flashy way to demonize.

58
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,676
When did you get here?

59
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:08,563
All that fancy talk in front of the Master,

60
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:10,539
and you let her wreak havoc like this?!

61
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:13,055
No one said she could demonize so flashily!

62
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,096
Thanks for coming.

63
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:18,058
You're a Hashira, right?

64
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,475
I've been here waiting for you.

65
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:22,253
Shut up.

66
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,227
I'm not here to waste my time on you. Get lost.

67
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:28,162
After all, you're no Upper Rank demon.

68
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,885
Not when you're that weak.

69
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,436
You're not the one I've been searching for,

70
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:34,463
so beat it.

71
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:36,762
Come again?

72
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,362
How dare you speak to...

73
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:45,903
Huh?

74
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,637
Damn it!

75
00:08:58,662 --> 00:08:59,860
Damn it! Damn it!

76
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:03,413
How did we lose sight of the God of Festivals already?!

77
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,017
At this rate, we'll be left in the dust!

78
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,232
In a flashy way, of course.

79
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:16,563
Hmm?

80
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,989
Eh? Hey, you spotted him?

81
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,674
I hope you're ready, Worm Lady,

82
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,084
'cause the Mountain God, Lord Inosuke is comin' through!

83
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:35,024
Wait.

84
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,645
What?

85
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,987
She's beheaded!

86
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:43,155
But how? Was it Mr. Uzui who did that?

87
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,030
He's unreal.

88
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:46,843
Hey...

89
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,560
the battle here's far from over,

90
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,566
so get her under control.

91
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,270
Nezuko!

92
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:02,924
Brats who throw temper tantrums
don't belong on the battlefield.

93
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,991
Can't you sing her a lullaby or something?

94
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,557
It's no use. My voice isn't reaching her.

95
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,941
She's not listening to me at all.

96
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:35,306
Mother, what do I do?

97
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,278
Can't you sing her a lullaby or something?

98
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,881
Nezuko.

99
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,336
Nezuko.

100
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,878
I think I'm starting to get what happened now.

101
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,000
So the reason Brother's eyes are red

102
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:25,616
is because you ate red berries
when he was inside your tummy.

103
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,371
Nezuko.

104
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,416
It worked.

105
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,163
You hear that, Mother? It worked.

106
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,097
She's sound asleep.

107
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,103
Mr. Uzui.

108
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,406
Where do you think you're going?!

109
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,143
Get back here, you brute!

110
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:34,918
You have the gall to behead me and walk away?!

111
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:36,655
You're going to pay for this!

112
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,764
Would you just shut up already?

113
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,088
You've been nothing but unflashy,

114
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,783
so drop dead.

115
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,511
Don't give me that crap!

116
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,306
I'm stronger than you!

117
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:50,033
So what makes you think that I'm not an Upper Rank?

118
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,612
Sorry, but you can't be an Upper Rank.

119
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:55,121
I will have you know that I am Upper Six!

120
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,671
Then why are you holding your severed head right now?

121
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:58,851
I mean, come on.

122
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,855
What, did I cut your brains out too?

123
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:03,732
Just because I'm like this doesn't mean I've lost yet!

124
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,302
I'm an Upper Rank, damn it!

125
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,842
I think it's pretty obvious that you lost.

126
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,685
I'm just more powerful than you can comprehend!

127
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,942
I might be Number Six right now,

128
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,162
but I'm going to get even stronger!

129
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:16,888
Don't care. Didn't ask.

130
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:27,913
I really am an Upper Six! I really am an Upper Six!

131
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,278
I've even got the number to prove it too!

132
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:32,704
You just can't accept how amazing I am!

133
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:33,703
You're kidding.

134
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:35,322
She's throwing a tantrum?

135
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,623
Wait a second. How is she able to talk for this long?

136
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:42,627
Even though she was beheaded,
her body hasn't disintegrated.

137
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,723
Die! Die!

138
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,672
All of you can just die!

139
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:57,076
He cut my head off! He cut my head off!

140
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,773
Help me...

141
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:01,107
Brother!

142
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,403
Come on now.

143
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:25,230
There's no use crying about it, you know.

144
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:29,878
Can't you even manage to
reattach your own head by yourself?

145
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,505
Well, you haven't always been the
sharpest tool in the shed, have you?

146
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,575
She's still alive, even after I beheaded her.

147
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:40,423
More importantly, who's that guy with her?

148
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,093
His reflexes are unreal.

149
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,218
Aww, is that a burn on your face?

150
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,531
You need to learn how to take
better care of your face, you know?

151
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:55,605
After all, you were born with
such a pretty face compared to mine.

152
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,688
Huh. Not bad.

153
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,564
I was going in for the kill, you know?

154
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:11,959
But you were able to stop me, weren't you?

155
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,175
Good for you, really.

156
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,393
You're a lucky guy, aren't you?

157
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,851
That face of yours...

158
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:22,973
Nice.

159
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,897
I like your skin too.

160
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Not a blemish, birthmark, or
scar to be seen anywhere, huh?

161
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:32,048
And you've got some meat on your bones.

162
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,685
I can't gain weight, no matter what, see?

163
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:37,746
And you're tall as well!

164
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:41,188
You look like you're well over six feet, aren't you?

165
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:46,817
I guess you must get tons of
attention from the ladies, don't you?

166
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,303
I envy you.

167
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,553
Oh, how I envy you!

168
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:57,393
Would you mind just dropping dead
and in the most agonizing way at that?

169
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:02,251
Like getting skinned alive or maybe
even getting that belly of yours slit open.

170
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,109
And one more thing, you oversized meat-sack.

171
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,343
Brother, wait!

172
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,257
He's not the only one who was harassing me.

173
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:12,340
Kill the ones who burned me too. Kill them!

174
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,117
I've been toiling away over here, and yet...

175
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,005
even though I've given it my all, they won't die!

176
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:23,568
I feel like I tried everything, but they
kept getting back up and picking on me.

177
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:27,439
They ganged up and bullied
me, and I can't take it anymore!

178
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,241
I think I understand what's happening now,
and what you did to her was unforgiveable.

179
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,090
My sweet little sister was doing her best
with what little brains she had to work with,

180
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,504
and you bullied her.

181
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:44,022
I'll have to massacre everyone who laid a finger on her.

182
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,896
You could say I'm a firm believer in vengeance,

183
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,965
so I'll exact the same pain you inflicted upon her.

184
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,143
When you die, those words will ring through your skull.

185
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:59,173
I'll show no mercy, because my name is Gyutaro!

186
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,567
What are those, sickles?

187
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,669
They're heading back towards Mr. Uzui.

188
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:14,684
Something's not right.

189
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:17,099
The Belt Demon never used a sickle.

190
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,954
Is it a new demon?

191
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,142
I smell Mr. Uzui's blood.

192
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,637
I've got to back him up.

193
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,856
Where are you, Worm Belt?!

194
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,089
Lord Inosuke has arrived!

195
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,346
You can run, but you can't hide!

196
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,293
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

197
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:34,874
Zenitsu, are you asleep?

198
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:39,663
You two, go and help Mr. Uzui! Hurry!

199
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,083
Sit back, relax, and leave it to me!

200
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,776
I'm ready to go berserk!

201
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:47,139
Yours truly, Lord Inosuke, will handle it!

202
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,779
And flashily!

203
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,646
Thanks! I'll put Nezuko back into her box.

204
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,303
It should only take a second!

205
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,446
I will allow it!

206
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:56,846
Thank you!

207
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm so envious, I could die.

208
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,112
You really are a good-looking guy, aren't you?

209
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,152
Damn.

210
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:15,213
Protecting those humans, showing off like that?

211
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:17,566
I envy you.

212
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,150
In their eyes, you're some kind of brave hero, aren't you?

213
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:29,044
I bet their affection and gratitude
towards you is immeasurable, you know?

214
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,558
Well, yeah.

215
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:34,230
I'm a flashy, glamorous lady's
man, so that's a no-brainer.

216
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:37,060
Not to brag, but I have three wives to boot.

217
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:43,183
Am I going deaf, or did you
just say that you have three wives?

218
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:45,263
You've gotta be kidding me.

219
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:50,336
That's unforgivable!

220
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,515
Blood Demon Art.

221
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,168
Flying Blood Sickles!

222
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:01,052
These splashes of blood are
like blades, and so many of them!

223
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:03,112
I have to protect the people.

224
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,130
What now? An explosion?

225
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,592
So you're on the first floor now.

226
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:13,767
Run! Quickly!

227
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:14,560
R-Right!

228
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:18,467
Like I'd let you escape that easily.

229
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,135
Bend for me, Flying Blood Sickles.

230
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,633
He can control each of the slashes?

231
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,587
Which means he'll keep moving
them until they hit their target.

232
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,131
The sister didn't die, even when she was decapitated.

233
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,371
That's unheard of.

234
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,363
Since these two are siblings,

235
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,716
can I get rid of them both if
I behead the brother instead?

236
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,044
Is he the main unit?

237
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,704
One way to find out.

238
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:54,741
From what I can hear, all the people upstairs have fled.

239
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,443
Ugh! Look out!

240
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,023
Wow, this might be harder than I thought.

241
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,506
How flashy.

242
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,944
The thing about us is...

243
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:28,930
we fight together, and two is better than one, you know?

244
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:01,845
Nin-nin!

245
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:05,346
Today we'll be starting off with a Taisho-era secret!

246
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:08,274
Since she was a child, Nezuko's been an angel,

247
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,529
and she's never once been unreasonable.

248
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,763
Even when our grandmother died

249
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,848
and also when our father died,

250
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:18,686
she always told our younger siblings the same thing.

251
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,210
"They won't be able to rest easy if we're always crying,

252
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:26,180
so let's get it all out now
and move forward even stronger."

253
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,810
She'd say, "Let's all keep smiling."

254
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,284
Next, Episode 8, "Gathering."

255
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:37,986
Nezuko really is the best, huh?
