1
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:22,218
Hinatsuru.

2
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:05,913
Please forgive me.

3
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,486
I was only trying to...

4
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,230
Never mind that. Just rest.

5
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:16,139
By the time I realized Oiran Warabihime was a demon,

6
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:18,534
she was already suspicious of me.

7
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,658
I drank some poison

8
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,644
and tried to slip out of the House.

9
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:29,692
I didn't know the belt she gave me
was being used to spy on me and kill me.

10
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:32,789
She always knew exactly what I was doing,

11
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,784
so I was unable to contact you.

12
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:42,183
Lord Tengen, please leave this place
and don't trouble yourself with me.

13
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,089
You heard that sound just now. I know you did.

14
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,472
That demon is on a rampage.

15
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,509
Can you promise me that you'll be okay?

16
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,937
I promise.

17
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,708
I'm so sorry that I couldn't be more helpful to you.

18
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,662
You've done everything that you possibly could.

19
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,213
Once the antidote kicks in, leave Yoshiwara.

20
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,202
Understood?

21
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,565
Yes.

22
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,913
The battle's already begun.

23
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,447
Where is it?

24
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,548
Search for its presence.

25
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,970
It's here, underground.

26
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,982
I can hear the sound of someone fighting.

27
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:44,952
If I focus on the reverberations...

28
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,337
then I can locate them.

29
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,554
Sound Breathing. First Form...

30
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:55,992
Roar!

31
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,762
That infernal racket is giving me a headache.

32
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,369
What is all that noise?

33
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:04,749
What is it you're up to?

34
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,282
It sounds like it's coming from the Ogimoto House.

35
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,004
That damn Hinatsuru.

36
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,658
Exactly how many of you are there?

37
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:14,879
Four perhaps?

38
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:16,324
Who knows?

39
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:18,742
Well, then, if you were to tell me the truth,

40
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,219
I might be willing to spare your worthless life.

41
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:24,874
We only clashed for maybe an instant at most,

42
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,599
but look at your sword.

43
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,056
It's already chipped.

44
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,005
The swordsmith who made it must have been a real amateur.

45
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:38,475
You're wrong! The person who forged this is amazing,

46
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,585
and he's a brilliant swordsmith!

47
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,068
Oh, really? How did it get chipped then, you moron?

48
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:47,531
Over there now too?

49
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,718
Such an obnoxious racket.

50
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:51,975
I'm growing tired of it,

51
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,389
so I'm putting an end to you now.

52
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,440
The blade suffers when its wielder is inadequate.

53
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:00,459
It's my fault.

54
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,301
Despite training my hardest, I still...

55
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:08,690
I still can't handle the Water Breathing Technique yet.

56
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,153
The truth is my body's just not suited for it.

57
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,584
If I keep using Water Breathing,

58
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,647
I'll never be like Mr. Urokodaki or Mr. Tomioka!

59
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:27,462
For me, using Hinokami Kagura to strike
my enemies has always been more effective.

60
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,608
I feel more in tune with it.

61
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:32,857
And yet...

62
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:41,938
Hey, moron, would it kill you to hold back a little?!

63
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:45,945
What's the point if you don't give it your all?!

64
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,112
Hinokami Kagura!

65
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:48,498
Hmm?

66
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,768
Flame Dance!

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,930
Clear Blue...

68
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:57,628
Eh?

69
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:58,473
Tanjiro!

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,488
Hey, what happened? Are you okay?

71
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,670
Hey, are you hungry?

72
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:03,384
Shut up!

73
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,083
Huh?

74
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,135
Because of its sheer force,

75
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:08,961
I couldn't unleash multiple strikes.

76
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,222
But it's different now.

77
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,092
I should be able to do it!

78
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,216
No, I can do it!

79
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,078
That is what I've been training for.

80
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:23,049
Don't go down in defeat.

81
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:24,018
Burn!

82
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:26,743
Burn! Burn!

83
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,244
Set your heart ablaze!

84
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,588
Hinokami Kagura!

85
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,338
Raging Sun!

86
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,374
His swordsmanship style changed.

87
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,041
It's sharper than before.

88
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:46,197
What is that sound he's emitting?

89
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,772
It's unpleasant as hell.

90
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,599
Is it his breathing?

91
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:52,513
Flame Dance!

92
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,978
She dodged the first one, but
this move is a two-hit strike!

93
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,848
That was underwhelming, but...

94
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,493
so typical.

95
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:05,971
He's gone?

96
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:10,252
Hinokami Kagura. Fake Rainbow.

97
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:15,247
There it is, the Opening Thread!

98
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,729
I can do this!

99
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,792
Hinokami Kagura!

100
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,121
Fire Wheel!

101
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:23,939
Far too so slow.

102
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:25,546
You're making me yawn.

103
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,560
I have to use the defensive falling technique.

104
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,718
This is the drawback of using Hinokami Kagura.

105
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,410
All the built-up fatigue is causing my muscles to cramp.

106
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,975
Still alive over there?

107
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,639
Calm down.

108
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,265
Get your breathing under control...

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,715
and recover!

110
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:00,695
Quickly!

111
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,297
Recovery Breathing.

112
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,862
This belt is no different than a powerful blade.

113
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:19,539
Even if I glimpse an Opening
Thread, it vanishes instantly.

114
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,240
My attacks are too slow.

115
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,932
My body temperature.

116
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:27,920
If I'm gonna win, I need to raise my body temperature!

117
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,022
Are you sure?

118
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,918
I think I should tell Lady Shinobu.

119
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,866
Your body temperature still hasn't gone down yet.

120
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:35,642
Please don't. I'm begging you!

121
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:36,874
Keep it between us.

122
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,164
Really, I'm fine now.

123
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:40,010
There's no use in telling her!

124
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,746
Yes, but still...

125
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,291
Look. I'm fine, see?

126
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,609
Never felt better. Just a little warm.

127
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,464
Being a little warm is okay, but look at this!

128
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,506
It says 100 degrees!

129
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:53,370
It was that high yesterday and the day before too.

130
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,061
That's not good.

131
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,055
If you have a fever that won't go down,

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,621
that means something's wrong with your body, Tanjiro.

133
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:08,002
I'm not skilled enough to know
what to do about something like this,

134
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,848
but Lady Shinobu would.

135
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,673
The thing is...

136
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,448
when I have a fever,

137
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:19,755
I'm actually at the top of my game.

138
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,064
I can use multiple Hinokami Kagura strikes,

139
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,343
and I might become even stronger with it.

140
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:30,489
Please, Kiyo, can't you wait just a
little longer before telling Lady Shinobu?

141
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,872
Just a little bit longer.

142
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:34,265
I'm begging you.

143
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,481
Very well, then.

144
00:09:39,464 --> 00:09:42,165
But only just a little longer!

145
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,904
It's working.

146
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:50,243
I can feel my body temperature rising.

147
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,744
I can do this.

148
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,822
I can take on an Upper Rank Demon!

149
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,303
He's a pesky one,

150
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,869
more than I thought he'd be.

151
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,691
How entertaining.

152
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,124
Focus!

153
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,613
Hinokami Kagura's effective against her...

154
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,573
but it's not enough to just be effective.

155
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:11,160
If I want to win,

156
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,723
I'm gonna have to use every ounce of my power,

157
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,690
and I have to win...

158
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,293
to protect the innocent...

159
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:21,007
to protect my friends.

160
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,921
Never again will I allow chaos like that to unfold.

161
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:29,816
Never again will I let anyone suffer the way that we did.

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,141
No one should have to bear that kind of grief.

163
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:44,011
The way you sweat like a pig is truly repulsive!

164
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,249
What's all that screaming about?

165
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,811
It's a monster! A monster!

166
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,510
There's no time to fool around.

167
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,654
Get ready for work!

168
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:12,423
Who cares about work when there's a monster boar
going around destroying all the ceilings and floors!

169
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:13,155
Wha?

170
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,759
Are you sure you got enough sleep last night?

171
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,259
Come see! I'll show you!

172
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:21,691
Huh?

173
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,424
Now I'm really feeling that demon's presence!

174
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:33,939
Is it here?

175
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,216
Yaah!

176
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:39,768
This must be it,

177
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:42,199
the hole leading straight to the demon's lair!

178
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,284
Get ready to die, bastard!

179
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:50,656
So I can only get my head inside, huh?

180
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:56,943
That might have stopped others,
but it's not gonna stop Lord Inosuke!

181
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:02,099
After all, I'm a man who can dislocate all his joints.

182
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,065
In other words,

183
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,982
As long as my head fits, I can go anywhere!

184
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,520
Get ready, demon, 'cause I'm comin' through!

185
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:20,280
What gives?! There's no end in sight to this damn thing!

186
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:21,989
Hah! It's here!

187
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,284
I can tell there's a demon here!

188
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,050
What the hell?

189
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,117
Some kind of cloth with a human pattern?

190
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,705
What is this?

191
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,808
No, that's not just a pattern.

192
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,157
Those are living humans.

193
00:12:56,479 --> 00:13:01,095
So this demon is able to trap
humans inside of a woman's belt, huh?

194
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:03,834
Huh?

195
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,990
Then it takes them whenever it wants and devours them?

196
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:11,572
Pretty brutal, if you ask me.

197
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,798
Hmm?

198
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,014
What's he doing here?

199
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:20,501
That's a question I should be asking you.

200
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,299
How would you like it if someone
started messing with your food?

201
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,078
Dirty man.

202
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,644
You reek of filth!

203
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,254
Disgusting.

204
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:30,309
Repulsive.

205
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,183
You damn stinkbug!

206
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,883
Look who's talking, you worm!

207
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:34,709
Gross!

208
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:38,062
You dare insult me, stinkbug?!

209
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:42,267
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

210
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,026
Hah!

211
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,051
You're really grossing me out, Worm Belt.

212
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,079
Look how sluggish you are!

213
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:52,764
You got greedy and swallowed up too many humans!

214
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:56,226
There's no way an attack from an overweight worm

215
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:59,414
can ever hope to land on Lord Inosuke!

216
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:03,347
So lose some weight, and don't come back 'til you have!

217
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,958
Damn it! He managed to slice
me without touching the humans.

218
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:13,219
After I went to the trouble of
storing all that fresh food too.

219
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:16,229
His intuition appears to be razor sharp,

220
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,819
and his ability to detect murderous intent is exceptional.

221
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:25,500
It's so precise that he can perceive attacks
from any direction and dodge them effortlessly.

222
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:30,783
I never anticipated a Demon-Slayer
swordsman would infiltrate our food supply.

223
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,651
What should I do?

224
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,348
Capture him alive.

225
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:41,404
He's the brat who got in my
way when I captured Makio earlier.

226
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:43,673
He was beautiful.

227
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:49,800
You can kill all of the humans you have
stored, but save the 10 most beautiful ones for me.

228
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,420
Though it might prove harder to capture
them alive than to merely kill them.

229
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:59,384
If you devour some of the uglier
ones, that should make things easier.

230
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:06,884
I can't slash it when it's flapping like that!

231
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,620
Let's see you deal with Beast Breathing, Sixth Fang.

232
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,141
Palisade Bite!

233
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:25,393
Slashing me is useless when I'm
not even the main body, you fool.

234
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,271
Never mind. The humans you saved are
looking awfully vulnerable, don't you think?

235
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,731
Not to mention I can recover from
any damage you manage to inflict.

236
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:45,454
Oh, crap! I forgot! I've gotta fight it
while protecting those humans, don't I?

237
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,659
Damn it! I can't keep up!

238
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,783
Annoying Worm Belt!

239
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,230
Ooh. Huh?

240
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,054
I gotta hand it to you.

241
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,638
Worm Belt's a pretty good name!

242
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,669
Yeah, it's perfect for something so gross,

243
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,447
and I'm so gonna tell on you!

244
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,916
Just wait until Lord Tengen finds out!

245
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,669
We're gonna give you a hand with this freak,

246
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:08,076
so fight the good fight, my boar-headed friend!

247
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,136
Who the heck are you two?!

248
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,823
Both of us are Uzui's wives!

249
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,971
I'm trying my best here, but I'm not much of a fighter!

250
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,180
So please don't expect much from me!

251
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:23,334
Suma! This is no time to be acting like a wimp!

252
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,699
But, Makio, I can't help it.

253
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:28,474
You know I'm a good-for-nothing,
especially when it comes to fighting!

254
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:32,615
I got captured! You can't expect me to
protect everyone else who got captured!

255
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,659
It's impossible!

256
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:36,003
I'll be the one who gets killed first probably!

257
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:39,118
It's a shame your friends don't think more like you.

258
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,288
Now which of you should I eat first?

259
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,709
Damn that thing!

260
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,471
It's not the main body?

261
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:47,709
If that's true, I'm screwed!

262
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,892
This battle's never gonna end!

263
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,719
Thunder Breathing.

264
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:53,725
First Form,

265
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,995
Thunderclap and Flash.

266
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,568
Sixfold.

267
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:15,327
Maybe you should stay asleep like this the whole time.

268
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:17,497
Muscle!

269
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:18,182
Muscle!

270
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,669
Is he Demon Slayer Corps?

271
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,398
If he is, then why is he dressed like a total idiot?

272
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:24,891
Yeah! Good question!

273
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:26,175
Hey! The next one's...

274
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,135
Such blinding speed! Who is that boy?

275
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:31,429
Regardless, he's not alone.

276
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,946
I'm sure I heard two sounds,

277
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:38,139
like overlapping thunderbolts creating two sounds at once.

278
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,202
One was that boy.

279
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:42,185
And the other one came...

280
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,384
from above?

281
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,394
The wind?

282
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,011
How is that possible?

283
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,210
What's powerful enough to create
a hole that reaches this depth?

284
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,471
What the hell?

285
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,673
This presence...

286
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,840
Someone's here. I know it.

287
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,770
Such strength!

288
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,136
A Hashira!

289
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,254
Lord Tengen.

290
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,092
Makio. Suma.

291
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,803
Sorry I took so long.

292
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,050
You both look as flashy as ever.

293
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,814
You know, it wasn't like this before.

294
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,478
The thought of dying never used to bother me,

295
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,563
since that's how I was trained.

296
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,183
Furthermore...

297
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,598
since I was a kunoichi,

298
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:13,557
I could never hope to match a male
shinobi in terms of raw strength,

299
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:18,453
so risking my life for a mission was
the least I could do to make up for it.

300
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:26,166
You three are only to think about
your own lives from here on out.

301
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:27,789
Above all else,

302
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:30,421
your top priority is to come back alive.

303
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,218
Life over accomplishing your mission!

304
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:37,521
I understand that conflicts with
your occupation, but it doesn't matter.

305
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:38,780
I'm allowing it.

306
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:43,113
You are to live your lives in the following flashy order.

307
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,504
First prioritize your own lives,

308
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:50,790
then second, law-abiding citizens,

309
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,785
and finally my own.

310
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,514
As a Demon-Slayer swordsman, it goes
without saying, I'll protect the public

311
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,332
leading their unflashy lives,

312
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,685
but if I'm being completely honest,

313
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,699
I'll always prioritize you three,

314
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,242
so don't you die on me.

315
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,687
He can't be serious right now.

316
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:12,393
If you put your own life first before the mission,

317
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,838
can you really hope to accomplish anything significant?

318
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:18,605
Don't worry.

319
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,852
If Lord Tengen says it's fine, then I trust him.

320
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:28,512
Putting your own life before others or a
mission doesn't sound like a bad way to live at all,

321
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:29,925
don't you think?

322
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:33,517
As long as you don't despise yourself for it,

323
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,274
it's totally fine, you know?

324
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,323
You're right.

325
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,837
You've been doing some flashy work here.

326
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:06,178
You're my wives.

327
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,850
I'd expect nothing less.

328
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:16,591
All right!

329
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:29,161
From here on out, things are gonna get real flashy!

330
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:01,499
Nin-nin!

331
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:02,744
It's a joke, right?

332
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,252
The Sound Hashira can't possibly have three wives!

333
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:07,422
Well, why don't you try for that, Zenitsu?

334
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:08,414
What, really?

335
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,502
Okay, well, then there's Yoshiko,
Sanae, and then there's also...

336
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:13,059
I guess I have to let Nezuko know.

337
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,479
Wait, Tanjiro, no!

338
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:17,098
Now it's time for a Taisho-era secret.

339
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:19,937
Uzui's whole family practices polygamy,

340
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:25,014
and I hear that when you turn 15, the head of the
family picks out three wives that are sure to be a fit.

341
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:25,464
Ah?

342
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,588
But they say that Suma actually
stepped forward and offered herself.

343
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,001
Maybe I should become a shinobi too!

344
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,659
Then you'll be starting shinobi training today, right?

345
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:34,346
Huh?

346
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,720
No!

347
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,046
Next, Episode Six, "Layered Memories."
