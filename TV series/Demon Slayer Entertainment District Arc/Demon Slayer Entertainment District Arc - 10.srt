1
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:06,983
Tanjiro! Look out!

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,956
Damn it.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,980
Zenitsu, forget about me.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,909
This happened because I wasn't paying attention.

5
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,993
I'm sorry, Inosuke.

6
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:25,459
If only I'd noticed him sooner, then maybe...

7
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:30,757
No, if I hadn't left Mr. Uzui's side in the first place,

8
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,672
this never would have happened.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,420
It's my fault.

10
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:37,457
I'm sorry, everyone.

11
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:39,437
Please forgive me.

12
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,766
I failed.

13
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:26,820
I'm sorry, everyone.

14
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,657
I'm sorry...

15
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,877
Nezuko.

16
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,030
There's nothing for you to be sorry for.

17
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,746
Big Brother, why do you always apologize?

18
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,103
If we're poor and can't afford to wear nice kimonos,

19
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:52,485
is that something you have to be sorry for?

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,757
Don't blame yourself for something like that.

21
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,443
It would be like blaming Father
for succumbing to his illness.

22
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,579
He tried as hard as he could,

23
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:05,019
but it wasn't enough. We have to accept that.

24
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:10,682
We're human, after all, and part of that means
there are things that are outside of our control.

25
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:15,231
Whether I'm happy or not is up to me,

26
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:18,355
even if it feels like the world is against me.

27
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:20,565
What's most important

28
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,068
is that we keep moving forward together

29
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:24,721
and fight if we must.

30
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:27,583
So stop apologizing!

31
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,620
You, of all people, should understand.

32
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:34,232
I want you to understand how I feel!

33
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,287
Was that a dream about the past?

34
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,517
Hold on. Where am I?

35
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,501
Am I...

36
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,926
This is awful. How did it come to this?

37
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,740
I just hope the people who lived here were able to escape.

38
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,033
Nezuko!

39
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,275
Nezuko.

40
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,109
Thank you, Nezuko.

41
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,899
My fault or not, I've gotta do what I can do.

42
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,840
Well, I'm impressed.

43
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:30,137
I'm shocked you're still alive after that.

44
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,632
You're one lucky guy, aren't you?

45
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:39,673
Well, not that you have anything going
for you except being lucky, that is.

46
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,830
It really is a shame, you know.

47
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:52,638
Every one of your friends is dead
or burning under the rubble right now.

48
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:56,419
It only took a single thrust to that boar's heart.

49
00:04:56,767 --> 00:05:00,640
Meanwhile, that yellow-haired
boy is trapped under the rubble,

50
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,498
so I think I'll leave him there 'til he dies.

51
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:07,989
Squirming around like an insect, how disgraceful is that?

52
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:13,083
And that Hashira, he really was all bark and no bite.

53
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,888
It seems the poison got to him after all,

54
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:19,083
and now he's dead like the others.

55
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,763
You're all disgraceful, utterly disgraceful.

56
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,923
You all might be pathetic and shameless in your own ways,

57
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:28,309
but you're by far the worst!

58
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:32,841
The one sticking out of that box,
that's a relative of yours, isn't it?

59
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:38,193
I can tell she's related to you,
you know, even if she is a demon.

60
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,490
Tell me, who is she?

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,123
Your younger sister?

62
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,066
Why won't he kill me?

63
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,694
What's going on here?

64
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,691
My arm is numb.

65
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,940
I couldn't lift my sword if I wanted to.

66
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:57,803
So if I went for his head now, I couldn't slash it.

67
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:00,943
That girl in the box...

68
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,713
is my younger sister.

69
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,582
It's just as I thought, then.

70
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,747
You really are a disgrace, huh?

71
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:18,184
Imagine being so useless, you
can't protect your own sister.

72
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,037
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

73
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:23,784
After all, you're just human.

74
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,801
It makes sense you're weaker than your sister.

75
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:30,124
Considering she's a demon, it only
makes sense she's stronger than you.

76
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,139
Even so, I just can't help but see you as a disgrace.

77
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,529
If you're really her big brother,

78
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,373
then you should be protecting her instead of leaving her

79
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,772
to fight all of your battles for you, you coward.

80
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,163
Devotedly...

81
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,309
with this hand, you see?

82
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:54,238
But I've got to know. How do you feel after all this?

83
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,473
Being the only one to survive so disgracefully?

84
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,230
Not to mention you let that kid sister of yours
use up her strength protecting a disgrace like you.

85
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,353
Hey, answer me, worm.

86
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,723
You imbecile.

87
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,126
Sad sack.

88
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:09,128
Coward!

89
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:10,323
Good-for-nothing!

90
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,162
Why was trash like you even born to begin with?

91
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,338
What are you gonna do?

92
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:16,663
I don't know about you,

93
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:22,753
but I'd love to see you try and cut off my head with
that useless, battered, disgraceful human body of yours.

94
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,577
Come on! Come on!

95
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:25,943
Come on!

96
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,085
Huh?

97
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,302
Oh, I see!

98
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:52,506
Your poor little soul got crushed at the last second, huh?

99
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,243
How disgraceful are you?

100
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,062
I didn't think you could get more pathetic!

101
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,883
I gotta hand it you.

102
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,669
You really are the most disgraceful scumbag.

103
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:23,859
In all my life, I've never seen
anyone as shameless or cowardly as you.

104
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,133
Oddly enough, as disgraceful as you are,

105
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,742
I don't dislike you.

106
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,485
Because I can't help but like anything that's
pathetic, disgraceful, and filthy, you understand?

107
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,806
What is it about you?

108
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:08,201
Maybe it's this filthy scar on
your forehead I'm getting attached to.

109
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,023
I have an idea!

110
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,548
How about you just become a demon too?

111
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,667
Why not do it for your little sister's sake!

112
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,949
Oh, why couldn't I have thought of that sooner!

113
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,364
If you become a demon, I'll spare your life,

114
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,639
since you and I will be comrades then!

115
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,848
Otherwise, I'll slaughter you and your pathetic sister,

116
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,963
since I don't give a crap about other
people's little sisters, to be honest.

117
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:30,647
No way!

118
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,502
Absolutely not, Brother!

119
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,804
I am not on board with this, understand?!

120
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:38,742
If you become a demon, you can instantly become stronger!

121
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,642
You can kiss that defective body of yours goodbye!

122
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,719
So what do you say?

123
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,792
What's it gonna be?!

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,538
It makes you bitter, huh, realizing how weak you are?

125
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,370
Humans are so cute,

126
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,277
looking to the sky when you grieve.

127
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:01,797
All so you don't let your tears fall down your face.

128
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:04,723
This whole time...

129
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,574
This whole time...

130
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,364
I've been waiting for this.

131
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:18,823
You've been waiting for a pathetic, last-ditch head-butt?

132
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,562
M-My body won't...

133
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:26,830
What are you doing, Brother?! Get back up on your feet!

134
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,614
Something's wrong.

135
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,066
What's going on? Something's wrong!

136
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,483
All he did was use a lame head-butt.

137
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,537
A kunai?!

138
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:41,697
I got stabbed when he head-butted me!

139
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:45,817
He was pretending to retreat when
he was really going for this kunai.

140
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:51,738
All the while scattering the courtesans'
sachets to cover up the scent of the kunai's poison!

141
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:55,104
Damn you. Damn you.

142
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,187
You're still a rotten weakling of a human.

143
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:03,858
Look how bruised and battered you are even
after taking me on with three others helping you!

144
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,492
But now you're alone, so why?

145
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,292
Why won't you give up?!

146
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,412
Why is it you're so damn determined...

147
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,543
to decapitate me?!

148
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:32,879
Brother.

149
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,325
Brother!

150
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,132
Big Brother!

151
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:40,308
Big Brother!

152
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,698
Brother!

153
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,665
At every turn...

154
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:57,068
one false step, and I could have found myself
in the very same situation he's in right now.

155
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:01,609
I was lucky enough to remain a human...

156
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:06,113
but there could have been a
future in which we were both demons.

157
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,855
If I do end up turning into a demon,

158
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,352
I know I can rely on one thing...

159
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:19,368
that someone in the Demon Slayer Corps
will behead me for the greater good.

160
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,119
Cut through! Cut through!

161
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,578
Win! Win, no matter what!

162
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,472
We're going to win!

163
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,613
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

164
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,653
Don't get beheaded by someone like him!

165
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,047
That brat...

166
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,874
he pulled himself out of the rubble!

167
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,189
Die, you ugly freak!

168
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,000
Thunder Breathing.

169
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,438
First Form...

170
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:06,513
Luckily I know exactly how fast your move
is because I've seen it so many times now!

171
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,303
...Thunderclap and Flash.

172
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,789
Godlike Speed!

173
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,103
So fast.

174
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,708
M-My head's being severed.

175
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,193
Damn it.

176
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,853
I had no idea he could move like this.

177
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,613
Cut through.

178
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,650
Cut through her!

179
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,500
My body can only handle using
Thunderclap and Flash, Godlike Speed twice,

180
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,424
and I've already used it once to escape the rubble.

181
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:38,746
I won't get another chance to go
for her neck if I don't do it now!

182
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,970
Tanjiro created this one-in-a-million chance!

183
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:45,003
I'm going to slash her for sure, no matter what!

184
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,803
Damn it. It's no use.

185
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,153
I can't cut through!

186
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,193
The poison should have weakened him!

187
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,768
Am I still not strong enough?

188
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,153
He's recovered from the poison.

189
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,073
His blades are engulfing me.

190
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,842
And my sword, it's being repelled!

191
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:15,488
Damn it. I almost had him there!

192
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,472
Just a few more seconds, and I could have...

193
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,543
Don't give up!

194
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:21,973
Don't give up, Tanjiro!

195
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,293
Hang on until the very end!

196
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,670
Die, you little punk!

197
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:31,888
His attack speed is increasing!

198
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,160
He's broken down the poison and fully recovered!

199
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:37,870
But don't give up.

200
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,604
Don't give up!

201
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:43,796
Don't give...

202
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,896
He's not dead!

203
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,656
But how is that possible?!

204
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,235
Wait, his heart. I get it!

205
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,508
He used his muscles to stop his heart...

206
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,480
which stopped the poison from circulating.

207
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:07,800
Mr. Uzui!

208
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:11,958
My Musical Score Technique... will take us to victory!

209
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:15,617
Don't make me laugh!

210
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:21,060
Ichi!

211
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,403
San! Shichi! Go! I! Kin!

212
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,698
I can read it now,

213
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:29,929
that filthy musical score of yours!

214
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,414
He deflected my Rotating Circular Slashes!

215
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,399
Amazing.

216
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,833
Wait, did he say, "Score"?

217
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:49,553
He turned my Blood Demon Art
into a song and deflected it?!

218
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:52,473
And he did it all using only one arm?

219
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,063
There's no way that's possible.

220
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,354
I've had enough of your crap!

221
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,248
He might be holding his own right now,

222
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:45,916
but that's not enough to beat him.

223
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,370
Mr. Uzui's going to reach his limit first!

224
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,047
I've got to make a move before that happens.

225
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:54,022
If I can decapitate him, victory is ours!

226
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,833
Mr. Uzui!

227
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:03,833
Don't stop!

228
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,854
Jump!

229
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:10,881
Unfortunately you're too slow!

230
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:15,617
He paved the way for you, and you still blew your chance!

231
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,772
It's over. The poison will kill you!

232
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,982
Even if it costs my life, I will behead you!

233
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,246
I won't give up!

234
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,933
I'm cutting your head off, no matter what!

235
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,693
Damn you!

236
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:32,246
What's it going to take for you to give up?

237
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:36,493
You couldn't behead me before.
What makes you think you can now?

238
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,203
I can't just use my arms!

239
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,493
I've got to use every ounce of strength I have,

240
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,916
from the top of my head to the tips of my toes!

241
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,842
I have to ignore all the pain in my body! Endure!

242
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:49,705
Striking with all my might won't be enough!

243
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,693
I need 100 times the force!

244
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:55,355
Summon every ounce of strength left!

245
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:03,741
Damn it!

246
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,382
Not by a brat like him.

247
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,723
If I don't do something, I'm gonna get beheaded.

248
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:14,823
No, it's fine. Even if I get beheaded,

249
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,717
as long as my sister's head is still intact...

250
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,403
then I can finish off this stubborn punk!

251
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,900
Damn it. I'm running out of strength!

252
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:32,398
It's too bad you'll never get the chance to decapitate me,

253
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:35,318
because before you do, I'm gonna tear you to shreds!

254
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,855
Yaah!

255
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:40,843
What's he doing here?

256
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,899
Didn't Brother impale him through the heart?

257
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:46,815
Don't underestimate the sheer flexibility of my body!

258
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,788
Shifting the position of my internal
organs is nothing but child's play for me!

259
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,798
And since I grew up on the harsh mountainside,

260
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,832
poison doesn't work on me, either!

261
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,152
Help me, Brother!

262
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:06,102
Do something before I get decapitated!

263
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,615
I need to unleash the Rotating Circulatory Slashes.

264
00:19:58,348 --> 00:19:59,535
They did it.

265
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,593
They really did it.

266
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,497
They did it! They did it!

267
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,783
They did it! Hear that, Hinatsuru?!

268
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:10,192
Just take a look from beyond the grave!

269
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,748
What the... Do you even know what you're saying to her?!

270
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:13,287
What?

271
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:13,908
Dummy!

272
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:14,887
That hurt!

273
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,653
Hold on a second!

274
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,375
Something's not right here.

275
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,873
Th-The poison...

276
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,790
u-use your breathing to combat it.

277
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:36,742
S-Slow down the poison...

278
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,395
as much as you can.

279
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:41,963
Kamado! Get up!

280
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:42,753
It's not over yet!

281
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:45,303
What... What is he saying?

282
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,510
Does it mean...

283
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,304
I didn't cut off his head?

284
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,163
Run!

285
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:53,893
Mr. Uzui is...

286
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:54,608
He's not done yet!

287
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,696
...saying something.

288
00:20:57,746 --> 00:21:01,157
You gotta run!

289
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,603
Nin-nin!

290
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,926
Brother! Brother, are you all right?

291
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,327
Hang in there, Brother. You have to survive!

292
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:16,283
And now it's time for a Taisho-era secret
about a certain something that has helped Brother

293
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,370
overcome countless dangers like this.

294
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:22,173
Brother got his rock-hard head from our mother.

295
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:25,558
When I was still just a little girl...

296
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,311
I heard that Mother was able to repel a
boar all by herself by head-butting him!

297
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:34,933
Next, the final episode, "No Matter How Many Lives."

298
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,328
You got this, Brother!

299
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:38,459
I know you have what it takes to win!
