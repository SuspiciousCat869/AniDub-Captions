1
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,187
Thank goodness.

2
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:11,707
Nezuko's asleep.

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,913
Nezuko! No, don't!

4
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:47,906
You sleep tight, Nezuko.

5
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,763
I can still move.

6
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,246
I can still put up a fight.

7
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,314
This time, no matter what happens,

8
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,309
I'm fighting to the very end.

9
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:51,094
You're starting to piss me off.

10
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:54,771
You're a good-looking guy,
you have three wives to yourself,

11
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,820
and on top of that, you're teeming with confidence.

12
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:01,375
You're different, aren't you?

13
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:05,157
You're not like any of the other Hashira I've slaughtered.

14
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:07,926
Normally people have to train to get strong,

15
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:10,674
but I'm sure you were born with strength, weren't you?

16
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:13,354
Being born with talent must be nice.

17
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,394
I thought I was envious before,
but I'm so jealous right now,

18
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,287
all I can think about is tearing you to shreds!

19
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,816
Born with talent?

20
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:22,584
Huh?

21
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:28,112
You think I look like someone with any talent to boast of?

22
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:31,616
If someone like me gives that impression,

23
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,404
then you're more out of touch than I thought.

24
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,260
Huh?

25
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:38,222
You may be centuries old,

26
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:42,518
but if you've been stuck in this district,
then your ignorance to the real world makes sense.

27
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,047
What do you know about the real world?!

28
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,821
I know it all too well.

29
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,491
You have no idea.

30
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:51,499
This country of ours, it's giant!

31
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,331
It's full of people who would blow your mind.

32
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,871
Some are a complete mystery.

33
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,611
They can pick up a sword and
become a Hashira in just two months!

34
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,490
Yet you're saying I'm special?

35
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,812
What a load of crap!

36
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,816
Do you have any idea...

37
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:09,826
just how many lives have slipped through my fingers?

38
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:11,508
That's right.

39
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:14,758
Rengoku was always ahead of me in that regard.

40
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,497
If you aren't special, then what's going on?

41
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:24,046
Both of my Blood Sickles are drenched with deadly poison.

42
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:29,186
I'm positive it's entered your bloodstream
by now, so why aren't you dead?! Huh?!

43
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,434
I said I'm a trained shinobi, didn't I?

44
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:34,044
I'm immune to nearly all types of poison.

45
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,501
The shinobi were wiped out back
during the Edo period, you fool.

46
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,382
Don't think you can lie to us.

47
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:40,585
It's not a lie.

48
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,026
The shinobi still exist.

49
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,326
I had nine brothers and sisters.

50
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,431
Seven died by the time I turned 15.

51
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,447
Frightened that our clan would live on only in history,

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,250
my father forced us to train
as if our lives depended on it.

53
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:02,126
The only survivors were myself and
my brother two years younger than me,

54
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,771
and he was exactly like my father.

55
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,724
They shared the same mindset,
treating subordinates like pawns.

56
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:11,143
His wives were no exception.

57
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,561
He just wanted heirs.

58
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:14,494
No one else ever had any say.

59
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,584
His word was absolute.

60
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:18,963
And I...

61
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,074
I didn't want to become like him.

62
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,458
It's hard, isn't it, Tengen,

63
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,647
the path that you've chosen?

64
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,442
You've decided to reject the very same values
that shaped you into the shinobi you are today

65
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,567
and enter the battlefield where those values thrive.

66
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,161
It must be painful.

67
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:48,651
Despite carrying all that conflict within yourself,

68
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,087
still...

69
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,621
you all insist on pushing forward and fighting

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,688
and for a noble cause too,

71
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,354
all so you can protect other people's lives.

72
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,198
You have my thanks.

73
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,860
You are quite a remarkable child.

74
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,264
It is I who should be giving thanks.

75
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:15,971
Master...

76
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:19,558
I'd never think twice about
laying down my life for your sake.

77
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,549
Those with conflict might be spineless fools,

78
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,652
but it's why I've achieved
everything that I have up until now,

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,050
and I've never been without it.

80
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,151
Huh? Huh?

81
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:33,024
Huh?

82
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,751
What the hell are you laughing about?

83
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:45,815
Slowly, but surely... the poison's
affecting you after all, isn't it?

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,574
This must be embarrassing after all that
talk about it not working on a guy like you, huh?

85
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:57,222
You're wrong! I'm fine!

86
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:58,311
Look for yourself!

87
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,259
I've never felt better!

88
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:02,885
I could devour a hundred bowls of tempura don!

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,880
In a flashy way, of course!

90
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:17,081
Don't you dare lay a hand on my little sister!

91
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:18,567
You scumbag!

92
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,195
Well, those are unique explosions.

93
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,988
They can inflict damage on a demon's body

94
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,596
and detonate from the slightest friction.

95
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,233
Since she slashed one without realizing that, she got hit.

96
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:42,374
There's never a dull moment
taking care of her, that's for sure.

97
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,455
The blade can extend?!

98
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:53,486
No, he's holding on to the tip of his
sword! What kind of insane grip is that?!

99
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,381
Now!

100
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,597
I missed my chance to finish him!

101
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,982
He just beheaded me again!

102
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:10,461
Damn you! Damn you!

103
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,253
I'll make you pay for this!

104
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,295
It's not fair...

105
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,500
not fair!

106
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,635
How come I'm the one who's always getting beheaded?

107
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:23,261
Hold on.

108
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:25,723
You're onto us, aren't you, big guy?

109
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:27,661
About what?

110
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:32,288
Not that finding out about our
little trick will do you any good,

111
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,750
since you're going to die a slow and painful death anyway.

112
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,873
Even now, as we speak, we're getting closer and closer

113
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,531
to your inevitable death, aren't we?

114
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:43,581
Hmm?

115
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,525
Are you sure about that?

116
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,911
Or did you forget about me!

117
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,094
It is I, Lord Inosuke, along with my trusty minion!

118
00:08:57,254 --> 00:09:00,136
Who the hell are these two idiots?

119
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:02,420
Eh?

120
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,350
Huh?

121
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:30,605
What's happening?

122
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,884
Follow me if you're wounded!

123
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:42,649
As for everyone else, please evacuate!

124
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,326
I've taught you well.

125
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,806
Talk about a flashy entrance!

126
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,740
Keep it coming!

127
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:24,342
You can summon all the underlings you want,

128
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,677
but unfortunately your fate was sealed from the start.

129
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,941
So look, you're all going to die anyway, right?

130
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,620
So drop the act and quit staring
at me like that, will you?!

131
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,092
There are two demons now.

132
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,212
How did that happen?

133
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:47,034
Also, the Belt Demon isn't dead.

134
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,565
Are they both Upper Six and
somehow splintered off each other?

135
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,476
If that is the case,

136
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,839
then there's no doubt this guy is the main threat.

137
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,409
His scent is different.

138
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,833
It's far stronger.

139
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,011
It feels like the back of my throat's going numb from it.

140
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:11,521
My hands won't stop shaking.

141
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,271
Is it because I'm exhausted...

142
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,311
or is it that I'm afraid?

143
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:20,306
It doesn't matter, because either way...

144
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:22,991
no matter how strong they are...

145
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,311
We'll win! 'Cause we're Demon Slayer Corps!

146
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:28,730
Yeah, right! Fat chance!

147
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,525
Not when your only hope to win is being ravaged by poison.

148
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,611
Poison?

149
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:38,291
Does it look like I care, you idiots?!

150
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:42,001
I'm at the top of my game when I
got a little poison in my system!

151
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,005
Drop the act, already!

152
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:47,012
It's no act! You just underestimate humans!

153
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,011
All three of these boys are my brilliant Tsuguko!

154
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,099
They have relentless grit!

155
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,276
Yeah, we do!

156
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,856
And they'll fight even if their limbs fall off!

157
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,978
Not to mention, I've already
figured out how to bring you two down!

158
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:06,643
And that's to behead the both of you simultaneously!

159
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:07,707
Am I right?

160
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:19,394
That's why you don't just
absorb your weaker sister completely.

161
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,001
Keeping your talents separate makes you harder to kill.

162
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,264
This'll be easy-peasy!

163
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,275
It's as simple as that, isn't it?!

164
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,891
Then we've already won, haven't we?!

165
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,481
You say that, but the Demon
Slayers who perished before you

166
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:37,101
didn't find that task to be so simple.

167
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,191
Not even the Hashira!

168
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:42,424
Fifteen for me, and seven for my sister,

169
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,841
that's how many we've devoured.

170
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,149
You heard him.

171
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,473
Not a single one of those
fools even lived to see daybreak!

172
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:55,669
After all, we always have the long nights on our side.

173
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:59,028
Your deaths are inevitable, so just die!

174
00:12:59,214 --> 00:12:59,868
Huh?

175
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:12,880
Zenitsu!

176
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,650
Leave that Worm Lady to me and Mr. Sleepyhead!

177
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,079
You two focus on taking down
the praying-mantis-lookin' guy!

178
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:20,271
Careful!

179
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,539
Yeah, yeah!

180
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:25,441
I'm not about to let you kill my sister.

181
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,383
It's you, the little brat!

182
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,066
There's something I need to tell you.

183
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,383
Apologize to the girl whose ear you pulled.

184
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:39,642
Huh?

185
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,237
Even if it really was your earnings

186
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:46,162
that kept the house afloat and provided for everyone,

187
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:49,503
it still doesn't make those girls your belongings.

188
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,856
You have no right to treat them like that.

189
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,961
Oh, please. Don't bore me with
your high-and-mighty lecturing.

190
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,298
With unfortunate looks like yours,

191
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,428
what makes you think that you
can talk down to me, exactly?

192
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:07,134
In this city, women are merchandise, the same as objects.

193
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,744
They are bought, sold, and then discarded.

194
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,546
Such is the right of an owner.

195
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,133
Those without beauty don't deserve even a grain of rice.

196
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:21,034
It only makes sense the wretches
shouldn't be treated as humans.

197
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:28,190
You shouldn't inflict the pain
that was done to you onto others.

198
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,663
You couldn't be more wrong!

199
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,748
The horrible things done to us,

200
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,725
the things that made us suffer,

201
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:39,177
it only makes sense to give back what we received.

202
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,706
We might have been driven to misfortune,

203
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:45,982
but we make up for it in the
revenge we exact upon the blessed.

204
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,126
Do you understand now?

205
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,166
That's the way we've chosen to live our lives.

206
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,023
We have killed off anyone who's ever
crossed us, anyone who's ever slighted us.

207
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,606
We're going to slash through your gullets
just like we did to all who came before you!

208
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,233
His bloodlust is unreal.

209
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,300
It's giving my whole body chills.

210
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,904
He's the real deal, an Upper Six demon!

211
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,554
You have to focus.

212
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,850
Mr. Uzui's been poisoned, so I have to protect him!

213
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,561
Strike with your sword the instant he makes a move!

214
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,001
The second he moves even an inch,

215
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,350
that's my chance!

216
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:30,231
Swing it!

217
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,321
Swing your sword!

218
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,155
Evade it! Evade it!

219
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,281
Bend backwards! Bend...

220
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,478
What are you doing?

221
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:48,683
He protected you instead, and now you're just a hindrance!

222
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,407
I can't deflect this many belts.

223
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:10,797
Huh? She's got three eyes?

224
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,247
I can see everything now, including all of your movements.

225
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:17,058
Now that Brother's awake,

226
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:20,266
I'm able to show you what my true power looks like.

227
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:21,790
Shut up!

228
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,480
Your shrill voice is really making my head hurt!

229
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,791
Them being your Tsuguko was a lie.

230
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:33,568
Your movements are so out of sync, it's almost laughable.

231
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:36,576
And here I thought you'd be different.

232
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:43,547
You won't get close enough to even start fighting me.

233
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,393
Shut up, Worm Lady!

234
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:50,271
If you're really as strong as you say, then why
run your mouth the whole time instead of killing us?!

235
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,145
Be careful what you ask for!

236
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,535
Die, already!

237
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:17,544
This speed...

238
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,531
he really is like a praying mantis.

239
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,185
And these attacks of his...

240
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:40,303
I'm trapped.

241
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,060
Why are these slashes... so heavy?!

242
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,846
Side-step it! Ward off the blow!

243
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,753
If you take it head-on, it'll snap your blade in half!

244
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,482
If it's power versus power, the weaker side always loses.

245
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:01,016
Don't misjudge the flow of power,

246
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,789
and redirect it as necessary.

247
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,176
The flexible Water Breathing
technique is better for defense.

248
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:08,511
If I had just done this before...

249
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,853
my blade never would have gotten chipped!

250
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:22,031
Sound Breathing.

251
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,374
Fifth Form...

252
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:27,633
String Performance!

253
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:34,113
You can use your noisy moves all you
want, Hashira, but it changes nothing!

254
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,218
Drop dead, You ugly toads!

255
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,511
Now we have blood blades flying
towards us with the belts?!

256
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:48,055
If this keeps up, then I'll never
be able to get near the Worm Lady!

257
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,475
These damn blood blades are bad news.

258
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,818
I can sense that even a scratch from them would be deadly!

259
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,240
Try to be useful!

260
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,213
Don't let him attack like he wants!

261
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,363
Most importantly, find a way to win!

262
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,677
He won't hold up much longer.

263
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,136
It's a miracle he can still move at all.

264
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:17,328
That shoulder wound must be really deep.

265
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,623
He seems to have stopped the bleeding for now,

266
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:23,303
but that left hand tied to his hilt
is the only thing keeping his grip.

267
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,759
All because I let myself get poisoned.

268
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,654
If I don't take care of this now, we'll be annihilated.

269
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,601
I can't breathe.

270
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:37,719
There's too much happening to catch my breath.

271
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,494
I'm about to black out.

272
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,330
I've got to find a way to start Recovery Breathing!

273
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,345
What's this?

274
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,007
Kunai?

275
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,891
Ugh. It's gonna be a pain dealing with
this many of them in front of a Hashira.

276
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,981
Could they be any more annoying?

277
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,166
There's still three fledgling Demon Slayers too.

278
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,434
Well, even if they do hit me, these things are no prob...

279
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:27,615
Wait, would they really try to
pull off such a meaningless attack?

280
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,476
Blood Demon Art! Rampant Arc Rampage!

281
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,831
He's creating a dome with the slashes.

282
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,740
Huh? Hey, hold on a second!

283
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:39,305
What's going on here?

284
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,841
He's closing in on me?

285
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:42,809
And what's this?

286
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:45,296
There's multiple kunai stuck in him?

287
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:47,198
That's right.

288
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,383
He's not a swordsman. He's a shinobi.

289
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,443
That explains his otherworldly battle senses.

290
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,585
Wha...

291
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,126
My legs aren't regenerating.

292
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,611
I knew it. They're laced with something.

293
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,626
If I had to guess, this kunai is probably
coated in something extracted from wisteria.

294
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:11,231
M-My body's going numb.

295
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,700
Hey, not too shabby!

296
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:20,961
You're starting to get into sync with one
another in such a short time! How amusing!

297
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,491
Please!

298
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,927
Nin-nin!

299
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:05,394
Rengoku, how would you fight against this?

300
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:06,774
What if...

301
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,829
I'm just not able to handle this like you could?

302
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,281
It's okay to do things a little differently.

303
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:16,336
Rengoku!

304
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,606
Your sword skills are elegant.

305
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,977
Though you do have too many wives.

306
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,976
The Kamado boy, the yellow-haired boy,

307
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:29,551
and boar-headed boy, take care of them, Uzui.

308
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:35,051
I'll watch over them flashily.

309
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,973
Next, Episode 9, "Defeating an Upper Rank Demon"!
