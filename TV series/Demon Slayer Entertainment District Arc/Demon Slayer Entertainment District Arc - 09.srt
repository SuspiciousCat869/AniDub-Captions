1
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,056
Wha...

2
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:17,016
Hmph.

3
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:23,095
Please tell me it worked,

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,930
even if just for a second.

5
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:27,491
If it did...

6
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:30,475
then someone should be able to behead him!

7
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,802
If my siblings were still alive...

8
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:49,231
maybe we would have gone drinking one day.

9
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,435
Forgive me,

10
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,688
but I haven't died just yet.

11
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:57,720
So I brought some fine sake to try to make up for it.

12
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,369
I promise we'll all grab drinks
in the afterlife at some point.

13
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,482
Now dig in everyone, and make it flashy!

14
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:21,167
Whoa, these are tasty! Don't hold back, you three.

15
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,697
Pardon me, Lord Tengen.

16
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:25,937
Hmm?

17
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:28,286
Forgive me for asking.

18
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:31,073
Do you think about your departed siblings often?

19
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,907
Of course.

20
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,349
Not a day goes by that I don't.

21
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,683
I always think about the day I
left my homeland with you three.

22
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,063
It feels like only yesterday it happened.

23
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:55,221
Hey, this one's tasty too!

24
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:56,686
Come on! Join me!

25
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,375
Right.

26
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,669
It's delicious!

27
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,899
Slow down! Would it kill you to show restraint?

28
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,129
Settle down.

29
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,984
But Lord Tengen told us to dig in!

30
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,439
Here you go, Makio. Open wide!

31
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,387
Mmm. It is good.

32
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,248
Isn't it?

33
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:22,768
Mmm.

34
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,269
In the end, I'm going straight to hell.

35
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:27,835
Hmm?

36
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:32,205
Whoops. Shouldn't have said that out loud.

37
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,482
I guess I just earned another
tongue-lashing from you three, huh?

38
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:41,190
Mark my words.

39
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:44,926
I'm gonna live the flashiest life
possible for my fallen siblings.

40
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,632
With you three.

41
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,069
Right.

42
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:02,112
How lovely.

43
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:11,767
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

44
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,527
No?

45
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,417
Lord Tengen, look at this!

46
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,859
I've got a few in my hair too.

47
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,629
Why do I feel like you put those on yourself?

48
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,726
What makes you think I would do that?

49
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,203
Lord Tengen,

50
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,778
if you don't mind,

51
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,322
could you give me that petal?

52
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:32,030
I don't mind at all, but there's tons of them everywhere.

53
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,775
The only one I want is that one.

54
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,990
Thank you, Lord Tengen.

55
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,908
Lord Tengen, I want one, too!

56
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:47,762
Huh?

57
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,369
Just pick up one of the petals yourself!

58
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,776
You're so cruel!

59
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,861
Lord Tengen!

60
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,226
He regenerated his legs?

61
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,226
Damn it! He's already neutralized the poison!

62
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:10,957
Man...

63
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:15,302
that poison sure packed a punch, but now it's my turn.

64
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,912
Blood Demon Art.

65
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:23,545
Rotating Circular Slashes... Flying Blood Scythes!

66
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,151
He can attack without swinging his arms...

67
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,219
with such range?!

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,866
Sound Breathing.

69
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:36,403
Fourth Form...

70
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,212
Constant Resounding Slashes!

71
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,077
He's gone?

72
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,817
Lord Tengen, watch out!

73
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:57,742
Hinatsu...

74
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:02,531
I'll draw the belts' attention.
Don't mind me! I'll take care of her!

75
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:04,274
You find that dem...

76
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,590
You've got some nerve jumping into this fight.

77
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:14,463
But now you have to suffer
the consequences of that choice.

78
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,243
Hinatsuru!

79
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:19,476
Damn it!

80
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,897
These belts are blocking me!

81
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:25,832
Hinatsuru.

82
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:33,667
Wow! It's beautiful here, don't you think, Lord Tengen?

83
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:36,368
Dragonflies!

84
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,342
I wish I could soar like one of them.

85
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:41,692
Hey, now that's a flashy dream if I ever heard one!

86
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,186
There you go again, spouting nonsense like a lunatic!

87
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,074
What?! Why do you have to be so mean all the time?

88
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,929
I hate you, Makio!

89
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,169
What was that? I dare you to say that again!

90
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:54,701
Hmm?

91
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,202
Lord Tengen...

92
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,672
once we've defeated an Upper Rank demon,

93
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:12,798
what do you think about us all stepping back
from the front lines and just living as civilians?

94
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,021
While none of us chose to become shinobi,

95
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:20,047
we can't just walk away after all the lives we took.

96
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:24,741
We still need to set things
right somewhere along the line,

97
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:29,604
Otherwise, we could never hold our heads up
again or dream of ever living a normal life.

98
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:33,467
When that day comes, one of us might not make it.

99
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:36,385
But no hard feelings, right?

100
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,549
Leave her alone!

101
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,022
Move.

102
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,636
Move, move, move, move!

103
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,822
Another person is about to be killed before my eyes.

104
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:58,624
Close the distance!

105
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,452
Quick! Jump up on the roof!

106
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:03,105
You can't always be the one being protected!

107
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,062
You have to be useful here!

108
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,652
Because I'm weak...

109
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,727
he doesn't acknowledge me as a threat.

110
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,484
So if I make an unpredictable move,

111
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,990
I can save her!

112
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,458
I have no choice.

113
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,443
I have to use Hinokami Kagura!

114
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,015
Maybe I can reach him with that!

115
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:29,957
It's no good.

116
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,620
I'm out of stamina. I can't pull it off!

117
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,702
What do I do?

118
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:35,202
Think. Think!

119
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,635
What do I do? What do I do?!

120
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,511
Focus. What else can I do right
now that's gonna be able to save her?

121
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,884
I have to act before it's too late!

122
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:08,725
I didn't think that kid was capable
of such a lightning-quick move.

123
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,055
Judging from his fatigue,

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,223
there's no way he can move like that again right now.

125
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:22,672
I did it. I did it.

126
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,643
Keep blending the Breathing Techniques.

127
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:28,911
Use Water Breathing and Hinokami Kagura in combination.

128
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,012
That'll give me more attack power
than I'd have with just Water Breathing,

129
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:36,448
and I'll also be able to move
longer than with just Hinokami Kagura.

130
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:41,280
I bet the swordsmen who have fought the
demons 'til now have been doing that all along...

131
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,458
pairing the Breathing Techniques with
the sword skills that suit them best

132
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,560
and modifying them into a form
that draws out their full power.

133
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,452
I'm sure those same swordsmen were able
to create different techniques like that.

134
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:58,635
Modify it... into any form.

135
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,082
Be flexible.

136
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:04,326
That's the kind of fighting style
that Mr. Urokodaki taught me to use.

137
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,755
Even if I can never fully master
Water Breathing like Mr.Tomioka,

138
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:18,333
no matter what, I won't let what
Mr. Urokodaki taught me go to waste!

139
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:22,844
Enough fooling around. You're going down!

140
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:31,425
Tanjiro Kamado!

141
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:35,225
You have my utmost gratitude!

142
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,759
Whoa! Hey! Watch it!

143
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,241
There's too many of these things to keep up with!

144
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,579
They might be slithery, but
these things are hard as a rock!

145
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,465
There's no end in sight to 'em, either!

146
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,029
Huh?

147
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,319
Yaah!

148
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,372
Damn it! Damn it!

149
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,687
They're gonna decapitate him without me!

150
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,562
Inosuke, incoming attack!

151
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:21,973
The only way to bring this one down
is for us to strike at the same time!

152
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,109
We're able to hold our own by dodging her belt attacks,

153
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,602
but we can't expect to win just by avoiding her.

154
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,013
We have to act!

155
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,852
If we can close the distance, we can go for her head!

156
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,863
Inosuke, calm down!

157
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,469
We don't have to strike simultaneously.

158
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:52,426
We just need to make sure the
two demon heads aren't connected!

159
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:02,539
Even after they've beheaded their
demon, we have to fight with all we've got!

160
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,262
Wait, you're...

161
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,096
you're like...

162
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:10,585
You're like a completely different
person now, aren't you?! What gives?!

163
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,615
Stay alert and use this chance to go for his head.

164
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,621
I can do it!

165
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:24,550
Damn. He won't budge!

166
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:31,242
You really think you're capable of cutting off my head?

167
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,361
Hate to break it to you, but that's not gonna happen!

168
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,799
My blade is stuck!

169
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:52,384
Of course a freak like you can swing
his head all the way around like that!

170
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,848
Not again!

171
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,338
Kamado, hang on tight!

172
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,590
Mr. Uzui!

173
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,153
Lord Tengen!

174
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,297
Mr. Uzui!

175
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:11,707
Look out!

176
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,935
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

177
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,897
They're forcing us to change our strategy! Muscle!

178
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:35,032
I can't close in on the Worm Lady, no matter what!

179
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:39,842
So us three will take her on, while the old
man deals with the praying mantis guy alone!

180
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:43,198
Well, at the very least, she's the weaker of the two.

181
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:44,802
We need to behead her first.

182
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Tanjiro, can you still move?

183
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,679
I can move!

184
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,993
However, Mr. Uzui has been poisoned,
and he's in bad shape 'cause of it.

185
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,972
So we have to hurry, or else he won't make it!

186
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,000
I barely blocked it.

187
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,205
That was close.

188
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,160
He's attacking us even as he fights Mr. Uzui?

189
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:19,143
Miss Hinatsuru!

190
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,530
You shouldn't worry about me at all!

191
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,359
I'll hide for now! You just focus on winning!

192
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,972
Look out! Behind you!

193
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,406
Are you all right?

194
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,328
Yes, thanks to you!

195
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,382
I can see that your movements
are getting more and more sluggish.

196
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,430
I wonder which of you will be the first to fall apart?

197
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,752
Damn it!

198
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,407
Monichi and I are still practically unscathed!

199
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,602
We've got to start getting serious.

200
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,950
The other two are banged up from giving their all.

201
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,181
What was the point of all that brutal training?

202
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,071
What was the point?

203
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,910
What was the point?!

204
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,560
Inosuke!

205
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,130
This demon's neck is too soft to cut normally!

206
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,639
It's going to take a lot of speed! Otherwise...

207
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:14,315
we'll have to slash her from multiple directions!

208
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,363
Got that?!

209
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,705
Now that it's heading toward Tanjiro as well,

210
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,733
it seems like the attack has...

211
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,274
ever so slightly slowed down.

212
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,292
Maybe I'm seeing things here, but I'm gonna assume it has!

213
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,330
All right!

214
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:45,037
You want multiple directions, leave it to
yours truly, Lord Inosuke, the dual-wielder!

215
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:49,705
As long as you two have my
back, together, we can beat her!

216
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:50,778
Understood!

217
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,421
Zenitsu, protect Inosuke!

218
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:54,455
Got it!

219
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,927
You can bring all the ugly freaks you want to the fight,

220
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,995
but it's not gonna change a thing!

221
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,053
Now, Inosuke!

222
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:13,998
Let's go!

223
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,375
Stay close and don't let me down, underlings!

224
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,542
Beast Breathing.

225
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:28,384
Eighth Form...

226
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,848
Explosive...

227
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:33,456
Rush!

228
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,262
Water Breathing.

229
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:43,524
Third Form...

230
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,238
Thunder Breathing.

231
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,702
First Form...

232
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,272
...Flowing...

233
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:04,682
...Thunderclap and Flash!

234
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:07,179
...Dance!

235
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,545
Eightfold!

236
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:25,769
What?

237
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:30,148
He's charging straight towards
me without any type of defense!

238
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,201
I'm getting it done this time.

239
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,478
You can't cut it off.

240
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:42,978
There's no way you can,

241
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,072
not with these beat-up blades of yours.

242
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,558
Sixth Fang...

243
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,526
...Palisade Bite!

244
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,427
Inosuke, you did it!

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,685
Using your swords like saw blades was genius!

246
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,899
I got her head! I got her head!

247
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:26,770
I'm gonna take it far away so she can't stick it back on!

248
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:30,565
Whoa!

249
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:38,202
You two go help the old man!

250
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:41,912
I'm gonna run around with this head
until you guys beat the other one!

251
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,145
Will do!

252
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,940
Be careful, Inosuke!

253
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,040
Got it!

254
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,708
Mr. Uzui!

255
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,944
We've got to help him... before it's too late.

256
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,777
Let me go, you hideous boar!

257
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,404
I said let me go!

258
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,345
Yaah!

259
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,628
Is that all you got?

260
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:09,068
Man, you suck now.

261
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,843
What did you just say?!

262
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,087
You might not die when your head is cut off,

263
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:16,065
but you're so damn weak, you might as well be dead.

264
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,306
Inosuke!

265
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,482
Inosuke! Inosuke!

266
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,856
This is bad! The poison!

267
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,412
Was he stabbed in the heart?

268
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,631
It's too dark to see!

269
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:35,771
Damn it!

270
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,361
What's he doing here?

271
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:40,256
He was fighting Mr. Uzui.

272
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,156
Mr. Uzui!

273
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,483
Tanjiro! Look out!

274
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:53,506
Damn it.

275
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,340
Zenitsu, forget about me.

276
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,447
This happened because I wasn't paying attention.

277
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,075
I'm sorry, Inosuke.

278
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,499
If only I'd noticed him sooner, then maybe...

279
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,329
No, if I hadn't left Mr. Uzui's side in the first place,

280
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,191
this never would have happened.

281
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,047
It's my fault.

282
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:19,961
I'm sorry, everyone.

283
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,111
Please forgive me.

284
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:26,627
I'm sorry...

285
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:27,967
Nezuko.

286
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,383
Nin-nin!

287
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,926
Beast Breathing.

288
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:06,239
Eighth Form, Explosive Rush!

289
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,781
Thunder Breathing. First Form,

290
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,776
Thunderclap and Flash! Eightfold!

291
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:11,118
Water Breathing.

292
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,046
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

293
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:22,636
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

294
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,783
Mr. Uzui!

295
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,089
Can we really still win this?

296
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,682
Don't give up!

297
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:34,558
Don't give up! Don't give up!

298
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,033
Next, Episode 10...

299
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:38,133
"Never Give Up."
