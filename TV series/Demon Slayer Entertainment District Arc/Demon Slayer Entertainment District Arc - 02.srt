1
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:03,073
Entertainment... District?

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,606
Y-You know, that place with all the beautiful...

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:10,521
th-the shapely... Y-You get what
I'm trying to say, right? Come on!

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,280
Huh?

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,002
Listen up!

6
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:20,035
I am a god!

7
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:22,819
You three are trash!

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,205
That's the first bit of info
you need to pound into your heads,

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,610
so drive it in!

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,974
You turn into dogs if I say so!

11
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,215
Arf, arf, arf, arf!

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,240
Turn into monkeys if I tell you!

13
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,565
Whoo-hoo!

14
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,925
So be ready to bend over backwards,

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,330
pander to my every whim, and worship me endlessly!

16
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:43,500
That's right.

17
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,725
And remember above all else...

18
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:48,137
I am a god!

19
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:53,824
Oh, this guy is crazy.

20
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,594
Quick question, Lord Uzui.

21
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:59,253
What exactly are you the god of?

22
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,163
Please tell me he's playing dumb.

23
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,180
Good question, pupil.

24
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:04,440
Huh?

25
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,440
You have great potential.

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,696
What potential lies in a stupid question like that?

27
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,611
I am the god of festivals,

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,497
the god of flashiness.

29
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,200
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

30
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,595
He's the god of stupidity and idiots.

31
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,517
Well, I am the King of the Mountains!

32
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,285
It's a pleasure to meet you, God of Festivals!

33
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,252
I've never heard of you.

34
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:30,932
That's odd.

35
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,507
Something about you creeps me out.

36
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,023
You're kidding, right?!

37
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:40,133
You two are match made in heaven! Cringeworthy!

38
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:42,086
You want creepy? I'll show you creepy!

39
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:43,980
Take it easy now, Inosuke!

40
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,921
Super creepy.

41
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,612
Eh?!

42
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:50,538
He's totally oblivious to the fact that
they're basically the same person, isn't he?

43
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:51,952
Tear that flashy...

44
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:52,400
Right.

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,101
That's enough fooling around. Let's go.

46
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,081
Follow me.

47
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,300
Huh?

48
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,120
He disappeared?

49
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:06,173
Look!

50
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:09,574
He's fast! Look how far he got!

51
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,856
He's the size of a sesame seed!

52
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,250
So this is the power of the God of Festivals.

53
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:18,596
No way. He's just Mr. Uzui Tengen, a Hashira.

54
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,617
What are you waiting around for?

55
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,117
We have to go after him!

56
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,532
Please be careful!

57
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,278
Please be careful!

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,660
Safe travels!

59
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:26,760
Listen, you three.

60
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,051
Try not to stand out.

61
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:31,520
We're only here to case the joint.

62
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,463
And whatever you do, don't get out of the carriage.

63
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:35,570
Uh...

64
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:37,875
Stop it! What do you think you're doing?

65
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:39,979
Where are you going?!

66
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:43,405
Come back, you two!

67
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:46,102
What a bunch of hardheaded idiots!

68
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,954
Settle down, Inosuke.

69
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,790
Get back here, damn it!

70
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,460
I'm talking to you too!

71
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,030
Are you listening to me?!

72
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,340
It's so bright.

73
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,588
It looks like it's daytime.

74
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:07,747
Allow me to introduce you to the
Yoshiwara Entertainment District,

75
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,305
awash in vanity and desire.

76
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,452
Flashy, isn't it?

77
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,957
What kind of place is this?!

78
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:17,808
There's too many people to even count!

79
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:22,990
Make way, chumps,

80
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,903
'cause I'm comin' through!

81
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:24,328
Hey!

82
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,370
Get back here, moron!

83
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:28,251
A boar is on a rampage!

84
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:31,618
Hey! Where'd the annoying kid with the yellow hair go?

85
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:32,295
What?

86
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,907
Well, aren't you a handsome one?

87
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,090
Why don't you come and join us?

88
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:42,325
If you're hungry, we have candy.

89
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,298
No need to be shy, young man.

90
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:55,901
Beautiful ladies who make the first move?

91
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,922
What am I gonna do?!

92
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,563
Not so fast!

93
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,035
You're too young for that kinda stuff.

94
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,495
Take notes, you three.

95
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,430
During the day, this place is quiet as a ghost town,

96
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:12,500
but at night, it roars to life with all kinds of people,

97
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:15,171
ideal circumstances for a demon.

98
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,257
The women here are also unique.

99
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:21,698
Many become courtesans and
are sold off to pay their debts.

100
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,270
In return, they're given food, clothing, and lodging,

101
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,800
and if they climb up the ranks, a
rich man might buy out their contracts.

102
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,970
The highest-ranking courtesan is referred to as oiran,

103
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:33,720
and she's on a whole different level.

104
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:36,031
Her beauty and intelligence are unrivalled,

105
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:38,080
and she's mastered every traditional art.

106
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,872
A woman of distinction

107
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:44,133
bathed in her house's resources
to become their shining star.

108
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,382
She sounds incredible.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,914
I think that's enough reconnaissance for now.

110
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:50,437
Let's go.

111
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:57,808
Sorry to impose!

112
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,250
Listen up, you three.

113
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:04,774
Once you're in the Entertainment District,

114
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:06,945
you should try to seek out my wives.

115
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,233
I'll search for any info on the demons.

116
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,975
This is completely ridiculous!

117
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:15,671
Huh?

118
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,999
You're joking, right?

119
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:22,115
How dare you order us to waste our
time finding a bride for you, huh?

120
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,696
What?! When did I ever ask for something like that?!

121
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,536
Shut up! I'm not done talking here!

122
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,820
Zenitsu, please!

123
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,490
Just because a freak like you has no
luck with the ladies doesn't make it okay

124
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:34,239
to use Demon Slayers like us for such a pitiful reason!

125
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,584
We're not helping you find a wife, you creep!

126
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,588
What are you babbling about, idiot?!

127
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm talking about my wives who've
infiltrated the Entertainment District

128
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,577
and are hard at work gathering intel!

129
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:47,394
I've stopped receiving regular check-ins,
so I need to ensure they're still safe!

130
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:52,468
I suppose that is what a guy like you would fantasize.

131
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,082
You damned punk!

132
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,152
Here's your proof,

133
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,549
letters that were sent to me by Kasugai Crow.

134
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,028
There's quite a lot of them here.

135
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:07,190
She must have been undercover for quite some time.

136
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,250
Oh, well, I do have three wives.

137
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:10,110
Huh?

138
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:11,910
Did you say, "Wives"?

139
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,150
And, "Three"?

140
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,020
Three?! Three?!

141
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,084
Three wives?! There's no way!

142
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,647
How did you, of all people, manage to get three wives?!

143
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,515
Is this some kind of sick joke?!

144
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,890
You got a problem with that, kid?

145
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:31,951
Um, excuse me,

146
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,209
but I noticed that in the letters they sent you,

147
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,269
they all seem to keep reminding
you not to stand out when you come.

148
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,409
Which is why I'm sending you three.

149
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,906
So what are we going to do, exactly?

150
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,729
Disguise yourselves, of course,

151
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,511
and as much as I hate it, in an unflashy way.

152
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:52,571
All three of my wives are
brilliant ninjas known as kunoichis.

153
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:56,870
I was almost certain that this district
would be the perfect place for the demons,

154
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:59,250
but when I went in as a customer,

155
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,035
I couldn't get any info on 'em.

156
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:05,427
So I sent each of them in to get
closer than a customer ever could.

157
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:09,735
Since I've already narrowed
down the likeliest houses to three,

158
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,843
you all will search for my wives there

159
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,583
and try to gather information.

160
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,010
Suma of the Tokito House,

161
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,759
Makio of the Ogimoto House,

162
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,236
and Hinatsuru of the Kyogoku House.

163
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,994
They're probably all dead if they stopped writing.

164
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,336
Pardon my intrusion, sir,

165
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,484
but I brought back all of the items you requested earlier.

166
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:32,968
Thank you.

167
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,007
Oh, my goodness.

168
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:55,621
These three girls... are certainly
a homely bunch, aren't they?

169
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,796
Sorry. I'm afraid we're not looking to hire at this time.

170
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,922
I beg of you to find it in your heart to reconsider.

171
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,422
I believe that under your training, Madam,

172
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,534
their beauty'll bloom in no time.

173
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,367
That's very flattering, but...

174
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,864
mmm... Eh?

175
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,059
Well, I suppose taking in one wouldn't be a problem.

176
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,248
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.

177
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:27,591
You may pick whichever girl you'd like.

178
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,920
If we can choose, then I think
we'll take the one in the middle.

179
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,688
She looks the most obedient.

180
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,380
I promise to work as hard as I can.

181
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,917
Great! Now I'm stuck with you two brats.

182
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:43,201
I'm gonna have to pay someone to take you.

183
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,954
Stop talking to me. I don't want to hear it from you.

184
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,967
Are you upset you have to dress up as a girl?

185
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,808
You said you'd do anything I asked, right?

186
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:00,555
I don't give a damn that I'm
dressed up like a girl, you moron.

187
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:03,384
It's that face of yours.

188
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,387
You think you're such hot stuff,

189
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,407
and it pisses me the hell off!

190
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,897
Hey, look! Seems like there's a whole
bunch of people swarming around over there.

191
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:15,861
Hmm?

192
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:16,399
Eh?

193
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:41,103
Ah! That there is House Tokito's oiran.

194
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,445
Her name is Koinatsu.

195
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:47,606
The highest-ranking courtesan
is going off to meet her suitor.

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,821
How's that for being flashy?

197
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,265
That her?!

198
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,321
Are you telling me that's your wife?!

199
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,456
How did you get with a knockout like her?!

200
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,920
And what?! You have three of them?!

201
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,087
Do they all look like that? Huh?! Do they?!

202
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,440
She's not my wife!

203
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,060
Why does she walk so slow?

204
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:06,334
She'd be killed instantly if we were in the mountains.

205
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:08,651
Hmm?

206
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:11,859
Excuse me, sir,

207
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,454
but I'll be taking this girl back to my house now

208
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:16,730
if that's all right.

209
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,386
I see. And you must be...

210
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:22,831
Forgive me. I am the chaperone of the Ogimoto House.

211
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,769
Well, if she managed to catch the eye
of the Ogimoto House, how could I refuse?

212
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,988
May I ask what it was about
her that caught your attention?

213
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:35,065
Yes. Her beauty is unlike any I have ever seen.

214
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:38,013
Take care of yourself out there, Inoko!

215
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:44,553
Oh.

216
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:49,161
Oh, no! I'm the only one left here!

217
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,174
Take a look at her now!

218
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,788
She's perfect!

219
00:12:55,934 --> 00:13:00,146
I wasn't sure with all that makeup
plastered over her face, but my goodness!

220
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:04,417
I can't believe I was able to buy this
unrefined beauty for such a low price!

221
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:05,363
Mm?

222
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,855
I'm going to train this woman like nobody's business!

223
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:14,630
When I'm through, she'll be in more demand than
Kyogoku House's Warabihime or Tokito House's Koinatsu!

224
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,710
This girl certainly has some
heft to her, though, doesn't she?

225
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,510
Well, it's better for a girl to be
plump and curvy than scurvy, right?

226
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,013
It certainly seems like she's more muscular than plump.

227
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:02,175
Wow, that girl sure can play the shamisen.

228
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,485
No kidding. So dynamic.

229
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,360
Do you know anything about her?

230
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,182
I know she has a good ear for music.

231
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:13,089
I was told she could play the
shamisen or koto after just one listen.

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,560
It's a pity about her looks, though.

233
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,190
I'm surprised she got taken in here.

234
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:24,979
She may be hideous, but I heard the man
who brought her here was drop-dead gorgeous.

235
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:26,360
Oh!

236
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:29,091
Was he, really? I wish I could have seen him.

237
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,672
The chaperone lady was totally smitten!

238
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,420
I've never been more certain.

239
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,279
That girl will rise to the top.

240
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:39,966
What?

241
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,485
Her shamisen is speaking for her.

242
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:45,367
She intends to get back at the man who abandoned her.

243
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,784
That girl has serious backbone.

244
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,445
I-I see.

245
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:56,221
If you take her, you can have her clean
the toilets or do whatever you want, really.

246
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,978
Hell, you don't even have to pay! Just take her!

247
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,888
I'm gonna make that jerk pay for this!

248
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:08,957
Just watch me become the Number one oiran in Yoshiwara!

249
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,773
Sumiko, do you have a minute?

250
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,830
Sure!

251
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,895
Sorry to bother you, but we're short-staffed.

252
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
Could you help carry these up the stairs?

253
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,180
It'd be my pleasure.

254
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:28,929
I'll take care of it, no problem.

255
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,140
Thank you, Sumiko.

256
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,209
Nice to have a hard worker around.

257
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,640
I apologize for removing your makeup yesterday.

258
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:39,857
I feel like it's partially our fault
the House Madam found that scar of yours.

259
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:41,585
Relax, my dear!

260
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,309
There's no use lashing out at this poor child!

261
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,522
I'm fine, just thankful that they're letting me work here.

262
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:52,910
My, my.

263
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,004
That new girl is rather burly.

264
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:55,909
Indeed.

265
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,192
Hmm.

266
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,049
They say the Kyogoku House's Madam
died from falling out of a window.

267
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,729
That's awful.

268
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,562
Let's be careful, okay?

269
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:13,574
And have you noticed some of the older
girls running away, committing ashinuke?

270
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,310
That's scary.

271
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,273
What even is ashinuke?

272
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,803
That's a lot of baggage to carry.

273
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,089
There we go.

274
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,190
I think they're all gifts for Oiran Koinatsu.

275
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,690
You said you've never heard of ashinuke?

276
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,249
It's probably a good thing you haven't.

277
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:32,821
"Ashinuke" means to run away
without paying off your debts.

278
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:35,056
And it's really bad if you get caught.

279
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:36,976
Why do they do that?

280
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,170
Some people try running away in order
to be with the man they're in love with.

281
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:43,780
Right, like Oiran Suma did the other day.

282
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:45,315
Suma?

283
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,537
That's Mr. Uzui's wife.

284
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,683
Listen...

285
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,682
You two shouldn't be spreading rumors.

286
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,990
After all, nobody knows her whereabouts now.

287
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:56,952
Who knows what happened to her?

288
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,798
Fine.

289
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,530
You brought these up by yourself?

290
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:01,696
Thank you.

291
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,379
Oh, it's my pleasure.

292
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:04,325
Come here.

293
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,514
Take this candy as my thanks.

294
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,189
Keep it secret, or you'll have to share it.

295
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,080
Hey, I want some candy.

296
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,901
Me too! Me too!

297
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:20,829
Now, now. I gave you some earlier.

298
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:22,547
Um...

299
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:26,067
did Oiran Suma really commit ashinuke?

300
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,970
May I ask why you're so curious about that?

301
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,470
She has her guard up,

302
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,757
but I've gotta find a way
around it and ask about Miss Suma.

303
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:38,764
It's just...

304
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,220
Candy, please.

305
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,264
Oiran Suma is...

306
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:44,375
She's actually...

307
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,879
Believe it or not...

308
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,882
she's my...

309
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,761
elder sister.

310
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:00,817
What?!

311
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,580
I think I understand now.

312
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,106
So you were sold shortly after your sister.

313
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,170
Yes, that's right.

314
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:14,315
The entire time she was here with
you, I was exchanging letters with her.

315
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,930
I promise you she isn't the type
of person who would commit ashinuke.

316
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,934
Oh, I had no idea.

317
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,650
I was surprised as well.

318
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,786
I could hardly believe that Suma would commit ashinuke.

319
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,343
She was such a well-behaved girl.

320
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,355
There were no signs that she was infatuated with any man.

321
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,892
But they ended up finding her diary.

322
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:41,811
I heard they read through the entire thing
and found she'd written about running off.

323
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,883
Ashinuke...

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,827
demons couldn't ask for a more perfect coverup.

325
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,455
Even if someone were to vanish,

326
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:52,112
people would only assume that she'd run away.

327
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:54,524
The diary could have been forged.

328
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,470
I pray that you're safe, Miss Suma,

329
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:00,643
but if you're not, we're going to rescue you.

330
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:13,272
Another day, and nothing.

331
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:18,129
Yet I can't shake this feeling
something is creeping in from the fog.

332
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:22,338
How can they avoid detection with such ease?

333
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:29,472
Could it be that the demon residing
here... is an Upper Rank demon?

334
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:35,648
If that's the case, we might be in
for an ultra-flashy fight to the death.

335
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:41,991
It's so hot, I feel like I'm
gonna die in this stupid thing!

336
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,508
And wearing this stupid outfit is dulling my senses!

337
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,324
Oh, Yae, can I ask you something real quick?

338
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,459
Do you think Makio's adjusting here all right?

339
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:55,780
Hmm?

340
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,095
Well, she's been locked up in
her room ever since she got here.

341
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:03,227
She mentioned not feeling very well,
but keeps refusing to go to a hospital.

342
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,850
If she doesn't do something,
the Madam's going to drag her out.

343
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,750
I brought a meal to her room,
but she didn't come out to get it,

344
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,790
so I ended up having to leave it outside her door.

345
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:14,252
Makio?

346
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,034
That's Uzui's wife.

347
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,336
'Bout time we found a new lead.

348
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,761
Not feeling well shouldn't be
enough to stop her from checking in.

349
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,733
Well, if she is sick, she'll be inside her room.

350
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,140
Guess I'll take a look.

351
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,652
Careful, Inoko!

352
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:33,236
You'll hurt yourself rushing around like that.

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,256
What a quiet little girl.

354
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:47,212
You've got the voice of a
dying animal, so don't say a word.

355
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,588
Oh, and if you try putting on a girl's
voice, it'll just make you creepier,

356
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:52,970
if that's even possible.

357
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:56,346
Then what am I supposed to do, damn it?

358
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,100
Now, then, answer me.

359
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,858
Now, then, answer me.

360
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,346
Now, then, answer me.

361
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:06,408
Now, then, answer me.

362
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,900
Now, then, answer me.

363
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,690
Who was it that you were writing
all of these little letters to?

364
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,284
What was your name?

365
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,057
Oh, I remember.

366
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,260
It's Makio, isn't it?

367
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:31,267
Answer me at once, Makio.

368
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,800
Nin-nin!

369
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:07,896
Eh?

370
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,213
I hate that you're prettier than me.

371
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,291
What was that?!

372
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,828
Now it's time for a Taisho-era secret.

373
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:19,125
Zenitsu seems to have taken an interest in the
shamisen, and he's actually become quite good at it. Huh?

374
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:22,915
I'm scared to be alone in the
house, so can I come over to yours?

375
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,058
But I heard all the girls are
taking an interest in you over there.

376
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,761
Wait, really? Then I'm going to
aspire to be the number-one oiran!

377
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,258
Huh?

378
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:33,885
Now what?!

379
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,243
Uh, next episode: "What Are You?"

380
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,093
Zenitsu, are you okay?

381
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:39,625
Zenitsu!
