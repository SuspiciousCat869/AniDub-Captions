1
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,166
Medic! Unit 322 performed
an emergency bailout!

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,916
The 2nd Lieutenant was
injured in the process!

3
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,416
What the. What the
hell just happened?

4
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,833
You're not
getting away with that!

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,791
Get away!

6
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,500
Well now we know
what a Void can do.

7
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,000
Ogumo. Go.

8
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,916
Roger that, Commander. Over.

9
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,166
Inori.

10
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,375
Inori! Wake up!

11
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,583
What was that?

12
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,583
Shu Ouma.

13
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:51,166
You've got fifteen seconds.
Grab Inori and get out of there.

14
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,958
Wait. What?

15
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,333
Tsugumi. Where's
the next target?

16
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,500
Direction, 10 o'clock,
distance of four hundred.

17
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,916
That far off?
There's nothing closer?

18
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,875
Why don't you just call it a
day? Don't overexert yourself,

19
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,916
Aya. Your poor craft
can barely take anymore.

20
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,291
It's not my job to give up.

21
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,208
Well look at this
stocky little bastard.

22
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,291
Talk about perfect timing.

23
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,083
He's fast!

24
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,625
Bailing you out!

25
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:53,375
Where are the accompanying
screams? Aw, man.

26
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,958
What a buzz kill.

27
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,916
Impossible! There's no way! How
could a foot soldier do this?!

28
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,416
I don't know. The battle
footage is too distorted

29
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,625
to say for certain,
but that's way it looks, sir.

30
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:18,041
A handheld anti-Endlave weapon?
Dammit! I can't report that!

31
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,708
Second Lieutenant Daryl Yan.

32
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:25,666
Kill it. Lieutenant Yan,
this is quite a nice surprise!

33
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,875
A visit from the Major
General's only son.

34
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,416
It's an honor to finally
have a chance to meet you.

35
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,041
And clearly you live up to
your reputation for bravery.

36
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,750
Did your father's orders
bring you to our post here?

37
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,416
No. It was my decision. I was
on my way to deliver a new

38
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,458
model Endlave to the operations
center. I got the report

39
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:48,375
a battle had broken out and
I don't know. Sounded fun!

40
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,875
Is that so? Well!
We couldn't be more grateful

41
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,708
to have your assistance.
Lieutenant.

42
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,250
Who do you think I am?
You expect me to touch

43
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,083
that greasy pig hoof?

44
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,916
Listen. I'll do as I please,
you got it? And if you get

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
in my way. I'll have to report
your fat ass to my father.

46
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:22,708
That little shit! Expand the
search perimeter! Apprehend

47
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,416
and question anyone you see!
Women, children, everyone!

48
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,875
God.

49
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,666
Reporting in as ordered, Gai.

50
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,458
Ayase. What's your status.

51
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,750
I lost my vessel.
And I apologize.

52
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,333
It was completely my fault.

53
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:56,583
I see. And I am disappointed.

54
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,708
Your mission. Was to stand your
ground for eighteen minutes

55
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,166
in a rundown older
model Endlave.

56
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,916
And you rose to that task.
But here you are claiming

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,250
that your mission was an utter
failure. It sounds to me

58
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,000
like you think that I've
failed you as your commander.

59
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,541
No, no! I failed you!
I'm the failure here! Not you!

60
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,916
I'm joking.

61
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm glad you made it
back alright. You did well.

62
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,333
I can hear your heart fluttering
clear across the room, Aya.

63
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,083
Shut up, Tsugumi!

64
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,958
So, uh. Should I?

65
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,666
You're finally awake.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,458
Inori.

67
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,416
Gai. Did I accomplish
the mission?

68
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,041
No. And I'm very
disappointed with you. Inori.

69
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,208
Hey!

70
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

71
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,875
I know it's none
of my business, but.

72
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,833
She tried as hard as she could
for you. And she even got hurt.

73
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,791
I realize that.

74
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,833
But results are everything.
And in the results department

75
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,750
she screwed up in a big way.

76
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,125
Screwed up? What do you mean?

77
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,791
She made the decision to share
the Void Genome with you.

78
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,916
You mean the cylinder?

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,833
That's right. It was supposed
to be for me to use.

80
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,500
The cylinder she gave you
was one of only three

81
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,083
enhanced genomes to be
successfully cultivated

82
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,291
by Sephira Genomics.
It allows the user to harness

83
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,750
what's known as
the king's power.

84
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,708
And what is that?

85
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,916
A way to analyze intron
sequences in the human genome.

86
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,416
And extract the
power within them

87
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,875
by converting it into Voids.

88
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,875
What's a Void?

89
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,291
An idea given corporeal form.
That's what the sword

90
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:03,333
you used was. That was Inori's
Void. Every person contains

91
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,333
their own unique version.

92
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,583
Void technology has
one foot firmly planted

93
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,041
in the realm of the Gods.
And you've just obtained

94
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,625
its crowning achievement.

95
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,833
Which means you're no
longer allowed to sit idly

96
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,208
on the sidelines and turn
a blind eye to the desperate

97
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,583
lives of those in need. From
now on you fight with us.

98
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,500
I what? Wait!

99
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,458
Remember this, Shu Ouma.
There are only two paths left

100
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,625
in this life to choose from.
You can be selected

101
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,500
out of this world. Or you
can adapt and make a change.

102
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,708
What is it?

103
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,500
Things have taken
a turn for the worse.

104
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,125
The damn whitecoats
have quarantined

105
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,833
the underground lot
in Area 14.

106
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,125
The underground lot?

107
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,541
Yeah. Word got out
that it was a safe spot.

108
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
There were nearly one hundred
people hiding in there

109
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,291
when they raided. And that new
model that took down Ayase?

110
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,625
Belongs to Kill-Em-All Daryl.

111
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,791
Things could get
tricky, then. Daryl.

112
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,208
So the Kaleidoscope's in play.

113
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,750
It's bad. The situation
is untenable. There's too much

114
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,458
of a disparity between
our forces. A rescue mission

115
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,125
is simply too dangerous.
I recommend we pull out.

116
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:33,500
No. We aren't backing down.
No way. This is an opportunity.

117
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:38,041
This is providence.
Attention all members.

118
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,875
As of now we move to
wipe out the Anti Bodies.

119
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,875
And rescue the
residents of the fort!

120
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,916
Furthermore. We're going
public. This will not be

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,041
a covert operation. As of this
moment the Funeral Parlor

122
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,458
is making itself known
the world over.

123
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,625
So go! And give it
everything you've got!

124
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,916
Right on!

125
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,166
About time!

126
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,583
So much for caution. I guess
I'll get a script prepared.

127
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,291
Although, are you sure
this isn't too soon?

128
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,250
Depends on his answer.

129
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,250
Tell me who your leader is!

130
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,666
Go on. Spill your guts
or I will. Tell me!

131
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,375
The Special Virus Disaster
Response Bureau,

132
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,791
commonly known as the Anti
Bodies. They've been granted

133
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,083
the unilateral authority to
diagnose people as symptomatic

134
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,333
and then exterminate them for
the safety of the population.

135
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,291
Please don't do this! My husband
hasn't done anything wrong!

136
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,291
I need to go, Mama.

137
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,125
Wait just a little longer,
Ryo. Please, I promise,

138
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,375
my husband isn't sick!
Let him go!

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,291
What a tragic spectacle.
My heart hangs heavy.

140
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,958
Officer! Please!
Spare my husband's life!

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,625
Get off of me,
you filthy hag!

142
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,625
Are you trying to infect me?!
You festering gutter rat!

143
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,666
The lynchpin of GHQ's
public security.

144
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,208
Their cruelest, sharpest fang.

145
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,083
And now you know.
That's the true face

146
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,583
of the enemy we're fighting.

147
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,750
No questions.
Just get it done.

148
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,458
Execute every one of them.

149
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,041
Mama! Mama! Mama!

150
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,458
Your offspring is annoying me.
Thinks you'll protect him

151
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,583
just 'cuz you
gave birth to him.

152
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,083
This can't be real.

153
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,958
Alpha team,
are you in position?!

154
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:17,666
Not yet.

155
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,458
Well hurry!

156
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,833
We're trying!

157
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:41,916
Gai!

158
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,583
Launch the operation!

159
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,166
Incoming missiles!

160
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,625
Well intercept them!

161
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,416
So they're making a move.

162
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,416
I want them dead or alive!

163
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,625
Time for some fun!

164
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,208
It's started.

165
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:23,416
Listen, Shu. Alpha Team
will strike first with

166
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,250
a long-range attack and
then we'll lure the Endlaves

167
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,875
as far from the enemy
camp as we can.

168
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,750
Once they've reached
the determined checkpoint.

169
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,791
Charlie Team
will make its move.

170
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,291
Checkpoints Red, Blue,
and Yellow, now secure.

171
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,000
Distance to final point Seven.

172
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,708
Alright, you better
take care of my babies, Aya!

173
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,125
You've got it.

174
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,958
You're about to get
stomped on, little buggy!

175
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
The target has reached D-line!

176
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,333
And now. You die.

177
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,458
Now!

178
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,750
Abort! Abort the attack!

179
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,958
What?!

180
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,500
Multiple missiles locked on
your bay and there's too many

181
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,416
for us to shield!

182
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,833
A friendly word
of advice to Major Guin.

183
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:44,041
Commander of GHQ's
Anti Bodies squadron three.

184
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,291
He's on an open channel!

185
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,333
We are The Funeral Parlor.
Release your hostages

186
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:54,416
and surrender. If you comply,
we'll allow you to live.

187
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,916
What do we do?
How do we respond?

188
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,416
We're holding the
trump card in this game.

189
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,625
Attention, terrorists!
We will never agree

190
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,291
to the demands of terrorism.
If you don't immediately

191
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,125
withdraw your forces.
We'll set off the gas

192
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,916
we planted underground.
Show yourselves

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and we'll refrain from doing so.
We want to meet your leader.

194
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,125
Bring us the head caretaker
of your little parlor.

195
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,458
I'm the one in charge.

196
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,625
That's kind of a sinister name
you've chosen for yourselves.

197
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,666
The world offers up
the choice to live or die.

198
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,541
Survival of the fittest.
That's the only governing law

199
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,833
this world recognizes.

200
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,875
As a result. We'll
always offer funeral songs

201
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,250
for those selected out.
Hence the moniker.

202
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,166
It signifies that we'll
always be the ones singing.

203
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,416
And that we'll always
be the ones to survive.

204
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,791
You don't quite understand
the position you're in.

205
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,375
We've got the power to decide
the selection process here.

206
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,333
Now you've taken
something of ours.

207
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,875
A dangerous genetic weapon.
We'd like it back.

208
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,208
Sorry. This is the first
I'm hearing about it.

209
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,875
You've got until
the count of ten. Give it up

210
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,833
or we'll wipe any trace
of you from existence.

211
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,375
Right on schedule.

212
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
It's crazy. Everything's
happening just like

213
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,833
he said that it would.

214
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,833
All of these people
will die if I mess up.

215
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:54,208
Believe, Shu.
You can do it. You can.

216
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,208
I know you can.
Because I belong to you now.

217
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,458
Ten! Nine! Eight!

218
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:16,083
Seven! Six!

219
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:22,541
Five! Four!

220
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,000
Three! Two!

221
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,416
Initiate... Kaleidoscope!

222
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,750
One!

223
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
Time's up!

224
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,791
What?!

225
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,416
You've done well.

226
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,208
You moved past your fear
to do the right thing

227
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,875
and help those in need.
No small feat

228
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,666
and you should be proud.

229
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,833
Join us, Shu. We can use
your ability. You know that

230
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,708
you could make a difference
if you come with us.

231
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,250
I wonder. How much my
life would've changed if

232
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,916
I'd chosen to take his hand.
But I know I made

233
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,958
the right decision.
I don't have it in me

234
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,250
to live some crazy
life of adventure.

235
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:04,208
As of today. I'm just
an average kid again.

236
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,166
Oh, and one last thing before
we get started. Our class has

237
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,541
a new transfer student
joining us. Come on in!

238
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,000
Whoa. Check it out!

239
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,875
Hey, she's hot!

240
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,250
Everyone. This is Inori.

241
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,666
No way. This can't be real.

242
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,000
Of course it is.
