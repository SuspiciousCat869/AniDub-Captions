1
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,083
The next time you're
with Gai Tsutsugami.

2
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,000
Press the blue button
two times and then

3
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,458
the red button once. It'll
alert us to their location

4
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,250
and we'll move in before
they can cause more harm.

5
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,250
How's Kido?

6
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,000
He's still unconscious. It's
probably the shock of having

7
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,375
his Void used, but we aren't
sure when he'll wake up.

8
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,791
I see.

9
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,458
All right then. Just in
case you've forgotten.

10
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,166
This is Shu Ouma.
He possesses the Void Genome.

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,375
And he'll be at the core of our
strategies from this moment on.

12
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,125
With Shu's allegiance
to our resistance.

13
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,083
And with our attainment of
Kenji Kido. The most pressing

14
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,041
of our immediate goals
is finally within reach.

15
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,791
We now have the means
to retrieve the Leucocyte.

16
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,458
The Leucocyte?

17
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,166
This is the proposed plan.
Considering all variables,

18
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,833
there are 145
possible outcomes.

19
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,500
So. Have them memorized
by the advent of the mission!

20
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,875
Time frame?

21
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,416
Three days. If that's not enough
time, then we don't need you.

22
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,125
It hasn't even been
a full day since our raid

23
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:30,583
on the GHQ compound. Fatigue
is a realistic concern here.

24
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,125
According to who? What drove
you people to sign up for this?

25
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,000
Was it the hope of getting
a good night's rest?

26
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,416
You'll have time to rest
when you're dead. The enemy

27
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,916
isn't going to wait for you
to catch up on your sleep.

28
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,708
Ayase.

29
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,916
Uh, yes?

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,125
I'm giving you the
responsibility of making sure

31
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
he has enough basic training
to pull his own weight

32
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,625
on this mission.

33
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,750
You want me to do what?

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,916
He's bound to drag us all
down if we don't whip him

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,916
into shape. So train him well
if you want us to live.

36
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,125
Uh, hey. You really don't
need to worry about me

37
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,791
that much, I'm fine.
Honestly, I'd feel bad

38
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,125
causing trouble for a girl
who's uh. You know, disabled.

39
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,458
Yes, well. That's very
thoughtful of you, Ouma.

40
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,833
You're so kind.

41
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,583
You can just call me Shu.
If you want?

42
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,458
My only disability is dealing
with people like you.

43
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,458
Keep your sympathy
to yourself. Got it?

44
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,125
Hey. Are you serious
about jumping?

45
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,625
Yeah, it'll be fine.
Just believe in me!

46
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,666
What was that?

47
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,958
My clothes.
The pen is gone too.

48
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,708
Starting now, your
whole life is training!

49
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,666
You've had enough time
to sleep, so look alive!

50
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
I told you, you don't
have to do this.

51
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,375
Do you think I like this
either? But it's not our job

52
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,708
to ask questions.

53
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,458
Why do you even want to join
Funeral Parlor anyway?

54
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,708
I can't think of someone
less cut out for it.

55
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,375
My pen!

56
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,541
What's that you're
blubbering about? Oh. This?

57
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,041
Uh, yeah, where did you get
it? It looks like a nice one.

58
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:04,583
I found it. Don't tell me
this is yours?

59
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,041
Um, I did lose one.
It's probably mine;

60
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,125
you think I could have it back?

61
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,041
No.

62
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,000
This is perfect incentive.
How about this?

63
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,250
We're testing you in one week
to see if the training sticks

64
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,083
and if you've got what it
takes to join Funeral Parlor.

65
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:26,208
I'll give this back then.
But only if you pass.

66
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,000
The name's Argo,
I'm a sophomore at Ryusen.

67
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,333
Now tell me your name.

68
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,083
My name's Shu Ouma.

69
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,458
Yeah, I know.

70
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,541
Come after me like
you're going to kill me, kid.

71
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
But this knife
is real, isn't it?

72
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,208
Yeah. What about it?

73
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,041
You're going to face death
everyday from here on.

74
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,291
It's best to get
used to it now!

75
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,333
Your heart rate's
soaring straight into

76
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,625
the next solar system.
Just how little do you

77
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,500
actually exercise, anyway?

78
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm more into artsy stuff.

79
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,750
It's kind of heavy.

80
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,416
So what do you think?
Huh? Is there any hope?

81
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,916
I don't think so.

82
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,666
As you can see, she's
pretty good at this stuff.

83
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,250
And that's the same level
of skill I want from you.

84
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,458
Huh?

85
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,666
What am I supposed
to do? Is this right?

86
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,250
Not quite. The slide will take
a chunk out of your hand

87
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,166
like that. Hold your
thumb like this.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,625
You shouldn't get
so close to me.

89
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Oh. Sorry.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,708
I'm still here!

91
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,416
The Leucocyte Plan seems
to be advancing rather nicely.

92
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,875
The "Invisible Cage".
You can't help but like such

93
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,750
a perverse concept.

94
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,833
Enough small talk. How's your
plan to divide them playing out?

95
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,958
I give it a fifty-fifty
chance he'll follow through.

96
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,750
Cool, thank you! So Kyo. I heard
you're going side by side

97
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,166
with Gai on this one.

98
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,041
Yep! He's finally going
to let me join him in battle!

99
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,708
I'm kind of bummed I won't
get to see the test fight.

100
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,125
But I wish you the best
of luck, Shu! You can do it!

101
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,541
Thanks, I hope so!

102
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,583
See you guys later!

103
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,416
She seems so young to be doing
this. Just flocked to Gai

104
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,625
like everyone else. I guess
that's what confidence

105
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,208
can do for you, huh?

106
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,083
I mean anyone else could
do the things he does.

107
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,416
And nobody would follow them
blindly like this. But I guess,

108
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,416
it's always the selfish
people who end up making it

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
in this world.

110
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,833
There's nothing
selfish about Gai.

111
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,416
You're blind to everything
around you right now. And

112
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,583
at this rate. I seriously doubt
you'll ever see the truth.

113
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,791
But regardless,
that was insulting to Gai

114
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,750
and the people who believe
in him. Apologize.

115
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,250
Fine, I'm sorry.

116
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,708
On a different note.

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,791
Can you draw out those
Void things from anyone?

118
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,416
Why am I working my ass
training for these guys?

119
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,958
It's like I'm really
planning on joining them.

120
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,958
--the wind screamed by

121
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:13,250
The two overlapped

122
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:22,458
I shall sing the
proof that you lived

123
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:34,708
For the sake of those
who have no names

124
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,041
You know, this kind of reminds
me of the first time we met.

125
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,000
It's making me nostalgic.

126
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,958
I've been wondering. Why'd you
join Funeral Parlor, anyway?

127
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,000
I've been wondering
the same thing about you.

128
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,333
You have? Well I guess,
really, there're a whole bunch

129
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:17,875
of reasons. But the
main one. I think it's,

130
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,041
because I was happy.
That day, at the compound.

131
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,583
I was happy
that you came for me!

132
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:40,916
Hey, Inori? I have
a question for you.

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,875
What if I asked you
to just leave all this

134
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,625
and live a normal life
with me? Would you?

135
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,583
Gai gave me
the thing I needed most.

136
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,083
I had nothing.
And he gave me a name.

137
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,083
A world to live in.
A place to call home.

138
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,375
So no, I won't go with you.

139
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,583
But. I thought. I mean before,
all that stuff you said.

140
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,625
"I belong to you".
"I want to stay with you."

141
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:23,916
I just, I thought,
that's what you wanted.

142
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,333
Don't tell me.

143
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
It was Gai.

144
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,250
He told me to
tell you that stuff.

145
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,666
No.

146
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,000
You shouldn't get close to me.

147
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,291
But. Inori, wait! Stop!

148
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,291
Of course.

149
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:10,416
What's happening? Did
I misread things that badly?

150
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,708
How humiliating.

151
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,583
Why does everyone
love Gai so much?

152
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,375
Maybe you should
run with your eyes open!

153
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,583
Oh! Sorry!

154
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,583
Quit leering at me!

155
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,791
I didn't mean to!
Really, I'm sorry.

156
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,333
Saw their room, did you?

157
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,875
It's obvious how much you like
Inori. You poor, poor fool.

158
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,916
Eyes on the wall!

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,041
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

160
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,875
They sometimes spend the
night together in that room.

161
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,375
Usually two or three times a
month. We pretend not to see it,

162
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,708
but I think we've all noticed by
now. Sorry to have to tell you.

163
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,416
So you're cool with it,
is that it?

164
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,083
Why wouldn't I be?

165
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,041
Well I can tell that you like
Gai. So doesn't seeing them--

166
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,416
Where'd you come up
with that stupid assumption?

167
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,958
Uh, the way you act.

168
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,458
You have no idea what's going
on! I have respect for Gai.

169
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,791
That's all!

170
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,958
I just don't understand it.
Why'd she choose him?

171
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,041
The only thing I can think
of is that you girls seem

172
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,708
to have some kind of weakness
for good looking jerks.

173
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,291
But is that really all it is?

174
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,708
Maybe I'm too naïve to get it.
Or just socially illiterate.

175
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,833
I never see the signs.

176
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,375
You can turn back around.

177
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,708
Really want to know
why? Then I suggest

178
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,958
you try your hardest
in the mock battle.

179
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,250
If you pass, then you'll
officially be one of us.

180
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,416
And you'll start to see things a
little more clearly after that.

181
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:21,166
Thanks, but no. It's a rule of
mine to do this part by myself.

182
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,791
I don't exactly look my most
elegant hoisting myself

183
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,750
into that ridiculous chair. So
I don't like people watching.

184
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,291
Would you mind leaving?

185
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,333
Good night, Ayase.

186
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,000
Good night, Shu.

187
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:48,000
You look so much like her.
More and more, every day.

188
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,416
Does it bother you?

189
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm not sure.

190
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Gai!

191
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,666
Looks like one squadron.

192
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,958
Just what we planned for.

193
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,666
The OAU and the
Leaving Nations.

194
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,125
They're a highly
principled group.

195
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,833
All right. Let's put your
training to the test. This mock

196
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,166
battle is called Scenario
D-14, and it's modeled after

197
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,375
the Leucocyte mission. It
assumes a possible situation

198
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,291
in which you have to face
an Endlave by yourself.

199
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,625
If want to win this
test, just make it past

200
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,458
Steiner and take shelter in the
train car. The paint bullets

201
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,750
are strong enough to
knock you unconscious.

202
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,041
So don't get hit. Got it?

203
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,083
Let's do this!

204
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,708
Good luck.

205
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,291
She's setting him up
to fail. I mean hell,

206
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,083
I can't even make it
past Ayase's Endlave.

207
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:15,833
And she's even faster now that
she's got Steiner. Okay, Aya.

208
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,291
You ready to connect?

209
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,708
Plug me in.

210
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,000
You ready to start?

211
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:32,500
Okay then. Ready! Go!

212
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,750
You really want
to show me your back?

213
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,916
Quit running away
like a little coward!

214
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,791
It's ridiculous to ask
me to fight this thing

215
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,208
with just a gun!

216
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,375
Look sharp! You're acting
like you want to get shot!

217
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,583
Now what? I'm out of options!

218
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,958
What the?

219
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,166
Argo!

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,583
Sorry about this!

221
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,416
Made it!

222
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,666
Huh?

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,125
He did it.

224
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,166
That's impossible.

225
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,875
So, I guess I cheated?

226
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,333
That's debatable.
You just utilized the thing

227
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,750
that makes you unique.

228
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,208
A light that creates darkness.
I didn't realize I was

229
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,666
that gloomy on the inside.

230
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,458
Well, Shu. Welcome
aboard. Starting today,

231
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,375
you're officially one of us.

232
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,791
Ow!

233
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,541
Here, your reward.

234
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
If it means so much
to you, you might want

235
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,625
to put it someplace
safer than your pocket.

236
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,375
Right.

237
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,958
Team building drills?
Looks like fun.

238
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,250
So you're finally
awake. Kenji.

239
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,708
Wait, Kenji?

240
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,166
Kenji Kido. He's the one you
rescued from the compound.

241
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,500
Don't tell me you already
forgot about that, Shu?

242
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,958
There's nothing wrong
with team building drills!

243
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,583
You don't seem too quick.
In many ways.

244
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,666
What's up with
Gai's recruiting?

245
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,458
Screw you!

246
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,875
We've got trouble, you guys!

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,041
What's the matter?

248
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,791
What happened, Tsugumi?

249
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,500
It's the Leucocyte! It was
just fired at Point Delta!

250
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,708
But that's where Gai is.

251
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,625
This is bad, very bad.

252
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,208
We fired at an output
rate of 3 percent.

253
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,708
Target destruction rate was 110
percent with an error field

254
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,500
of point seven meters.

255
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,166
Through me, the road
among the lost creation.

256
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,625
I am the way to
a forsaken people.

257
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.
