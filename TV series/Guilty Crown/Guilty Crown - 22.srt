1
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,875
I'm sorry, but you
just missed her.

2
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,333
No. Inori.

3
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,833
Where the hell is this light
coming from? What is it?

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,416
Something big's going down.
I think that much is obvious.

5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,291
Alright, we're gonna stay
down here and hold them off.

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,125
You get up to the top
and help out Shu!

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,833
Ayase! You're backup!

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,041
I'm on it! Although-

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,916
You've rubbed my face
in the dirt too many times,

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,958
but it's not gonna
happen again!

11
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,208
Not while I've got
Gespenst here!

12
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,583
Tsugumi. Can you take
back their system yet?

13
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,916
It's like their
defenses are on steroids!

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,833
The more code I knock down,
the more shows up!

15
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:06,875
Someone's rivaling
Tsugumi? Kenji.

16
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,875
Of course it would be you.

17
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,833
Top of the morning, Triton.

18
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,250
Welcome back, Mana.

19
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,250
Shu!

20
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:44,666
You're here!
You changed your mind!

21
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,916
I've had a rough time, y'know.
There was this awful girl

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,291
holding me back, and she
wouldn't let me out.

23
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,375
But it's okay now.
I ground her up into dust.

24
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,166
She thought she could stop me,
but I made her body mine.

25
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,125
She was a headstrong little
beast. Especially for

26
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,000
a man-made monster.

27
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,166
Shut up!

28
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,875
Shu?

29
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,541
Inori is not a monster!
She's got more love

30
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,375
in her than you ever could!
You've taken her face and voice,

31
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,041
but you're the monster!
She's the real human!

32
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,875
You're so mean, Shu.

33
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,666
You can't even see how much
your sister loves you.

34
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,458
I couldn't even stop loving you
after my body was torn apart.

35
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:38,666
And here you are, still refusing
to give me your love, Shu.

36
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,416
No need to get upset.

37
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,041
You too?

38
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,958
Leave him to me.
You focus on the world.

39
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,500
You've hurt me quite
badly, Shu. Twice now.

40
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,041
You're a cold and heartless
boy. And when you hurt people

41
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,375
like this, you should be
prepared for them to hurt you

42
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:27,083
just as much. You can apologize,
but nothing will ever make me

43
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,583
forgive you.

44
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,875
What?

45
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,875
So it's begun, Gai.
You've done it.

46
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,083
What the hell's
going on out there?!

47
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,791
We're registering genomic
resonance from Ward 24

48
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,583
that dwarfs the readings
from Lost Christmas!

49
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,291
The high output seems
to be interfering with

50
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,625
the Endlave's remote systems!

51
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,250
What is this?

52
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,583
This is it, Shu. The Fourth
Apocalypse has begun.

53
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,625
The selection and evolution of
all human life on this planet!

54
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,958
Yahiro!

55
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,958
Their frail physical bodies
will be shed in exchange for

56
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,291
an eternal collective mind
within the crystal. That is

57
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,458
the next stage of humanity. The
Voids were only the beginning,

58
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,875
the first of a new world where
all thought becomes matter!

59
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,083
You really think you
can stop me with your guns?

60
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,708
Watch out, little bug!
You're gonna get crushed!

61
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,666
That's as far as you get!

62
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,166
Don't underestimate
my guns! Ayase!

63
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,958
Get the hell outta there!

64
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,833
Tsugumi! We could use
some help here! Tsugumi?

65
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,875
Just die already!

66
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:15,208
Bastard! What?!

67
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,750
Lieutenant Daryl!
The Void Emulator is still

68
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,125
in its trial phase!
Don't overdo it!

69
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,375
You've gotta be joking. You
give me this power and tell me

70
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,416
to lay off when I haven't
even killed them yet!

71
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,958
Souta!

72
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,833
Gai! Tell me. You sacrificed
Mana's consciousness

73
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,833
to save her soul. Remember?
You gave your life that day

74
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:49,333
to make it happen! So how?!
How did we end up like this?!

75
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,250
You couldn't possibly
understand, Shu!

76
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,708
Everything's handed to you.
And all you've ever done

77
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:05,125
is turn your nose up at people.
You'll never understand!

78
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,541
How d'you like this, Kurosu? You
tried so desperately to save

79
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,583
your daughter and now she's
about to end the world.

80
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,166
I guess you lose.

81
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,458
That's why you wanna
see the world die?

82
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,333
That's what this is all about?

83
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,083
I don't see much point
in denying it.

84
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,333
Are you gonna
shoot me? Can you?

85
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,541
I can't let them get past me.
I have to protect him

86
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,208
until the end!

87
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:58,416
Persistent jerk! It's
too much! At this rate-

88
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,958
Tsugumi.

89
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,166
I need you to keep him occupied
until I give you the signal.

90
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,916
Can you hold out that long?

91
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,666
Just watch me, mister!

92
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,291
I would've let you have
her. Mana, that is.

93
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,833
I would've given up
the throne to the old you.

94
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,666
But now, the man you've
become doesn't deserve it.

95
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,750
Goodbye, Shu.

96
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:34,750
I feel so heavy.
Is this how I die?

97
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,250
And take all of
my friends with me?

98
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,375
Don't give up, Shu. Not now.

99
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:05,416
I know it hurts, but you can
still move. You can do it.

100
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,458
Everyone's counting on you.

101
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:25,583
Everyone. It's alright.
I want you to use me.

102
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,250
What the hell?!

103
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,291
Did the process get reversed?

104
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,375
Kenji. Consider this checkmate.

105
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,916
There are people
who believe in me.

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,833
People who have put
their lives in my hands.

107
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,625
And I refuse to let them
down. I'm taking Inori back

108
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,125
no matter what!

109
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,708
You're up and running!

110
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,125
Sorry I left you
hanging there, Aya!

111
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,708
I'm connected!

112
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,666
I'll keep you
linked in remotely.

113
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,333
Gai. If you're gonna try
to stop me, just know,

114
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,083
I'll do everything
I can to take you down!

115
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,583
That voice. I had a feeling
you'd make an appearance, runt!

116
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,208
Tsugumi!

117
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,333
I'm on it!

118
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,416
What?

119
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,916
Killing you is the only
unfinished business I have left

120
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,416
on this planet. Kill-em-All
Daryl's last trophy!

121
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,333
Shut your hole!
You sound pathetic!

122
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,916
Inori?

123
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,500
Nooooooooo!

124
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,000
Did we do it?

125
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,791
Brother!

126
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,666
It's true Kurosu might have
lost, but I never said

127
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,250
that I won. Now, run, Haruka.

128
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,791
Gai.

129
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,375
You've done well, Shu.

130
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,666
The man you've become.
Don't ever change.

131
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,083
Where am I?

132
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,708
This is the point
of convergence.

133
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,333
The world reborn and
shaped by the Apocalypse.

134
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,750
I don't understand.

135
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,958
What you see,
this is Daath's Shangri-La.

136
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,166
Everything on this planet,
it would've become the bones

137
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:09,041
beneath the new living flesh
of crystal. Even I would

138
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,041
eventually have been encased
within it. Even their king.

139
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,916
I've always been terrified
of falling prey to selection.

140
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So I resisted it, and clung
to Eve. Hid behind Mana.

141
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,791
The day I died. Beneath
Roppongi, when I begged you

142
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,666
to stab me, I believed
I could free Mana

143
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,416
from her curse that way.

144
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:45,166
And maybe I could have, if it
weren't for the will of Daath.

145
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,041
They won't allow Mana to die.
They'll keep bringing her back

146
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,250
until she's fulfilled her fate.

147
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,708
So I realized there's
only one way to free her.

148
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,708
To let them use her to
accomplish their goal.

149
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,083
I decided to take a gamble.
I became their demon king.

150
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,208
And worked to bring
about their apocalypse.

151
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,541
And I bet on you, Shu.
Bet on you stopping it.

152
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,125
I've finally managed
to give her peace.

153
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,833
No!

154
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,625
The rest is up to you.
Go save Inori.

155
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:49,875
Shu. Is that you?
Please don't blame yourself.

156
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:58,041
You've done so much. Taught me
how to feel so many emotions.

157
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,875
All of them. Each one
is thanks to you.

158
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:17,958
Shu. Are you there? Shu? There
you are. Stay with me forever,

159
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:24,625
Shu. Are you there? Shu? There
you are. Stay with me forever,

160
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:30,666
Shu. You know that I'll always
be on your side. Right?

161
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,916
Inori. It's time
for us to leave.

162
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,291
Hey! Was that-

163
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,375
Yeah. I felt it too.
It's our Voids.

164
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:22,083
No. What's he doing? You idiot,
don't you act like a martyr!

165
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,708
The entire crystalized framework
supporting the structure's

166
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,083
giving out! The whole facility's
gonna collapse any second!

167
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,291
Hey, guys.

168
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,458
Dr. Ouma! Are you okay?

169
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,708
What are you-?

170
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,000
If you get a second chance,
do it right this time!

171
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,250
Don't be Kill-em-All Daryl!
It's not who you are!

172
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,791
I can feel it happening. All
the emotions and the memories

173
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:13,791
flowing into me. From
my friends, my enemies,

174
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,750
they were all born
innocent, uncorrupted.

175
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,958
Inori.

176
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,291
Take it.

177
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,541
Inori!

178
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,708
Hang on! Shu's not out yet!

179
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,833
I know that! But that
doesn't mean I'm gonna

180
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,708
let you die in there with him!

181
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,875
Shuuuuu!

182
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,458
Hey! Yahiro!

183
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,083
Wow, you guys are early.

184
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,666
Work been keepin' ya busy?

185
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,250
Fairly. But I didn't have
any trouble ducking out

186
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:29,208
early today. Ayase.
Mind if I sit next to you?

187
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,583
Be my guest.

188
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,458
Hey, Aya, you're okay
with Earl Grey, right?

189
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,833
Thank you, Tsugumi, so polite.

190
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,916
Only for today. The mid-terms
for my students are coming up.

191
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's when the
real demon comes out.

192
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,291
He's not here yet?

193
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,458
Don't worry. I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

194
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,333
He told me he's been
looking forward to it.

195
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,583
Speak of the devil!

196
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,583
Yeah!

197
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,750
Oh, good! It took
you long enough.

198
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,875
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

199
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,333
Hold 'em up. Cheers, you guys!

200
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,875
To the new year!
