1
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:32,250
Jun! Are you okay?

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,166
What's wrong?

3
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,833
I appreciate your cooperation.

4
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,375
Try not to beat
yourself up over this.

5
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,958
No one will blame you
for wanting to live.

6
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,500
That's disappointing.
I hate it when they get away.

7
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,208
But at least we know that
we're on the right track.

8
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,375
Okay, we're ready
to roll! You're distraught

9
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,166
over the news of your
lover's death. Action!

10
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,041
One week? That seems
like kind of a long time

11
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,666
for the leader to be away.

12
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,333
Some matters require me
to show up in person.

13
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,833
Just enjoy being a normal
student for a few days.

14
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,541
Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure
I can manage that.

15
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,583
It can't be true.
I don't believe it.

16
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,333
Cut, cut!

17
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,875
Shu just doesn't seem
the same to me lately.

18
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,333
It's like he's gotten
bolder or something.

19
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,500
It's almost like
he's a different person.

20
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,291
Maybe something happened
back in Oshima?

21
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,791
Huh?

22
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,208
A vacation on a southern island,
talk about a perfect place

23
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,041
for romance! Maybe he
finally became a man.

24
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,000
Stop torturing me!

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,458
But seriously, life rarely goes
the way we want it to, does it?

26
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,708
You still haven't
heard from Yahiro?

27
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,916
I even checked at the orphanage,
but they haven't seen him.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,916
We used to spend hours
playing there together

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,708
when we were kids.

30
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,750
The object of my affection is at
the aquarium? What the heck,

31
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,041
I'm not trying to find a fish!

32
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,666
What does yours say?

33
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,250
Um. Let's see. A tiger
striped teakettle herald's

34
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,458
love's arrival.

35
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,125
What? Where are you
supposed to find that?

36
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,416
Is that?

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
A tiger striped teakettle.

38
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,583
No way.

39
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,041
Excuse me!

40
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,791
Shu!

41
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,541
Oh, hey. I thought you guys had
already gone home for the day.

42
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,041
Does this belong to you?

43
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,208
No, it's a prop for Souta's
film. It's the lover's gift

44
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:34,083
or something. He wants Inori
to hold it during this scene.

45
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,083
I think I left something
in the clubroom!

46
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,333
I might as well take this
down there for you.

47
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,666
You should go shopping with
Hare now that you're free!

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,791
Uh. Okay.

49
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,208
What? Hold on, Kanon!

50
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,166
It's the sign!
Go for it! I'm never going

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,875
to doubt my horoscope again!

52
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,625
What was that about?

53
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,958
I, uh, have no idea.

54
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:09,625
I hear we've got a ghost on
the prowl. Someone broke into

55
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,416
the Oshima lab using Dr. Kurosu
Ouma's ID to gain access.

56
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,416
I'm rather curious, Dr. Keido.
You were close colleagues

57
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,416
with Dr. Ouma. Maybe you
can explain how this

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,833
might have happened.

59
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,916
No, sir. I'm afraid I can't.

60
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,125
Hey.

61
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,083
How long's this going to
take? Your shopping I mean?

62
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,166
Do you have a lot
that you need to get?

63
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,208
Oh! Yeah, I guess so.

64
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,208
Hope I can carry all your bags.

65
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,541
Um!

66
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,208
Uh, Hare, are you all right?

67
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,458
Yeah, it's just that I--

68
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,833
Well, I think that I'm in--!

69
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,666
Damn it.

70
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,708
Yahiro.

71
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:46,833
Shu. Well, well, looks
like you've gotten close.

72
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,958
It's not what you think,
Yahiro. Shu's just--!

73
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,500
Is that it? That's really
all you have to say to me?

74
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,625
What do you
expect me to tell you?

75
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,416
You want to get into it
right here on the train?

76
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,208
Hare, I can't go
shopping with you, okay?

77
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,708
What? Why not?

78
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,416
I need to speak with
Yahiro in private.

79
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,791
Oh, Shu Ouma.
Keeping a close eye on you.

80
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,791
Was clearly the right call.

81
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,625
That night, they told
me they were going to

82
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,541
euthanize my brother.

83
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,250
When the chaos broke out,
we took advantage of

84
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,333
the confusion and ran. I wasn't
just going to sit around

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,250
and wait for them to kill
Jun. Go on and laugh.

86
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,583
I sold you out to get
Jun treatment there.

87
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,166
And in the end it was
the worst thing for him.

88
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,291
Jun!

89
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,416
You fell off the couch again!
You didn't hurt yourself,

90
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,625
did you? You're okay?

91
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:17,416
It's all right, buddy.
This is my. He's a friend.

92
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,208
We've tracked down
the fugitive Cancerous.

93
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,208
Excellent! Now that's
using your guts!

94
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,041
Do you really need my Endlave?
This is just a simple,

95
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,625
routine Cancerous hunt.

96
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,125
Of course we do, kid! We should
encounter each situation

97
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,000
with every resource we have!

98
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,541
Right, cause that's
not wasteful or anything.

99
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,625
You got all that? Scarface?

100
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,708
You got it, Dan! Just
leave everything here to me!

101
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,166
We've got guts galore
for this job!

102
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,916
Oh, don't look at me that way.

103
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,625
Do you think I could
borrow some money?

104
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,750
We need cash to keep
running and to eat.

105
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:17,083
Is that it? That's why you went
out of your way to show me Jun?

106
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:21,458
Please, Shu. Listen.
I have to protect him.

107
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,875
I'm the only one
who can do it. Please.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,125
Shu?

109
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,291
Is Gai there?

110
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,958
No, he already left.

111
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,750
I've got someone I need you to
harbor, an Apocalypse patient.

112
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,458
And his symptoms
are pretty advanced.

113
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,791
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
You've got to run this

114
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,125
by Shibungi first
before we can--

115
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,250
We're heading for
Point Yellow-One now.

116
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,666
Be there in one hour
to pick us up.

117
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,166
Really? You'll help?

118
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,291
Don't think this means
that I've forgiven you.

119
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:08,166
But, Jun hasn't done
anything wrong.

120
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,958
Look this over. It won't be long
before we have to use it.

121
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,375
It's wrong.

122
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,666
This song. It's all wrong now.

123
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:40,625
I know. I'm sorry, Jun. Just try
to bear with it for now, okay?

124
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,125
Looks like they've decided
to make their move.

125
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,958
Are you prepared
for the gene capture?

126
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,875
The system check is complete.
But what's the point

127
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,416
of using this?

128
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,458
Is there something so wrong with
wanting to get a better look

129
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,500
at your true love?

130
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,208
Let's get started.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's the Anti Bodies! How the
hell did they already find us?

132
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,625
Stay calm!

133
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,583
We knew that this could happen.
Just keep moving!

134
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
You hear that?

135
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,291
What if it's a Funeral Parlor
attack or something? Run for it!

136
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,791
Perfect we can use that!

137
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,875
No!

138
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,208
This has to be a trap!
It's a tactic to open up

139
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,958
an escape route and lure
us in. If you don't think

140
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,500
like they do then
you're going to die!

141
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,583
What the hell are you
doing? Get off of me!

142
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,583
You've got to let
me use your Void!

143
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,750
I have the ability to use
people's hearts as weapons.

144
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,833
I can take down
an Endlave with it.

145
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,875
Do you really expect me to
believe that? For all I know,

146
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,208
you're the one who led them
to us. You hypocrite!

147
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
Shut your mouth, you traitor!

148
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,208
Shu.

149
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,583
I'm not the one who betrays
people here. I don't abandon

150
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:19,000
them! I'll make sure Jun
escapes like I promised.

151
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,750
But I need you to
shut up and let me do this!

152
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,458
Jun!

153
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,708
You don't need to worry
about your brother.

154
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,333
I promise he's safe.

155
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,125
Not that.

156
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,458
What do you mean?
What is it then?

157
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,958
You again, huh?
Faceless bastard!

158
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,791
Stay there, Jun!
I'll be right back to help you!

159
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,750
Run all you want! But I've got
a fun new toy for today!

160
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,708
It'll track the signature
of that thing no matter

161
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,083
where you go.

162
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,958
Not bad. I'll give you
something more challenging.

163
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,166
Jun!

164
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,250
No!

165
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,375
Hey, Segai.
What the hell is this?

166
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,625
It's not what I expected,
but I admit it's definitely

167
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,791
intriguing. That weapon of
his and the Apocalypse Virus.

168
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,083
They give off the
same E.M. reading.

169
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,583
What's happening?

170
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,000
It transferred!
How is that possible?

171
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
What the hell is going on?

172
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:56,875
Jun, no! Are you okay?
Answer me!

173
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,416
Oh, god! Yahiro,
what have I done?

174
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,583
Judging by the
machine's appearance.

175
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,916
It absorbed the genomic
resonance of the virus.

176
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,875
So the one now controlling
the machine is...

177
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,583
Reboot the PINs!
Input every last one!

178
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,875
Hey, what's wrong with it?
What happened?

179
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,416
Bastard!

180
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,666
Major Segai! You're in danger!
Please evacuate!

181
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,916
Yes, I suppose we'll have to
withdraw. Abort the operation.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,083
Yes, sir!

183
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,666
No! Yahiro!

184
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,541
You leave him alone now!

185
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:41,416
This is, Roppongi?
But before Lost Christmas.

186
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,250
That's right.

187
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,375
Do I? Wait, are you Jun?

188
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,875
I'm glad we have
this chance to talk.

189
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,041
Wow, thank you!

190
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,208
For your birthday.
It's the one you wanted, right?

191
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:04,750
The date is December 24th, 2029.
This was the happiest moment

192
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:10,416
of my life. In a few
seconds, Lost Christmas

193
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,166
is going to happen.

194
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,750
I want this to be the last
memory I take with me.

195
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,583
Before I give up this life.
Will you help me do that?

196
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,875
Use my brother's Void to cut
my lifeline and set me free.

197
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,500
Yahiro's Void severs
the connection between

198
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:38,708
life and death. If you use it,
I can finally get some rest.

199
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,750
That can't be right. It's crazy.

200
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,541
The crystals that
imprisoned my body.

201
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,541
They gave me the ability
to see people's Voids.

202
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,333
As a result, I saw my
brother's other side,

203
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,291
the one he tried to
keep hidden from me.

204
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,541
We should order
some pizza for dinner.

205
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah?

206
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,416
Sure, you should have your
favorite food today, right?

207
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,750
And I'll order it
just the way you like it.

208
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,500
You're in the way.
You're ruining my life.

209
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,875
I've seen the horrible
thoughts behind

210
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,958
all the kind eyes,
over and over again.

211
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:31,833
My friends, my family, the
caretakers at the hospital.

212
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,833
And you, Shu. You're
probably no different.

213
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,166
I can't bear to live any longer.
Not with this hanging over me.

214
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,708
I'll end up hating
my big brother if I do.

215
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,583
I want to die holding
onto my love for him,

216
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,750
as my true self.
Please hurry and do it!

217
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,500
Lost Christmas.

218
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,875
Why is this happening?
I'm so scared!

219
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
It's okay I won't
let anything happen.

220
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,625
Okay.

221
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,583
Don't worry, Jun.
I'll take care of you forever!

222
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,208
You have to do it!
Please, I don't think

223
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,958
I can stop myself
from killing him!

224
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,166
Brother, was I a burden
on your life? Did you throw

225
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,541
your future away taking care
of me? Did you hate me for it?

226
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,666
Well, let me show you
how I feel about you!

227
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,583
Thank you.

228
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,666
Goodbye, brother. I love you.

229
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:28,125
Life really never does go
the way we want it to, does it?

230
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:51,750
Where are we?
Wait Jun, where's Jun?

231
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,125
He's dead.

232
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,416
What did you say?
You're lying.

233
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,916
Jun's dead.

234
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,625
Where is he?

235
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,416
I did it. I took his life.

236
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,416
Oh, Shu.
