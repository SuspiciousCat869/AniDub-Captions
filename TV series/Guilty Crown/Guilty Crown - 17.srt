1
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,083
Oh man-- the Diet
Building's toast!

2
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,708
It gets closer every day!

3
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,000
What are we gonna do?
It'll be here in a week,

4
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,583
at this rate!

5
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,416
You're supposed
to be on watch.

6
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,791
President Ouma!

7
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,000
What if somebody had
attacked the school just now,

8
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,500
while you three stare at a wall?
Your classmates would die,

9
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,000
and it would be on your heads.

10
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,458
What a dick.

11
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,416
I've seen enough.
Take them both into custody.

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,458
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,333
What?!

14
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,625
What the hell!

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,833
Where do you get off?! I'm
so sick of you acting all--!

16
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,541
You're nothing but a tool that
I use toward the greater good!

17
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,583
If you don't do your job,
you're useless!

18
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,291
Going to bed soon?

19
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,708
I'll sleep later.

20
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,958
There's only a week left
before we attempt the Exodus.

21
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,458
And besides, Gai wouldn't
relax at a time like this.

22
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,375
Neither should I.

23
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,250
Ah, that Funeral Parlor guy.
Tell me something.

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,958
Did he strong-arm
his people into obedience?

25
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,791
Why do you ask that?

26
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,583
You gotta stop acting
so heavy-handed, Shu.

27
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,333
You're taking things
way too far.

28
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:18,500
So, they resent me?
That's the price of safety.

29
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,708
At least they're alive.
If I had done this earlier,

30
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,958
Hare still would be.

31
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,541
I know they hate
the ranking system.

32
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,041
I'm sure Arisa was attacked
because she's a Rank S.

33
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,375
But there's no
going back, Yahiro.

34
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,250
You told me that yourself.

35
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,291
Look, I still believe that.
But we can't just expect them

36
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,916
to roll over.

37
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,375
Help. Help me!

38
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,208
Inori?

39
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,000
Is something wrong?

40
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
I'm all right.

41
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,208
Somebody. Help me.

42
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,875
Hello? Hello?

43
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,333
Yes. Shu has pushed the student
body to the breaking point.

44
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,125
Right. They're too scared
to fight back right now,

45
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,708
but that could change.

46
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,625
I know that you're
a Rank S and all,

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,458
but traitor-talk is against the
rules, so hand over the phone.

48
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,541
Who'd you have
your little chat with?

49
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,875
It's fine if you don't wanna
tell me. All I have to do is

50
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,333
look at your call history,
and I'll have my answer.

51
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that all you want?

52
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:41,458
Maybe Shu shouldn't
get to have all of the fun.

53
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,416
Reach inside, and draw it out.

54
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,541
You sure 'bout this?
There're no take-backs.

55
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,041
Oh yeah. Trust me,
she made it worth my while.

56
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,541
Well, if we're really
gonna do this thing,

57
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,916
no point waiting
around. Here goes.

58
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,416
Hey. D'you read the message
that just went out?!

59
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,541
"Shu Ouma's hiding it,
but if your Void breaks,

60
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,500
you'll die with it?!"

61
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,125
He knew all along
it was dangerous,

62
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,375
and he used our Voids
anyway?! Screw that guy!

63
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,041
That bastard!
He's gonna pay for this!

64
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,083
This is the last straw!

65
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,250
Go to hell, Shu Ouma!

66
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,625
These reports from Keido's
administration are useless--

67
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,916
we've found no less than 98
instances of doctored facts

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,458
or outright lying.

69
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,708
I knew this was a mistake.
The man's nothing but

70
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,458
a rank opportunist.

71
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,833
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
been reaching out to Japan

72
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,708
for well on a decade now.
When do we cut our losses?

73
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,541
Wait. So, we write them off?

74
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,041
The U.N. is aware of your
concerns. We'll give you

75
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,583
the chance to cash out
your yen at a fixed rate.

76
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,625
Ahhh. Well, in that case.

77
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,166
Now that we've put any
qualms to bed, please,

78
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,833
elaborate on your plan,
if you would.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Spreading rumors,
Arisa? I thought you

80
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,416
were bigger than that.

81
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,791
What do you mean?

82
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,083
Come on. Don't play dumb
with me. The rumor that

83
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,125
you die if your Void breaks.

84
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,250
And what if it's the truth?
What then, dear Yahiro?

85
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,583
Of course it's not true.
If people thought that,

86
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,583
everything we've built
here would crumble.

87
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,041
You won't be letting me off with
a simple maiming this time,

88
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,375
will you?

89
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,250
"This time?"

90
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,458
Anybody who speaks out
against the great and mighty

91
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:51,166
Shu is punished. Don't
tell me you didn't know.

92
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,041
Listen to me.
We did not sanction that.

93
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,000
Really. Well then,
would you care to know

94
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,541
who did this to me?

95
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:09,333
I wonder, if someday, I'll
pay the price for all this.

96
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,416
All what?

97
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,041
In order to save the
students, I hurt them.

98
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,916
I've hurt people,
too. But worse.

99
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,166
Why would you say that?

100
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,875
I'm the one who hurt
Arisa. Or think I am.

101
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,458
You mean you don't know?

102
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,791
She spoke, but, I couldn't
even hear the words.

103
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,666
Just that you were in trouble.
I started to shudder,

104
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,708
and when I woke up, blood.

105
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:53,416
I'm so afraid of myself. I'm
a monster. You were right-

106
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,916
Don't say that.

107
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,666
You'll be fine.
I'm king, remember?

108
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,291
No one here can touch you.

109
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,500
If anyone tries anything,

110
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,791
they'll have to go
through me first.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,208
Shu, I found out who
was responsible for

112
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,833
the attack on Arisa.

113
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,333
Really. Do tell.

114
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:30,375
It was Inori. Arisa told me,
and I believe her.

115
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:37,916
She'll heal. Let it go.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's not an
option, Shu. Look.

117
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,333
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but we are hanging on here

118
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,125
by a thread.

119
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,666
If you start flouting your own
laws and playing favorites

120
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,291
with your girlf--

121
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,666
Hypocrite!

122
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
Oh, you're one to talk!

123
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,833
You knew broken Voids mean
death and you said nothing!

124
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,833
So don't you lecture me
about truth!

125
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,125
Shu, stop it!

126
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,166
Dammit, Shu! Listen!
Using Voids kept us alive!

127
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,458
Shut up!

128
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,625
Not another word! You knew
about this since Hare died,

129
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,791
but you kept it from
me on purpose!

130
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:15,791
For your own good! After Jun,
I figured something out.

131
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
People make mistakes.
And setting things right

132
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,500
takes power. That's the
whole reason I agreed

133
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,416
to work with you
in the first place!

134
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,875
How stupid do you think
I am? You've been wanting

135
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,208
to stab me in the back
since day one! Sugar!

136
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,291
You're wrong, but I can see
why you'd think that.

137
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,708
Guess that's what I get
for not telling you the truth.

138
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,000
Get out of my sight, Yahiro.
The days of you pretending

139
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:51,833
to be my friend are
over. Drop the act.

140
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,666
Fine. As you command.

141
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,041
Yahiro got exiled
to the Rank F tents.

142
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:06,208
I suppose he's reaping what
he sowed. Oh yeah, here.

143
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,291
For services rendered.

144
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:12,416
The Exodus schedule,
and all student Void info.

145
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,208
Not that I care, but what
do you want it for?

146
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,916
A magic trick.

147
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:26,166
I'm going to take our tyrant,
and make him disappear.

148
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,125
Any of you groups
that are ready to move,

149
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,791
go ahead and take the lead.
Tokyo Tower is about

150
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,083
four kilometers
away from campus.

151
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,291
We'll stop after each
kilometer for a quick break

152
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,583
and a head-count.

153
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Anything else, ask your squad
leader. They'll tell ya.

154
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,375
Something doesn't feel right.

155
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,458
Kuhouin will give the signal.

156
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,708
We'll be ready.

157
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,583
Team B is on board, right?

158
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,416
We only get one shot at this.

159
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,458
Did somebody get
the security team?

160
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,750
What is it?

161
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,375
This isn't what I wanted.
I didn't mean for any of this

162
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,666
to happen.

163
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,166
Nanba.

164
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,333
Sir?

165
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,541
What do they think of me?
The people that I rule.

166
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
You're saving them
from certain death.

167
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,625
They won't forget
what you've done.

168
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,083
I see.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
Mr. President, the
students are on the move.

170
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,958
So the data we were
given was accurate.

171
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,208
They're headed for
Tokyo Tower, then?

172
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
Yes. At their current heading,

173
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,416
we'll engage them
on Sakurada Street.

174
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
So be it.

175
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,250
Soon now, we shall witness
the advent of the true king.

176
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,041
I've measured the highest
genomic resonance out of

177
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,250
Tennozu High School.
The index variation

178
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,541
is two-hundred eighty-one.

179
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,708
Very good. You've corralled
them all so well for me.

180
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,166
Let's review the
plan one last time.

181
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,416
The transmitter controlling
those Ghost Endlaves

182
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,000
is here in Tokyo Tower.
Therefore, I'll use

183
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,708
a combination of Voids to
send a high-voltage current

184
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,458
up its struts. If I can short
out whatever device they have

185
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,750
up there, those Endlaves
will be out of commission.

186
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,333
But none of that's going
to happen if I can't

187
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,666
get close enough. Man
your posts and fight off

188
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,291
whatever defense drones they
throw at us. Understood?

189
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,208
Just remember, if we win
this is the last night

190
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,208
we spend behind that wall.

191
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,125
Good luck.

192
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,625
They're here!

193
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,125
Hold the line! Your Voids
will carry you through this!

194
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,083
Give the order, Shu! Send
us onto the battlefield!

195
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,333
To win back
our freedom at last!

196
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,250
Go! Give them hell!

197
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,083
Twenty Auto-Insects on radar!
That's what we planned for!

198
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,250
Go to hell!

199
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,916
The path is clear!
I repeat, the path is clear!

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,250
Am I using them as
soldiers? Or fodder?

201
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,583
Shu.

202
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,750
Inori. Don't be scared.
We'll be fine.

203
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,708
I can judge myself later.

204
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,958
Kazumi, nooo!

205
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,666
That's the wrong way!

206
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,791
Let's go!

207
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:22,291
Enough! No more decoys!
No more hiding!

208
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,166
I'm not losing anyone else!

209
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,541
Time to go. Come on!

210
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,791
Let's put that red line
behind us as fast as we can.

211
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,250
Hurry, everyone!

212
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,541
Well, we made it,
it's all over.

213
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,458
So, then. Shall we?

214
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,041
Uh, is there a problem?

215
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,625
What in the hell
are you doing?!

216
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,291
Stop!

217
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,125
Sorry, girl.
Shu's had it coming.

218
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,666
You can't go out there, Aya!

219
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,125
What's going on?!

220
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,750
Excellent work, Shu. Truly.

221
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,958
But morning has dawned, and
your reign has come to an end.

222
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,708
I guess we'll soldier on
without you, somehow.

223
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,791
So how does it feel?

224
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,250
Arisa! You put
them up to this?!

225
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,125
The answer to that should
be fairly obvious by now.

226
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,041
I didn't do anything wrong.
He deserved it!

227
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,416
Souta?

228
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,083
We're not your damn toolbox!

229
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,541
How dare you use us like that?!

230
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,375
You're a coward!

231
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,291
Parasite!

232
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,291
Just die already, you bastard!

233
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,375
Shuuu!

234
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,458
Hey!

235
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,791
Inori!

236
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,166
Inori!

237
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,291
Gai?!

238
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,208
I knew you'd come back for us.

239
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,833
Long time no see. Shu.

240
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,083
Please no!

241
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:46,291
My arm! My king's power
you took it awaaaaay!

242
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,750
Council members.
Submit your votes for U.N.

243
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,041
resolution 17, the
termination of Japan

244
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,083
in the name of global security.

245
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,041
The ayes have it.
The resolution passes.

246
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,791
Instruct the stealth
bomber to launch

247
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,083
the reactive material warheads.

248
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,750
Your king's power?
You were just a pretender

249
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,833
to the throne.
Or had you forgotten?

250
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,416
I am the king.
And I have returned.
