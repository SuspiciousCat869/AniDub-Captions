1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,125
Gai. Is it?

2
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,916
It's them!
They're doing this!

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,791
Dan!

4
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,958
What the hell?
What's happening?

5
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,916
Stop! You have demands?
I'm listening, terrorist!

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,291
You've got my attention.
I'm GHQ's Commander,

7
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,875
Major General--

8
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:19,375
Unit number. Eight Twenty-three.
Don't you recognize my birthday?

9
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,833
Don't you get it? Of course
not. You never got anything.

10
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,458
The two of you make me sick!
You're disgusting!

11
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,458
Attention please. This is the
chief of GHQ's Anti Bodies,

12
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,250
Shuichiro Keido.
I'm saddened to announce that

13
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,958
Major General Yan was killed
in a surprise terrorist attack.

14
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,875
It's okay, Lieutenant.
You've done well.

15
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,250
As the highest-ranking
surviving official,

16
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,000
I will be effectively assuming
command of all military action.

17
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,500
A group of terrorists
have launched

18
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:42,000
a large-scale viral attack
against the entire Kanto region.

19
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,833
We have declared this attack
a level one state of emergency.

20
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,333
So, as a necessary consequence,
the Anti Bodies have

21
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,916
taken over command. I repeat!

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,166
This is a level one
state of emergency!

23
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,916
Don't you worry your pretty
little head, Dr. Ouma.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,166
We have use for you.

25
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,333
Leave her alone!

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,750
Haruka, stop!

27
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,416
Aiming your gun at an
innocent woman! Scarface,

28
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
I expected more from you!

29
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,125
That's where you're wrong,
Dan. It's pretty damn obvious

30
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,000
you didn't expect anywhere
near enough from me.

31
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,541
It's time to make
our move, Major Segai.

32
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,083
Right behind you, sir.

33
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,250
At approximately 3:40 pm
today, the terrorist group

34
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,458
known as Funeral Parlor
launched a widespread

35
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,166
biological attack
from Haneda Airport,

36
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,125
using the Apocalypse Virus--

37
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,916
That's a lie! They'd
never attack the public!

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,750
Now you want to defend us?

39
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,291
Tsugumi?

40
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,208
What the hell are you doing,
Shu? They've practically

41
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,541
wiped us out. I can't get
in touch with Gai or Inori.

42
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,000
For all I know
they could be dead.

43
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,333
Don't say that.

44
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,875
It's your fault, Shu!
We needed you to be there!

45
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,916
And you abandoned us!

46
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,333
A severe contagion
alert has been issued.

47
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,708
All students are required
to immediately evac--

48
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,958
Have any of you guys
seen Hare or Shu?

49
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,291
I'm pretty sure
Shu went home early.

50
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,500
He seemed like
he might've been feeling--

51
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:41,125
Um, hello? If you can
hear this broadcast,

52
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:47,333
will the following people, um,
report to the Film Club room.

53
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:52,166
I know it's a bad time,
but I really need your help.

54
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,375
If they let me, I can use their
Voids to save Gai and Inori.

55
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,166
I don't know if I can pull
it off but I've gotta try.

56
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,541
We've pinpointed their
leader. He's only got one

57
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:06,625
accomplice with him. The group's
remaining arsenal consists of,

58
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,625
one large-sized trailer,
one Endlave, and

59
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,416
a fighting force of about eight
people west of the terminal.

60
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,541
We've severed
their chain of command.

61
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,875
They're as good as helpless.
Where's the Chief?

62
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,083
His helicopter
just landed in Roppongi.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,125
Everything's going as planned.
Funeral Parlor's forces are

64
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,000
concentrated at Haneda.

65
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:36,791
Then the time has come to cross
the river of lamentation. Mana.

66
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,750
All right, Shu.
What do you need our help for?

67
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,916
You do know there's a contagion
alert going on, don't you?

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,875
Yeah. But see the thing is,
well I, need to get to Haneda.

69
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,208
The airport?

70
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,916
But that's where
the source of the outbreak is!

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,208
I know that. But my
friends need my help.

72
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:08,625
And, I can't do it alone. So I
need you to help me help them!

73
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,583
You don't want our help!
You want to use us

74
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,083
like we're your tools!

75
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,750
I didn't know you were here.

76
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,208
What do you mean, tools?

77
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,041
Good question. Let's see
if Shu will explain it for us.

78
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Well? Go on!

79
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:36,625
Mana, please don't
do this, again.

80
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,250
Gai, I can stop this.
I know I can.

81
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,500
It's too far advanced to stop.
It's already reached my blood.

82
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,875
The song. It'll help!

83
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,333
Inori!

84
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,833
I've got a lot of questions for
you. But first, tell me this,

85
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,791
is Shu all right?
Isn't he with you?

86
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:10,166
We didn't bring him with us.
Right now, he should be

87
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,208
in school.
So don't worry.

88
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,291
But, he'll come.

89
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,916
He will. I know it.

90
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,666
I think we all want to know
what he means by 'tools'.

91
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,958
And I'd like to know who these
friends are that need your help

92
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,375
in the middle of a lockdown.

93
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,708
It's not Inori,
right? Is it Inori?

94
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,375
Whoa, guys. Let's not
gang up on him.

95
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,541
He'll answer everybody's
questions. Promise.

96
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,541
How would Gai handle
this situation? Would he

97
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,708
give them the chance to refuse?

98
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,333
If it's important there's
no time to waste. Talk to us!

99
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,791
Yeah, you can tell us, Shu.
We're all your friends,

100
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,125
aren't we?

101
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,375
You got us here. Now speak
up! I think you at least

102
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,750
owe us an explanation.

103
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,833
Would he get a group consensus?
Would he somehow trick them

104
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,916
into doing what he wanted?
Or would he just demand

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,208
that they help him
no matter what they think.

106
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,791
Why am I trying to think like
Gai? I'm never going to be him,

107
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,583
so what's the point? I can
only do things the way that

108
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,708
I know how to do them.

109
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,958
Hare.

110
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,375
Yeah?

111
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,750
I need you to help me.
It might seem scary at first.

112
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,750
But I promise you'll be
fine. It's completely safe.

113
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,875
Sure. Go ahead.

114
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,250
Whoa, hey!

115
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,625
What is that?

116
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,458
Bandages, that makes sense.

117
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,250
Hare. What'd you do to her?

118
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,666
She's okay. She'll wake up
as soon as I put this back.

119
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,416
What the hell is this, Shu?

120
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,458
Yeah, it's definitely time
for that explanation.

121
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,041
This is a Void.
It's a manifestation

122
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,416
of a person's heart.
So it's shape and effects,

123
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,416
are different depending
on the person.

124
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,875
No way!

125
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,041
Hey, Shu, what happened?

126
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,791
It's okay. Really I just
used your Void.

127
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,166
You did? So what was it like?

128
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,458
It was kind, just like
the person it reflects.

129
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,666
I know that none
of you remember.

130
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,041
That's how it works. But
I've drawn yours out, too.

131
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,750
Souta, Arisa, all of you.

132
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,500
Wait, you did?

133
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,458
It was like I looked into
your hearts without asking.

134
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,833
I've felt bad
ever since. I'm sorry.

135
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,666
You going to
tell them the rest?

136
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,458
You know, the part about
you using that power

137
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,500
of yours to help out a
terrorist group? That part?

138
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,083
You're wrong.

139
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,875
Am I? Then why don't you tell
them who you're planning

140
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,250
to go save?

141
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,625
Fine! Gai and Inori.
From Funeral Parlor!

142
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,750
Inori's a terrorist?

143
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,750
Then you admit it, huh? So
why would you want to save

144
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:48,000
people like that? When you
wouldn't even save my brother?

145
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,750
They're terrorists! Answer me!

146
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,583
They aren't what
you think they are.

147
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,000
Those are the good guys!

148
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,458
And they actually believed
in me too! Without them,

149
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,916
I wouldn't even have a purpose!
And now they need my help,

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,708
after all they've done for me.
So please! Help me save them!

151
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,708
Right! Let's go! There's no
guarantee we're going to be

152
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:24,541
safe here, anyway. We might
as well give it a shot.

153
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,250
You make a good point, Souta.

154
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,958
Count me in. I'm sick of saying
it's none of my business.

155
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,708
Damn straight! Now that's
the right attitude.

156
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,625
And you, Yahiro?

157
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,541
I get it; I wouldn't
have had a purpose either.

158
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:46,250
If Jun hadn't needed me
like he did. You and me,

159
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,000
we're the same.

160
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,833
So this is the
passage to Cocytus,

161
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,833
the so-called Gate of Hell?

162
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,250
Not quite. I personally
prefer to think of it

163
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,833
as the Gate of Heaven.

164
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,583
I can't hold out much longer!

165
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,125
Well, this isn't how I thought
the test run would go,

166
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,458
but I think it might work.

167
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,000
Will Shu really come?
Do I want him to?

168
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,791
I didn't know there
was a path down here.

169
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:47,208
I've never seen the army use it.
Should get us there safely.

170
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,458
Shu? You're feeling
better now, aren't you?

171
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,875
Yeah, I am. And it's
all thanks to you.

172
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,375
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

173
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,458
Shu!

174
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:29,750
Keep going. Almost there.
It's open! Inori!

175
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,791
Shu.

176
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,708
I'll never be
loved by you again

177
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:56,166
Or needed by you again, either

178
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:05,125
And so here I am, all alone

179
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:13,333
You always do that,
make me angry

180
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:19,083
And then make me
cry in the end

181
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,083
Inori.

182
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,333
Genomic resonance
is passing three thousand.

183
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,333
What the hell is this?

184
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,708
Wait, is that?

185
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,166
Inori.

186
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,583
Inori's singing!

187
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,375
We've got our first roadblock!

188
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,458
Halt! Stop your vehicle
or we'll open fire!

189
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
Now Arisa!

190
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,541
Okay, I'm ready!

191
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,791
Fire!

192
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,625
Yes, hold me tight--

193
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,083
Barricade three has
been infiltrated, sir!

194
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,958
Do we know if it's an Endlave?

195
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,291
Actually.

196
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:24,916
We'll sleep with our
foreheads pressed together

197
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,208
The bridge!

198
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,291
This wouldn't stop Gai. Hare!

199
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,708
Oh, wow.

200
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,333
They're behind us!

201
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,000
Souta! It's your turn!

202
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,625
Huh? Really?

203
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,916
They've wiped out the
fourth Endlave platoon!

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,416
Gate two has been breached!

205
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,666
You can't even stop one measly
jeep? How worthless can you be?

206
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,166
Transfer me as close
to them as you can.

207
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,708
I'll take care
of this as usual.

208
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,291
There she is! Tsugumi,
the radar building!

209
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,208
Got it! Let's take
a little shortcut!

210
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,125
Hang on tight, everyone!

211
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,625
It's Shu!

212
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,791
A little late, dude.

213
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,750
Inori!

214
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:09,208
Yes, hold me tight
as you can and don't let go

215
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:15,708
I want to be in your arms

216
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:23,916
We'll sleep with our
foreheads pressed together

217
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,166
You ok?

218
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,916
I think it's my turn.
Show them what you can do.

219
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,333
Come on and scurry out
you little rats.

220
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,125
You again? Damn you!

221
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,500
Moron. Showing me up.

222
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,291
Inori.

223
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,666
You came.

224
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,708
Inori!

225
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,833
You truly
disappoint me, Shu Ouma.

226
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,833
You gain what could
be your throne.

227
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,750
And then you don't even
bother to sit in it!

228
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:22,166
This is where you lose her,
forever. Say goodbye, Shu!

229
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,083
The song.

230
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,875
It won't start again.

231
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,750
Gai?

232
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,458
This is why I can't
trust you, on your own.

233
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,666
Gai, no!

234
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,375
Gai, please! Gai!
