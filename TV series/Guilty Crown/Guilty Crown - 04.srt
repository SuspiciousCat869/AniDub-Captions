1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,083
I'm sorry about this.

2
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,791
Sorry about what? No,
what did you tell them?

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,541
Yahiro! What did you do?

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,291
They're arresting Shu?

5
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,291
It may not seem like it
now, but your friend

6
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,375
just did you a big favor.

7
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
No, Inori. Don't do it.

8
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,333
But, Shu, he's--.

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,750
Gai said to leave it be.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,916
I won't feel guilty.
I can't apologize

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,750
for the world we live in.

12
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,875
So, Shu, maybe
you can answer this.

13
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,833
Here is the clue:
close-fitting underwear,

14
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,708
leggings, or tights.
Primarily for women

15
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,333
four characters long. Any
suggestions spring to mind?

16
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,541
I don't know.

17
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:23,833
Why? He set me up.

18
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:29,291
I'm so stupid.
How could I be so stupid?

19
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:33,833
It's panty hose! Well hose
for short. Nothing I hate

20
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,333
more than leaving blank spots
unfilled. And I've got

21
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,875
a few blank spots that I could
use your help filling in.

22
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,416
I've prepared
a nice little room

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,416
for you to think in.
It's a bit small,

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,750
but you'll be comfortable
enough. And you can take all

25
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:50,958
the time you need to help me
figure out this puzzle of ours.

26
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:34,458
What? What do you mean
Shu got taken in by GHQ?

27
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,125
What do they want with him?

28
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,666
I was there and I could hardly
believe what was happening,

29
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,791
but the teacher confirmed
that they arrested him.

30
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,875
He didn't do anything wrong.
I know he didn't.

31
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
You arrested Dr. Ouma's son?

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,375
Yes. I brought him
in on suspected ties

33
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,875
to Funeral Parlor.
Did I make the wrong call?

34
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,708
Not if you're right.
What's your impression so far?

35
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh, he's guilty.
Aside from the evidence,

36
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,708
he's barely trying
to hide his complicity.

37
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,375
His buddy Yahiro
is quite the shutterbug.

38
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,541
Here we have Gai Tsutsugami,
self pronounced leader

39
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,083
of Funeral Parlor.
And here you are together.

40
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
Now what's a boy like
you doing hanging out

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,666
in the middle of a battle
zone with a known terrorist?

42
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,791
Good question.
You should be asking Gai that.

43
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,708
Look, Shu. It's no
exaggeration to say

44
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,500
that the food here is bad.
Much worse than

45
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,708
the school lunch line.
And I can't imagine

46
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,416
anybody would want to eat it
for the rest of their life.

47
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,875
I suggest you think about that
before you say anything else.

48
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,291
As you can see, he's trying
to keep quiet. He's familiar

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,125
enough with the group's leader
to call him by his first name.

50
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,208
But he doesn't display
any of the ideological

51
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,875
fixation characteristic
of most terrorists.

52
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:05,583
His involvement seems tangential
at best. In short, it's odd.

53
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,666
Take a look at this
and give me your analysis.

54
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,083
It's a pirate feed
simultaneously transmitted

55
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,333
to multiple news portals
seven minutes ago.

56
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,916
A warning to GHQ.
Funeral Parlor will raid

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,750
your Isolation Factory
number Four tomorrow.

58
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,833
You're welcome
to try to stop us.

59
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,791
But I can assure you that
we will rescue our comrade.

60
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,125
My, my. You can't get
more cocky than that.

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,500
You know what, sir. I think
I just had a bright idea.

62
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,000
There've been some
unexpected developments.

63
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,708
So I think its time
to let you in on everything.

64
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,708
Sorry about these
elaborate precautions.

65
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,375
We're in a heightened
state of emergency

66
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,333
right now and we've had
to double our security

67
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,833
to protect a certain prisoner
being held beneath that tower.

68
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,666
However, I'll get into all
of that later. It'll be easier

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,833
to explain after I show
you a few things, first.

70
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,958
This is our isolation ward.
Our entire compound was

71
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:28,166
initially built as a means
to facilitate this one ward.

72
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,958
It's also home to the reason
Yahiro sold you out to us.

73
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,333
Things aren't quite as black
and white as they may seem.

74
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,791
He's not a Norma Gene
addict like you thought.

75
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,291
He's a dealer.

76
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,833
Sugar is the name he gives to
his clients. He was inside

77
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,833
the Roppongi blockade that day
to sell drugs, not to buy them.

78
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,833
It's dirty money, sure,
but his motives are pure.

79
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,333
Look down there.
You'll understand.

80
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,125
What happened to these
people, are they--?

81
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,625
Yahiro! Who's the kid
he's sitting with?

82
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,000
That's his younger
brother, Jun.

83
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,125
And the reason
Yahiro ratted on you.

84
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,875
Pretty shocking, huh?
That's what happens

85
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,916
when the Apocalypse
Virus reaches Stage 4.

86
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,458
One of the most important
roles of this facility

87
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,250
is our effort
to provide cutting edge

88
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,041
medical attention to these
people who were accidentally

89
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,375
infected or developed
immunity to the vaccine.

90
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,958
I doubt you've forgotten
but only ten years

91
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,291
have passed since the
pandemic struck.

92
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,666
That little time since
the massive riot known

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,291
as Lost Christmas broke out
and this country unraveled.

94
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:46,083
GHQ was the only organization to
successfully develop a vaccine.

95
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,750
And thanks to it,
we managed to get

96
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,500
the outbreak under control.
Without that vaccine,

97
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,083
I doubt the world
would have recovered

98
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,125
any real sense of order.

99
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,041
So I can't forgive Funeral
Parlor. Not when they carelessly

100
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,666
disrupt the peace and stability
we've desperately worked

101
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:12,458
to create. And I can't
wrap my head around you.

102
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,583
You seem like a smart kid
who cares about people.

103
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,125
So why would you want to
dismantle all of our goodwill?

104
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:24,875
Goodwill? Really?
The stuff I saw wasn't goodwill.

105
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

106
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,958
What am I--, I saw
innocent people killed

107
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,166
right in front
of me! By your men!

108
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,208
That was a hideout
for unregistered citizens.

109
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,958
People that refuse
their regular inoculations and

110
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,375
it's basically
a hotbed of infection.

111
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,208
Well that still doesn't
make it right to kill them!

112
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,166
You must know our soldiers
were killed, too?

113
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,958
Far away from their families.
Think they wanted to die

114
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,916
protecting people who
won't protect themselves?

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,166
Gai said we had to save
the civilians. He said,

116
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,041
that what we did was
for the greater good.

117
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,416
Is that what he said?
Then explain this to me.

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,166
Why is he trying to
free a mass murderer?

119
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,666
Kenji Kido.
The man responsible

120
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,875
for the Sky Tree bombing.
Funeral Parlor has declared

121
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,708
their intent to take him from
us by force. Him, not you.

122
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,041
Listen, Shu. This is some
advice you should take to heart.

123
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,833
When someone tells
you to be selfless,

124
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,041
you can bet it serves them.

125
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,375
I want you to take this
transmitter. The next time

126
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,166
you're with Gai Tsutsugami,
press the blue button

127
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,500
two times and then the red
button once. It'll alert us

128
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,833
to their location and we'll
move in before they can

129
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,708
cause more harm. That's all
I need you to do for us, Shu.

130
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,458
We know about Inori Yuzuriha.

131
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,375
Most people know her as a famous
musician from the internet.

132
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,375
It's a shame that she's become
so ensnared in Gai's web

133
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,500
of deception. If you
refuse to help us,

134
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,041
that'll leave me with no
choice but to bring her in

135
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:28,708
for questioning.

136
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:39,708
Blooming wildflower,
I beg you please tell me

137
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:45,291
Blooming wildflower,
I beg you please tell me

138
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:55,333
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

139
00:10:55,416 --> 00:11:02,041
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

140
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,375
Why do I feel cold?

141
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,833
What's wrong with me,
Funell? I don't understand.

142
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,708
I wish Shu was here.
Maybe he could tell me.

143
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,541
Come on. Your lawyer's
here to see you.

144
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,041
You must be Shu.

145
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,916
I'm pleased to meet you.
Your mother hired me to act

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
as your legal defense. I'm
going to do everything I can

147
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,000
to get you out of here.

148
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,375
Oh, you can call me
Mason by the way.

149
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,375
Ga--!

150
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's get right down
to business.

151
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,125
Right! Initiating mainframe
hacking sequence.

152
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,708
They don't give much
time for consultation.

153
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,083
So we have to work fast.

154
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,000
I only need three minutes.

155
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,291
Do you feel ready to talk to me
about what happened?

156
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,791
I've diverted their video feed.
You're safe to start.

157
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,125
Good. Everyone stand by.

158
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,500
I know this has been
a harrowing experience

159
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,958
but it's almost over now.
You just do your best

160
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,750
to hang in there and I'll
have you out of here

161
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,291
in no time at all.

162
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,708
Talk about pathetic.

163
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,041
All right, I know,
you think I'm stupid!

164
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,291
Just tell me why the hell
you've come here!

165
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,000
There's a certain someone
being confined here

166
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,625
that we need free. So we're
going to break him out.

167
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,791
You mean Kenji Kido?
The murderer?

168
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:32,041
That's the one. Ogumo and
the others are set to attack.

169
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,750
Kido's in solitary.
Once we're done in here,

170
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,583
I need you to find him and
immediately draw out his void.

171
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,166
Thirty seconds afterward we'll--

172
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,541
Quit assuming I'll do
anything you want me to!

173
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,708
I am not one of your followers!

174
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,708
What exactly did
they tell you? Who was it?

175
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,916
I'm guessing it was Galty?

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,125
Look, Gai. Why are you
so determined to fight them?

177
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
What's the point of it?

178
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,166
You really need
to ask that question?

179
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,000
Answer me, damn it! Come on!
Quit keeping me in the dark!

180
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,750
Attention all personnel.
The system has been temporarily

181
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,750
corrupted by an outside
source. We are currently

182
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:19,041
rebooting from a backup
array. Please stand by.

183
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,875
Initiate the operation.

184
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,666
It's all yours!

185
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,208
It's go time.

186
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,791
Raise the shields!
Move out the Endlaves!

187
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,458
All right, Aya!
Enemy units have launched!

188
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,166
Roger that. I'm ready
whenever you are, Shibungi.

189
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,541
You've got an angle
and the flight path is clear.

190
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,166
Can you make it, Ayase?

191
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,708
Only one way to find out.

192
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,625
We don't have time for this.
Decide. You can either

193
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,291
move now, or you can lie down
and go back to playing dead.

194
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,541
Shu!

195
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,750
Inori?

196
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,583
Just hang on!
I'm coming to get you out!

197
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,333
You mean you're here?

198
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,500
I gave you an order to hold your
position. What are you doing?

199
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,666
Gai, I can see her now!
She's infiltrated the facility

200
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,458
and she's downloaded
the location of Shu's cell.

201
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,625
It's pretty clear she's
trying to rescue him.

202
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,250
She what?
But I'm not in my cell!

203
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,125
I can't reach her;
she's shut off her feed.

204
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,708
And the tower's defenses
are at full blast!

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
The meeting is over!
Get back to your cell!

206
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,125
What the-- Hey!

207
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,000
Reckless idiot.

208
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,500
Hands up! One move and--

209
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,375
Hey, Tsugumi.
Patch me to Shibungi.

210
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,875
You got it.

211
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,000
I was starting to worry, Gai.
We're all in position here

212
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,166
to send Ayase
in for your escape.

213
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,625
Things haven't exactly
gone as planned.

214
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:11,416
I'm switching up our strategy.
I'm bringing Kido in on my own!

215
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,333
That's too risky, Gai.

216
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,625
Go ahead and launch
as planned, Ayase.

217
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,500
Get in here and help
Inori and Shu!

218
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,333
Roger! Shibungi,
I'm heading in!

219
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,291
Shu, Inori,
just try to sit tight!

220
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,125
Hurry it up!

221
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,083
Gai, it looks like
they're moving Kido.

222
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,083
Perfect timing.
Send me his coordinates!

223
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,166
On the way!

224
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,250
I've secured the escapee.
Request immediate back--

225
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,375
What the hell
did you do to Inori?

226
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,500
You must've done something
she would never disobey Gai!

228
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,333
You've messed up
the whole operation!

229
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,416
If something happens to Gai,
you are on my shit list!

230
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,958
Major, we have a message from
the head of Facility Four.

231
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,291
He says that they can
protect the facility

232
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,166
and he's asked you
not to interfere.

233
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,416
Fine by me. I'm going
to get some fresh air.

234
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,541
Yes, sir. They specifically
asked you not to step in,

235
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,791
though, sir.

236
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,666
Yes, I heard you the
first time you said it.

237
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,125
I'm only going to watch.
Nothing wrong with that.

238
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,333
I promised that I'd protect
you no matter what happens.

239
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,875
So you just sleep tight, Jun.

240
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,375
Go run and hide for a second.

241
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,333
Kenji Kido.

242
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,166
It's a gun.

243
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,458
Behind you!

244
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,791
What is this thing?

245
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,208
I get it. It makes
things weightless.

246
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,916
You see, don't you?
Kenji Kido's Void has

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,250
the ability to
manipulate gravity.

248
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,458
It's like there's
an endless supply of them!

249
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,666
Damn, there's too many!

250
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,541
You're outnumbered! Surrender!

251
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,541
Shu!

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,125
Inori!

253
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,166
Hey! Stop!

254
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,000
Give me enough!

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,333
Hang on!

256
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,083
Shu.

257
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,208
Inori.

258
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:01,208
Inori, you--you're here.
You came for me!

259
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,041
This is far more
important than your life.

260
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,666
It's beautiful!

261
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,708
Kido's fine, he's over there.

262
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,291
I noticed, Ayase.
Collect him, please.

263
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Oh, yes sir!

264
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,625
What're you going to
do now? Come with us?

265
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,500
Or try to make it on your own?

266
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,291
I can decide for you
if you can't.

267
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,500
You can leave everything
to me. Just know, if you do,

268
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,041
I call the shots.

269
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,166
All right. I'm with you
from now on.

270
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,333
Let's go.
