1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:04,357
An after-hours pass request? Really?

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:05,939
Um. Yes!

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:11,261
After making such a pathetic excuse for
being out all those nights without permission,

4
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:12,804
you ask for this?

5
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:15,124
You've got some nerve, don't you?

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,430
All of the necessary paperwork
does seem to be accounted for.

7
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:22,917
As it happens,

8
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:26,507
I received a virtually identical request from Shirai.

9
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:31,411
It was dated tomorrow, and had the same
reason for absence "a study group with friends."

10
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:33,869
Oh, yes. Kuroko and I are both...

11
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,353
What are you two scheming?

12
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,685
Nothing, I swear!

13
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,802
We're just studying with some friends.

14
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:41,602
Hm. Can't you study in the dorm?

15
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,585
Why do you need to leave the premises?

16
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,769
I guess you could say, for a change of pace?

17
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:48,619
These friends are from another school,

18
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:52,077
and we're all really loaded up
with summer vacation homework.

19
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,041
You know?

20
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,512
Very well. You may go.

21
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:55,900
Huh?

22
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,171
I hope your study group is productive.

23
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:04,396
However, if you are even one minute past your return time,

24
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,520
you know what is going to happen.

25
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:08,456
Don't you?

26
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:09,987
Uh... yeah!

27
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:51,227
A good day to you Uiharu!

28
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,477
What's happening?

29
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:53,635
I've got good news!

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,004
Misaka and Shirai both got their after-hours passes!

31
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,070
Oh, really?

32
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,314
That's fantastic!

33
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,514
They said getting approved might be kind of tricky.

34
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:04,160
But, I'm glad it worked out.

35
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,988
So that means we can proceed with
today's study group as scheduled!

36
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,624
It's been so long since we've all been together!

37
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,889
Mm-Hm. Heh!

38
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:17,648
And Misaka will be there, so it's the perfect
opportunity to find out who she made those cookies for!

39
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,369
Behave yourself, Saten.

40
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,852
We aren't entirely sure she gave them to a boy.

41
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,519
Oh, I'm completely sure!

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,920
There was a look on Miska's
face that I've never seen before.

43
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,033
There we have it. All ready!

44
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,439
And now we put them in the oven.

45
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:37,089
And then we just have to wait
a little while for them to bake.

46
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:38,752
I hope I'm not putting you out.

47
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,728
It's really great of you to let me use your kitchen today.

48
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,348
No, it's not a problem at all!

49
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,660
Though for something like baking cookies.

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,030
I would think your dorm would be
better equipped than my lame kitchen.

51
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:53,057
Oh, um, not really.

52
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:56,572
When it comes to prying eyes,
my dorm has more than its share.

53
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:57,300
You know?

54
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,120
Mainly Kuroko, Kuroko, and Kuroko.

55
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,058
Ho-ho.

56
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,301
So this present you're preparing is for someone
you don't want other people asking you about, huh?

57
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:07,906
No, that's not it!

58
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:11,807
I'm in this person's debt, and I
don't like being indebted to anybody.

59
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,852
I would have thought store-bought would be
good enough, personally, but the idiot said

60
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:18,315
something about how cookies are best if homemade.

61
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm not doing this 'cause I feel obligated.

62
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:25,965
I'm just tired of listening to all the
whining, and I thought this way it would stop.

63
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:28,581
Well, then. Good for you.

64
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,820
Uiharu and I have been concerned
about you for a while, Misaka.

65
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,991
And you know poor Shirai's been distraught.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,840
Ehh...

67
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,935
I understand if I'm not the person you want to confide in,

68
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:41,767
but I hope you know I'm always here if you need me.

69
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,627
I'm sorry. It's just...

70
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,602
I'm the one who caused the problem in the first place.

71
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:51,197
I didn't want to drag anybody else into it.

72
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:53,469
Looking back on it now.

73
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:55,602
It was almost more than I could handle.

74
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,977
I'll try to be more careful.

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,102
I'm really sorry.

76
00:04:58,224 --> 00:04:58,720
Great.

77
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,184
Anyway, you seem to be feeling a lot better now.

78
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:05,102
Having a new boyfriend can do that, huh?

79
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:08,690
Boy? Uh n... no. I don't have a boyf...

80
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,312
Ah! Oh, no, the flour! Whoa, and the eggs, too!

81
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:13,894
How adorable.

82
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:17,239
She sure made a mess, though. Heh, heh.

83
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,398
It wouldn't be very nice to try to force

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,977
the information out of her, Saten.

85
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,157
Yeah, yeah. I know that.

86
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,894
Once we're finished up with our Judgment work,

87
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,289
Shirai and I will do our shopping and head over.

88
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:32,511
As for Haru'ue, she says she has something to do,

89
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,694
so she'll be a little late.

90
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,712
All right. I'll get things ready here.

91
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,547
That sounds good. I'll see you later.

92
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,360
Hey Shirai!

93
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,908
How has your morning been?

94
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:45,974
Good so far.

95
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:49,310
Lots of free time on your hands again, huh, Misaka?

96
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,952
Just a minute, when you say it like that,

97
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,578
you make it sound like I'm a loser.

98
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,032
I'm just taking it easy now

99
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:56,843
because I have plans later in the day.

100
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,823
You've been skipping meals in the dorm a lot lately.

101
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,474
What have you been up to?

102
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,155
You know, a little of this, a little of that.

103
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:08,272
A lot of the time,

104
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,507
Shirai came here and just ate by herself.

105
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:13,925
I know.

106
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,195
Hm.

107
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,533
It sure is peaceful now.

108
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:44,568
That whole Money Card situation seems to have settled down

109
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:47,326
and the back streets and alleys of Academy City

110
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,765
have finally returned to their usual calm.

111
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,204
Cute! Where did you buy that?

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,769
I can show you the store now.

113
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:55,977
Really? That would be great!

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,709
I found one!

115
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,435
Whoa! Another?

116
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,310
See? Isn't this place amazing?

117
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:02,394
Not for me.

118
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,781
I've only found three-leaf ones.

119
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,988
Judgment lady!

120
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:08,696
How are you doing?

121
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:10,420
Long time no see.

122
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:11,842
Here, take a look!

123
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:14,019
When I told my friends about the clovers,

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,571
they all wanted one, so I brought them here.

125
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:17,971
That was nice of you.

126
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,812
I don't want you guys staying out here too late, though.

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,258
Mm.

128
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:22,584
Found another one!

129
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,578
I finally found one! It's got five leaves!

130
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,027
Let me see! Let me see!

131
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:28,667
Look!

132
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:29,299
Oh!

133
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,410
Yep. Things are nice and peaceful.

134
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:44,652
Tough homework?

135
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,033
Yeah.

136
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,285
There was this book report I was assigned,

137
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,510
but I'm not sure what I want to write it on.

138
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,531
There's not much time until the vacation's over.

139
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:56,244
I know, don't remind me.

140
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,943
There are still so many loose ends to wrap up, too.

141
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,151
Ah, not again.

142
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:01,722
What's up?

143
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:06,315
Someone is trying to crack into the newspaper
club's server at Sakugawa Middle School.

144
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,160
I was asked to look out for it.

145
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,434
We have a hacker.

146
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:12,283
This seems to be happening a lot lately.

147
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,929
Why would they even want to go after
a middle school newspaper, anyway?

148
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,394
You know how hackers are.

149
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,011
They're always after a challenge,

150
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,435
and you are one of the best goalies in the whole city.

151
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,217
Huh? Did you say something?

152
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,695
Ah, they broke through the firewall again.

153
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,105
That's pretty impressive.

154
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:32,701
You're almost in now. Keep trying!

155
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,727
Uh, "keep trying"? You're rooting for them?

156
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,894
No, it's okay.

157
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:38,366
The server itself is actually a trap.

158
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:42,395
I just have to log the hacker's IP
address and send it on to Antiskill.

159
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:45,718
Ugh.

160
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,474
Maybe I should try to find a different book to read.

161
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,472
But I'll probably just have a
hard time with that one, too.

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,112
The legendary digital goalie of Academy City.

163
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,905
Brought low by a book report.

164
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:58,698
What was that?

165
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,606
You say something about a goalie?

166
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,910
Never mind. There anything I can do to help?

167
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,102
It's so sweet of you to ask!

168
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,923
Oh, well, this isn't about the book report.

169
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,644
But maybe you could help me out.

170
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,872
Do you happen to know of a supermarket
around here with a good selection?

171
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,168
Supermarket? What for?

172
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,599
I'm going to a study group after this.

173
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,746
We're each supposed to pick up an ingredient at the store,

174
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:22,740
then we're meeting at Saten's place.

175
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,241
There we go.

176
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:27,426
Hm...

177
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,443
Oh, would you look at that!

178
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,280
Uhh...

179
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,619
Hello, Shirai.

180
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,551
Such a small world, isn't it?

181
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:37,269
Lovely. It's Kongo.

182
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:38,638
Doing some shopping?

183
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:39,957
Yes, I am.

184
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,241
So, what are you in the market for?

185
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,239
Just getting some food, that's all.

186
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:49,685
What a coincidence!

187
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,185
That's what I'm doing, too.

188
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,435
I could accompany you.

189
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,185
I don't mind. It isn't too much out of my way.

190
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,960
Oh, but I would hate to
inconvenience you in the slightest.

191
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:01,435
I'm sure you have a very busy day
of snobbery and condescension planned.

192
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,977
I felt it was my civic duty to approach you.

193
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,602
You just looked so lonely out here,

194
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,727
shopping without a single friend by your side.

195
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,354
Interesting you should say that, considering that
you appear to be shopping all by yourself, as well.

196
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:15,119
I am doing no such thing, thank you.

197
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,474
In fact, I'm going to meet up with
Wannai and Awatsuki in a little while.

198
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,380
I mean, we don't have plans, exactly.

199
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,060
But they'll be done with swim practice shortly.

200
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:26,378
Until then, I'm just passing the
time with some personal shopping.

201
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:29,327
Would it help if I clarified
the definition of "alone" for you?

202
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:31,243
Now, just come with me.

203
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,202
There is a fantastic shop over
here that is one of my favorites.

204
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,393
Huh? Hey!

205
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,435
Why are we in a pet store?

206
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,259
Yes!

207
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,158
The selection here is every bit
as good as I've come to expect!

208
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,535
Hey, um, Kongo.

209
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,744
Oh these are nice and plump.

210
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,346
They should be the perfect size.

211
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:48,734
I'm confused, here.

212
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,035
Would you mind holding these for a sec?

213
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,407
Uh... Ahhh!

214
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,060
I thought you said you were out shopping for food today!

215
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,852
Ecaterina will be happy.

216
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:00,790
She has a very sophisticated palate, you know.

217
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,855
And this "Ecaterina," would be...

218
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,127
that giant python?

219
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:12,808
Turtle?

220
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:26,083
Heh.

221
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,097
Ah.

222
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,897
I'm guessing you're here about the girls?

223
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,294
Yes.

224
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:43,071
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear
that they're all doing very well.

225
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:46,098
That also includes the one who was injured.

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,345
She seems to be making good progress.

227
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,124
On the surface, anyhow.

228
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,673
What does that mean?

229
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,977
Following my initial examination,

230
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,533
I have learned a few things.

231
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,701
As we suspected, they are clones,

232
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:00,103
created from the somatic cells of the Original.

233
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,566
Which is you, of course.

234
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:06,372
During the creation process, various
drugs were administered to the culture fluid.

235
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,527
These drugs promoted the rapid growth of their bodies.

236
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:15,069
They developed incredibly quickly from fertilized
eggs to their current form in a mere fourteen days.

237
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,403
The girls already have shorter
lifespans than ordinary people,

238
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:22,510
but the accelerated growth process
has shortened them even further.

239
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,616
Ah! Shortened? How much?

240
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:29,031
Hm. I can't really give you an exact timeline,

241
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,481
but I would guess that, at most,
they have another year or two.

242
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,292
Oh, no.

243
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:40,138
Which is why they need to be adjusted.

244
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:41,456
Adjusted?

245
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,736
Here, take a look at this.

246
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:46,720
What we'll do is balance the hormones that promote rapid

247
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:50,109
growth and regulate the rate
of division of the cell nuclei.

248
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:54,325
By doing so, we should be able to
recover a certain degree of their lifespans.

249
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:57,807
We can't cut so many young lives short, can we?

250
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:02,974
We're currently in the process of dividing this
research among organizations outside of the city.

251
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:06,079
There will be constant
communication between these facilities,

252
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:09,517
ensuring that everything that can be done for them is.

253
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:13,237
Outside facilities? That sounds perfect.

254
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,031
The fight for those girls will continue.

255
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,146
And it may be a long road yet.

256
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:22,437
Although, at least this time it won't be a fight to die,

257
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,587
but rather a fight to live.

258
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,525
Hmm. I just don't know.

259
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,255
I wonder what everybody else is going to bring.

260
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:45,517
I'm so excited!

261
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,615
I've found the ultimate ingredient for tonight.

262
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:51,991
Sparkling clean.

263
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,509
Oh, man. I'm running late!

264
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,265
Kuroko's probably there by now.

265
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,541
Table for one?

266
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,311
No. I'm meeting someone.

267
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:02,830
Huh?

268
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,044
Uhh...

269
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,737
I'll be right back with some water and a menu.

270
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:14,269
Oh, no! Please don't!

271
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:15,335
I'm not with them.

272
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,077
I knew there was something I didn't like about this place.

273
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,769
Apparently they cater to spoiled,

274
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,554
sheltered little princesses.

275
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:26,201
You know, that fight was far from a clear victory for you.

276
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:26,830
Huh?

277
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:30,166
To be fair, it's an issue of prior information.

278
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,894
If I had known you were the Railgun,

279
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,519
I would have taken more care setting up my stuffed doll-

280
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:35,560
Frenda!

281
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:36,275
Huh?

282
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,714
You haven't forgotten that it was because you neglected

283
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,477
to clean up those very same dolls

284
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,852
that she was able to get away, have you?

285
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,233
Ah! Oh yeah, I guess that's right, huh?

286
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,019
Owwww!

287
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:50,727
Clean up your messes, bimbo!

288
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,540
What's going on here?

289
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:56,719
If you are going to fight, take it outside the restaurant.

290
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:57,815
As a Judgment officer,

291
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,967
I cannot allow you to disturb the other cus...

292
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:02,995
Sissy! I'm disappointed in you!

293
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,573
You know better than to start a
dispute in a public place like this!

294
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:07,977
Hey, hold on! I didn't start this.

295
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:09,153
I was just waiting for...

296
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:11,784
We've discussed this sort of thing so many times before!

297
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,619
You can't get into fights with
members of the weaker general population.

298
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,358
Excuse me, who are you calling weak?!

299
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,685
What are you, a fourth-grader?

300
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:18,281
Heh.

301
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,873
I'm certain you aren't talking to me, as I
am quite clearly a full-fledged middle schooler

302
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:26,130
who was only speaking out of a
serious concern for your welfare.

303
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:29,054
Angering Sissy here is very dangerous.

304
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,410
It could cost you your life, in fact.

305
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,438
Like I said.

306
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:35,035
You should really keep your nose out of this, little girl.

307
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,984
Your friend would be the one
shredded to bits if we got into it.

308
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,163
Just like I thought. You don't know anything.

309
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:44,019
I'm sure you'll revise your opinion
knowing she's the Railgun of Tokiwadai.

310
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,874
Well, Mugino has more combat experience than her.

311
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,902
She would blow your friend to pieces.

312
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,902
Sissy will rip her apart.

313
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:51,935
Mugino will win!

314
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,602
The victory will go to Sissy!

315
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,435
Mugino!

316
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,201
Sissy!

317
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:56,893
Hold on, Kuroko.

318
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:58,775
Take is easy, Frenda.

319
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:00,261
Okay, fine.

320
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,660
Sissy may have cartoon characters on her underwear,

321
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,935
and her taste in general does tend to be more childish

322
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,060
than one might want.

323
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:07,935
However, as Tokiwadai's Ace,

324
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,644
she is still quite a formidable opponent!

325
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,838
Yeah, well, Mugino may have her flaws, like a shrewish

326
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:14,435
temper and a tendency to flaunt
her underwear to passersby,

327
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,019
but in a fight she's completely unstoppable!

328
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,821
Honestly!

329
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,093
You think your flat-chested friend
can win against this kind of power?

330
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,073
How ignorant to think that size matters!

331
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,557
When it comes to future potential,

332
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:26,172
Sissy is the clear winner here!

333
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,362
Get your hands off of me!

334
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,106
Man. I'll never be able to go to that restaurant again!

335
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,736
Wait for me, Mugino!

336
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,959
Hey, we're here!

337
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,496
Ah. Come in!

338
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,577
Shirai, you look a little disheveled.

339
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,571
Heh. Oh, it's nothing, really.

340
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,057
Ta-da!

341
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,227
Ooh. Nice stewpot!

342
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:50,894
Yep, I borrowed it from a friend of mine.

343
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,935
And I've got the stock all ready to go.

344
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,112
Wow, that's exciting.

345
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,857
I bet we're the only ones in town having
a stew party in the middle of summer.

346
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:00,189
Now let's be clear. This isn't a party.

347
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:02,926
It's a study group, as is written on our permission slips.

348
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,607
Oh yeah, right.

349
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,496
Well, whether it's an official party or not,

350
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:09,548
eating hot food when it's hot
outside is good for the body.

351
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,648
Okay, so what ingredients did everybody else bring?

352
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,618
Well, actually I had a hard time deciding what to get.

353
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:19,785
But the man at the meat counter suggested these.

354
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,228
So I went ahead and got them.

355
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:22,349
Boxes?

356
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:23,754
Hmm...

357
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:28,387
Wow!

358
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,569
They're full of great-looking beef!

359
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,548
The marbling is incredible!

360
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,395
Um, is that good?

361
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,448
Not good, Misaka. Wonderful!

362
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:37,698
What about you?

363
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,658
Oh! Here, take a look.

364
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,345
I decided to go with vegetables.

365
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,957
I focused on summer veggies.

366
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,435
Stuff that's in season, like okra and corn.

367
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,809
And also some mushrooms and tofu.

368
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:48,622
Great idea!

369
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,532
Sounds delicious and full of vitamins!

370
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:51,539
I'm up next.

371
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:53,139
I've brought something that can enhance

372
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,843
a young lady's natural beauty!

373
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,410
You should prepare yourselves,
because I think you're going

374
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,060
to be very impressed with my contribution to the pot.

375
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,602
Sounds interesting, Shirai.

376
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:02,446
What did you bring?

377
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,535
I admit I was unsure at first.

378
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,899
There I was, standing in the pet
shop with plump mice in my hand,

379
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,369
not certain what to do.

380
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:10,747
Plump mice?

381
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,480
You went shopping at a pet store?

382
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:13,632
However!

383
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,628
It wasn't long before I had an epiphany!

384
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:18,560
And I knew I'd found an ingredient fit for Sissy.

385
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,308
Are you going to tell us what you got?

386
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,752
Yeah, Shirai we're on the edge of our seats, here.

387
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:27,012
The ingredient that I chose is turtle!

388
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:28,512
Turtle?

389
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,202
The soft collagen will enhance Sissy's fresh,

390
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:34,310
youthful skin, making it even more beautiful than before!

391
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:35,845
And that's not all!

392
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,557
That looks like...

393
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,523
Fresh soft-shell turtle blood!

394
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,027
Mixed with apple juice, to make it easier to drink.

395
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,728
Go ahead, gulp it right down!

396
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,221
One glass and you'll be full of energy.

397
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:49,654
No, you'll be positively bursting with vitality!

398
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:54,382
It's possible you'll be so fired up that
you won't be able to get to sleep tonight.

399
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,394
When that happens, I'll come and lie down beside you.

400
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:58,178
Yes!

401
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,107
Okay. Let's eat, shall we?

402
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:08,196
Mmm. Oh my gosh! It's amazing!

403
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,639
This is the first time I've ever eaten turtle,

404
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,296
but it's delicious.

405
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,942
The turtle is good, but I think the beef is my favorite.

406
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,494
The fresh veggies are pretty tasty, too.

407
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,602
So, basically, everything turned out great!

408
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:20,622
Yes it did.

409
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,444
I hope Haru'ue gets here before much longer.

410
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:26,779
Oh, I think she should be arriving any minute now.

411
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,218
I wasn't thinking.

412
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,326
Should we be waiting?

413
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,135
We'll still have plenty of ingredients left

414
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:32,135
when she gets here.

415
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,448
Oh, yeah. I say we keep eating!

416
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:38,634
You know, it's a real mystery.

417
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:39,969
What's a mystery?

418
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,185
Why is it that food always seems to taste better

419
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,584
when it's eaten as a group?

420
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,977
Mm-Hmm. I think cooking it while we eat

421
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,490
like this makes a difference, too.

422
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,102
I guess there's nothing that can beat homemade

423
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:55,769
when it comes to cookies or stew.

424
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:56,581
Right, Misaka?

425
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,719
Hey, Sissy, what's the matter?

426
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:00,927
Are you okay?

427
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,223
Oh. Yeah, I'm fine, really.

428
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:04,098
Are you sure?

429
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,703
You're panting and sweating, and your face is all red.

430
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,332
Yeah! I said I'm okay!

431
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,035
Oh! These mushrooms look delicious.

432
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,602
That's just adorable.

433
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,685
Oh, you're pure evil, Saten.

434
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,453
Hi, you guys. I'm sorry I'm so late.

435
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,487
Nah, don't worry! Come in, come in!

436
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,632
Oh. Hey, Haru'ue.

437
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,269
Oh, wow! Everything looks delicious!

438
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:27,477
So, you were able to get your errand taken care of?

439
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,682
Mm-Hmm. I needed to have a talk to my teacher, that's all.

440
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,727
This stew we put together is really good.

441
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,567
Let me get a bowl ready for you, okay?

442
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:36,894
What's in the bag?

443
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,169
Did you bring something to add, too?

444
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,194
Yeah, I just picked up some noodles.

445
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,408
Ooh! Exactly what we needed.

446
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:44,664
Sounds great! Throw 'em on in!

447
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,144
Yeah, sure, Sissy, whatever you say!

448
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,254
Oh, come on! I'm telling the truth!

449
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:12,194
Ah, I am officially full!

450
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:14,736
I think we may have to diet after this.

451
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,642
That was a lot of fun, huh?

452
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:19,102
We should really have another study group sometime.

453
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,613
Yeah.

454
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:22,369
I just wish it didn't require so much paperwork.

455
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:23,849
Ah! Paperwork?

456
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:25,519
We're not late, are we?

457
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:27,227
No, we're still okay.

458
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,070
I do think we might want to
move a little bit faster, though.

459
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,827
If we are so much as a minute past our return time,

460
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:34,160
the punishment won't be pretty.

461
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:35,782
Ugh! Let's hurry!

462
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:41,144
Kuroko? What's wrong? Come on.

463
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,139
Nothing.

464
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:49,915
Let's go.

465
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,889
Right. I'm with you, Sissy.

466
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:32,081
There. That should do it.

467
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,895
That didn't take nearly as
long as we thought, huh, Haru'ue?

468
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,852
Yeah. Um, Uiharu?

469
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:37,410
Yes?

470
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,785
You know. I really am grateful.
