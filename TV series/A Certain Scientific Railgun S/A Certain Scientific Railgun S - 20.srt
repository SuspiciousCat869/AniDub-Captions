1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,944
I've gotta say...

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:08,987
security robots malfunctioning like
this is a real black eye for Antiskill.

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:12,169
Luckily for us all, it didn't get too serious.

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,168
Whoa... that's definitely strange.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,500
Have you found the source of the problem?

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,750
It's kinda hard to tell.

7
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:21,000
These robots were just brought to the site

8
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:23,153
and their main batteries haven't been installed yet.

9
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,150
That doesn't make any sense. Are you sure?

10
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,919
Yeah... Forget malfunctioning,

11
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,264
these things shouldn't be functioning at all...

12
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:34,727
Maybe there was power left in the auxiliary batteries?

13
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,675
Okay... I guess that's that...

14
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,201
Yeah, don't worry.

15
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:11,837
Bye for now...

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,245
Uiharu and Shirai still have to
investigate the site, so they'll be a while.

17
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,045
She said to go ahead without them.

18
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,299
Okay, Febri. What do you think?

19
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,336
How about I give you this red Gekota,
and you give me back the pink one?

20
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,797
This one's cute, too, right?

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,959
Look, look!

22
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:28,758
No.

23
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:29,656
Ugghh...

24
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,480
Well, how about together with this blue Gekota?

25
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,549
And, hey, I'll even throw in the yellow one.

26
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:35,397
Do we have a deal?

27
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,235
This is my Gekota!

28
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,018
If I don't find a way to get it back
soon, it really will be hers forever!

29
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,559
Out of all of them...

30
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,459
Why did she have to fixate on the pink...

31
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,430
The color I only have one of?

32
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,790
So, it has come to this.

33
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,491
You've been at that a while...

34
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,271
You sure do like finger puppets.

35
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,914
Misaka, Saten!

36
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,709
Hello once again.

37
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,069
Yes, hello!

38
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,039
Hi, Kongo!

39
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:02,627
Mitsuko!

40
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,948
Oh, my, you're in good spirits, aren't you, sweetie?

41
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,681
You really came through before...

42
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:12,781
I mean it, if you hadn't spotted Febri,
who knows what might have happened to her?

43
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,926
Yeah, thank you so much for your help...

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,636
Febri, do you want to tell Mitsuko something?

45
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,605
Thank you, Mitsuko!

46
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,246
N-No thanks necessary, I'm sure...

47
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:28,400
I only did what anyone would have in the same position.

48
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:32,184
Well... we were all just about to go out for some tea.

49
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:34,050
And it should be fun. Would you like to come along?

50
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:36,075
Wow! A tea party?

51
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,349
Oh... While I appreciate the kind invitation,

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,811
there are still duties here to which I must attend.

53
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,125
No worries... You go on and have fun, Kongo.

54
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,656
Yeah...

55
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,952
We can manage the rest on our own, I'm sure.

56
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,454
How can you say such a thing?

57
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,092
I offered to help, and that's what I intend to do!

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,437
Mitsuko Kongo is not someone who abandons her friends!

59
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,750
Okay! Mitsuko! Wanna! Atsuki!

60
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,334
Thank you, bye-bye!

61
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,857
Have a nice day!

62
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,415
And be careful!

63
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,815
All right, then...

64
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,119
Shall we continue on with our business, ladies...?

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,264
Wait...

66
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:13,598
Heh...

67
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,522
That man again...

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,316
How lucky that we already have a chance to test the
data we acquired on the fourth-ranked the other day.

69
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:26,888
I would have liked to have had more time to prepare...

70
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,078
but I suppose I shouldn't complain.

71
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,639
This should be interesting...

72
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,342
I wonder what kind of data we'll get this time around.

73
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,793
Well, I think it will be at least mildly entertaining.

74
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,817
Let's see what you can do... Railgun.

75
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,459
They've got posters for the Reach Assembly

76
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,238
put up all over the place, huh?

77
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,280
So, what do you think...

78
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,212
I mean, now that we've seen some of it?

79
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,047
I'm not sure what I expected.

80
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,792
I've never actually been to
one of these assemblies, either.

81
00:04:56,851 --> 00:05:01,578
Well... I imagine it would be nice, having a
field of study that you were passionate about...

82
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,660
Maybe I should try to find something to research...

83
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,559
Urban legends, maybe!

84
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,225
I don't know about that...

85
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,324
Oh... No?

86
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,008
Thank you for waiting.

87
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,272
Ooh, here it comes, Febri!

88
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,321
Your very special ice cream.

89
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:25,884
Well, shucks, you can't eat with your hands full, can you?

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,284
I guess I have no choice but to hold the pink
Gekota for you while you have your ice cream... Here.

91
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,697
Aaahhh...

92
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,380
Aw... Such a spoiled little girl.

93
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,582
There ya go.

94
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,014
Yum!

95
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,188
Aaahhh...

96
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,168
Okay!

97
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:44,377
Whew...!

98
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,553
I thought we would never be finished!

99
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,620
We still haven't found the cause
of the security robot incident.

100
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,334
Come to think of it, we don't know what was
behind the traffic light outage yesterday, either.

101
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,978
A rash of mysterious mechanical trouble.

102
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:57,574
Hmm?

103
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,793
That sounds like the kind of
story Saten would like to hear.

104
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:01,458
Yeah.

105
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,785
Hey... do you two have some time?

106
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,076
Is it good?

107
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:07,242
Yeah! Yeah! I want more, more, more!

108
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,271
All right, all right.

109
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,294
Oh yes, hello? Oh, Kuroko...

110
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,198
What? Hold on, where are you?

111
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:18,372
So... this is what you do in your free time?

112
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:19,439
Just you wait...

113
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:21,218
Nothing beats this when you're tired...

114
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,029
What do you say, Febri?

115
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,061
Have you ever been to one of these before...?

116
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,460
Inside they've got the biggest bathtub ever!

117
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,031
It's so big we can all go in together!

118
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:36,688
Oh, yes... sharing a bath with Sissy
is something I've always dreamed about!

119
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,497
Leave it to me, Sissy!

120
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,841
I'll be the best bath attendant you have ever had.

121
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,725
When I'm done with you, every last inch of
your body will be scrubbed clean! Every inch!

122
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:45,972
Every nook and cranny!

123
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:50,295
Okay, let's go inside, Febri.

124
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,264
Yay!

125
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,783
Bath time! Bath time!

126
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,092
It's... bath... time!

127
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:57,994
I will not allow anything to stand in
the way of this blissful opportunity!

128
00:06:58,527 --> 00:06:59,352
Showtime!

129
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,330
Oh... Shirai...

130
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,301
So you're here, too, huh?

131
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,063
Uh-oh...

132
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,648
You're tickling me!

133
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:11,794
Come on... stop fidgeting.

134
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,402
There...! That's a good girl.

135
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,047
Those two are like peas in a pod, huh?

136
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,463
They're adorable!

137
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:21,800
How are you liking it so far, Misaka?

138
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:22,392
Huh?

139
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,559
You know, having a younger sister!

140
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,643
Uh... I have no idea what you mean.

141
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,322
A younger sister, huh?

142
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:32,807
There, see?

143
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,960
All clean, all clean!

144
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:37,027
Hey...! Where did that come from?

145
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,576
Come on, Gekota, you stop fidgeting!

146
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,934
She's even imitating Misaka.

147
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,309
She really does make a cute little sister.

148
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,107
Just plain adorable!

149
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,936
See, Gekota, that feels good, huh?

150
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,654
There, there... You just sit still, okay?

151
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,917
Good girl...! Good girl!

152
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:55,625
Good girl!

153
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,703
So, Febri... you really like Gekota?

154
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,427
Mm. Yes!

155
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:04,897
Thought so...

156
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,956
Tell you what, then. You can keep it.

157
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,180
Take good care of it, though.

158
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:11,722
You promise?

159
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,500
Uh-huh! Thanks a lot, Mikoto!

160
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,309
That's really nice, but Gekota was already my Gekota.

161
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:18,888
Eh?!

162
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,061
Hey, Misaka, if Febri's all clean,
come over here and I'll get your back!

163
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:26,036
Ooh, Saten, when you're done, will you get my back, too?

164
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:26,666
Sure.

165
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:29,430
See, I told you it would be fun!

166
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,360
You're getting water everywhere!

167
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,195
Sissy...

168
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,892
Paradise awaits just beyond those doors!

169
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:38,568
A sweet, blissful haven that I alone can truly appreciate!

170
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,506
Did I say you could stop?

171
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:43,971
Come on. Can't you rub any harder than that?

172
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,456
Yeah...

173
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,309
Well, I'm headed this way, so...

174
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,750
guess I'll see you tomorrow.

175
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,536
Sounds good. See you later!

176
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,209
Have a good night! See ya'!

177
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,118
Okay, Kuroko, let's get going.

178
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,738
A bath with Sissy...

179
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,305
A once in a lifetime opportunity!

180
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,592
It should have been me in there with her!

181
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,669
Oh, cruel, cruel world!

182
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,327
Geez, Kuroko... What's with you?

183
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,841
Ruiko...

184
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,152
Okay.

185
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,964
I guess it's been a pretty big day for such a little girl.

186
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:25,436
Your back has become reserved seating, huh?

187
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,811
Non-stop piggy back rides.

188
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,661
Yeah... I don't mind.

189
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:33,102
I only get to carry her around for five more days.

190
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:35,589
I'm really gonna miss her when she's gone.

191
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:36,303
Yeah...

192
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,663
but it's not like we'll never see her again.

193
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,292
You try to remember that, too, Sissy...

194
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,283
Don't get all sad.

195
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,090
I... wasn't planning on it.

196
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,600
Gekota...

197
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,385
Well... maybe just a little.

198
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:56,834
Once she gets all settled at Asunaro
Park, we can go and visit her together.

199
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:57,970
Of course!

200
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:02,619
Uh, but... this time I think I'll make
sure to leave all of my Gekotas at home.

201
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,834
Oh, come on now, Misaka!

202
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,214
I don't know what the big deal is.

203
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,424
You have so many of them.

204
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, well, they're not exactly easy to come by!

205
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:10,952
Huh?

206
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,542
Sidewalk closed?

207
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,277
It shouldn't be a big problem...

208
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:16,450
Let's just go up one street and cross there.

209
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:18,364
Uh?

210
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,099
It's closed here, too?

211
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,321
It's a pretty long way around,

212
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,119
but if there's construction,
I guess we don't have a choice.

213
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,325
This is annoying, huh?

214
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,426
Um...

215
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,930
A dead end. We can't get through here.

216
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,892
We followed the detour map exactly, right?

217
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,243
I thought we did, but...

218
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,569
Hold on, I can look it up on my GPS...

219
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,625
That's strange...

220
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,622
I've got several missed calls from Kongo.

221
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,286
What does Her Highness want?

222
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,822
Oh... so do I.

223
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:49,627
Wow... that many?

224
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,971
She must have called while we were
in the bathhouse, and we didn't notice.

225
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,045
I wonder if it was something important.

226
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:00,210
What's that?

227
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,587
Now... let the experiment begin.

228
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:30,538
Get back!

229
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,441
Be careful!

230
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,902
You know, I'm not sure...

231
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,228
who you are exactly...

232
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,611
but come on...

233
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,677
did you actually think this was going to work against me?!

234
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:51,668
Are you okay?

235
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:52,195
Kuroko!

236
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,742
Keep out of this!

237
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,308
Are you sure?

238
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,080
I can't control it?

239
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,042
It's not using shields...

240
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:02,530
In fact, it's got no electrical systems at all.

241
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,017
Just like the simulations predicted...

242
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,446
Well then, next up...

243
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:07,957
How is it moving?

244
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,850
I'm not sure what's going on,

245
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,068
but it looks like the type of
thing that has someone inside.

246
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:25,419
Come on!

247
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:28,306
I've got better things to do today!

248
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,281
Oh, no! Look out!

249
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,427
You're okay!

250
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,738
Get your phone! Contact Antiskill!

251
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,381
I'll get right on it!

252
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,101
Uh... no good.

253
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,474
What's wrong... hurry!

254
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,239
I'm not getting a cell signal!

255
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,384
No signal? That's kinda' weird...

256
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:54,831
Febri!

257
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,508
This isn't a good place to be!

258
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,940
What are you doing? Get away from here!

259
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:12,235
What's the matter?!

260
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,510
It's over?

261
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,016
Uhh...

262
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:32,478
That stupid machine should find a different dance partner!

263
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:33,406
It's Kongo!

264
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:35,518
Geez! What the heck are you doing here?

265
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,338
Wherever Kongo's friends are, there she will be.

266
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:39,164
Huh?

267
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,285
So, tell me, what is going on here?

268
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,134
Not sure...

269
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,575
I don't know who would do something like this.

270
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,563
Hey, wait... that's...

271
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,081
It's empty?

272
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,035
This makes no sense.

273
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,012
Febri!

274
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,858
What's the matter? C'mon wake up!

275
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,784
Oh, no!

276
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,962
We did predict that this might happen...

277
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:08,439
It's always nice when your
calculations are proved correct, isn't it?

278
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,006
Febri...!

279
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,849
Are you all right...? Febri!

280
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:13,096
Does she have an injury?

281
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,517
I'll call an ambulance!

282
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,930
But our phones aren't working...

283
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,279
The signal's getting through now.

284
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,075
Okay, then call someone, already!

285
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,765
R... Right, I'm on it.

286
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,748
Really? You guys again?

287
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,757
I wish you had been there to see it!

288
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,558
I was simply amazing!

289
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,542
The horrible robot was closing in,

290
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,725
but I plucked it up and tossed it aside...

291
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,911
No pilot, no battery, and no idea what's going on.

292
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,796
That sounds an awful lot like
the security robots, doesn't it?

293
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:45,297
We're telling you the truth...!

294
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:48,571
Please, just take a look at the
surveillance cameras, and you'll see!

295
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,693
Calm down. It's not that I doubt what you're saying...

296
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,683
but I've already received the reports from the cameras...

297
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,342
and they haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.

298
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,709
Could they be wrong?

299
00:14:58,752 --> 00:14:59,955
Let me think, here...

300
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:02,768
Could it be connected to our phones not working, maybe?

301
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,099
Just leave this up to Antiskill for now.

302
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:05,811
Yeah, but...

303
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,475
Your young friend was taken to the hospital, right...?

304
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:09,902
See how she's doing.

305
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,684
I guess we should...

306
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:12,601
Let's go.

307
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,757
Uh... right.

308
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:14,911
Thank you.

309
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:15,441
Yeah.

310
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,288
Just great... Could my job get any weirder?

311
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,938
Hmm... What's this?

312
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,190
Right.

313
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,624
Yes, okay... bye.

314
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:40,610
Kuroko says they'll be here soon.

315
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,654
It didn't look like she was injured or anything...

316
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:46,330
She'll be okay... won't she?

317
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:56,292
It's the waiting... that's the worst, isn't it?

318
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:56,673
Hm?

319
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:59,241
She'll wake up and it'll be fine.

320
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:05,702
Febri!

321
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,988
Doctor, please...

322
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,377
Her fever hasn't gone down...

323
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,385
and she hasn't regained consciousness.

324
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,676
I don't know why her condition is worsening...

325
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:14,970
I'm stumped.

326
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,818
There is nothing more we can do for her here.

327
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,146
We're moving her to another hospital right now.

328
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:22,496
O-kay...

329
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,583
This is yours now...

330
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:28,756
Keep it close to you.

331
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,007
Excellent!

332
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:44,202
We now know that our work can hold its
own nicely against Railgun and her ability...

333
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:48,873
Though it would have been preferable if our
machine made it through the experiment in better shape.

334
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,750
Well, we all take risks in the name of greater knowledge.

335
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:56,215
Today's data has ensured that the
program will be even more accurate.

336
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,812
It's actually a good thing the third-ranked interfered.

337
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,286
Today's experiment has demonstrated something vital...

338
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,996
The fact that even those espers who possess
greatest abilities are vulnerable to attack...

339
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,435
Academy city's inconsistency will be exposed.

340
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,860
Now, my friends, it's time to call a vote.

341
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:16,625
Concerning Febri's... disposition?

342
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,936
It's taking awhile, isn't it?

343
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,694
So, uh...

344
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,448
what was that thing we saw?

345
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,878
If it had never shown up...

346
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,983
maybe she would be okay.

347
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,042
I don't know who these people are.

348
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:38,504
But that thing...

349
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,371
it came after me.

350
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,083
It's my fault. I did it.

351
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,831
She's in pain because of me.

352
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:51,297
Sissy...!

353
00:17:53,627 --> 00:17:55,543
Oh, hey... I'm glad you're here.

354
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,152
So, how is Febri doing?

355
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,130
Sorry, we... don't know.

356
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,600
Oh, okay.

357
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,379
Any news?

358
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,477
Well... Antiskill has taken
over the investigation for now...

359
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,103
and, unfortunately, we haven't gotten any leads so far.

360
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,388
I'd like to know...

361
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:13,009
What are you doing here, Your High-and-Mightyness?!

362
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,865
You have to ask? Like all of you,

363
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:17,482
I came because I'm concerned about Febri, of course.

364
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,540
I guess that I should thank you again...

365
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,193
I do appreciate it...

366
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,834
Oh, yeah, and I saw that you called us earlier?

367
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,359
Yes... yes, I did!

368
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,057
There is something I felt that you needed to know...

369
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,178
Our sweet Febri is in danger!

370
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,724
There was an incident near the Reach Assembly
with a man who spoke extremely unkindly to me.

371
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:36,996
And then...

372
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,168
Hey, is that?

373
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,334
Hold on, what are you planning to do?

374
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:44,447
I just think I should have a word
with that guy about his attitude...

375
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,645
I don't like what he said before, Kongo.

376
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,633
I really think he's wrong about you.

377
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:49,762
Yes, I agree...

378
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,027
And I would like to tell him so to his face.

379
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:53,372
Huh? But...

380
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,043
Target is currently on the move...

381
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,427
That's right.

382
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:59,249
It's unfortunate that we failed to retrieve Febri...

383
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,704
but aren't we better off as things stand now?

384
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:03,949
Hmm...? Yes...

385
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,073
Yes, send them my way... please.

386
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,044
I think there will be some interesting results.

387
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,148
That guy wanted Febri?!

388
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,668
Yes, so we tried...

389
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,750
but we couldn't reach any of you...

390
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:18,508
Then we decided it would be best to
split up and start searching for...

391
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,621
Whoops. Please excuse me.

392
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:22,514
Hello, this is Kongo...

393
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,220
Wannai, Awatsuki?

394
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,175
Yes, I'm so sorry...

395
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,330
I completely forgot to call
you and fill you in on everything.

396
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:33,332
Oh, yes, I was able to find Misaka and the others.

397
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:35,032
And Febri, too... However...

398
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,294
Well, yes. I'm doing just fine thank you.

399
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,234
Why do you ask?

400
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:41,046
Please, feel free to go and
reassure your friends you're OK.

401
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,250
There's no real reason for you to stay here.

402
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,683
I do not intend to leave!

403
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,888
Oh, no, sorry! I was talking to somebody else.

404
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:51,599
You ladies must be exhausted
after searching the city for so long!

405
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:55,197
No, really. You needn't worry about
me. I assure you, I'm quite well!

406
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,205
Thank you...

407
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,875
I'm sorry. I really am. I just forgot...

408
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,080
Well then, as much as I hate to leave you all...

409
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,225
I must go...

410
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:09,316
But if something important comes
up, you'll tell me, won't you?

411
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,859
I mean, after what's happened,
we're all Febri's friends aren't we?

412
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:14,702
Yes... we are.

413
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:17,943
I don't understand.

414
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,628
What does it all mean?

415
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,254
Febri is a target...

416
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,480
That's what they said.

417
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:24,391
Wow, they're really cold.

418
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,182
Acting like she's just some thing.

419
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:44,903
Good morning.

420
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:52,853
Febri!

421
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,864
Ah, Mikoto!

422
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,454
Are you feeling okay, Febri?

423
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,067
What...? Am I okay?

424
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,569
Hi, sweetie... We were worried about you.

425
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,087
You collapsed all of a sudden!

426
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,416
Gekota... are you okay?

427
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,275
Huh?

428
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,483
I'm guessing that means she feels all right now.

429
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:12,429
Hmm?

430
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:16,657
A moment, please?

431
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,461
You're sure that you don't hurt anywhere?

432
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:21,796
Gekota's fine!

433
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:23,475
Still as cute as ever, huh?

434
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,139
Doctor.

435
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:26,142
We'd like to thank you for all your help.

436
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,986
Please don't. I didn't actually do anything.

437
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:30,385
Huh...? But you...

438
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:34,103
I'm sorry, but helping her is beyond my capabilities...

439
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,557
I don't understand... Is it serious?

440
00:21:36,935 --> 00:21:39,267
Please. Surely you can do something?

441
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:40,054
No...

442
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:43,463
If it were some human illness, I'm sure I could.

443
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,801
But the fact is...

444
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,184
She's not human.

445
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:50,041
Huh?

446
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:53,260
The girl has been scientifically engineered.

447
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:56,707
She's a construction.

448
00:21:58,825 --> 00:21:59,376
What?

449
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,944
Oh, wow! I got the preview?

450
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,311
I was only doing what I, Mitsuko Kongo, thought was right.

451
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,203
Next time... I will save the world!

452
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:39,626
Oh, just shut up!
