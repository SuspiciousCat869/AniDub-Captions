1
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:09,129
Amazing!

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,102
It's like a part of my body!

3
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,206
Like moving my own arms or legs!

4
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:16,223
All of this air is completely under my control!

5
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:17,629
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,270
So fighting someone stronger
really was a shortcut to leveling up!

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,295
Guess they were right all along!

8
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,129
Thanks, third-string!

9
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:28,873
You served your purpose well,
and now I'm going to destroy you!

10
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:29,722
Huh?

11
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,172
How could this be happening now?

12
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,580
It looks like the plasma is diffusing.

13
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,545
Why is the wind suddenly acting like this?

14
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,100
It's not wind manipulation?

15
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,298
So, what?

16
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,937
The windmills are turning the wrong way.

17
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:47,613
Hold on.

18
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:49,410
I've heard about this before.

19
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,462
It's something about dynamo motors.

20
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:54,574
When they're hit by particular
electromagnetic waves, they...

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,637
Is it them?

22
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,792
Damn it. What do they think they're doing?

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,407
Those windmills aren't just spinning around haphazardly.

24
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,291
They're being directed to disrupt my formulas!

25
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:09,565
She's doing it!

26
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,672
The images she sees are going across the network!

27
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,647
I'm gonna' kill you!

28
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:23,825
I won't let you!

29
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,460
I don't understand you people.

30
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,050
First we have a gallant appearance from third-string.

31
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,494
And then you show up.

32
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,593
Just to defend this wind-up doll.

33
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:46,384
That's an overproduced, factory reject of yourself.

34
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,504
I would think, out of everyone in the world,

35
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,109
you would be the most disgusted by it.

36
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,004
Or maybe it freaks you out to see something

37
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,004
that looks like you getting all beat up.

38
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,670
But then, that's not a very good reason

39
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,279
to put your life on the line.

40
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:07,301
So maybe you just can't stand to have
somebody else become a Level 6 before you.

41
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:10,920
Or, maybe, it's some kind of atonement for being

42
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:14,342
the reason they started these
experiments in the first place.

43
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,824
I don't desire power for power's sake the way you do.

44
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:23,712
Nor do I think of this as atonement for any of the things

45
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,388
that I've done wrong in the past.

46
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:28,650
She's my sister.

47
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,201
All of these girls.

48
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,546
They are my little sisters.

49
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,644
That's why I'm here.

50
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:40,979
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,436
After all this time, I have no right to ask you this,

52
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,487
but still...

53
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:51,412
Just this one time, may I fulfill my role as big sister?

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,212
Yes.

55
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,149
Heh.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,395
I will not let another one of them die!

57
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,898
Huh?

58
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,203
Man, that's rich!

59
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,620
I have to admit that I didn't see that one coming.

60
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:17,614
Playing at sisters? That's a good one!

61
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,920
You're way out of your league here.

62
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,923
If there's something I wanna do, you can't stop me.

63
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,998
Two little girls like you can't even slow me down.

64
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:30,500
It's kind of like how a person's
vision can only be measured up to 20/20.

65
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,551
Level 5 is the highest rank an
esper can attain in Academy City.

66
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,566
So that's where I'm stuck, even
though I'm better than the rest of you.

67
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:42,462
I'm sick of looking at the same damn face day after day,

68
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,825
so I'm gonna kill all...

69
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,238
Impossible.

70
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,016
Doesn't he get it?

71
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,696
I'm the most experienced killer this city's ever seen.

72
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:21,462
I know so much about what it takes to destroy a person,

73
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:22,827
I'm almost sick of it.

74
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,418
He's standing.

75
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:30,064
He shouldn't even... be alive.

76
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,332
What am I doing?

77
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:46,113
This idiot just doesn't know when to quit.

78
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,350
Sure, I lost control of the wind.

79
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,536
But I can still finish him off.

80
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,647
All I need is one touch.

81
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,767
This really has been fascinating.

82
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:58,427
But I've had enough.

83
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,589
It ends now!

84
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,863
You're the strongest guy in Academy City.

85
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,326
That's not gonna help you now.

86
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,107
The weakest guy is taking you down.

87
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,703
I don't get it.

88
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,304
Why can't I break this guy?

89
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:41,601
He's protecting them. The wind-up dolls.

90
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,717
I was one step away from it. From absolute power.

91
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,806
And now. And now.

92
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,809
What if having too much power,

93
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,690
turns the world itself against me?

94
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:11,068
Ultimately resulting in
destruction, rather than protection.

95
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:15,328
Just think.

96
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,648
If you were to gain even greater power than you have.

97
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,563
Then what would your life be like?

98
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,694
Just do the experiments,

99
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,938
you have nothing to lose.

100
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,210
It's not like any people will get hurt.

101
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:34,109
Guinea pigs. Wind-up dolls. Clones.

102
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,843
It's not like I'm seeking immortality.

103
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:40,254
I just want to gather enough power

104
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,029
that nobody will ever want to fight me again.

105
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,238
If that happens.

106
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,782
Then someday, maybe.

107
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,323
If that happens, then.

108
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:06,124
Then, no one will.

109
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,757
So many Sisters, living the best that they can.

110
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,545
All of these girls.

111
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,737
They're my sisters.

112
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:22,125
Really.

113
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,556
What am I even doing anymore?

114
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:19,235
Hi. Are, are you?

115
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:39,962
Just thought I would drop by.

116
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,014
Oh, guess he's asleep.

117
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,325
To think he actually defeated the
first-ranked esper in Academy City.

118
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,156
You must be crazy or something.

119
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,315
You know that?

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,929
Uh... Sorry. Did I wake you?

121
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:11,297
Uh. Here! Get well soon!

122
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,587
I picked the most expensive cookies the store had.

123
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,090
For the price, I'm guessing they're pretty good.

124
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,202
I just thought...

125
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,270
I really ought to try and do something to,

126
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,192
you know, say thank...

127
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,750
When it comes to cookies...

128
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,752
Don't people say homemade are the best?

129
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:29,859
Huh?

130
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,145
Heh, heh. Is that so?

131
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,670
Can you seriously picture me baking cookies?

132
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:36,753
No, never.

133
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,750
I'm pretty sure if you tried to the cookies
would come out all misshapen and disgusting.

134
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,198
It would be ugly for sure.

135
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,962
I meant that baking's not my
style, not that I can't do it!

136
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,650
Hey, calm down! I'm injured, here!

137
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,795
Or you're gonna fry all the hospital's fancy equipment

138
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,003
if you're not careful!

139
00:11:58,962 --> 00:11:59,962
Okay, fine.

140
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,333
So, uh.

141
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,628
Your sister stopped by.

142
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,759
She said the experiments are over.

143
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:13,754
Mmm.

144
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:19,631
They're over, but because of me so many...

145
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:31,136
Well, you know, if you hadn't offered them your
DNA map, none of the sisters would ever have existed.

146
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:35,450
That experiment was messed up in a lot of ways,

147
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:38,106
but at least there was something good that came from it.

148
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:40,376
Your sisters.

149
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,275
You can take pride in that.

150
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,146
Think about it this way.

151
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,947
If it weren't for you,

152
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,927
they wouldn't have had a chance at life whatsoever.

153
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,290
What's the point in moping?

154
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,817
I don't think they'd like to see you like this.

155
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:00,333
Beating yourself up.

156
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,712
What should we play on?

157
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,076
How are your injuries doing?

158
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:15,017
These are really nothing serious
compared to what happened to that boy.

159
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:16,620
Good. I'm glad.

160
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,061
Here we go. Whee!

161
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,525
Ha, ha, ha! Yay!

162
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,948
Lives created by a machine.

163
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,748
They're born without knowledge of the world.

164
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,367
Blank slates.

165
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:37,301
So it's not surprising that when they
are told they're nothing but lab rats.

166
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,471
they swiftly come to accept it as the simple truth.

167
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:46,858
However, if they're given the chance
to look at the world around them.

168
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,290
Like she did.

169
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,339
Then surely, they can...

170
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,463
So, listen, um.

171
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,910
You probably can't forgive what I did.

172
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,524
I doubt you even want to see my face.

173
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
But, uh. I do think you might have some trouble,

174
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,076
you know, adjusting to a normal life. So, if, um...

175
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,930
If there's anything at all I can do to, uh, help?

176
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,236
"This is called 'stand and swing'," Says Misaka,

177
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:24,254
putting into practice knowledge she gained
from Testament and showing off her skills.

178
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,270
Wow!

179
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,537
That's amazing!

180
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,761
"Done. Any more of that and I risk

181
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,888
aggravating my injuries, so that's all for me.

182
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:38,652
Whew!" says Misaka, growing tired.

183
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,941
"What? Is something the matter?"

184
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,949
Sorry, just give me a moment.

185
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,017
Come on, Sis!

186
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,120
Let's do it again!

187
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,201
No. I think that's enough.

188
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,125
"No, it isn't."

189
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:55,058
"As the big sister, it is your
obligation to indulge your younger sister."

190
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:55,876
Huh?

191
00:14:56,314 --> 00:15:00,023
Says Misaka to the impressionable
youngster, hoping to brainwash her.

192
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,247
Hey, you!

193
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:08,891
Cute, yes?

194
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,416
It is what people call a kitten.

195
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,735
I know that!

196
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,770
Hey, are you and this other lady sisters?

197
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:15,979
You look the same!

198
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:16,399
Uh...

199
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,216
You've got to be twins, right?

200
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:21,271
So who's the older sister and who's the younger sister?

201
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,199
Uh...

202
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:23,725
Well, the thing is...

203
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,706
Ah! Hold on, hold on! I wanna guess!

204
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:28,929
Okay, let's see. I think...

205
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:30,495
Hm...

206
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,911
You were the one who wanted to guess.

207
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,699
It's you!

208
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,534
You're the younger sister! You've gotta be!

209
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,145
I mean, you've got a Gekota.

210
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,650
Uh...

211
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,340
I like stuffed animals, too!

212
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:44,383
Huh?

213
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:48,503
"Mmph!" says Misaka, indicating stifled laughter.

214
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,549
It cannot be denied.

215
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,368
Her tastes are inappropriate for her age.

216
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:57,592
She is rude, hot-tempered, and belligerent.

217
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:02,552
She is sensitive, easily embarrassed,
and even more easily offended.

218
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,695
However, this problematic older
sister of mine risked her life for me.

219
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:11,689
Huh?

220
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,752
It is strange.

221
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,949
After last night's experiment,
Misaka was supposed to be dead.

222
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,379
It was supposed to play out as it always had,

223
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,444
more than ten thousand times before.

224
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,001
The same course of events.

225
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:37,619
And yet, here I am.

226
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:39,861
Misaka is still alive.

227
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,774
Still walking and talking.

228
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,494
The Misakas were disposable.

229
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,169
We were created in order to be killed.

230
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,370
That was the sole purpose for our existence.

231
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,650
The reason for which we were born.

232
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:57,356
And now, thanks to you and that boy,

233
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,411
we have lost our purpose.

234
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,532
We are unemployed.

235
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,290
Huh?

236
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,212
We are lost.

237
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,752
Adrift in a world that makes little sense.

238
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:10,727
So, please.

239
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:13,071
"Help Misaka.

240
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,867
Stay with her while she goes on her search.

241
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:19,729
While she tries to discover a
new meaning for this life of hers."

242
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:24,290
Says Misaka, asking her big
sister for a world of indulgence.

243
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,350
Yes. I'd love to.

244
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:39,638
Do it again, Sis!

245
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,420
Okay, okay. Ready?

246
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,252
Uh-huh!

247
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,252
That's all she said?

248
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,803
So she didn't give you any details then?

249
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:51,920
No. None.

250
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:54,401
Misaka baking. Huh.

251
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:56,795
She said she wanted to get away from

252
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,828
all the prying eyes in the dorm kitchen,

253
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,790
so she asked to borrow my oven instead.

254
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,735
It seemed like a really big deal.

255
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,571
I almost don't believe it.

256
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,395
Pigs must be flying now.

257
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,367
Yeah, right?

258
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:09,599
Still. I'm glad.

259
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,316
She seems more cheerful than she's been in a while.

260
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,516
I agree.

261
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,729
I wish we knew who she was making the present for, though.

262
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:20,001
I asked a million times, but she wouldn't give up a name.

263
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:21,143
Yeah?

264
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:22,636
Yeah.

265
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,077
Jeez. Saten got a little too much
enjoyment out of the whole thing.

266
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,408
After all, it's not like this
is supposed to mean something.

267
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,609
It's a thank-you. That's it.

268
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,154
Of course, this is him we're talking about.

269
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:41,045
"I was only fighting for my own sake.

270
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:43,454
I've done nothing that deserves any thanks."

271
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,612
I'll bet that's what he says.

272
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,000
Maybe I'm just being childish.

273
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:56,091
No, no, no! Anyway, whether he wants thanks or
not, I still need to show him proper gratitude.

274
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:57,682
U... Uh...

275
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,988
I went to all the trouble of making these things,

276
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,920
and if he doesn't accept them,
then he's going to pay for...

277
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,171
What's he gonna pay for?

278
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:07,930
Huh?

279
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,107
What are you doing all the way out here?

280
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,308
Huh?

281
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,294
You're still supposed to be in the hospital!

282
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,280
Well, uh...

283
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,962
hospitals aren't exactly cheap.

284
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,422
And I have a hungry roommate who gets even
more violent every day that I'm away from home.

285
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:21,898
Huh?

286
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:22,980
Hey.

287
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,775
For that matter, what are you doing way out here?

288
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:26,349
Uh.

289
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,159
Well, I...

290
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:30,670
Oh, I know.

291
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,863
You must've been coming to visit me again.

292
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,618
Hah! Yeah, right.

293
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,445
I... I was not!

294
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,053
Wow, uh. you don't have to deny it so forcefully.

295
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:40,989
Idiot!

296
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,557
Uh, no, I wasn't coming out here to check on you.

297
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:50,809
It's just that, lately, you've helped me out an awful lot.

298
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:58,222
I... I, uh, didn't... mean to.

299
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:01,703
I just, wanted to.

300
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,362
Look, ants!

301
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:04,148
Ants?

302
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,067
Oh. You have a research project or something?

303
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,295
Some summer vacation homework?

304
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,978
"Look, ants!" What am I, five years old?

305
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:16,710
Sorry to interrupt you.

306
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,395
See ya around, zapper.

307
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,151
Mikoto Misaka!

308
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:30,073
What?

309
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,647
I have an actual name!

310
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,174
It's Mikoto Misaka. It isn't Zapper.

311
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:36,931
You always call me that.

312
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:39,305
Try using my real name sometime!

313
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,437
Then again, maybe that's just too much to ask of you.

314
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,093
See you later, Misaka.

315
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,344
I've got bad news!

316
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,490
Listen, Sis...

317
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,802
What happened? What's the matter with you?

318
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,700
Ah! Are you feeling okay?

319
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,237
Are you hurt somewhere?

320
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,752
Did you eat something that didn't agree with you?

321
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,762
What? What are you talking about?

322
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,712
And what's this bad news you mentioned?

323
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,291
Oh, about that.

324
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,837
The head resident seems to have learned about the nights

325
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,212
you've been away from the dorms without permission.

326
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:26,750
She says you'd better have a very
good explanation for your absence.

327
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:27,881
That's bad, huh?

328
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,606
I'm gonna need an excuse.

329
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,108
Wait... you came all the way
out here just to tell me that?

330
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,197
Thank you.

331
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,379
But how did you know where I was?

332
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,295
Huh? As they say, "like calls to like."

333
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,903
Wherever Sissy is, there too will be Kuroko.

334
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:44,379
But more importantly, are you sure everything is okay?

335
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,087
Because if anything were to happen to you, Sissy,

336
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,513
I wouldn't rest until I had done everything tha...

337
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:49,833
Honestly.

338
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,713
Keep talking crazy and I'll leave you here.

339
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,723
Can you really blame me, Sissy?

340
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,299
There was a look on your face
that I've never seen there before.

341
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,312
I'm so glad Misaka's feeling better now!

342
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:35,879
I still want to know who those cookies were for!

343
00:23:35,904 --> 00:23:36,923
Exposed!

344
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:37,784
Uh, Shirai?

345
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,270
It's time to come out of your shell, Sissy.

346
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:40,888
Body and soul!
