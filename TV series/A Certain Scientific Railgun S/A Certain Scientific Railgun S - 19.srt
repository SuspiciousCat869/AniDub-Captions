1
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,762
Let's make a trade, okay?

2
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,387
My name is Ruiko.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,652
Now it's your turn...

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:09,352
Do you think you can tell me your name?

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,720
I'm Febri.

6
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:16,899
Aww...

7
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,012
That's a very pretty name!

8
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,345
Okay, then, Febri...

9
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,679
What else can you tell us...?

10
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:24,097
Anything goes. You can just pick something.

11
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,229
Mikoto Misaka.

12
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:29,928
Huh?

13
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:31,588
What, me?

14
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:33,113
So, um...

15
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,237
is this little one somebody
you might've actually met before?

16
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,804
No, not that I can remember.

17
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:39,762
A distant relative or something?

18
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,076
Any half-sisters you've never told us about?

19
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:43,497
Half-sisters?

20
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:46,120
Yeah, around ten thousand or so...

21
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,423
Wait...! No, no, no, no, no!

22
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,179
Do not tell me she's your daughter!

23
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,786
No, you would never have done that!

24
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,484
Surely not without telling me fir...

25
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,917
Ow... www...

26
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:59,137
Hi, I'm Mikoto Misaka...

27
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,524
I'm just wondering how you know my name.

28
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:13,487
They say children have a sixth
sense about things like this...

29
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,056
Which people are safe and which ones are more dangerous.

30
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:17,478
Uhh...

31
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,650
Heh. Maybe, but she hasn't seen this yet!

32
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,205
A finger puppet?

33
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,089
A prize that came with a soda...

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,315
I don't know how many cans she
drank before she finally got it.

35
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,644
Still into that little guy, huh?

36
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:39,645
Ahh...

37
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:44,865
Yo! My name is Gekota!

38
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,304
Your name's Febri, right?

39
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,720
Maybe you can tell me something, Febri.

40
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:51,372
I would...

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,070
Ahh!

42
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:01,969
You only have a one in twenty-four
chance of getting a pink Gekota!

43
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:02,471
Ugh...

44
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,736
Are you really going to make a spectacle
of yourself over a lousy finger puppet?

45
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,126
Hey, come on, now, Febri...

46
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,309
You can't just run off with someone else's...

47
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:16,533
That is so cute.

48
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,130
It's pretty obvious who she trusts the most.

49
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,195
You know... that Gekota isn't yours...

50
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,697
It belongs to Misaka...

51
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,705
Why don't we give it back?

52
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,885
No...! It's my Gekota!

53
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,479
Well, I tried.

54
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:42,362
Hm. I'm not finding any information on
her under lost children or missing persons.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,134
Nothing at all, huh?

56
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:48,313
It's too late for me to get in touch
with somebody at Antiskill who could help us.

57
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,696
What are we supposed to do?

58
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:51,849
Well...

59
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,881
how about I take her for the night?

60
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:56,060
I mean, just look at her...

61
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:01,589
I have a little brother, so taking
care of children is nothing new for me.

62
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,012
Well, I hate to impose...

63
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,929
but if you really wouldn't mind...

64
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,263
I don't mind at all!

65
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,099
But, you know...

66
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,095
my place is a bit small...

67
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:16,709
and it probably wouldn't hurt to have some help...

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,244
What do you say Uiharu? Wanna give me a hand?

69
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:22,858
Yes!

70
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:02,003
Hmm.

71
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,816
How's it going out there?

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,880
Ready?

73
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,252
Yeah!

74
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,637
Lolly...

75
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:14,888
What's a lolly?

76
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,326
Here... it's all yours!

77
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,252
Should we see if she wants to eat something?

78
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,643
Hey... want some supper?

79
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:36,112
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing!

80
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,512
Boing, boing, boing! Boing, boing, boing.

81
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:42,012
So, looks like it's time to play house...

82
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,137
Are you up for it?

83
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:44,136
Totally!

84
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:48,943
It's time to dig in!

85
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:54,813
What's the matter? Doesn't it look tasty?

86
00:05:58,904 --> 00:05:59,986
Aaahhh...

87
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,734
Aaaaahhhh...

88
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,224
Good, huh?

89
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,212
Yeah! Heh!

90
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,648
Okay... here we go.

91
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,642
Close your eyes for me!

92
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,777
Whee!

93
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:34,804
Okay, now it's your turn...

94
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,617
Will you spray some water on me?

95
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:37,509
Yeah!

96
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,029
Whoa! Easy, now, or you'll fall!

97
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,054
Be careful, Feb...

98
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,012
Ooh... Are you okay, Ruiko?

99
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,529
Ooh! You did that on purpose!

100
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:47,970
I'm gonna get you!

101
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,871
Hey! Aren't you coming in?

102
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,020
Uiharu!

103
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,270
Hey, Whee-hah!

104
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:58,797
Yeah! Heh.

105
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,844
I hate to say it, but you seem
to be a finger short of a froggy.

106
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,554
Hey, don't worry. I'm okay...

107
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,220
One lousy finger puppet...

108
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,095
A free prize with a can of soda...

109
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,279
It's... no big deal...

110
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,840
Well, it sure doesn't sound like you're okay.

111
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,953
I just have a lot of things on my mind...

112
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,222
You know, like...

113
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:31,138
How does a little girl I've never met before know my name?

114
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,102
And, more importantly, why is she so afraid of me?

115
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,006
What?!

116
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:38,970
Please don't tell me that little
street urchin hurt your feelings, Sissy!

117
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,718
Absolutely unforgivable!

118
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,554
But you need not despair!

119
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:49,102
I know exactly how to fill the hole
that wayward child has left in your heart!

120
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:53,393
Huh? Ah!

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,137
Hey, Shirai!

122
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,804
What's all the commotion?!

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,797
I really wonder...

124
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,346
How in the world does that lost little girl know my name?

125
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,279
So, um...

126
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,102
She's pretty unusual, huh?

127
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,137
Still a cutie, though.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:25,900
Yeah.

129
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:33,246
Hmm...

130
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:48,439
My goodness...! That's an intense flavor.

131
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,384
Yeah! It's crazy, huh?

132
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,650
And she just sucks on them like they're nothing.

133
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,093
Oh, you're terrible, Saten, you know that?

134
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,362
She did the same thing to me last night.

135
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,458
"Hey, this is delicious, you should really try it!"

136
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:04,130
Oh, let it go. I said I was sorry.

137
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:07,067
Having fun?

138
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,139
Yeah!

139
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:09,637
Good to hear.

140
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,789
Yeah, I'm glad you're having fun, Febri!

141
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:17,187
Heh, heh.

142
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,915
Ugh...

143
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,485
Still no luck.

144
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,535
There's no data on her anywhere.

145
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:31,036
I put her information into the database that handles
queries from missing persons and lost child cases...

146
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,992
but so far, there's been no response.

147
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,720
We all know what that means, right?

148
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:39,321
Little Febri here might be a Child Error.

149
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:40,887
Oh, yeah.

150
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:42,946
Hi everyone!

151
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:45,939
Hey, Haru'ue!

152
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:47,904
We're settled from the move...

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,005
So I thought I would stop by
here and say hello to you all.

154
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:52,957
Well, what d'you know.

155
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,059
So that's where she ran off to.

156
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,929
Ah, excellent.

157
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,666
You managed to find her.

158
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,179
A Child Error. That's what you think she is?

159
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:09,682
It does seem likely...

160
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,453
I've tried everything, but I haven't
found any other information on her.

161
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,983
Guess we'll have to wait until someone
from an institution can come to get her.

162
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,270
I hope she gets into a good one.

163
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,679
There are good homes and bad homes?

164
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,091
From what I've heard, things can get pretty
horrible, depending on the facility you're in.

165
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:31,429
Well, maybe... we can choose where she goes...

166
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,262
Hey, Uiharu...

167
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,054
do you know of any sites that rate
and review these types of institutions?

168
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,165
No, they don't really do that.

169
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,823
Hey...! I know!

170
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,795
I've received confirmation.

171
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:46,222
They're willing to accept her.

172
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,121
Asunaro Park said okay!

173
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:53,867
It's a facility in District 13.

174
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,898
Don't worry, we've been there before.

175
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:59,314
We know first-hand that it's a warm, welcoming place.

176
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,458
However, there's one small problem...

177
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:04,720
They aren't ready to take her in quite yet...

178
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,454
They'll need at least five days.

179
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:07,970
That shouldn't be a big issue...

180
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,969
I am more than happy to look after her 'til then.

181
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,951
I'll help take care of her, too.

182
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,221
Yeah, so will I.

183
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:17,862
In that case, I shall assist with childcare, as well.

184
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,105
All right, then...

185
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll inform them of our decision.

186
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:27,845
So... little one...

187
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,745
would you mind sticking with
us for just a little bit longer?

188
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:32,374
With you, Ruiko?

189
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,514
Yeah...! And everyone else, too!

190
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,198
You mean, with Whee-hah?

191
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:37,723
Yep.

192
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,488
And Kuroko?

193
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:40,327
Yes.

194
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,564
And Mii?

195
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,268
Of course. I'll be here, too!

196
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:51,929
Five days, huh?

197
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,616
That means Febri's going to be with
us until the day of the Reach Assembly.

198
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:58,070
Oh yeah! Speaking of which...

199
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,637
it's just about time for our on-site security meeting,

200
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,470
isn't it?

201
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,887
I really do hope that you'll come and visit us again.

202
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,095
Of course I will...

203
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,345
Next time I'll bring Banri with me, too...

204
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,985
Bye-bye now, Febri, you be good, okay?

205
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:12,385
Okay bye, Erii!

206
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:13,366
Huh?!

207
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,056
Even Haru'ue?!

208
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,270
So help me!

209
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,177
I swear I will get that girl to call me by my name!

210
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,387
Huh. Is this really where
they're holding the Reach Assembly?

211
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,865
'Cause that's kinda surprising...

212
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:35,796
Yes...

213
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,763
Well, it's one of the sites, anyway.

214
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,554
It's just that this place is sort of...

215
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,956
how do I put it? Sad and uninviting.

216
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:44,792
The focus of the Reach Assembly is academic rigor,

217
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,845
prioritizing pure research over esper abilities...

218
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,150
The result is an understandable lack of glitz and glamour.

219
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,351
It tends to get pretty nerdy.

220
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:54,501
That makes sense.

221
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,175
You sound like you're really disappointed about this...

222
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,845
What were you expecting the assembly to be like?

223
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,125
Oh, well, you know... something with
street stalls and lots of events...

224
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,720
Everyone working together to get it all set up...

225
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:08,720
That sort of thing.

226
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,345
Okay, so that's why you came along.

227
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:12,862
Yeah, that's pretty much it...

228
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:14,637
I thought it would keep Febri, you know...

229
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,179
amused... Right?

230
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:17,577
Right?

231
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,804
Right.

232
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,264
So cute!

233
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,987
My! Look who we ran into!

234
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,282
Isn't that Misaka?

235
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,262
Huh?

236
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,804
Yep, that's her, all right.

237
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:28,320
What a strange coincidence.

238
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,012
Oh, hey... it's Kongo.

239
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,904
I can see that, thank you...

240
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,310
What is she doing here?

241
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,668
Well hello there... It's nice to meet you...

242
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,179
My name is...

243
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:36,920
I see.

244
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:41,220
So Wannai, somebody you know from the
swim club is presenting at the Reach Assembly?

245
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,059
Yes...

246
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,841
We're here to help her set up her presentation.

247
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,098
Awatsuki and I volunteered to lend her
a hand since we're friends with her...

248
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:52,688
Kongo doesn't know her but selflessly came along, anyway.

249
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,426
It's nothing to fuss about, I assure you...

250
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:57,750
We'll be set up in a matter of moments...

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,898
I'm always happy to help those in need.

252
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:04,644
So, tell me, Misaka,

253
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,345
is this young lady tagging along
with you somebody's little sister?

254
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,453
Oh, no...

255
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,435
It's kind of a long story.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,070
Come here you two...

257
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:17,002
You need to meet this darling little
girl... Her name's Febri. Isn't that pretty?

258
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,871
We've only just met... but I can already
tell that we're going to be friends.

259
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:26,758
In that case, I know that we are going to
be the best of friends, as well, Febri...!

260
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,845
My name is Mitsuko Kongo...

261
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,716
It is such a pleasure to meet you... Truly!

262
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:34,235
It's really nice to meet you, too, Mitsuko.

263
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,362
Yet another friend...!

264
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:37,862
My list keeps growing!

265
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,390
Great... Now Kongo, too?

266
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,262
Nice to see everyone!

267
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,668
Have a great day!

268
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:45,886
Bye-bye!

269
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:49,012
Okay, you guys... We're headed off to our meeting now.

270
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,231
All right, sounds good.

271
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,070
We'll just have a look around the area.

272
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,346
This should give me the chance I need.

273
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,679
Let's see...

274
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,699
Just give me a minute...

275
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,634
I think it was...

276
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,304
This place is ridiculously spread out, huh?

277
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,196
Hey, before you go... tell me where the bathroom is.

278
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,148
Well, it's...

279
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,505
how about I just take you there?

280
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,973
Yeah, if you don't mind.

281
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:14,079
Ruiko?

282
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:16,904
It's all right, sweetie.

283
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:19,872
I'll be back in a minute. Until then...

284
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,397
Why don't you wait with Big Sister Mikoto?

285
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm giving you two a little time...

286
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:28,756
Have fun, okay?

287
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,332
Wait right there...! I'll be back!

288
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:37,259
Don't be gone long!

289
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,668
Of all the...

290
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,595
This campus is a big, sprawling mess...

291
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,887
We're gonna need a few more security personnel.

292
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,512
No... I'm totally sure.

293
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:50,429
This is where it's supposed to be delivered.

294
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,137
On paper, that may be true.

295
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,249
However...

296
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:55,741
we simply don't have the authority to receive it.

297
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,406
Is there some kind of problem here?

298
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,443
Apparently, this is a delivery for the assembly.

299
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,892
But the student who is supposed
to sign for it hasn't arrived yet.

300
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:08,067
This school is one of the regular assembly prize winners.

301
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,641
Yes, you're right. It is...

302
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:11,012
Most of the other regulars

303
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,595
haven't shown up this year, either.

304
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,620
Not here or at the other sites.
It's really kinda' strange.

305
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:16,208
Hmm...

306
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:17,454
Hey...

307
00:16:20,142 --> 00:16:21,304
What's the matter now?

308
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:22,393
It's just...

309
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:26,637
Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought I saw somebody
from one of the schools we were talking about.

310
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,114
Huh?

311
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,836
I have arrived at the site.

312
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,879
The package appears to have
been safely delivered, as well.

313
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,179
Roger that.

314
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,301
That's all for now.

315
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,142
I'll contact you again once I've located the target.

316
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:43,470
So, Febri...

317
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:44,845
you getting hungry at all?

318
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,014
Um-um.

319
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,179
Okay, then. Thirsty, maybe?

320
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:48,995
Uh-uh.

321
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:51,179
Hey, look over there, Febri!

322
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:53,304
Those flowers are beautiful, aren't they?

323
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,262
Why's Ruiko taking so long?

324
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:57,621
She's one tough customer...

325
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,440
and here I always thought I had a way with kids.

326
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:04,606
Mm-mm...

327
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,970
I am not going to let this discourage me...

328
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,564
I'm ready to make a sacrifice if necessary...

329
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,720
It's time to call in the super-rare,

330
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,815
one in every sixty cans... rainbow Gekota!

331
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:17,473
All right, check this out!

332
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:22,827
Oh, no!

333
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,589
Where is she?!

334
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:41,847
Ahh!

335
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:43,524
Aw, man.

336
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,873
Who knew having a job was so freaking exhausting?

337
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:49,556
Wow!

338
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,913
Well, aren't you just the cutest little thing?

339
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:55,793
Or not...

340
00:17:58,387 --> 00:17:59,412
Gekota...

341
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:10,678
I'm sorry!

342
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,946
I just took my eyes off her for a second!

343
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:14,148
It'll be all right.

344
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,899
She couldn't have gotten very far...

345
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,579
I'll start looking for her, too.

346
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:18,943
Great, thanks!

347
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:21,429
Hey, Febriiii!

348
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:29,827
Is something wrong?

349
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,264
Where are you...? Whee-hah...

350
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:37,700
Kuroko...

351
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:38,720
Mii...

352
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:39,866
Ruiko!

353
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,993
This is it. Target located.

354
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,056
There she is!

355
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,469
Erii...

356
00:18:58,327 --> 00:18:59,345
Mitsuko...

357
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,388
Febri!

358
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,704
Ah!

359
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,728
Ahhhhh... Ah!

360
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,638
That looked like...

361
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,789
Good, you're okay!

362
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:55,389
Uh?

363
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,127
Ruiko!

364
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:00,269
Heh.

365
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:03,339
Oh, well...

366
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,312
I'm just glad she's safe.

367
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,301
No doubt about it...

368
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:09,955
That's her.

369
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,036
So, it has been quite an eventful day.

370
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,637
I'm so glad that nothing bad happened to her.

371
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:19,449
It was my fault for not watching her more carefully.

372
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,511
I'm really, really sorry, Saten.

373
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,477
I should apologize, too.

374
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,095
Please forgive me.

375
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,325
Uh... for what?

376
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:28,762
Come on, now, Febri...

377
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:32,262
You made Big Sister Mikoto very
worried, running off like that.

378
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:33,891
You should say sorry, too.

379
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,539
It's okay.

380
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:47,932
I'm really sorry.

381
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,102
Hmm?

382
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:54,870
Thank you, Mikoto...!

383
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:55,752
Bye-bye now!

384
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:56,816
Ah!

385
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,216
Hey, you...! Get back here!

386
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,512
Ha, ha! No-oo!

387
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,429
I'm gonna get you!

388
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,179
I knew they'd be friends eventually.

389
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:09,179
They just needed a little while, that's all.

390
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,846
I am glad to see them enjoying themselves.

391
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:16,220
Seeing them together like that really does
make it worth all the trouble I had to go through.

392
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:17,590
Honestly, Kongo!

393
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,220
You're going to take all the credit?

394
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,887
That isn't very graceful of you.

395
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,154
Downright petty, in fact.

396
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,304
But I really was helpful this time, I swear!

397
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:25,554
You just didn't see, that's all.

398
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:26,572
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:27,970
I'm telling you, it's the complete truth!

400
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,177
Of course it is. I believe you.

401
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,807
Don't say it like that. I'm being serious!

402
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:36,954
As you know, there are only seven.
Level 5s here in Academy City...

403
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,529
and now, in addition to the fourth-ranked,

404
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,178
we'll be able to experiment
on the third-ranked, as well...

405
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,346
This is truly a stroke of good luck.

406
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:48,116
Well, in that case, I move we put it to a vote.

407
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,066
Let's see a show of hands...

408
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:53,222
Those in favor of conducting the experiment on Railgun?

409
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,274
And, of course, I am in favor, as well.

410
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,677
So, next time, Ruiko and Whee-hah

411
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,710
and Kuroko and Mikoto and...

412
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,095
Who thought letting her do the preview was a good idea?

413
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,857
She's still got a lollipop in her mouth!
