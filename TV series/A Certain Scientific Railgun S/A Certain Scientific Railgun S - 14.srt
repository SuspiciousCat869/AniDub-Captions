1
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:12,358
"How to shift experiment subject Accelerator to Level 6."

2
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:33,856
"Out of Academy City's seven Level 5 espers, it has
been determined that only Accelerator can reach Level 6.

3
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,663
"Project Radio Noise."

4
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,377
"Since that number of Railguns cannot be
produced, a different plan has been developed.

5
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,326
"Sissy" sounds more like a nickname for an upperclassman.

6
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,497
"We are her sisters," says Misaka in conclusion.

7
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:30,300
10032... Date: August the 21st. Time: Twenty-thirty hours.

8
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:13,350
A dangerous, intrusive person who likes to
do room inspections without prior warning.

9
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,446
A guy like this I can already tell.

10
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,376
A visitor to the dorms? That's unusual.

11
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,115
A way to force them to stop.

12
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,024
About all of your Sisters.

13
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,269
After all that.

14
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:05,112
After killing 20,000 Sisters in various
scenarios, Accelerator will achieve... Level 6.

15
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,823
After that number of victories,

16
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,204
All that is wishful thinking.

17
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,553
And it was all totally legal of course.

18
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,009
And now you know everything.

19
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,032
And that makes it my duty

20
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,277
And you're convinced that, if you die

21
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,608
And, if this plan fails them, too...

22
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:28,916
Answer me.

23
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:43,185
Anyway, what business do you have
with Sissy that brings you here so late?

24
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,112
Are you saying you have some other solution to offer?

25
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,576
Are you some kind of pervert?

26
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,654
As far as he knows,

27
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:14,805
At 02:23 on August the 20th. Test 10030.

28
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:35,852
Before it begins, I'm going to track down Accelerator
and fight him with every ounce of strength in my body.

29
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:08,313
Besides, when curfew hits, the
dorm security will be activated,

30
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:08,196
But I do know I can't afford to lose to you today!

31
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,287
But I'm not gonna let you just march off to your death.

32
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,941
But earlier today you said all
of this would be over for good.

33
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:46,085
But, if I was to be unceremoniously beaten on the
very first move, lying there, helpless and pathetic.

34
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:02,672
But, the way you've got it planned.

35
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,242
Calm down! It's all right.

36
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,438
Can you defeat him?

37
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:12,816
Come in.

38
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:44,574
Cut the crap.

39
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:45,411
Damn it!

40
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:55,819
Did you come to tell me how disgusted you are with me?

41
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,391
Do things your way, and you won't save anybody.

42
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,491
Do you know what Tree Diagram predicts?

43
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,132
Do you really think they'll be grateful to you?

44
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,850
Do you think I'm going to stand aside
just because you put your hands up?

45
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,035
Do you understand now?

46
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,745
Don't do this!

47
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,221
Don't just stand there calmly while you ruin all my plans!

48
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:24,701
Don't just stand there. Come into
the room, and close the door please.

49
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:53,517
Don't you see?

50
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,367
Even if he does know something,

51
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,828
Even if it isn't the truth.

52
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:58,274
Everyone has their own secret, special habits.

53
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,559
Evil and disgusting.

54
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,881
Fight me!

55
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:36,554
For her sake.

56
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,834
For instance.

57
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,284
From next door, maybe?

58
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:25,656
Get down there!

59
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:49,830
Good boy.

60
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,638
He is not going to approve of my plan.

61
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,355
He may not have all the facts,
but the outcome's the same, anyway.

62
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,735
He must have been captivated by
Sissy's beauty and followed her back here!

63
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,265
He'd kill you for sure!

64
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,367
He's probably come here to condemn me.

65
00:02:56,726 --> 00:03:00,086
He's the troglodyte I saw with
Sissy by the vending machine!

66
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,108
Heh.

67
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,482
Hello? Are you there?

68
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:03,896
Here we go again.

69
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:45,931
Here, kitty.

70
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:03,308
Hey! Did you hear that? It sounds like a patrol!

71
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:22,339
Hey, you know, if you guys share a room,

72
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:50,659
Hm...

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,847
Hold on, Railgun?

74
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,058
Honestly.

75
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,481
How about this.

76
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,859
How can you smile like that
after everything that's happened?

77
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,492
How could they do it?

78
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,891
How could they?

79
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:01,268
How many times have I tried to fry you now?

80
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:24,457
However the Misaka who died today was serial number 10031.

81
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,923
However, I am expecting her at any moment now.

82
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,772
However, what if I'm even worse than they expect me to be?

83
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,409
Huh?

84
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,263
Huh?

85
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,191
Huh?

86
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:19,992
Huh? I don't get it.

87
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:50,259
Huh? What are you doing on somebody else's bed?

88
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,103
I already said.

89
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,789
I apologize.

90
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:46,841
I blame myself.

91
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,024
I can do whatever I want, whenever I want.

92
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,092
I can't drag anybody else into this mess with me!

93
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,876
I can't take any other route than this.

94
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,863
I cannot just continue to ignore this.

95
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,855
I could actually make myself useful.

96
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:48,287
I didn't get to ask him anything.

97
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,698
I do not have time for this stupid charade!

98
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:46,641
I don't get it!

99
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,056
I don't have time for this.

100
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,284
I don't know if I have any chance of beating him,

101
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:43,123
I don't think I could do that. Not without her permission.

102
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,947
I guess I have the wrong room, I'm sorry!

103
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,647
I have already resolved not to
act on any information I may acquire.

104
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,916
I have the file.

105
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,807
I have to send you outside until she's gone.

106
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:37,117
I heard some unusual noises.

107
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,589
I know that face.

108
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,970
I know you have your own goals.

109
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,419
I know you've convinced yourself
you're doing the right thing here.

110
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,688
I know. I heard them, too.

111
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:16,333
I let him slide before because I thought he would be
a good example for Sissy of how useless boys truly are,

112
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,494
I live here with her. I'm Sissy's roommate.

113
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,565
I mean what I say!

114
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,812
I must stop this right now! If I breathe
in her scent for too long, I'll pass out.

115
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,226
I read all about the project.

116
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,850
I really can't stand those blimps.

117
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,792
I really hate this!

118
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,520
I refuse to fight you.

119
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,976
I saw to it that her previous roommate was reassigned

120
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,200
I take it Misaka's not home.

121
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:31,025
I think your heart may even
have stopped for a second there.

122
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,926
I told myself I was going to wait.

123
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,234
I told myself I would wait.

124
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,421
I was just thinking, "I'm glad I'm on her side."

125
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:01,518
I wish there was some way to know what I should do!

126
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,413
I won't fight you!

127
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,163
I won't fight.

128
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:51,206
I would hate for these mysterious noises to disturb her.

129
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:31,864
I'll do it. I will hurt you.

130
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,152
I'll fight him.

131
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:19,291
I'll stop the experiment and bring your sister back.

132
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,745
I'm a participant in the
experiment who volunteered her DNA.

133
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,868
I'm afraid it does not offer much in
the way of entertainment for guests.

134
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:39,047
I'm going to do whatever I have to, to stop this!

135
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,384
I'm here 'cause I'm concerned.

136
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:38,872
I'm not bluffing. I'll fry the
life out of you if I have to!

137
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:23,911
I'm not going to fight you.

138
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,374
I'm not moving.

139
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm still not sure what kind of power you used against me.

140
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,591
I'm trying to put a stop to them!

141
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,224
I've got an idea.

142
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:13,105
I've never been able to land an
attack on him like that before.

143
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,772
If I die tonight.

144
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:06,340
If my one life can save ten thousand of theirs,

145
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:08,400
If the head resident finds you here in this
room, it's going to mean big trouble for both of us!

146
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,233
If you don't want to fight,
then get the hell out of my way!

147
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,023
If you have something pressing to discuss
with her, I recommend you come in and wait.

148
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:48,604
If you want to stop me, then fight like a man!

149
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,422
If you're not going to move, I'll
happily shoot right through you.

150
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:08,919
If, for example, I lost the fight after the first move.

151
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:03,296
Impossible! He knows!

152
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,409
In fact, I'm actually a full year behind her.

153
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:18,646
Is Misaka there? This is Kamijo.

154
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:54,941
Is this stupid thing even working?

155
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,164
It didn't feel like it was negated like the other times.

156
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:59,298
It doesn't really matter what I try against
him, There's no way that I can win in a fair fight.

157
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,944
It felt like it went through him.

158
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,369
It is the truth.

159
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:12,686
It would be best if you avoided
raising your voice so loudly.

160
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:17,993
It's a cat.

161
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:26,778
It's her!

162
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,381
It's my fault.

163
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:15,135
It's not like some hero is going
to come dashing to the rescue.

164
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,503
It's not much, but maybe it's enough?

165
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:40,806
It's starting soon. I have to hurry.

166
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,227
Just a moment!

167
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,166
Just let me go.

168
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,060
Just standing.

169
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,746
Just who are you, anyway?

170
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:08,406
Just-Just a minute!

171
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,380
Let's say he was handily
defeated in a fight with a Level 0.

172
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,600
Like rats or guinea pigs.

173
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,537
Like you never secretly pressed
your lips to your crush's picture.

174
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,364
Mama isn't here now to make every little problem go away.

175
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,793
Maybe the researchers would see that
and begin to doubt the whole project.

176
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,828
Maybe they'd be forced to reconsider the simulations.

177
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,359
Maybe we'll both win.

178
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:30,092
Maybe you live in a world that's
full of happy endings for everybody!

179
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:04,775
Mine is seeing everybody get through this alive.

180
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,176
Misaka's asleep already?

181
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:12,971
No way.

182
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:09,363
No way.

183
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,633
No!

184
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:08,717
No, I haven't!

185
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,852
No, no, you are not mistaken.

186
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:32,521
No... I made up my mind.

187
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:39,926
Normally I'd kill someone for that.

188
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:38,148
Not only that, but you looked inside of my stuffed bear.

189
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,537
Nothing in there, either.

190
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,712
Now here I am.

191
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,045
Now take your idealism and stuff it.

192
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,121
Now, come on.

193
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,154
Of all places.

194
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,687
Oh, okay. Hello then.

195
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:23,055
Oh, really?

196
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:40,621
Oh, well.

197
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,627
Oh, whoops.

198
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,525
Oh. are you sure?

199
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,685
On August the 21st. Test 10031.

200
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,748
On second thought, you need not tell me.

201
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,345
On the other hand!

202
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,704
Ow! Hey! Cut it out!

203
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,750
Perhaps I can help you find what's causing them?

204
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,694
Perhaps the next floor up?

205
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:56,410
Please let me!

206
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:02,835
Please, help.

207
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,374
Programmed to control us.

208
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,134
Put the claws away!

209
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:01,884
Really it's not even a difficult decision to make.

210
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,849
Really, go ahead. The door is not locked.

211
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,808
Regardless of what Sissy might say.

212
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,681
Santa stopped making house calls a long time ago.

213
00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:36,956
Say what you want. I'm not moving.

214
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,822
Say you die and your Sisters all survive.

215
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,326
Saying nice things, trying to reassure me.

216
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,136
She knew about this.

217
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,263
She knew.

218
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,176
She knows about the existence of the clones.

219
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,196
She's catching up on her rest now.

220
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:10,319
She's in goodness knows how much trouble, and he
thinks he can just casually make an appearance like this!

221
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,016
She's not.

222
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,254
Shh!

223
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:18,716
Shut up, you fool.

224
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:42,918
Sissy.

225
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:07,713
So I...

226
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,558
So like I said, let's cut the crap.

227
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,786
So please, just go.

228
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,635
So that's it.

229
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:10,460
So you better be ready to fight for your life

230
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:21,749
So, by losing to him.

231
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:07,404
So, let's work together.

232
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,338
So, why are you here?

233
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,301
So, will you step aside?

234
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,274
So, you want to settle this by force, do you?

235
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,367
So, your name's Kamijo?

236
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,692
Somebody, help.

237
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,211
Stop crying.

238
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:38,952
Stupid monkey!

239
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,242
Stupid things.

240
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,858
Surely there's only one thing they could think.

241
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,905
That is odd, isn't it?

242
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,577
That means ten thousand Sisters get to live.

243
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:46,492
That one there's actually my bed.

244
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,879
That paper. How did you?

245
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,676
That something must've been wrong with Tree
Diagram's original programming. They'll stop.

246
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,472
That would be the best idea
if you do not wish to miss her.

247
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,564
That you'll be dead in 185 moves.

248
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,429
That's Zapper, isn't it?

249
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:24,018
That's a promise, okay?

250
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,281
That's impossible!

251
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,609
That's really creepy.

252
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,475
That's right.

253
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:31,306
That's too bad. Do it anyway!

254
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,870
That's what they refer to themselves as.

255
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,255
That's what you think?

256
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,288
The 7th Pharmaceutical Research Center.

257
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:03,255
The Tree Diagram satellite was actually attacked
from the ground and brought down a few weeks back.

258
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:48,917
The cost has already been too great!

259
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,638
The experiment's based on the supposition
that Accelerator's the strongest esper.

260
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,176
The experiment's basic premise would be flawed.

261
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:55,025
The experiments and everything.

262
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,597
The experiments.

263
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,272
The look on her face.

264
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:38,602
The optimal plan would involve creating one
hundred and twenty-eight different battlefields

265
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,586
The pathological analysis lab.

266
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,851
The prediction that I'd lose after
185 moves would be proved wrong.

267
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:23,367
The very fact that you're holding that file means

268
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,000
Their bodies are messed around
with for the sake of research.

269
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,829
Then why are...

270
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,689
Then you have no reason to worry.

271
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:56,090
Then...

272
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,475
There is no telling how long you'll be waiting for her.

273
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:24,755
There is the possibility that he
might know something about Sissy!

274
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,540
There isn't any wind.

275
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:26,346
There may well be something I
can do to help the situation.

276
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:19,704
There was something there.

277
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,822
There won't be any recalculations.

278
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,340
There's another experiment being held tonight.

279
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,495
There's no choice.

280
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,452
There's no room!

281
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,024
There's only one more thing I can think of to try.

282
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,536
They aren't stupid.

283
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,669
They compare themselves to laboratory
animals without so much as batting an eye.

284
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:10,056
They know exactly what it means
to be some scientist's lab rat.

285
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,162
They know, and still...

286
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,301
They may seem strange to other people, but
that doesn't make them wrong or perverted at all.

287
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,305
They wouldn't be able to.

288
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:18,008
They're in this situation because of me.

289
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:08,072
They're nothing but big computers.

290
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,326
Things will turn ugly if anybody outside hears you.

291
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:05,728
Think about it.

292
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,581
This doesn't have anything to do with you.

293
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:28,299
This is room 208, or is it?

294
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,694
This is something I have to do on my own!

295
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,897
This is the last time I'm gonna say it.

296
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:44,638
This isn't getting us anywhere. What, are you so
heartless you think since they're just a bunch of clones,

297
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,913
This plan involves the mass production of 'Sisters.'"

298
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,380
This room is primarily intended for sleeping in.

299
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,407
This whole project!

300
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,551
Uh, no thank you.

301
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:26,192
Uh, oh, right.

302
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:56,014
Uh-huh.

303
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:38,403
Uhh...

304
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,409
Um, maybe I should...

305
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,420
Um, yeah, hi.

306
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,647
Unless you want that, step aside!

307
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,694
Wait, what's Level 6? I've never heard of it.

308
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,514
We have no time!

309
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,928
We're talking about a guy so strong and arrogant

310
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,098
Well go ahead, then.

311
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,384
Well sure. She is older than I am.

312
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,242
Well then.

313
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,992
Well, I promise I don't deserve it.

314
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:23,321
Well, here's the thing.

315
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,842
Well, sorry, in a world like
that, there's no place for me!

316
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:07,922
Well, well, well.

317
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,945
Well, what if he's proven to be incredibly weak?

318
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,829
What are you saying?

319
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,655
What do you think you're doing?

320
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,925
What do you think you're doing?

321
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,246
What is going on with you?

322
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,898
What they're doing is crazy.

323
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,141
What're you?

324
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,981
What's it to you?

325
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,232
What's the deal with you tonight? I'm just...

326
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,863
What's wrong with them?

327
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:43,004
What, did he climb out? This isn't a jungle!

328
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:24,826
What?

329
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,448
Where are you going now?

330
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:09,172
Who's that?

331
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,434
Why are you doing this?

332
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,662
Why did it turn out like this?

333
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,644
Why isn't my power working?

334
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:49,922
Why shouldn't there be somebody else blaming me, too?

335
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,804
Why would you put yourself through this?

336
00:21:58,002 --> 00:21:59,007
Work with me.

337
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:57,101
Wouldn't they just do some
recalculations and start back up again?

338
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,622
Yeah, I didn't think so.

339
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,929
Yeah, okay.

340
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:39,833
Yeah. As far as the researchers are concerned.
Tree Diagram's projections are absolute.

341
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,991
Yeah. I know they're wrong.

342
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,176
Yes, she is.

343
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:13,353
Yes?

344
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,612
You are going to die tonight.

345
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,999
You came here looking for Sissy, correct?

346
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,886
You can fight, but do you really think you'll win?

347
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:17,542
You can open it from out there.

348
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:30,537
You can stop playing the noble idiot now!

349
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,523
You could be a detective.

350
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,424
You could easily have turned a blind
eye and pretended that you knew nothing.

351
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:22,826
You could have just continued living your normal life.

352
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,230
You don't know what you're talking about.

353
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:27,400
You don't mean...

354
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:27,342
You just have to hide underneath the bed!

355
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:49,731
You know these experiments are wrong, don't you?

356
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,727
You know what the Sisters say?

357
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,190
You know what?

358
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:16,912
You know, it's kinda nice to hear someone say that.

359
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,481
You look like hell.

360
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,524
You might as well have a seat over on the bed.

361
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,743
You must have realized it.

362
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:15,125
You only met my clone yesterday, and you already
got your hands on this top-secret information.

363
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:27,359
You plan to die.

364
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,932
You see, lately she hasn't been sleeping well at night.

365
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:20,583
You're an idiot.

366
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:55,294
You're here at an all-girls
dorm and you call me a pervert?

367
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,684
You're not coming home tonight, are you, Sissy?

368
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,617
You're out here, too. So why don't you
just mind your own business and leave me...

369
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,801
You're really a complete idiot, aren't you?

370
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:54,182
You're right.

371
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,342
and then I took her place.

372
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,089
and when they're used up, that's that.

373
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,479
and you will no longer be able to wait in the lobby.

374
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,049
because if you don't, you will die!

375
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,476
but I have to try. For their sake.

376
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,289
but this situation is swiftly becoming unacceptable!

377
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,341
doesn't that make the two of you classmates?

378
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:38,341
he wouldn't even break a sweat if he
had to defend himself from an entire army!

379
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,726
it is believed that Accelerator would advance to Level 6."

380
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,236
it's no big deal if they die?

381
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:07,884
or stole the seat from her bicycle to caress.

382
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:07,771
that's a good thing isn't it?

383
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,010
the entire project will come crashing to a halt?

384
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,459
to make sure the ones who are left survive.

385
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,379
upon which Railgun would be killed.

386
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,031
won't move.

387
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,373
you've been in my room without my permission.

388
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,094
you've got it all planned out, huh?
