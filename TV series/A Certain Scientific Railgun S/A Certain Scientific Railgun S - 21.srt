1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,465
Scientifically engineered...

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:04,896
Are you serious?!

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:06,445
Hm.

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:08,581
You mean that...

5
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,450
she's artificial...

6
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,832
made by a bunch of guys in lab coats?

7
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:13,658
More or less.

8
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:16,391
No way... You're joking!

9
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:19,117
I can't blame you for not believing. Most wouldn't...

10
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:23,117
Common sense seems to negate the
possibility from the very start...

11
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,258
However...

12
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:29,065
We humans aren't always good at knowing
the limits of common sense. Of all people...

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,264
I have to imagine you would understand.

14
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,659
I began my investigation by analyzing the
proteins of which Febri's body is composed...

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,367
It wasn't long before I realized that
they were not proteins that occur in nature.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,284
Lolly...

17
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:45,930
Would you like some, Gekota?

18
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:49,569
For her part, though, she seems unaware
that she's not just an ordinary person,

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,777
wandering through the city.

20
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,685
Of course, you can't tell just by looking at her.

21
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:58,476
Her body functions very similarly
to the way yours or mine does.

22
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,812
Except there is one problem.

23
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:05,659
Every time her body produces new cells to replace the old,

24
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:10,225
it involuntarily produces a certain
amount of toxin at the same time, as well.

25
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:11,632
Toxin?

26
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:12,346
Yes...

27
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:15,381
If left alone, it will accumulate in her body...

28
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,940
causing her internal organs to shut down...

29
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:19,633
and killing her.

30
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,216
You must be wrong...!

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,501
She's doing better now...

32
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,958
That's because of her candy.

33
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:27,867
A component within it neutralizes the toxin.

34
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:32,583
It is no exaggeration to say that it's those
suckers that are keeping her alive right now.

35
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:36,905
Without the lollipops, she dies...
is that what you're trying to tell me?

36
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,438
I'm telling you what I know.

37
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:41,355
Unfortunately, I can't fill in the details for you...

38
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:45,617
This could be a mistake made in the
lab or something deliberately built in.

39
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:46,930
But, either way...

40
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:51,083
If you want to find out how to keep
her body functioning as it should...

41
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,446
The best idea...

42
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,534
is to track down the people who
created her in the first place.

43
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:56,659
Who is that...?

44
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,025
Who are the people that created Febri?

45
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,659
And for what reason?!

46
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:04,562
Are the people who run this city
starting up another twisted experiment?!

47
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,877
I don't know whether this will help or not,

48
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:13,492
but a number of years ago, I heard some
rumors about a group that was looking into

49
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:16,003
scientifically recreating human life...

50
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:20,075
but the rumors evaporated, and I
can't say for sure what happened next.

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,263
So... she's a product of that research.

52
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,706
At the time, those sorts of experiments
were the province of the city's underworld.

53
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,470
Meaning?

54
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,400
There are some organizations in
the city that aren't above board.

55
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:37,432
They exist in the shadows, and are so
powerful that not even Antiskill can touch them.

56
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,175
In case you haven't noticed, I work for the underworld.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,049
Do you think this kind of child's play will get
you anywhere against the underworld of Academy City?

58
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:48,194
I assume you want to save the girl.

59
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:49,117
But if you do...

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,080
You had better be prepared to face
the darkness at the heart of this city.

61
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:57,227
Tell me. Is that something you think you're ready for?

62
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:32,179
Ge-ge-geko! My name is Gekota!

63
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,384
Oh, good. You're back...

64
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,254
What'd the doctor have to say?

65
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,788
Oh...

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,607
He says that there's nothing more to
worry about, and we can all get out of here.

67
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:44,549
Did he really?

68
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:46,041
Aw, that's wonderful!

69
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,916
So, are you ready to go home?

70
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,988
With you, Ruiko?

71
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:50,999
Yep...! And Uiharu.

72
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:51,634
Mm-Hmm!

73
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,004
Do we really think it's safe to go back to my dorm?

74
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,062
There could be another attack couldn't there?

75
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,172
That's a good point...

76
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,412
I'll get in touch with Antiskill.

77
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm sure they can step up some patrols.

78
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:04,749
Yeah... good idea.

79
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,100
That is a long time to spend in a hospital!

80
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,306
Are you hungry?

81
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,045
What would you like for breakfast?

82
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:16,416
A hamburger!

83
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,308
You've got a new favorite, don't you?

84
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,458
Sounds like it.

85
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,043
Out with it...

86
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,936
I know something's bothering you.

87
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,135
Uh, what?

88
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:27,148
You've looked pale ever since you
got back from talking to the doctor...

89
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,283
Something got to you. Something he said.

90
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,794
Uh, You... think I look pale?

91
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,163
A cat?

92
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,388
I wonder what it's doing here.

93
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:43,728
What's up?

94
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,708
Oh, uh... well... I... um...

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,013
I forgot to ask the doctor something,
so I'm going to head back there.

96
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:52,403
You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up, okay?

97
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:54,945
Now what are you hiding, sissy?

98
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,347
It's been a while since we've seen each other...

99
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,105
Is it okay for you to be out and about?

100
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,958
"I got permission from the doctor to go
out alone, so it shouldn't be a problem,"

101
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,373
Misaka says, providing explanation.

102
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:09,707
Oh, you did?

103
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,916
Well, that's good, then.

104
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:15,285
I spoke to that girl who came into
the hospital with you last night.

105
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:18,095
Huh? Are you talking about...

106
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,170
You mean Febri?

107
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,133
Yes.

108
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:25,017
I could not help but notice that you stayed up all
night, waiting to see the outcome of her treatment.

109
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,074
"She must be quite important to you..."

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,943
You haven't even visited your younger sister lately...

111
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:29,948
Hey, hold on...

112
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:33,663
and yet you waited for hours out of
concern "for this young girl... Right?"

113
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,653
Misaka asks with a pouty look and
a dejected slump of her shoulders.

114
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,845
You stop that right now...

115
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,860
It's not like she's more important to me or...

116
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,466
May I continue, please?

117
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,448
Late last night I had a look inside her room.

118
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:53,088
You have regained consciousness, I see.

119
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,239
Mikoto?

120
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,135
"Not her... Her younger sister...

121
00:06:57,435 --> 00:07:01,749
Or, more precisely, a cellular clone
synthetically created from her DNA map,"

122
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,354
says Misaka, politely introducing herself.

123
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,586
Oh, wow, really...?

124
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,889
Mikoto is your older sister?

125
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:09,779
Yes.

126
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,084
She is troublesome at times, but still...

127
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,673
Do you want to know something?

128
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,493
I have an older sister, too...

129
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,948
I'd like to see her.

130
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:21,347
She... has a sister?

131
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:23,659
If Febri was artificially created...

132
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:24,843
what does that mean?

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,988
Could her sister have been made in a laboratory, too?

134
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,364
"That is not all..."

135
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:32,143
Something else stood out when I was talking to the girl...

136
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:34,719
"See..." Misaka pauses for effect...

137
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,280
I sensed that all the knowledge she
possesses seems to adhere to a specific pattern,

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,194
one embedded at the most basic level.

139
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,616
Uh... What does that mean?

140
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,429
"It is something that Misaka has experienced.

141
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:50,210
Similar to the initial stage of
the Testament learning process,"

142
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,826
Misaka reports, observing a comparison.

143
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:55,735
"In Misaka's opinion..."

144
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,193
It is not unlikely that she received her knowledge

145
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,752
through the use of Testament...

146
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:03,613
In fact, considering all the
similarities in the underlying pattern,

147
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,126
it is highly probable that the Testament program

148
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,883
developed for the girl... was created by the
same individual who developed Misaka's program...

149
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,466
Says Misaka, expressing her conjecture.

150
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,221
Which would mean...

151
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,168
that she's involved...

152
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,972
I haven't seen her since it started.

153
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,849
Could she really have something to do with Febri?

154
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,153
Did she get involved with another screwed-up project?

155
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:27,901
I thought...

156
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,007
She was nice.

157
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,088
That other girl...

158
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:35,806
She showed Misaka what milk tea tasted like.

159
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:36,552
Huh?

160
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,009
"If it was possible, I would like to see her again...

161
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,296
to express gratitude... but...

162
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,373
That may never happen," Misaka says, resigned.

163
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:52,960
She may or may not be involved.

164
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,138
Right now I have to focus on the information I do have...

165
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,236
According to what Kongo said...

166
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,650
the people behind the robot attack were upset

167
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,966
because they had failed to "retrieve" Febri.

168
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,274
"Retrieve" implies getting her back.

169
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:09,151
Does that mean Febri could have
run away from them at some point?

170
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,528
Whatever the case, the best way to obtain more information

171
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,936
is to find out who these people
are and ask them some questions.

172
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,861
And if it turns out that the
underworld really is involved...

173
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,324
Then I can't drag Kuroko...

174
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,595
or any of the others into this.

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,815
I'll do it... alone.

176
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:32,509
Hello...?

177
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:33,844
Yeah...

178
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,696
Hey, Kongo. What's going on?

179
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,253
What's going on, you ask?

180
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,271
I've been on pins and needles about Febri

181
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,171
ever since I left you yesterday...

182
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,173
When I called the hospital
they said she'd been discharged.

183
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,384
Oh...

184
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:47,524
Right, sorry...

185
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:49,392
Mmm... She's fine now.

186
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:52,078
By the time we left, she'd even gotten her appetite back,

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,039
so there should be no cause for concern.

188
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,241
Well, that's terrific news!

189
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,410
I'll pass that message along to Awatsuki and Wannai.

190
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,199
Yeah... Please do.

191
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:02,923
Uh...

192
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,107
I actually feel pretty awful...

193
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm afraid in all the confusion,

194
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:08,285
I might have hurt their feelings.

195
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:08,856
Huh?

196
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,788
I told them everything that happened yesterday and...

197
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:15,467
well both of them felt really
horrible about not being there, too.

198
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:19,689
They said, "true friends are there for you
during the bad times as well as the good."

199
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,816
"That's what caring about someone means."

200
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:22,635
So...

201
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:25,994
They're right.

202
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:29,484
I thought about how I would
feel if things were reversed...

203
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,504
and, you know...

204
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:34,195
I think I would have been very sad
if I hadn't been able to help out.

205
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:38,340
So I feel really bad now for leaving
them out of the loop like I did.

206
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,982
Friendship is a very precious gift, isn't it?

207
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,303
Yes... yes, it is.

208
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,740
Well... I have to go.

209
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,967
Tell Wannai and Awatsuki hi for me, okay?

210
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:55,772
There you are.

211
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,276
Did you get the information you were after?

212
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:01,937
Huh...?

213
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:03,424
Oh... yeah...

214
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,360
All right then...

215
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,490
Are you ready to head back home?

216
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,117
If I'm gonna act on my own...

217
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,246
I'll need to be efficient about it.

218
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:19,416
First I'll search through all the
databases, keeping an eye out for leads.

219
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:23,799
They said, "true friends are there for you
during the bad times as well as the good,".

220
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,884
"That's what caring about someone means."

221
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:38,699
Hey, Sissy. You're going out again?

222
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:40,185
Oh, um... Yep...

223
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,314
There's something I need to take care of.

224
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,483
Okay, sure.

225
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,024
I'll be back sometime this evening.

226
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:49,424
Well... come home safely.

227
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:54,430
You know...

228
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,304
if you need assistance with anything,

229
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,223
no matter how big or small, I'm happy to help in any way.

230
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,110
Just ask me...

231
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,948
Whatever happens, I'm always here for you.

232
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,487
Is there something wrong?

233
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:13,521
I'm just being stubborn at this point, aren't I?

234
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,171
Sorry... What did you sa...

235
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,074
All right!

236
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,464
Well, here goes nothing.

237
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,351
I need to talk to you.

238
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:21,916
Huh?

239
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,278
Ah! Yes!

240
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,088
Hey, your towel, your towel!

241
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:29,812
Huh?!

242
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,262
Easy. Keep it down!

243
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:33,019
Oh... right, I'm sorry...

244
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,165
but... you're saying...

245
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,638
that Febri was artificially created?

246
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,953
Imagine if your life depended on eating a lollipop.

247
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,305
Whoever it was who made her in the first place...

248
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,021
did they intentionally build that dependence into her?

249
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,007
Probably.

250
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,246
They're beyond Antiskill's control?

251
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:54,291
Organizations like that really exist?

252
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,602
Well, yes... I think.

253
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,311
Do you have any idea who it could be?

254
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,171
It's possible...

255
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,022
There was this one time...

256
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:08,847
I got into it with some people who I
think were a part of the underground.

257
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,325
And they were extremely dangerous.

258
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,069
If we're really going to help Febri...

259
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,720
It'll mean taking serious risks
and exploring some shady places.

260
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,419
I want to make sure you understand that.

261
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,208
I hate the idea of putting you in harm's way.

262
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,806
And, honestly...

263
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,070
I don't know how well I can protect you...

264
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:28,576
With that in mind...

265
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:30,159
I understand if you don't want to...

266
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,790
First up, we somehow need to track
down the people who created Febri.

267
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:37,580
Kongo got a look at that guy, so we know
what at least one of them looks like, right?

268
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:38,852
That's a good point...

269
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:40,957
Let's fill her in and see if she'll help, too...

270
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:45,073
And we should check out the place we were
attacked to see if we can get any leads there.

271
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,792
It's entirely possible that the surveillance
cameras weren't working due to the construction.

272
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,898
I'll check to see if there are
any signs of a system break-in.

273
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:56,872
Also, we can't forget that Febri
needs those lollipops to stay healthy.

274
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,842
I wonder if we'd be able to make them ourselves somehow.

275
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,296
You're right, good thinking...

276
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,547
Do you think you could look into that
Saten, just to see what you can dig up?

277
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,294
And there is also the question of that powered suit.

278
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:10,790
I'll check with Antiskill to see if
they've been able to discover anything.

279
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,011
Right, that sounds good.

280
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:13,078
Now, what else...?

281
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:13,978
Everybody...

282
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:14,444
Hmm?

283
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,645
Misaka, you've been awfully quiet.

284
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,782
We could really use your help making plans.

285
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,640
It'll be best if we can strike first,

286
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,421
before they have another go at us.

287
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:28,049
Right.

288
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,040
That sure is pretty. What are you drawing there?

289
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:36,866
Gekota!

290
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,321
Yeah...? You're doing so well!

291
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,929
When I'm done with this then I'll draw you!

292
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:45,375
You will, huh...? That would be nice!

293
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,662
We really appreciate this, Konori.

294
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:50,228
It's great of you to keep an eye on Febri for us.

295
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,962
It's no problem... How's your work coming?

296
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:54,877
Have you found any promising leads?

297
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,545
From what I can tell so far,

298
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,256
there aren't any signs of intrusion into the system.

299
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,965
I think I'll widen the search parameters a little more.

300
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:03,258
That's an idea.

301
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,585
Look! All done!

302
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:05,816
Let me see.

303
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,139
Hi... I'm back.

304
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:12,586
Oh! How did it go?

305
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,174
You look beat!

306
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,305
Find anything out about the lollipops?

307
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,997
It's about what we were expecting:

308
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:22,441
"It would be an extremely difficult task
to analyze all the components of the candy,

309
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:26,028
and even if we succeeded there,
reproducing the exact formula

310
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,118
would be an even more impossible undertaking,"...

311
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:28,887
So he said.

312
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,724
Oh, that's a shame.

313
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,019
He did say he would get in touch

314
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,022
if he found out anything helpful, though.

315
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:37,509
Honestly, I'm not sure how
much faith I have in that guy...

316
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,464
A doctor just shouldn't look like Gekota.

317
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:43,015
Hey, now... be nice, Saten.

318
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,422
The powered suit from the alley?

319
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,481
Yes... There's something we
wanted to check. If we could...

320
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,618
Sorry, too late...

321
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:52,175
The item in question is no longer here.

322
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:56,330
Headquarters has taken over investigation of that case...

323
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,572
They left with all of the evidence
pertaining to it this morning...

324
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,890
They took those security robots along with them as well.

325
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:04,792
You mean the robots from the other day?

326
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:07,270
The ones that went out of control at the assembly site?

327
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,001
Yeah...

328
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:12,085
This isn't the first time HQ's
come barging in, guns blazing...

329
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,922
but they were pretty quick about it on this case.

330
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:20,706
Anyhow, I did get a preliminary look at
what little investigation has been done so far.

331
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,399
But I can't say there's much in the way of results.

332
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,562
The whole suit was a patchwork of unregistered parts...

333
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:29,247
and there weren't any solid
leads on its footprints, either.

334
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,494
That's disappointing.

335
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,909
I guess there's nothing we can do about it, though.

336
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,863
Well, thank you anyway.

337
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:35,641
See you.

338
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:44,289
Hey!

339
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:46,821
Take this with you.

340
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:48,402
Why, what is it?

341
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,610
It was lying inside the powered suit...

342
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,209
Who knows? It may be some kind of lead.

343
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,014
Are you sure about this?

344
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,371
If it's gonna be taken out of my hands anyway...

345
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,938
then it makes no difference to me
if it's you guys or HQ who has it.

346
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,315
With that said...

347
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,968
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

348
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,566
Hmm... What could it be?

349
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:12,443
Some kind of part that got detached, maybe?

350
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:15,510
It seems like they carted off
every other shred of evidence.

351
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:17,012
What good is this?

352
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,855
The timing is very strange.

353
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,874
I almost wonder if somebody is
putting pressure on Antiskill.

354
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:23,669
You mean like that shadowy organization

355
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,215
Misaka was talking about?

356
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,983
Maybe. I wish we knew something more about them, though.

357
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,829
Think hard, Febri... Can you remember anything?

358
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,132
Even the smallest thing could really help us out.

359
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:36,119
Hmm... Mm-mm.

360
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,367
That's okay.

361
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:39,956
How did the surveillance cameras pan out?

362
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,291
No luck there.

363
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,333
Right around the time it happened,
the cameras all went dark...

364
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,895
Every last one in the area showed an operational failure.

365
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,396
There's no way! Did you check all of them?

366
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,419
Of course...

367
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,483
The entire area must have
experienced some kind of interference.

368
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,291
That makes sense, if you think about it.

369
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,493
None of our phones were working... remember?

370
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,073
That definitely doesn't seem like a coincidence to me.

371
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:01,749
Oh!

372
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:02,607
What's wrong?

373
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:03,882
I was just thinking...

374
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,380
On that same day, not too far from where we were,

375
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,631
there was some trouble with the traffic signals.

376
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:11,490
Like the kind Konori asked us to help out with that time?

377
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,807
Oh, yeah! Do you think the two could be connected?

378
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:16,090
Not necessarily, but it's possible.

379
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,355
This seems like a lot of trouble to go through...

380
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,277
Just to track down a little girl?

381
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,343
Maybe there's more to their agenda than we realize.

382
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:29,658
We attempted to trace the path of
that creepy man from the other day,

383
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,369
but I'm afraid we have not made any progress.

384
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:33,218
I see.

385
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:36,032
Right... It was a long shot. Thank you.

386
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:39,073
We will continue to expand our search radius.

387
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:40,425
Be careful, though, okay?

388
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,822
Oh... what about the powered suit?

389
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,921
Have you found anything interesting there?

390
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:47,241
Well, Antiskill started looking into it...

391
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,743
but they didn't learn anything.

392
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,094
I'll see if I can find out something on my end.

393
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:53,295
Oh, yeah, didn't you know...?

394
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,743
My father's company has some research divisions

395
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,277
within Academy City that deal in powered suits.

396
00:18:58,824 --> 00:19:00,636
Great... That helps...

397
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:02,416
Okay, talk to you later.

398
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,618
Was that Kongo on the phone?

399
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:07,248
Yeah... It sounds like they've
still got some looking to do.

400
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,558
You know, I wonder...

401
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,991
What was this strange man doing
at the Reach Assembly location?

402
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:14,103
Well, he was looking for Febri, wasn't he?

403
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,184
Hmm...

404
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,236
We cannot allow Mitsuko Kongo to
outdo us in our search for the truth!

405
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:21,406
We must keep working!

406
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,780
Follow all avenues! Consider every possibility!

407
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:24,717
We'll keep at it!

408
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:26,902
I'll look into any blackouts that have occurred

409
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,357
anywhere in the city in the past couple of days.

410
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:30,674
I've got an idea...!

411
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:32,552
I'll go back to where we first found Feb...

412
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,531
Mikoto Misaka.

413
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,439
We never did figure out how Febri knew my name...

414
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,379
Somebody must have told her.

415
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:42,339
Somebody...

416
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,042
Was it her?

417
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:49,403
But... if it was... Why?

418
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:54,487
We have taken the necessary measures with Antiskill.

419
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:58,309
I doubt they'll be able to uncover
anything, the bumbling fools...

420
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,454
still... we can't be too careful.

421
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,935
We don't want them snooping
right before the Reach Assembly.

422
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,818
It's too important to our plans.

423
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,028
We're sure about allowing Febri
to remain out of our control?

424
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,612
We took a vote yesterday.

425
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,166
I thought we had settled the matter.

426
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,295
Just confirming...

427
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:17,313
We can all agree that we don't want
anything interfering with our big moment.

428
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,465
No need to worry.

429
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,240
Febri will die before the assembly...

430
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:23,217
She's a back up, after all, and imminently expendable.

431
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:25,562
The Reach Assembly is almost at hand...

432
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:28,039
We need to be sure that everything is ready.

433
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,184
So, is it?

434
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:32,512
Well, people, have we overlooked anything?

435
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:35,283
Oh, no... Not a chance.

436
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,739
Right, Nunotaba?

437
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,107
All of the pieces are in place.

438
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,164
I will do everything I can.

439
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:48,059
Looks like Little Miss Condescension got
herself expelled from Nagatenjoki Academy.

440
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,761
I can't find any trail on her since then.

441
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,120
And that means...

442
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,607
I've got just one avenue left.

443
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,094
Hmm...

444
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:02,465
I've performed an analysis on the
fiber from the capsule you brought me...

445
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:07,036
And, interestingly enough, it seems to be
made of the exact same components as those

446
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,666
that comprise the girl Febri's body.

447
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,173
To put it more simply... This is a hair.

448
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:14,739
Hair? One of Febri's, then?

449
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,241
No, it isn't.

450
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,426
This belongs to a different individual.

451
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:20,856
Somebody else?

452
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,104
Maybe... her sister?

453
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,441
Actually, I'm glad you came by.

454
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:27,340
There's something I wanted to discuss with you.

455
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,570
I took a closer look at the
candy young Febri's been carrying.

456
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:34,665
Considering the number of lollipops she has remaining,

457
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:39,034
I believe her situation is more urgent
than I had originally estimated it to be.

458
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,290
Urgent how?

459
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,102
Roughly seventy-two hours.

460
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:46,654
That is how long I believe her current store will last.

461
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,465
When they're gone, she'll die.

462
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,165
Oh, no...

463
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,580
Isn't there something you can do?!

464
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,415
It's like I told you before,

465
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:58,262
if there is anyone who can save the
girl, it's the one who created her.

466
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,374
That's your only real hope, I'm afraid.

467
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:04,371
Where are you planning to go?

468
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:05,412
Everywhere!

469
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:07,385
Anywhere I have to!

470
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:10,742
One way or another we're going
to find the monsters who did this!

471
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,126
You don't even know where to start.

472
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,968
I... have no choice.

473
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:17,925
I will ask you once again...

474
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:21,605
Are you ready to face the darkness
at the heart of Academy City?

475
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,218
It will be dangerous...

476
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:27,944
You could very easily end up getting hurt, yourself.

477
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,086
If it'll save her...

478
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,670
I'll do whatever it takes.

479
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:38,789
The quickest way to find out about the underworld
is to ask someone who has connections within it.

480
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,243
If that is what you want...

481
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,096
I will arrange a meeting.

482
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,133
There is something you should be aware of before you go.

483
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,019
The person you are meeting...
