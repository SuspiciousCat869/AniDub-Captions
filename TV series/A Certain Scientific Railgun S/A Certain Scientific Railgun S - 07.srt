1
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,366
This time at night?

2
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:14,667
What's going on?

3
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:19,094
I'm sorry... There's been a fire in
the first wing of the DNA map analysis lab

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,387
that's attached to Shiname Uni...

5
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,040
The cause and the level of damage?

6
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,836
Still under investigation.

7
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,246
Sir! Bad news!

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,712
There's a fire at the lab!

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,809
At the DNA map analysis lab, yes I already heard about it.

10
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,939
No, another lab!

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,725
Huh?

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,180
Hm...

13
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,517
The research data at Rangaku Medical Labs is gone?

14
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:40,765
Bio-labs' system is down!

15
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,592
Can you hear me? Is anyone there?

16
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,056
I can't get through to School
District Three's Thought Labs.

17
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,464
Excuse me, I'm sorry...

18
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:50,953
There are fires in Shiname's
second, third, and fifth wings, too.

19
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,033
What is this?

20
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:54,741
An organized terrorist attack.

21
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:57,386
What method are the terrorists using?

22
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:59,928
There are no signs of attack from the outside...

23
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,422
And no witness reports of intruders.

24
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:05,260
It appears... the equipment just exploded.

25
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:06,379
Hmm.

26
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:08,763
New information!

27
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:11,781
The attacks are coming via the communications lines!

28
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:13,386
We can defend against that.

29
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,357
Block all external communications.

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,945
Uh... yes, sir!

31
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:22,190
They're onto me, huh?

32
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:27,736
Uiharu would have done a better job at
hacking these guys if she had been here.

33
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:36,403
But still, that should more or less
take out seventy percent of the operation.

34
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:41,345
Now I just have to get out there and take
care of the rest of the labs more directly.

35
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,271
Again, Sissy?

36
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,824
I've got to keep going.

37
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,209
At this moment, while I sit here,

38
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,766
they could have another experiment underway.

39
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,539
I can't afford to collapse...

40
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,201
At least, not before the project does.

41
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,274
Oh... Head Resident!

42
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:10,334
What are you up to Shirai?

43
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:12,533
You're acting downright suspicious.

44
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:13,068
Me?

45
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,814
I don't know what you mean. I'm not doing anything...

46
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,200
That's even more suspicious.

47
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,366
Well, see you later!

48
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,080
Huh? Ah!

49
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,279
Sissy!

50
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,344
You're actually home! I can't believe it!

51
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,132
What's wrong?

52
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,476
I'm allowed to be in my own room, aren't I?

53
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:34,430
Well...

54
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,478
I mean, yes, of course you are...

55
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:38,100
but it's just that...

56
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,094
you never made it home yesterday.

57
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,557
I had some things to take care of.

58
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,011
Okay...

59
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,030
Well, you're here right in time.

60
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:47,500
Huh?

61
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:48,698
Ta-da!

62
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,274
It's Anshindo's special,
limited-time-only sweet-treat summer buns!

63
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:56,501
Remember, you were talking about
how much you wanted some, so I went...

64
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,059
That's okay, thanks. I'm not hungry right now.

65
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,163
In a little bit, then?

66
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,955
Sorry... I'm heading out again.

67
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,536
You are?

68
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:10,492
But what happens if the head resident
does another one of her surprise room checks?

69
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:13,799
Well, if that happens, you can just
trick her again for me, can't you?

70
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,370
Wait, Sissy!

71
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:26,303
Whatever you're involved in, it's obviously serious...

72
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,480
and something you want to keep hidden...

73
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,982
even from me...

74
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,939
Don't you know I want to be there for you?

75
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:44,536
Oooh, yummy!

76
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,131
Anshindo's sweet-treat summer buns!

77
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,094
These are super rare, limited-time-only products!

78
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,664
Oh, yeah?

79
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,751
Oh my gosh they look so delicious!

80
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,226
Is one for me?

81
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,978
Well, um... it's just...

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,065
Hmm?

83
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,593
You're both welcome to have some.

84
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,857
Really?

85
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,906
But... wait...

86
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:06,410
You had some of these yesterday, too...

87
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:08,844
You said you were going to bring them home to Misaka.

88
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,064
Are these the same ones?

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes, well...

90
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,044
Apparently she wasn't in the mood for sweets yesterday.

91
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:19,114
But... that aside, she seemed to be doing
fine, so there's nothing to be worried about.

92
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,261
Oh, Wow!

93
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:25,057
I would recognize those anywhere!

94
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:29,449
But those are hard to come by! Did
somebody hear me saying how much I wanted one?

95
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,840
That's so considerate!

96
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,997
Why don't you have some with us, Shirai?

97
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:36,823
No, thank you, I'm okay.

98
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:39,413
Huh?

99
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,159
Oh, don't be like that!

100
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,839
I'll make some of the special tea I've been saving, too.

101
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:50,589
Mmm, these are so good!

102
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,766
You can tell they were made by a well-established shop.

103
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,269
Possible arson you said?

104
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:54,970
Yeah...

105
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,375
There's been a whole series of unexplained fires...

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,537
They've occurred in research facilities all over...

107
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:04,686
We haven't received any requests for assistance
from them, and it doesn't seem to be too serious.

108
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,477
I wonder what's going on.

109
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,827
I would put my money on a bunch of false alarms.

110
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:11,531
Ah!

111
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,163
I know I had one left!

112
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,282
You ate it, didn't you Saten?

113
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,127
How could I not when you left it wide open like that?

114
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:20,020
That was a mean thing to do!

115
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm heading out...

116
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:24,247
I think I'll patrol for a bit.

117
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,295
Maybe they haven't asked for our assistance.

118
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,246
But that doesn't change the fact that arson is involved.

119
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,453
I guess if something serious did happen, we'd be too late.

120
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,724
My thoughts exactly.

121
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:37,290
So I think we should increase patrols from now on.

122
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,732
Nothing out of the ordinary so far in this district...

123
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:49,819
Huh?

124
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,678
Oh, come on, are you really sure?

125
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,369
I'm really, really sure.

126
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,510
Yeah? That can't be true.

127
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:57,923
Well, it totally is!

128
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:05,615
I'm not being vigilant enough.

129
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:09,613
At this rate I'm not going to
be any help to Sissy whatsoever.

130
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,190
Hey!

131
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,462
This is one, right?

132
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,021
Oh, wow! You really found one, Minori!

133
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,532
Okay, so, what's the number?

134
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,135
Gimme a sec...

135
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:19,852
You there. Kids.

136
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,473
What are you doing hanging out in a back alley?

137
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,277
Well, ya see...

138
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,602
Looking for lucky cards?

139
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,994
You mean like that Money Card you've got there?

140
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:29,528
Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,920
Except it looks like this one's a miss.

142
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,816
A miss?

143
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:33,652
Look...

144
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,297
It's got a code on the front.

145
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,355
You want one with a code that has a repeating number...

146
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,167
Find one, and it means you're lucky.

147
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,416
One with three sevens in a row is the best you can get...

148
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,632
It will grant whatever wish you make.

149
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,691
They say one person who found one became a billionaire!

150
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:49,842
So that's it.

151
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:54,897
An urban legend that grew out of the Money
Card craziness that went on a little while ago.

152
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,286
Huh? But how come?

153
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,521
Why... we aren't hurting anyone.

154
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:03,684
You might get hurt. This area
can be dangerous. Do you understand?

155
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,911
Get back to your dormitories, all of you.

156
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,443
Aw, no fair!

157
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,411
Also, as a member of Judgment,

158
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:13,298
it is my responsibility to take
custody of this abandoned Money Card.

159
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:14,292
Huh?!

160
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,722
Aw, man. Can she really do that?

161
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,304
I'm tired anyway.

162
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:23,219
Hey! Minori!

163
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:28,815
Sorry! I'm coming.

164
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,125
What were you doing?

165
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,482
Oh... nothing.

166
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:35,956
Really?

167
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,119
And this happened earlier today?

168
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:38,768
Yeah.

169
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:43,281
Money Cards with lucky numbers on them.
What a funny thing for an urban legend, huh?

170
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:45,228
Almost childishly adorable.

171
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,129
"Childishly adorable"?

172
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,803
That's rich coming from somebody in that underwear!

173
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:55,317
It may start out as a cute little urban legend.

174
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,661
But when people get caught up in something
like that, bad things can happen unexpectedly...

175
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,434
Accidents. Fights, maybe.

176
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,219
And let's not forget the suspicious fires, either.

177
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,607
We should all be more watchful.

178
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,826
Fine. It's still a cool rumor, though...

179
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:13,019
If I got my hands on a lucky card...

180
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:14,363
what would I do?

181
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:18,928
There are so many things to wish
for! I can't possibly make up my mind!

182
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,503
And there you go again...

183
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,674
What about you, Shirai? What would you do?

184
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,136
Huh? What're you talking about?

185
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:29,027
If you found a lucky card that
would grant you any wish at all,

186
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,212
what would you want?

187
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,532
What would I wish for?

188
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,801
Huh. What ridiculous, unscientific nonsense...

189
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,398
This is Academy City we're living in, you know!

190
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,390
Regarding the other facility that was attacked last night,

191
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:49,676
we investigated.

192
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,317
And we found that somebody physically
broke in and wrecked the place.

193
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,813
There were no human casualties... however...

194
00:10:57,482 --> 00:11:00,403
most of the data and equipment
there were completely destroyed.

195
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,329
At each facility, the locks
were deactivated from the outside.

196
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,585
None of the infrared security sensors were triggered.

197
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:10,389
And the cameras...

198
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:12,455
none of them recorded the attackers.

199
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,013
Also, and this is strange...

200
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,721
while the incidents were occurring,

201
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:20,281
the nearby wind turbines
rotated in the opposite direction.

202
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,346
Hm. Interesting.

203
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:26,534
This business with the wind turbines...

204
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,179
That could be caused by electromagnetic interference.

205
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:29,964
Uh-huh...

206
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,184
If she is the culprit, all of our standard
security measures are indeed useless...

207
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:39,707
What's more, we don't currently have the force
we'd need to stop her once she's gained access.

208
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:40,718
But sir...

209
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,718
If this keeps up, the experiment...

210
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,572
...will be shut down. Eh?

211
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,558
Sissy! Be still, my beating heart!

212
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,922
You look so sweetly vulnerable like that!

213
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,773
Almost as if you were asking
me to sleep there next to you.

214
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:12,191
How many days? How long has it been...

215
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:16,036
Since I've gotten to sit this close
and just look at your lovely face...

216
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:29,076
Well...

217
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:34,018
If you found a lucky card that would grant
you any wish at all, what would you want?

218
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,352
There couldn't be an easier question to answer...

219
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,204
I would want...

220
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,833
I would want to be able to help you, Sissy.

221
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:58,186
Good morning, Sissy. Did you sleep well last night?

222
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,246
I'll just go out there and do my best!

223
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,040
Nothing here...

224
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:21,508
Aww...

225
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,278
Nothing here, either.

226
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:32,080
Wha-I thought that...?

227
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,844
But I could've sworn I saw...

228
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,135
Honestly! Weren't you even look...

229
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,058
You're the kid I talked to yesterday...

230
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,164
Are you still chasing that rumor about lucky cards?

231
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,286
No way, it's not like that!

232
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:49,816
Uh... I mean, I guess it kind of is...

233
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,793
but it isn't.

234
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,469
It's just... well, uh... you know...

235
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,995
I get it now.

236
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,274
You want to find one of these lucky cards
so you can give it to a friend of yours.

237
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,944
It's a generous thought...

238
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,105
But ultimately, it doesn't matter what your motive is...

239
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,925
What you're doing is still reckless.

240
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,250
I know...

241
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,967
But pretty soon I won't get to see her anymore.

242
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,731
She told me that she's moving...

243
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,932
Her parents decided, and there's
nothing she can do about it.

244
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:24,350
No matter what, I have to give her a
going away present before she leaves.

245
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,386
We've been friends a long time...

246
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,753
She's really nice...

247
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:31,111
and we hang out together almost every day.

248
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,876
So... I just want to...

249
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,797
Here, use this.

250
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:45,944
Oh sorry, thank you.

251
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,367
She's a really good friend...

252
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,414
isn't she?

253
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:50,647
Mm!

254
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,224
Hey, how far are you gonna make us go?

255
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,821
Have some faith in my instincts, will you?

256
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,236
It's nearby...

257
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:02,050
The lucky card's here somewhere, I can tell.

258
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,956
Let's give up already!

259
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,994
Over there!

260
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:07,418
Oh, wait... Huh?

261
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,571
Oh, uh, hey, Shirai.

262
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,121
What are you doing there?

263
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,421
That's how you're going to find it? Really?

264
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,756
Just give it a little time, and you'll see...

265
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:27,791
The nose knows, I'm telling you.

266
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,118
Now... Why don't you come give me a hand?

267
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,237
Okay...

268
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,697
What are they doing? They look ridiculous.

269
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:40,581
For the record, I was patrolling
like a good Judgment officer...

270
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,717
Despite how it may have appeared.

271
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,928
I am surprised, though.

272
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:47,587
Huh?

273
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:51,243
I just wouldn't expect you to help
someone who's hunting for a Money Card.

274
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:52,828
I wouldn't say I was helping...

275
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:56,611
I was just looking out for her... making
sure she didn't get into any trouble.

276
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:59,696
I wasn't doing any more than my Judgment duties require.

277
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,023
Uh-huh...

278
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,725
Wow, Shirai, you might be the worst liar I ever met.

279
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,817
It's obvious that you're doing
this because you want to help her...

280
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,828
So, you were saying?

281
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,551
Oh, nothing at all...

282
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,006
But... what are we going to do?

283
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:16,977
Do about what?

284
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:21,536
If we really do come across a lucky
card, it's still classified as a lost item...

285
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:23,706
so it can't just be given away.

286
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,466
I don't see how we can make it work.

287
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,055
Oh... hey, you guys.

288
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,346
So what in the world are you two doing down there?

289
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,017
Hmm, that is complicated.

290
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:43,553
Obviously, as members of
Judgment, we can't turn a blind eye.

291
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,189
We have standards to maintain...

292
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:46,356
But, still...

293
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,273
Hmm. It's true. A lost item is a lost item...

294
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,428
This could be kinda hard to swing.

295
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:52,847
Impossible, maybe.

296
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,738
Ah! That's it!

297
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,744
I just had a fantastic idea!

298
00:16:58,044 --> 00:16:59,815
Hey, you two... Listen up!

299
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,176
So, um, what exactly is this good idea?

300
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,473
You just leave everything to me.

301
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,768
Uh...

302
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,201
Well, here we are.

303
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,244
When it comes to things like this,

304
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,935
I think the lower tech, the better.

305
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,011
Though... it's a bit cliché.

306
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,629
Ooh! I love clichés!

307
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,434
Konori's gonna save the day!

308
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,603
What do you mean? What's happening?

309
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,374
What's happening? We're searching, that's what.

310
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:26,097
Huh?

311
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,235
We're looking for something lucky!

312
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,094
A four-leaf clover!

313
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,446
Here we go!

314
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,585
Hey! Wait for me!

315
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,492
Huh? Wait...

316
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,112
Hold on a second, will ya?

317
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:43,116
You mean we're gonna search this
entire place? We're going to try.

318
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:43,887
Huh?!

319
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:46,992
You never know what you can accomplish until you try...

320
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,258
Okay? Give it all you've got and in
the end, you won't have any regrets.

321
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,591
Nothing... nothing...

322
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,729
Nothing here, either.

323
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:08,968
Yep, it's like they always say...

324
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:11,494
Happiness isn't an easy thing to find.

325
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,337
Oh, please! Don't say that...

326
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
You just have to know where to
look, isn't that right, Shirai?

327
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:17,856
I'm not so sure about that.

328
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:18,326
Huh?

329
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,475
Hey you guys, look what I found!

330
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:26,400
What is it? Did you already find a four leaf clover?

331
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:27,892
No, not that.

332
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:31,747
A butterfly!

333
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:40,860
Oh! There's another one!

334
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,458
How sweet! Those two must be friends!

335
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,214
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

336
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,051
Being able to connect like that...

337
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,315
Being so close to each other
without even needing to speak.

338
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,216
Your efforts don't go unnoticed, Shirai.

339
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,125
They definitely get through to Misaka...

340
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,511
So don't worry.

341
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:04,009
Uh... What are you talking about?

342
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:05,786
Why would I be worried?

343
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:07,608
And it isn't just Misaka, either.

344
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,459
We appreciate it, too.

345
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:10,102
Yep.

346
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:11,192
Uh...

347
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:16,030
You know, you don't have to do everything by yourself.

348
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,930
That's right. We're here for
you whenever you need us, okay?

349
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,119
Uh... what's wrong? Was it something we said?

350
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,540
We're just trying to cheer you up...

351
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,303
I actually found one!

352
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:36,910
Ah! It's a four-leaf clover!

353
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:39,365
Amazing! I thought it was gonna be impossible!

354
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,078
I'm surprised I saw it, though.
It's a bit on the small side.

355
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,293
Small or not, it's still fantastic.

356
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:45,993
Hey... Minori!

357
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,053
Over here...

358
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:47,963
Found one!

359
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,377
Look! Look! Look!

360
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,475
There are a whole bunch of them growing right here!

361
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, wow, you got one!

362
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:54,953
Good for you!

363
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,096
Here's another!

364
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:57,757
That's quite a haul.

365
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:13,671
Oh, you're getting dressed...

366
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,094
Are you heading out again?

367
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:15,951
Mm-hmm.

368
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,802
I have some things to do.

369
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:23,570
Sissy, wait!

370
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:24,889
Hmm?

371
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:26,192
Um...

372
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,377
It's just...

373
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,654
Come back safely, okay?

374
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,276
Well, I'm off.

375
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:49,686
Kuroko...

376
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:53,094
Thank you.

377
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,139
Sure.

378
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:08,937
I'll be here.

379
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,344
Waiting for you to come home.

380
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:15,698
Good luck, Sissy.

381
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:11,565
Sir, there's been another attack!

382
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,511
That's the third facility tonight!

383
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:14,987
Hm.

384
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,926
One more down.

385
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:25,706
So, that means...

386
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:27,263
There's only...

387
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:30,463
two to go!

388
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:34,588
A clover that makes wishes come true?

389
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,146
I only have one wish...

390
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:37,845
and when you walk back through the door,

391
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,690
that wish will come true... I believe in you, Sissy.
