1
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,375
I'm home, Mikoto.

2
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,225
What's the matter, dear?

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,489
Why are you crying?

4
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:18,304
Oh, a boo-boo!

5
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,554
Now, now, it'll be all right.

6
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:22,269
Really?

7
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,137
You just be a good girl, and it
will be fixed up, as good as new.

8
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,703
How's that gonna happen?

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,925
Ooh, I know!

10
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,342
Is Santa gonna come and make it all better?

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,931
Heh, heh, heh. Santa?

12
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,481
In the middle of spring?

13
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,705
Yep... that's right...

14
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,825
The old fellow is a friend of
mine, so I'll see what I can do.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,147
You know Santa?!

16
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,179
Sure!

17
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:47,025
Now, close those eyes and get some sleep, okay?

18
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:11,547
There...

19
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:12,975
breakfast is served.

20
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:13,864
Mama!

21
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:18,018
Look, Mama! All better!

22
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:20,260
See? Just like you told me!

23
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:20,959
That's right...

24
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:23,063
Life was so much simpler as a child...

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,114
Whenever something went wrong,
Mama would fix it while I slept.

26
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,258
Like magic.

27
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:29,999
If only the experiment...

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,849
and everything that's happened...

29
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,066
could just be a bad dream...

30
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,235
Something that vanished...

31
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,072
evaporated when I opened my eyes.

32
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:46,210
Isn't it a beautiful morning, Sissy?!

33
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:49,257
Oh, I just want a moment to
savor this before getting punched.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,778
Hey... Good morning.

35
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:01,819
It is a nice day today.

36
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:04,870
But I haven't been dreaming.

37
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,604
Mama isn't here now to make every little problem go away.

38
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,654
Santa stopped making house calls a long time ago.

39
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:18,853
And no hero is going to come
dashing to the rescue, either.

40
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,991
Are you going out again today?

41
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,128
Yeah.

42
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,160
Just once more.

43
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,959
Then it should all be over.

44
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:28,275
Huh?

45
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:33,336
Today...

46
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,492
Today is the day...

47
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,510
I'm ending this.

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,492
It's almost time now.

49
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,672
Sorry, guys.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,032
Maybe someday you'll forgive me...

51
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,558
Maybe someday you'll understand.

52
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,409
Tree Diagram...

53
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,436
The greatest supercomputer in the world.

54
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,287
Loaded aboard the satellite Orihime I

55
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:55,348
and launched into space by Academy City under the
pretense that it would be analyzing climate data.

56
00:04:56,196 --> 00:05:00,330
Every few weeks, it projects the movement of
all the particles in the Earth's atmosphere,

57
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,174
predicting the weather for the entire month in one go...

58
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:09,221
The rest of the time, it performs calculations for
all sorts of Academy City-based research projects.

59
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,089
Also...

60
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:16,849
It is the simulator that's directing the
creation and slaughter of twenty thousand clones.

61
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:21,544
Hey.

62
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,587
Remedial lessons for you too, huh...?

63
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,209
What class did you fail, Zapper?

64
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:27,956
Oh, hey... It's you again.

65
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:30,489
My name's Mikoto Misaka, not Zapper.

66
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,367
I'm really tired, and there are some
things I need to save my strength for today...

67
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,945
So I'm just going to skip the part where I zap you.

68
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,022
Oh, so you can say "zap," but I can't?

69
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:40,238
Never mind...

70
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:42,359
Your sister's not with you today?

71
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:47,205
I just wanted to thank her for helping
me carry all those drinks home yesterday.

72
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:47,983
Hold on...!

73
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,692
You mean you saw her again?

74
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,473
Uh, yeah... I saw her.

75
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:53,394
What for?

76
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,303
What do you mean, "what for?"...

77
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,184
I just ran into her, that's all.

78
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,800
Another sun again tomorrow!

79
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:03,903
Stupid things...

80
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,842
I really can't stand those blimps.

81
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,800
What's wrong with them?

82
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,185
They're nothing but big computers.

83
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,458
Programmed to control us.

84
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:18,246
For now.

85
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:21,201
But Tree Diagram's reign is about to end...

86
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,140
I'm destroying that machine.

87
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:25,093
Uh... Hey!

88
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:26,112
Today!

89
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,114
What is the deal with that girl?

90
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:35,566
I mean, jeez!

91
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:37,481
Is she always so high-strung?

92
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,306
Eh?

93
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,068
Hey, Zapper.

94
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,007
You were just over there, weren't you?

95
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,703
"Since Misaka's name is obviously not Zapper...

96
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,515
I can only assume that you are referring to the cat,"

97
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,279
Misaka tells the rude boy.

98
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,575
Oh, sorry. You're the sister, huh...

99
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:01,665
Without the goggles, there's no way to tell you two apart.

100
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:06,393
Oh, by the way... thank you for yesterday.

101
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:11,644
"Your words of gratitude are noted, but they
were not my objective," replies Misaka honestly.

102
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,820
"I removed the goggles because I needed to feed the cat,

103
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:20,034
and previous experience has taught me that they are
disturbed by reflective surfaces, such as lenses,"...

104
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:22,266
Misaka explains her wardrobe change.

105
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,203
Yeah, cats are like that...

106
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,658
So... Why put them back on, then?

107
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:31,760
"Because it was no longer necessary to
have them off. See?" asks Misaka patiently.

108
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:32,982
Okay...

109
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,320
so you fed him already?

110
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,009
No, I haven't fed him.

111
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:37,814
Uh...

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,935
then why did you put the goggles back on?

113
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:44,998
Well?

114
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,874
"The reason behind that action is unimportant,"

115
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,162
Misaka says, refusing to explain.

116
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,360
Huh?

117
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:54,797
Ah, I get it...

118
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,543
You didn't want anybody seeing your sweet side, did you?

119
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:00,043
No.

120
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,879
It is not that, exactly.

121
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,842
Fine, I give. What is it?

122
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:07,371
Hello!

123
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,037
"I refuse to answer that,"

124
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,460
Misaka states, making herself quite clear.

125
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,243
Well... all right, if you say so.

126
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,330
See you later.

127
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,872
"Hold on a moment,"

128
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,298
Misaka says, instructing you to stop walking.

129
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,909
Just tell me what the deal is, will ya?

130
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,446
"You were going to leave...

131
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,734
You were going to abandon this creature.

132
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,187
Walking away from a helpless, hungry cat.

133
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,075
How can you bring yourself to do something so cruel?

134
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,130
Well?"... Misaka asks sternly.

135
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:35,800
What's with you?

136
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,442
I'm not abandoning him.

137
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,466
You've got food!

138
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:42,621
"Misaka does have food, but feeding the
cat is nonetheless impossible for her,"

139
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,623
Misaka says, finally relenting.

140
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:48,556
"Misaka has a critical defect that
prevents her from interacting with the cat,"

141
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,122
Misaka explains further.

142
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,065
A defect?

143
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:52,825
I'm sure it can't be that bad.

144
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,492
"The descriptor is appropriate...

145
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,200
It's Misaka's body...

146
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,807
It constantly emits a weak magnetic field,"...

147
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,864
Misaka says, explaining her defect.

148
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:03,645
It is not strong enough for people to detect,

149
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,925
but animals are highly sensitive to it.

150
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:11,701
Okay, so... let me see if I understand. Animals
tend not to like you because you're a walking magnet?

151
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,385
"It is not that they do not like me.

152
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:17,246
They simply find it difficult to be around me,"...

153
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:19,962
Misaka says, correcting your previous statement.

154
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,647
Then give me the food...

155
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,379
I wouldn't mind feeding the ca...

156
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,071
"That is not enough...

157
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,557
Do you not wish to take him in and give him a home?"...

158
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,218
Misaka pointedly inquires.

159
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,422
"If you do not know what happens to animals taken in

160
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,096
by the Health Department, I am happy to inform you.

161
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,044
Well,"... says Misaka, beginning her illustrative tale...

162
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:39,602
First, the unfortunate creature is placed inside

163
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,009
a polycarbonate case...

164
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,931
Then, twenty milliliters of a
chemical called ASD-10 are injec-

165
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:44,942
Stop talking!

166
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,483
That is seriously disturbing information...

167
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,082
If you feel so bad, why don't you adopt him.

168
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:53,659
"Unfortunately, it would not be possible

169
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:56,811
for Misaka to raise a cat," Misaka answers honestly.

170
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,690
"In addition to the aforementioned critical defect,

171
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,998
Misaka's living space is somewhat unconventional

172
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,112
and thus not conducive to pet ownership,"...

173
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,140
Misaka clearly states her reasons.

174
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,428
Still, I...

175
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:11,309
Uh...

176
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,578
Okay, okay.

177
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,614
I guess you're coming with me.

178
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,763
You say there's a strange pain in your chest, huh?

179
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,372
I don't see anything that's out of the ordinary.

180
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:39,904
But Number 10031's turn is coming up tomorrow.

181
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,916
We don't want anything impeding the experiment, do we?

182
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,971
Yeah, you're right...

183
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:46,023
We should probably look a bit harder.

184
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:46,808
"No.

185
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,676
It is not something that will affect the experiment,"

186
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,194
says Misaka, offering her own analysis.

187
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:55,698
Well... since the tests aren't actually showing anything,

188
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,764
your word is good enough for me.

189
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:00,976
Sorry...

190
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,264
"Suppose you were to encounter a clone of yourself...

191
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,631
What would that experience be like for you?

192
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,611
How would you... feel?" Misaka wishes to know.

193
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,270
A clone of myself?!

194
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,409
Ugh, I don't think I'd like that at all!

195
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,315
Oh, really? But it could be useful.

196
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,565
What...?! Imagine for a second a living
copy of yourself standing in front of you.

197
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,887
Looking like you and talking to you in your own voice!

198
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,857
Just thinking about it makes my insides all squirmy!

199
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,994
Well... when you put it like that,

200
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,600
it does sound kind of creepy.

201
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,398
I can't take it...

202
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,080
You showing up like this...

203
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,315
Looking like you do! Just go away, all right?!

204
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:40,269
That is how Big Sister feels.

205
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,392
Misaka is creepy, someone she wants nothing to do with.

206
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,074
Hello and welcome to the Academy City Tour Bus...

207
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,671
We are so glad you chose to ride with us today!

208
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,662
We are now entering School District 23,

209
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:57,519
the area of the city devoted to space exploration.

210
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,250
In this area, as the name suggests,

211
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:03,759
you will find a variety of facilities
specializing in space technology,

212
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,806
including the Academy City Space Exploration Center,

213
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,990
which boasts its own rocket launch site.

214
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,997
The building you see on the left-hand side

215
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,664
is the data center for the most powerful
supercomputer in the world, Tree Diagram...

216
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:18,318
This center is a hub for data exchange...

217
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,534
It brings us the city's weather foreca-

218
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,730
It's unusual for a student to be dropping by at this hour.

219
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:36,834
Sorry... I'm writing a summer break
report and I needed to do some research.

220
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,506
That's very studious of you.

221
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,307
Or it would be, anyway...

222
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:43,498
if you hadn't waited until the
very last minute to get it done.

223
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,327
Word of advice:

224
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,763
This close to sunset, you want to
avoid going anywhere near the fence.

225
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,679
If you do, the security robots will swarm ya.

226
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:53,748
Thank you.

227
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:55,663
I'll be careful.

228
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,929
The data center...

229
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,567
The only point of contact for
communications with Tree Diagram.

230
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:12,150
From there, I'll hack in and program
it to produce a false prediction.

231
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,922
Like, emergency report:

232
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:19,785
Have observed a critical error in the
ongoing experiment titled Project Level 6 Shift."

233
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:25,008
"The error arose as a result of the battle
between test subject Accelerator and Railgun...

234
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,864
The damage done is irreparable...

235
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,312
Consequently, test subject Accelerator
will no longer be able to achieve Level 6."

236
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:37,097
The researchers, who have put all their eggs in
Tree Diagram's basket, will be thrown into a panic.

237
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,811
Of course, if they order a recalculation,
they'll realize that the error report was inaccurate.

238
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,069
They're bound to catch onto the trick sooner or later...

239
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,080
However...

240
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,192
before they do, I'll drive the
entire project into bankruptcy.

241
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,728
Geez.

242
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,767
You could've saved yourself a lot of pain.

243
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:06,811
That's my...

244
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,900
Shut up, you moron!

245
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:12,587
Wait, that's all you have?

246
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,232
Huh?

247
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,221
Hold on.

248
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,493
Black cats are supposedly bad luck, right?

249
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:26,482
"Why does he keep meowing like that?"
asks Misaka, expressing confusion.

250
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:29,232
Well, my guess is he's upset because he's still hungry.

251
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,487
So feed him again.

252
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,901
How about you give it a try this time?

253
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,761
I told you... It is impossible for me to feed...

254
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:37,010
Oh, come on... try.

255
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,794
You see, it worked. He's eating just fine.

256
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,356
Does he appear to be upset now?

257
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,025
No way... He looks pretty happy to me.

258
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:01,916
Are you happy, cat?

259
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,266
Uh, well... you want to give him a name?

260
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:11,665
A new name?

261
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,088
But I thought you named him Zapper.

262
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,582
Not Zapper... He's your cat, right?

263
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,480
You should give him a name you like.

264
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:20,784
Very well.

265
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,162
It's "Dog."

266
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:24,988
Huh?

267
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:28,571
Misaka has chosen a name for the
black cat, and that name is Dog.

268
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,178
He is a cat called Dog. Heh.

269
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:33,299
Come on... honestly...

270
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,357
Can't you think of anything better than that?

271
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,732
You know, something that's a little bit more dignified.

272
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:39,432
"Okay. King Henry VIII,"

273
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,609
Misaka suggests with a straight face.

274
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:42,759
Too dignified.

275
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:44,542
Very well. I will call him "Schrödinger."

276
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,242
Quit messing around! Thought experiment or not,

277
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,332
the man talked about locking a cat in a cage

278
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,405
with some poison and radioactive material.

279
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,344
Obviously not a cat lover!

280
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,477
All right... I shall put it on hold for now.

281
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,413
On hold. Yes?

282
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,719
I see where this is going...

283
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:06,071
Please don't name him "On Hold," I'm begging you.

284
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:07,295
Just don't.

285
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,888
"By the way, what is your current destination?

286
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:17,575
This is a different route than the one we took
yesterday with the beverages," Misaka observes accurately.

287
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,901
A little detour...

288
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:20,930
There's a book that I need to pick up.

289
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,709
"Do you wish to go to the shopping district, then?"

290
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,957
Misaka asks and then points out...

291
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:27,232
"Geographically speaking,

292
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:31,154
making a right turn at the previous
intersection would be the shorter route."

293
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,314
Nope... that's not it.

294
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,514
I'm headed for a used book store past there.

295
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,493
I don't imagine raising a cat
has changed much over the years.

296
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:42,848
"You are going to the store to find a
book on how to properly care for a cat,"

297
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:44,828
says Misaka, seeking confirmation.

298
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,767
Yeah, I'd say that about sums it up.

299
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,798
If it was just me, I'd be fine,
but you were at my place, right?

300
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,279
You saw the nun's habit and the priestess's robes...

301
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:53,781
It's for those two.

302
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,926
"In other words, you intend to shirk your responsibility

303
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,427
and foist caring for the cat onto somebody else."...

304
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,111
Misaka says, clarifying.

305
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,196
No, that isn't what I'm saying at all.

306
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,905
What's wrong... Are you angry?

307
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,217
"No, I am not angry...

308
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,673
However, if you fail to treat the
cat with adequate care and concern...

309
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,156
I will have you charged with destruction of property,"

310
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,114
states Misaka as a serious warning.

311
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,893
I knew it. You are angry.

312
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,356
No, I am not angry.

313
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,467
Well, I'm gonna go in and see what I can find...

314
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,729
You wait out here for me.

315
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:27,967
"I understand,"...

316
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,049
Misaka acknowledges the instruction.

317
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:32,348
There was a hidden meaning in there, I know it.

318
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,206
Oh... now that I think about it...

319
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:38,050
I probably shouldn't go into the store carrying a cat.

320
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,339
I do not mean to sound as if
I am lecturing you about this,

321
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,364
but please do not give him to me, as I cannot hold...

322
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,773
Here, catch! Kitty Bomb!

323
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,760
Your magnetic field freaks him out...

324
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:53,646
but if you can get past that barrier,
that'll be a sign of a real bond between you!

325
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:58,016
"Horrible boy...

326
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:00,280
Does he think he can get away with that?

327
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:06,240
One simply does not use a kitten to play catch."
Misaka says, talking to herself under her breath.

328
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,536
Is that an upset meow?

329
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:12,714
Or a happy one?

330
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,398
How do I tell them apart?

331
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:25,276
We were out of line. We're sorry man.

332
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,292
We get the message. You don't need to...

333
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:30,071
Oh, come on...

334
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,520
You were the ones who started it in the first place.

335
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,730
You don't really think you're going
to get off with an apology, do you?

336
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,044
It hurts! It hurts...! It hurts!

337
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:40,974
Please, just stop! Ahh!

338
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,099
Pathetic...

339
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:51,152
I know about ten thousand girls who can take
much worse than that without so much as a whimper.

340
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,615
No, please!

341
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,148
Hey, help a guy out.

342
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,976
I gotta work up an appetite for dinner somehow.

343
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:06,556
Yeah... I guess it is about that time again, isn't it?

344
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:10,324
Lucky you. It looks like you get to live for another day.

345
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:18,705
Thank you for waiting.

346
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,773
"I hope I have not kept you long...

347
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:27,555
I am Misaka 10031, your next opponent," Misaka reports.

348
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:29,739
Tch... okay...

349
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,045
You guys get kinda' confusing after awhile.

350
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:36,939
"Should I apologize for your confusion?" asks Misaka.

351
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:41,459
I don't need an apology from
somebody who'll be dead before tomorrow.

352
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,415
Operation confirmed.

353
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,686
Misakas 10031 and 10032 will proceed
with the predetermined course of action.

354
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:07,868
This is strange...

355
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,901
There isn't a hint of anyone here.

356
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,827
If the sensors weren't working,

357
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,572
the cameras probably aren't, either.

358
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,287
This facility is the end-all be-all,

359
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:25,140
the point of communication with Academy City's brain.

360
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:29,844
But here I am.

361
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:34,856
Moving around unimpeded after getting past
their meager display of exterior security.

362
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:36,206
Have they fled?

363
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,478
Is this a trap?

364
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,673
Whatever the case, there should be more to it than this.

365
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,278
How do they benefit from letting me get this far in?

366
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,299
Are they just that sure that
hacking into the system is impossible?

367
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,971
Even the control room is deserted.

368
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,746
The facility appears to be functioning...

369
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:06,349
But...

370
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,060
This didn't just happen...

371
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:13,167
The utter emptiness, the layer of dust coating everything.

372
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,565
This place has been abandoned for a while.

373
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,640
But why?

374
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:20,222
This is nothing like what I expected.

375
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,266
I'll do what I came here for and...

376
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:24,546
Is this it?

377
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,873
What does that mean?

378
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,971
Number of transmissions today: 0...?

379
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,515
There should be several hundred
requests to Tree Diagram each day.

380
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,702
No... the requests are here.

381
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:40,371
They just haven't been processed...

382
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,548
Nor were yesterday's, or the day before...

383
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:51,811
These are reports.

384
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,113
A bunch of them...

385
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,546
23rd Report... 24th Report...

386
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,850
What does that say?!

387
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:04,522
"This is the final report regarding
the disappearance of Tree Diagram."

388
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:08,607
"On June 28 at zero zero twenty hours,

389
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,945
all communications ceased and Tree
Diagram disappeared from its satellite track.

390
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,181
That same day, at zero one fifteen,

391
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,181
Search Party 1 was dispatched."

392
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,095
"Later, at zero three forty,

393
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,288
one section of Tree Diagram's remnants was recovered...

394
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,870
Analysis indicates that Tree Diagram was...

395
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:30,391
Tree Diagram...

396
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,998
no longer exists.

397
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,079
Then...

398
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,756
Let's see here...

399
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:42,070
Cat book... cat book... cat book...

400
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,109
Tree Diagram doesn't exist.

401
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:34,468
The experiments continue.

402
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,118
There must be something I can do to save them!

403
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:39,000
"Misaka must go on to the next experiment," says Misaka...

404
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,087
Stop... Please!
