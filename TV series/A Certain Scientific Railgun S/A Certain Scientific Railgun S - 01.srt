1
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,065
Come on. They're really late.

2
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:23,242
I wonder what they're up to.

3
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:28,875
Well...

4
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:34,675
Like I said, this group of creeps
is about to start some trouble.

5
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,836
Huh? Hey!

6
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,790
I was just minding my own business!

7
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:39,371
Hey!

8
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,961
Whatcha keep running away for?

9
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:43,159
Uh, oh!

10
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:43,562
Huh?

11
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,290
Hey, now. Wait up!

12
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:46,398
You're not goin' anywhere.

13
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:48,467
Look, I need some help. Just hurry, okay?

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,335
Okay, okay. Just a little longer!

15
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,419
I've pinpointed the location of Saten's cell!

16
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:57,850
Good. Nicely done, Uiharu...

17
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:58,724
Now...

18
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:00,114
Hold on for just a second.

19
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:01,799
I have to get my armband!

20
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:03,319
Huh?

21
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:03,675
Oh?

22
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,223
Slow down, will ya?

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,831
Yeah, just give up already!

24
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:09,090
Come on!

25
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:16,005
There, you see?

26
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:19,442
Start actin' all hasty, and you'll wind up with a boo-boo!

27
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:21,916
Um... I, uh...

28
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:27,331
Don't worry, Judgment's on the case now!

29
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:29,165
You made it! It's about time!

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,716
You five are under arrest for attempted assault.

31
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:33,882
I've never seen anyone teleport before!

32
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:38,107
If all of us surround her at the
same time, her ability won't matter.

33
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:40,706
Yeah? Try it. That'll teach you a lesso...

34
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,097
Ah, that's where you are!

35
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:43,813
I got tired of waiting for you.

36
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,498
What are you guys doing here, anyway?

37
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,081
Who are you?

38
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,428
Uh... wai...

39
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,860
Are you friends with these other little girls?

40
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:56,279
Since you were the last one to the party,
why don't we get started with you, huh?

41
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:58,743
Crazy, right? So then she says...

42
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,966
Uh... what was that?

43
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,093
Lightning, I think.

44
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:07,137
Okay. Can we get going now?

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,044
All the stores are gonna be closed.

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,456
But, you uh...

47
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:10,938
Alright, yeah...

48
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,834
Oh, and... Who were those guys, anyway?

49
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:19,476
Zap people senseless first and ask questions later, huh?

50
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,462
As usual...

51
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:23,194
Eh?

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,071
Home to 2.3 million people...

53
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,873
Eighty percent of whom are dedicated students...

54
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:41,062
All intently focused on nurturing
and developing their esper abilities.

55
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:43,120
This is Academy City.

56
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:46,711
There are seven people who have
achieved the status of Level 5.

57
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,440
Among them, you are ranked third...

58
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:52,591
The famous "Railgun," Mikoto Misaka.

59
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,355
Sometimes I don't think you really understand who you are!

60
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:57,980
Huh? What's that mean?

61
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,839
Ughhh! I really have to explain it, don't I?

62
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:06,956
Sissy, your ability is one people will
both aspire to and be viciously jealous of.

63
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:11,046
Like yesterday, when your rash attitude
made you those punks' prime target.

64
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,116
People will always fear you to some degree,
and if you're not careful, you'll get hurt.

65
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:16,595
Hey!

66
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,001
Don't text while I'm talking to you!

67
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,731
It's from Uiharu, she says she just left the dorm...

68
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:25,223
I guess you should hurry and finish up your
work if you want to hang out with us sometime.

69
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,302
Ah... No fair.

70
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,398
You're always so mean, Sissy.

71
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:35,101
Man! Whew!

72
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,956
I'm telling you, it was so amazing!

73
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,620
What would you call it, Uiharu?

74
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,201
An instant takedown?

75
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,053
One shot, and she blasted 'em all!

76
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,601
That sounds incredible.

77
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,945
Saten, you're never going to change, are you?

78
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,289
Wandering around those back
alleys always gets you into trouble.

79
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah...

80
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,849
Ah! Well, look at that! We're almost there!

81
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,956
Let's see, where is that invitation?

82
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:57,218
Yep, changing the subject, right on cue.

83
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,625
So, I'm curious...

84
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,742
Is there any reason we're meeting up at Misaka
and Shirai's school today instead of somewhere else?

85
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,258
Look who it is! Misaka!

86
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:23,635
Oh, hi Kongo, Wannai, Awatsuki, how's it going!

87
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,751
Hi there, it's so good to see you.

88
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:26,958
How have you been?

89
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:27,981
What's that?

90
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,940
Oh, yeah. All of this stuff...

91
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,398
Materials for our summer assignments.

92
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:36,690
It doesn't really feel like much of a
vacation when they give us this much work to do...

93
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,040
Seriously, couldn't they take it easier?

94
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,178
Tell me about it...

95
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:43,315
Finding all the material is
almost an assignment in itself.

96
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,165
So, is that why you're here today, too?

97
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:47,464
Oh uh...

98
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,910
I'm actually just killing time
until I meet up with someone...

99
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,331
I've already finished my work.

100
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:51,912
Eh?

101
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,659
No surprise there, huh?

102
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:54,933
Well...

103
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,758
If I had wanted to, I could have finished in a day...

104
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,111
I just prefer to divide the work up a bit.

105
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:02,415
Oh, whoops.

106
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,043
That is an awful lot of books to carry by yourself.

107
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,608
Oh, dear. How could I be this clumsy?

108
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,218
Don't worry... let me help you with that.

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,915
Here, I've got a few.

110
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:12,220
These, too.

111
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,498
Oh thank you.

112
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:14,650
Look!

113
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,319
It's Shokuho...

114
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:18,898
She's always surrounded by her friends like that.

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,491
So she's the fifth-ranked Level 5, huh?

116
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:22,768
How glamorous!

117
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,971
It's no wonder they call her the queen of the school.

118
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,204
I don't know.

119
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:31,652
I can't say there is a single thing I
have ever found to be likeable about her.

120
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,116
Did I just say that?

121
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:34,113
I didn't mean to!

122
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:35,378
I... It just slipped out!

123
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,168
I hope it didn't sound like I was
sniping! I would never want to...

124
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:39,441
It's okay, we get it.

125
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,940
Well then, I guess we should be on our way.

126
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah, probably.

127
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,236
See you around, Misaka.

128
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:45,604
Yeah. Bye!

129
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,720
Well, hello, Misaka!

130
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:54,532
I said "Hello, Misaka"!

131
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,077
Sorry, no talking allowed in the library.

132
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,831
Oh, come on now!

133
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,733
But you were chatting up a storm just a second ago!

134
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,458
You know, I have to wonder...

135
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:08,167
Is it just that you don't feel like talking to me?

136
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:11,618
Oh, my! What have we here?

137
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:12,554
Hey, stop!

138
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:15,429
You can't just go grabbing someone's stuff without asking!

139
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,717
Oh, no! Now I'm scared!

140
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:22,014
What's the deal? Oh, I bet I know!
Is it a present for your boyfriend?

141
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,304
What's with you? You tryin' to start a fight?

142
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,581
But why would I want that?

143
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:31,564
Going one-on-one would be so difficult. After all...

144
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,222
It would hardly be fair.

145
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,003
My tampering powers don't seem to work on you.

146
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,172
I admit, it's a real pain...

147
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:44,150
that EM barrier of yours.

148
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:46,272
Listen, you!

149
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,351
Qu... Queen?

150
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,337
Are those two facing off?

151
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,625
That could be interesting!

152
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:52,874
I wonder what they're talking about.

153
00:06:53,628 --> 00:07:00,452
Like I said, hardly fair, but while going
one-on-one against you would be difficult for me...

154
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:09,042
Going up against this many of our
finely trained Tokiwadai students...

155
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:13,746
Well, that would be intense, even for you, wouldn't it?

156
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,822
I'm just kidding.

157
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,998
I'm confused...

158
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,523
Why am I standing around like this?

159
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:25,298
I don't remember leaving my chair...

160
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:30,670
Oh, hey! Look everybody! Misaka and Shokuho are talking!

161
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,653
I see nothing's changed.

162
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:37,285
The way you abuse your ability is still depraved.

163
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,615
And to think that you're the
city's greatest mental ability user?

164
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:44,047
Misaki Shokuho... Known as "Mental Out."

165
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:47,144
Honestly, don't be such a bad sport!

166
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,481
This is just a warning...

167
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,944
I thought it only fair to tell you to be
careful about the friends you're making these days.

168
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,011
If you attempt to make any moves into my territory,

169
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:59,085
let's just say, it's going to cost you. 'Kay?

170
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,576
Shokuho... I've got a question.

171
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,770
Well, go right ahead. I'm listening.

172
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:11,307
Are you sure that you're really a middle-school student?

173
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,852
That's a good question.

174
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:21,188
For the time being, at least, that seems to be the case...

175
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:24,819
But with my tampering abilities, just
about anything could happen, you know?

176
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,265
Hello, Sissy! Uiharu and the others are here!

177
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,466
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

178
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,324
Quit teleporting out of the blue like that!

179
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:43,546
Hey, you guys!

180
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,324
Thanks for waiting!

181
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,337
Uh... Did something happen to your head, Shirai?

182
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:52,040
A little over-zealous affection, that's all.

183
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:55,116
I'm sorry for having to drag
you all the way out here, Haru'ue.

184
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,396
I'm having a great time, really...

185
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,366
And I've got some delicious
looking snacks I brought along, too!

186
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:04,131
There are a lot of great shops throughout Academy City,

187
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,630
but they're especially famous for them around here.

188
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:07,701
That's true...

189
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,427
Although I think you enjoyed showing them
off to Haru'ue even more than going to them.

190
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,065
Well, it's nice to share something so fantastic.

191
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,774
I mean, the sheer elegance of the
area is almost palpable, don't you think?

192
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,731
I feel like a princess!

193
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:22,476
It's like the air itself is scented with roses!

194
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:23,915
Oh... Is that why?

195
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,439
Huh?

196
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,756
I was just wondering why you went with
that particular design today, that's all.

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,851
I don't get it.

198
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,600
What design are you talking about?

199
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,507
B... b... but how did you know?

200
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh, it was earlier.

201
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,130
While you were picking out your
cake, I took a quick little peek.

202
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:42,596
They were so pretty, especially that rose pattern.

203
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,368
You, too, Haru'ue? You are being corrupted!

204
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,950
Just so you know, that kind of
reaction is what makes it so much fun!

205
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:51,727
How else am I supposed to reac...

206
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:52,898
Now, now, guys!

207
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,976
Let's not waste our time squabbling with each other.

208
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,357
Well?

209
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you coming?

210
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,577
Here to visit someone?

211
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,513
Yes.

212
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,205
All right.

213
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,573
Then please fill out all of
the required areas on this form.

214
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:10,534
Of course.

215
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:12,020
Wow, Haru'ue.

216
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,729
It looks like you've got this routine down.

217
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,213
Hey, you guys.

218
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,782
Ah! It's Yomikawa and Tesso!

219
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,182
Hey, what are you guys up to today?

220
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:22,691
Oh! Visiting?

221
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,621
Yes.

222
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,528
If I may ask, ma'am, why are you here?

223
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,123
Has there been an incident?

224
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,110
Oh, no.

225
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:31,156
There were some pseudo-radicals we had to take care of...

226
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,873
One of them is being treated here.

227
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,706
He's finally ready to be discharged, so we're
relocating him to an Antiskill-affiliated hospital,

228
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,035
where we can put the squeeze on him good and hard.

229
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,081
C'mon... take it easy, boss.

230
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,104
You were dealing with pseudo-radicals?

231
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,115
Yeah... you know...

232
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,633
All sorts of problems crop up in this town.

233
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,533
You never know what it'll be next.

234
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,509
Yes?

235
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:03,358
Hey, Banri! You mind if I come in?

236
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,334
No, of course not!

237
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:07,732
Is there something?

238
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,581
Just thought we would stop by!

239
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,274
You guys!

240
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:16,780
So delicious!

241
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,362
This is really wonderful, Erii!

242
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,143
Isn't it?

243
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:23,415
Uiharu took me to the shop where they make them earlier.

244
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,284
You two must have eaten about twenty of them.

245
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:27,936
Amazing!

246
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,310
It seems like you're doing a lot better, huh?

247
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,020
Mhmm. Slowly but surely...

248
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,015
The rehab can be pretty hard...

249
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:38,415
But having all you come see me will motivate me even more!

250
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,464
So thank you!

251
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:44,859
If you can finish your rehabilitation soon enough, then
we can go to school together, starting from second term!

252
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:45,797
Ahh...

253
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,956
So, uh... Is... anybody else thirsty?

254
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:51,365
Eh?

255
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:52,224
Thirsty?

256
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:54,343
Yes, I could use a drink...

257
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,731
Want to go see if we can find some sodas somewhere?

258
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:57,666
Great idea!

259
00:11:58,024 --> 00:12:00,810
Well, if you'll excuse us, we'll step out for a bit.

260
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:02,706
Wait, you mean...

261
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:03,689
Everybody?

262
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,372
Right... Come along, now.

263
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,540
I still don't understand...

264
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:08,981
Misaka, what's going o...?

265
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,214
Come on, come on, hurry!

266
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,936
Okay! We'll be back in a jiff...

267
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,815
You guys have fun together!

268
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,956
A soda sure sounds good!

269
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,888
Why it certainly does, Kuroko!

270
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,398
What in the world?

271
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:35,031
Okay. You want to tell us what's really going on?

272
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,438
Soon enough. Let's get sodas first, though.

273
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:45,288
So that's it? Their physical therapy?

274
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:47,353
Poor Edasaki.

275
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,548
She's working really hard, huh?

276
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:55,296
Sissy... Hello! Sissy?

277
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,290
You zoned out. Is something wrong?

278
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,049
Oh... mm-mm. It's nothing.

279
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,488
You want to plan... a surprise?

280
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:07,257
Yeah!

281
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:11,332
I don't feel like simply handing over our gift
will have enough impact, you know what I mean?

282
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:13,459
It's just...

283
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:16,122
Well, setting the mood makes a big difference.

284
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:18,998
What would be great...

285
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,032
Is if we could have it come out of a cake!

286
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,011
Or put it at the bottom of a champagne glass!

287
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,279
But neither of those things would work.

288
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,415
How serious is she about this?

289
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,383
But we could try... Those things!

290
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:32,052
You mean the...

291
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:32,823
flowers?

292
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,723
Yes! I call it...

293
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,981
"Operation, Oh, a Bouquet of Flowers?

294
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,005
But Wait, What's This Inside?"

295
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,080
Okay?

296
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,930
Uh... sound good?

297
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:46,206
Yes, sounds like a great surprise.

298
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,371
Doesn't it? Alright, I'll go buy them!

299
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,309
Do something!

300
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,376
What can I do? You know how Sissy is...

301
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,117
No!

302
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,673
No... Oh, no...

303
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,929
Oh, hey... What is that?

304
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,654
Oh. That's Misaka's bag.

305
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:05,248
Awww.. How could I be so idiotic?

306
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,331
It'll be okay.

307
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,050
There's nothing we can do about it now.

308
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,099
It won't matter...

309
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,231
It's the thought that counts, after all!

310
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,880
No, we can still do it! Kuroko!

311
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,210
I'll need to use your ability!

312
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,731
You take me with you, and we'll teleport our way in!

313
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,606
You're getting a little over-excited...

314
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:19,539
Come on!

315
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,354
We gave them plenty of notice!

316
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,504
How much time does it take to
process a simple patient transfer?

317
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,618
It'll be okay.

318
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:30,611
You know...

319
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:32,178
Captain...

320
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,728
Wasn't there a guard outside...?

321
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,598
Hey! Stop right there, you three!

322
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,460
What was that?

323
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:49,427
Come on, move it!

324
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:50,097
Tesso!

325
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:53,540
Call below and have them scramble... Hurry!

326
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,588
Uh... Right!

327
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,243
Damn.

328
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,791
Oh... it stopped.

329
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:05,074
Please note that while the emergency bell has just
rung, we cannot confirm any fires in the building...

330
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,938
Uiharu!

331
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:06,359
Right!

332
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:07,748
Huh?

333
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:09,034
Kuroko?

334
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,821
We're going to look into the situation, just in case.

335
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,234
You and Saten head back to Edasaki's
room without us and wait there.

336
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,656
Oh and one more thing...

337
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:21,806
No matter what happens, please refrain
from repeating yesterday's little scene, okay?

338
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,536
Uh... Yeah, whatever you say.

339
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:25,395
This is kind of scary.

340
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,263
I wonder what's going on out there.

341
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,353
I'll take a look and see if I can find out.

342
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,081
Just be careful, okay?

343
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:32,856
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

344
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,040
Almost!

345
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,290
Hurry up and get it open!

346
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:43,970
Freeze!

347
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,292
It's no use trying to escape.

348
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:49,456
There's an all-points bulletin
out on you through all Academy City.

349
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,492
There's nowhere for you to...

350
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:52,877
Shut up! I mean it! Stop talking!

351
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,427
Captain, their hostage...!

352
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:58,175
Don't try anything stupid.

353
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:01,050
If you do, I'm gonna blow her pretty little head off.

354
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:04,775
The criminal scheduled for transfer has escaped?

355
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,623
Captain Yomikawa is in pursuit...

356
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,114
Reinforcements are on their way.

357
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,267
Where we could really use your
help is preventing any panic.

358
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,731
Honestly!

359
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,012
I can't stand it when Kuroko
treats me like I'm a stubborn child.

360
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,181
She's concerned about you, that's all.

361
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,838
You do tend to be a bit reckless at times, you know.

362
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:25,679
But, of course, that's what we like about you...

363
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,642
That's right. Maintain your positions.

364
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,456
You heard me. I don't want to provoke them...

365
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,148
They have a hos...

366
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:32,564
Is something the matter?

367
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,672
What are you doing here?

368
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:35,985
Why, has something happened...?

369
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:41,967
It's the pseudo-radicals.

370
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:43,818
They've blocked our access to the roof.

371
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,305
You should go and find someplace safe.

372
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,731
Edasaki!

373
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:49,756
Why are you out of bed?

374
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,028
Looking for Erii...

375
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,815
She went to see what was
happening, but she didn't come back.

376
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,426
Huh?

377
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,523
What happened to her?

378
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,565
I'm sorry to have to tell you that...

379
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,165
Your friend's been taken hostage.

380
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,948
Oh, no!

381
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:02,624
Calm down!

382
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:10,790
Thanks for helping me...

383
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,308
But they've still got Erii!

384
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,246
What about her?

385
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,249
She'll be okay.

386
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:18,802
All right...

387
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:19,880
Where are you going?

388
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:21,636
Whoa!

389
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:22,509
What are you...

390
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:27,769
Come back! Hey, Misaka!

391
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,748
No! Let me go!

392
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:35,731
Be quiet! And stop squirming...!

393
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,910
C'mon, we're ready to go! Take off!

394
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:41,729
What?

395
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,357
Misaka!

396
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,185
You've just made a big mistake!

397
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,758
That's my friend you're messing with!

398
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,158
This one has an ability...

399
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,415
All right! Let's give it more power!

400
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,876
I am! My controls aren't working!

401
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,061
She wants her damn friend back, does she?

402
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,444
Well, okay!

403
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,144
Here you go!

404
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,577
I've got to catch her!

405
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:17,701
Thanks, Saten!

406
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,879
Can't... Hold... on...

407
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:23,354
Ow ow ow ow ow!

408
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,331
I've... I've got you...

409
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,184
Hang in there!

410
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:30,916
Oh, honestly!

411
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:32,453
Huh?

412
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:32,799
Eh?

413
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:34,371
I'm okay.

414
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:37,040
Hey, good timing!

415
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,464
I asked you not to.

416
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,939
But you just had to interfere, didn't you?

417
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:41,705
Yeah, well...

418
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,540
I couldn't help it, could I? I mean, if I...

419
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:44,623
No excuses!

420
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:46,225
Thank goodness! Are you okay?

421
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,792
You didn't get hurt at all, did you?

422
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,411
No... I'm fine, really.

423
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,501
I'm so glad!

424
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,084
It was pretty scary...

425
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:54,199
Ah!

426
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:56,409
The bag!

427
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:56,927
Eh?

428
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,641
Misaka's bag. I had it with me...

429
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,026
Huh?

430
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,726
Kuroko...

431
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,816
I guess we don't have any choice.

432
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:15,471
Whoa, Sissy! Can we please think this through?

433
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,592
Well, I guess it turned out well enough.

434
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,517
Yeah, you guys saved my skin.

435
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:23,693
What's that thing?

436
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:26,291
Oh. I think it belonged to that kid.

437
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,648
That girl with the ability was
seriously impressive though, huh?

438
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,315
So, she must be what people
call an "electromaster," right?

439
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:36,614
Yeah... And I'm pretty sure that
uniform she had on was from Tokiwadai.

440
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:38,665
Huh? The super fancy school?

441
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,919
Just a second...

442
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,190
An electromaster from Tokiwadai...

443
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:43,707
Hey, Kuroko...

444
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:44,654
Yeah?

445
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:46,026
Uhhhh...

446
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,119
Thanks for this!

447
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:52,111
Sissy...

448
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,449
I'll see you a little later, then.

449
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,989
And you're welcome.

450
00:19:58,636 --> 00:19:59,565
I remember!

451
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,573
I've heard about the electromaster from Tokiwadai before!

452
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,446
The best electric shock user in the whole city!

453
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,361
She's the Level 5...

454
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,087
"Railgun"!

455
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,123
Welcome back, pseudo-radicals...

456
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,524
I hope you all had a nice trip.

457
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,117
There you have it...

458
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:42,484
Looks like she's still the same old Misaka.

459
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,445
Yep, she certainly is.

460
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,979
But you have to admit...

461
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,877
That's what's so great about her!

462
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,545
That felt awesome!

463
00:20:58,398 --> 00:20:59,834
Here! This is for you!

464
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:02,287
Huh? This? Are you sure?

465
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,957
But that's Misaka's bag.

466
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,515
Never mind! Just open it!

467
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:05,842
Oh...

468
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,687
Wow, that's a school uniform!

469
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,537
If you keep working as hard as you have
been, I know you'll be wearing it soon!

470
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:17,687
We went out together yesterday and got it.

471
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:18,919
Are you surprised?

472
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,248
Mm-hmm!

473
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:21,055
You guys!

474
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:21,977
Thank you...

475
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,108
Uh, Misaka?

476
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:27,134
Sorry, I screwed it all up!

477
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,933
I was working on a better surprise,

478
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,203
but then there was all that commotion, and the
stores closed, so this is what we ended up with, and...

479
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,484
Please, Misaka!

480
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:38,924
I am really surprised!

481
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,423
And really happy!

482
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:41,894
Thank you!

483
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,529
Good grief.

484
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:00,145
There's never is a dull moment. Not in this town.

485
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,428
Misaka is still as amazing as usual, huh?

486
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,790
Yep. All in all, I'd say it was a rosy start...

487
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,651
I wonder what color it will be next time?

488
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:41,063
Please just leave my skirt alone!
