1
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,325
Come on!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,256
What is with this thing?

3
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:11,869
Is that...

4
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:14,942
We got ourselves a cutie here...

5
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:17,588
Oooh... and she's from Tokiwadai, too.

6
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,575
Wanna come with us; have some fun tonight?

7
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:21,655
We'll even take you back to your dorm...

8
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:24,454
Of course, there's no telling
how late it might be by then.

9
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:31,650
What do these idiots think they're
going to accomplish by talking to me?

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,090
Pathetic.

11
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,133
Everyone else is pretending not to see.

12
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:37,643
It's not that they don't care.

13
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,605
They just can't do anything about it.

14
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,925
If they interfered, they'd only get themselves hurt.

15
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,353
And that wouldn't help anyone.

16
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,546
Everyone has to look out for themselves...

17
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,731
That's the way it works.

18
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:50,910
And if there is somebody out there who would
jump in the middle of this to help out a stranger...

19
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:52,576
Well, that person is just a fool.

20
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,809
Oh, hey, there you are!

21
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,402
Thanks for keeping her company, guys!

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,419
You shouldn't wander off like
that. You know how much I worry!

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,854
I gave it plenty of money.

24
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:07,078
I don't understand...!

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,443
Is it out of order?

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,875
Seriously?!

27
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:10,335
Heh.

28
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,787
Please don't screw with me today...

29
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:47,067
Give me back my money!

30
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,482
Are you done yet?

31
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,000
You just going to stand there like an idiot?

32
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,932
Are you gonna buy something or not?

33
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,162
What? Hold on...

34
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,379
I seriously need to rehydrate.

35
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:00,354
If I don't get a drink, I could
pass out at any given moment.

36
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:09,433
You're one rude chick.

37
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:14,024
When will you get it through your thick skull?

38
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,418
My name is Mikoto Misaka!

39
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:21,761
Is it really that hard for you to remember?!

40
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:25,291
Great.

41
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,616
So I guess that hasn't changed either, huh...?

42
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,843
Why is it that my shocks have no effect on you?

43
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,081
I don't know!

44
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,990
But it serves you right for using your ability like that!

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,096
Well...

46
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,493
if you're done, I'm going to get what I came for.

47
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,434
I've got some serious business with this vending machine.

48
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,492
Uh... about this machine...

49
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:46,907
It has a tendency to eat your money.

50
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,684
Not five minutes ago, it took mine and gave me nothing.

51
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:50,897
So, you got yoinked?

52
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,219
Well, what was the damage...?

53
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:54,971
How much did it take you for?

54
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:58,880
2000.

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,768
Wow! 2000?! You gave it that big of a bill?

56
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,421
Then of course it ate your money, you idiot!

57
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:14,011
I can't tell you how much I needed a laugh...

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,518
So... I'll get you your money's worth.

59
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:16,883
Eh?

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,512
Yeah...

61
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:19,303
This machine and I go way back.

62
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,350
You wouldn't believe how much money I...

63
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:23,091
Hmm?

64
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,632
Uh, never mind...

65
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,572
Anyway, like I said, I'm going to make
this thing give you what you paid for.

66
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,956
Uh, you know...

67
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,829
I don't have a good feeling about this.

68
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,728
Just forget it.

69
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:35,555
Hah!

70
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:39,370
Thank you for waiting.

71
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:40,346
No problem.

72
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,301
So, that's it?

73
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,381
She's back to normal, just like that?

74
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:46,780
Uh-huh.

75
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:50,896
And just when I had decided to leave her
alone and wait for her to confide in me.

76
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:54,535
There's no reason for Sissy to know how worried I've been.

77
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,372
All that would do is make her worry, instead.

78
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,648
I just hope we never have to go through that again.

79
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:04,783
Hmm...

80
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:06,039
Let's recap.

81
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,242
She went out last night without eating anything...

82
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:12,713
She didn't give us any details about
where she was going or what she was doing...

83
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:14,296
It fits.

84
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,083
I'm sure now. There can only be one explanation...

85
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:18,996
There's a boy involved...

86
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,555
There must be. I wonder who it is.

87
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,837
Oh! W... W... Wow!

88
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:25,672
Absolutely not! There's no boy!

89
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,936
That's why she's been acting so strangely because...

90
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,223
That's right. Because she's lovestruck.

91
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,924
It all makes sense now!

92
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,286
Why she was sneaking around.

93
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,311
Why she couldn't turn to any of us for advice.

94
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:38,407
Why she kept it all completely secret...

95
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,153
I know!

96
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,117
I wonder what type of boy Misaka would choose.

97
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,631
I'll bet he's a gallant young gentleman
and as handsome as a prince, too!

98
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,676
Well, handsome is always a plus...

99
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:54,542
but I think Misaka would also want to go out
with a guy who was intelligent and interesting.

100
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:59,017
Wait! She stays out all night and
doesn't come home until morning...

101
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,805
You don't think she could be...

102
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,381
Are you okay, Uiharu?

103
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,510
No... there's no way...

104
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,679
Of all people, Sissy wouldn't...

105
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:11,840
An alarm?

106
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,485
What the... you guys are really quick.

107
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,390
Just listen...

108
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,060
That sounds like an alarm from a vending machine, right?

109
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:19,887
Well, what do you think?

110
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,143
A vending machine in that direction?

111
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,313
Could it be...?

112
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,616
So, what should we do, Shirai?

113
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,642
I'm gonna go see what might've set it off.

114
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,134
Well then, I'll come, too.

115
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,268
That's okay If I need backup, I'll contact you.

116
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:31,907
Hold on!

117
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:35,776
Wait up!

118
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,565
What are you so scared of?

119
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,500
I can't... run any farther...

120
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,455
Honestly!

121
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,852
You could at least help me carry all this stuff!

122
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:51,437
I did my part. I made that machine
cough up everything it owed you.

123
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,242
Well, I didn't want to steal any...

124
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,635
Technically, they already belong to you.

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,726
If I accept this, I'm not a bystander, but an accomplice.

126
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:01,074
Here.

127
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,844
There's more where that came from.

128
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,416
Whoa!

129
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,252
Hold on! Hold on! Ow!

130
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,930
There are some hot ones in there, too!

131
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,885
It's not my fault.

132
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,072
I can't choose what kind of drink it spits out, you know.

133
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,757
What's with you, anyway?

134
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,101
The littlest thing is enough to send you running...

135
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:22,468
It doesn't help my pride that the
guy who beat me is a big crybaby!

136
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,608
Huh? What did you say?

137
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:31,101
Please! Don't act like you don't remember. You managed
to defeat me, both in town and out by the riverbed.

138
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:34,211
Wait, so I've been getting into
fights with a middle-school girl?

139
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,334
Really? You're actually trying
to pretend that you've forgotten?

140
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,963
How pathetic can you be?

141
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:40,822
What have I been doing?

142
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:43,628
Whatever, just drink...

143
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:47,742
You should be thankful. I can think of at least
one girl who would swoon to get a present from me.

144
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,545
Aw, gimme a break.

145
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,254
This isn't some manga...

146
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,565
Girls don't actually "swoon."

147
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,051
Heh... if only that were true.

148
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:00,134
Of course, you probably don't know what
they call me at Tokiwadai Middle School, do you?

149
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,409
Hi, Sissyyyyy!

150
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,600
I heard a vending machine alarm, so I came running.

151
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,893
And sure enough, here you are!

152
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,629
Here we go. Speak of the devil...

153
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:11,570
What's up?

154
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,930
Uh, something wrong, Kuro...

155
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,590
Geez! What's the matter with you?

156
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,477
I thought she was wrong... but it's true!

157
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,602
How awful!

158
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,525
You're having a secret assignation with a boy!

159
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,577
Hold on a minute!

160
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,286
It's a pleasure to meet you, gentleman caller.

161
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:30,342
Whoa, what now?

162
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:34,729
The name's Kuroko Shirai, and I have
the honor of being Mikoto's right hand gal.

163
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,572
Her one and only partner. Forever.

164
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,590
As you appear to be an acquaintance of Sissy's,

165
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:42,483
I am bound by social etiquette to
at least introduce myself to you.

166
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:43,960
Uh... okay...

167
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:45,525
Are you kidding me?

168
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,195
He's not exactly what you would call "impressive."

169
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,184
Could someone like him really be with Sissy?

170
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:57,745
My, it doesn't take very much
to incapacitate him, does it?

171
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,096
I thought you would have had better taste than this.

172
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,092
Excuse me?

173
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:11,210
Do you seriously think a blithering idiot
like this is my boyfriend? How stupid can you be?!

174
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,555
Wait! Your what?!

175
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,404
No, of course I didn't...!

176
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:17,074
I thought it seemed like a strange pairing.

177
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:18,472
Come on!

178
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,197
Get back down here!

179
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:21,792
Let me think.

180
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,165
Of course, I would love for you to
wash your hands of this troglodyte

181
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,278
and allow me to escort you back home to our room, but...

182
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:34,363
it might be best for you to build up some immunity to the
charms of men so you are not led further astray later on.

183
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,142
And, really...

184
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:40,098
I don't think I have anything to fear
from this helpless, goofy little monkey...

185
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:45,368
In fact, it's possible that he's so pathetic that
you will become disillusioned with men in general,

186
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:47,790
and then I will be there to console you!

187
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,681
And, besides...

188
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,672
You finally seem like yourself again.

189
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,912
I said, are you listening?!

190
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:03,498
I have nothing more to say... and, as I have
some things to attend to, I will take my leave.

191
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:06,390
I'm sure I can trust you not to
embarrass yourself here, Sissy...

192
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:06,779
Hey!

193
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,604
So Good-bye.

194
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:08,408
What do you mean by that?!

195
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,146
She vanished!

196
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,833
Saying something like that, and then running away!

197
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,173
So there are people in real
life who use the term "Sissy"...

198
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:18,447
I had no idea...

199
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,631
You Tokiwadai girls are something else.

200
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,255
She's actually sort of a special case.

201
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,091
Oh... Is she?

202
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,508
Oh, man! Why am I here?

203
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,750
I need some rest.

204
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,305
Big Sister?

205
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,301
She's back... Wait... what the...

206
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,718
You mean... There's another Zapper?

207
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,411
"Our appearances are, indeed, similar.

208
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:49,369
Which makes sense, as we are entirely identical
on a genetic level." Offers Misaka in reply.

209
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,848
Huh? A genetic level...?

210
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,424
Oh, ah! So you guys're twins, huh?

211
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,844
Moments ago... I identified a power
identical to Misaka's being used in the area.

212
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,528
When I arrived, I found a broken vending machine.

213
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:06,174
And now I see you with all of these beverages.

214
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:09,786
Big Sister, I hope I am wrong in suspecting
that you are an accomplice to theft.

215
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:10,203
Hey!

216
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,109
Your sister is the perpetrator!

217
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,961
I'm an innocent bystander!

218
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,614
Misaka investigated...

219
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,083
I checked for fingerprints using my ability.

220
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:21,246
The results showed that the
most recent set belonged to you.

221
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:23,503
No way! You can actually tell?

222
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,071
Kidding.

223
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,114
Not laughing...!

224
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,821
Give me a break!

225
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,658
This sister of yours could stand to learn...

226
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:29,499
Uh...

227
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,314
Why?

228
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,769
Of all places...

229
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,262
What are you doing wandering around out here?

230
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,497
I am here for training.

231
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,015
But...

232
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,552
What are you training for?

233
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,919
Are you joining Judgment or something?

234
00:11:58,293 --> 00:11:58,943
Judgment?

235
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,748
Oh, yeah... that's what this is.

236
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,281
Come on. Let's talk.

237
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,701
Unfortunately, Misaka has a schedule to keep.

238
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,310
It's okay!

239
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:09,186
Come with me.

240
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:14,826
Well, every family is different...

241
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,763
Some more than others...

242
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,959
Big Sister... how far are we going to walk?

243
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:25,281
Misaka's schedule is already off by
thirty-eight seconds. She must go soon.

244
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,502
The experiment...

245
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,155
The project was shut down, wasn't it?

246
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,608
So why?

247
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,445
"To which project are you referring?

248
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,673
Could you be inquiring about Project Level 6 Shift...?

249
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,783
If so, it is proceeding on schedule."

250
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,601
Misaka says to clarify.

251
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,016
But it's not...!

252
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,556
Still?

253
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,266
Mm. Yes... That is correct...

254
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,651
Experiment Number 10020 was just conducted.

255
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:55,831
That's ten...

256
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:57,571
thousand?

257
00:12:58,406 --> 00:12:59,517
What is she saying?

258
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:02,408
No... They can't...

259
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,552
I thought they went bankrupt!

260
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,201
I read it, but I don't understand...

261
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,632
How could they...

262
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:12,918
It isn't over yet!

263
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,915
They're still... killing those girls!

264
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,020
No... that's not true.

265
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:22,176
It was me... I killed them.

266
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:24,750
And her, too...

267
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:27,602
Soon, she'll be...

268
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,311
Big Sister?

269
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,271
Are you all...

270
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,952
Aww! How adorable!

271
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,812
"Misaka found the cute animal,"

272
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,187
says Misaka, trumpeting her achievement.

273
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,150
What do I do now...?

274
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:53,167
What more...

275
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,552
can I possibly do?

276
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:56,933
Big Sister...

277
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,936
Big Sister, it's a kitty-kiddy.

278
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:05,196
Big Sister... Big Sister... Big Sister...

279
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:06,968
No, stop it!

280
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,648
Please, stop it!

281
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,340
I can't take it...

282
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,041
You showing up like this...

283
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,228
Looking like you do! Just go away, all right?!

284
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:23,645
Okay.

285
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:25,473
Misaka will leave now.

286
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,316
It keeps getting worse.

287
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:51,490
Man.

288
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,144
These are heavy!

289
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:56,251
I wonder what was up with Zapper and her sister...

290
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:57,562
That was strange.

291
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:58,937
Whoa!

292
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:04,831
Aww man, that's gonna leave a bruise.

293
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,159
"You've fallen.

294
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,349
Do you need a hand getting up?"

295
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:10,504
Misaka asks, offering her help, somewhat reluctantly.

296
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,205
Thanks a lot, Zapper.

297
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,833
Oh, you aren't her. You're the sister.

298
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,726
Wait... I thought you guys wandered
off for a heart-to-heart or something.

299
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,085
"Misaka was there before, and now she is here,"

300
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:23,605
says Misaka, pointing.

301
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,172
"After we gather them,

302
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,491
where would you like to take these canned beverages?"...

303
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:30,486
Asks Misaka, cleaning up your mess.

304
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,900
Oh, uh, don't worry about it!

305
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:35,259
Really, I can carry them myself...

306
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:38,716
"After we have picked them up,
where should we take these beverages?"

307
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:40,917
Misaka asks, repeating the question.

308
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:49,742
Hello.

309
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,285
Is something the matter?

310
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,701
You look awfully flushed, Dr. Amai...

311
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,115
Are you all right?

312
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,045
Don't "Hello" me!

313
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,168
How could you involve so many facilities?!

314
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:03,927
We're supposed to be taking the lead on Level 6 Shift!

315
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:07,649
If you scatter the work around
like this, the patent will never be...

316
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:08,962
Now, now, let's calm down.

317
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,696
We could divide it up even more than this,
and there would still be plenty of profit.

318
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,222
You can't possibly know that!

319
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,217
Oh, but I can.

320
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,068
Listen...

321
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,814
Right now, what's most important
is completing the experiments.

322
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:27,231
A total of a hundred and eighty-three
facilities are receiving transfers.

323
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:28,398
Quite a lot.

324
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,133
If that breaks our mysterious
attacker's spirit, then good...

325
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,770
And should the attacks continue, well...

326
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:37,376
The more of those facilities that are destroyed...

327
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,674
the greater our share of the profit becomes, doesn't it?

328
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,795
There're so many...

329
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,377
one-hundred-eighty-three...

330
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:52,273
How could it have been spread between
that many facilities in such a short time?

331
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,001
How could one firm possibly operate on this high a level?

332
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,814
Oh, wow...

333
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,496
I'm an idiot...

334
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,159
I can't believe I didn't see it sooner.

335
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:09,046
Academy City is under satellite and
camera surveillance twenty-four hours a day...

336
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:14,326
There's no way that the city's senior management
could have failed to notice these twisted experiments

337
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,951
when they were being held over and over again outside.

338
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,596
In other words...

339
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,711
All of Academy City...

340
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,467
is my enemy.

341
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:42,415
Ugh...

342
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,902
No flavor left in that piece.

343
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,311
Hello. Have a sec?

344
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,548
So, which lab's errand boy are you?

345
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,097
What makes you think I'm with a lab?

346
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,823
Only two types of people ever come near me...

347
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:04,190
There are the ones who want to
use me for scientific analysis.

348
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:08,767
And then there are the idiots who want to fight me
so they can claim the title of Academy City's top dog.

349
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,144
Hmm... that's very interesting.

350
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,130
Though, as both types tend to be full of crap,

351
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:17,356
I don't see all that much difference between them.

352
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,104
It's called Level 6 Shift?

353
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:22,170
Yeah...

354
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,982
An experiment with Tree Diagram's endorsement.

355
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,127
Ha! I'll pass, thanks.

356
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,979
I'm the first-ranked esper in Academy City...

357
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:32,780
and that means I'm already at the top of the heap, buddy.

358
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,527
No one can beat me...

359
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:38,198
No matter who they are or what
they try, I'll win every single time.

360
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:41,734
So why should I care about
becoming any stronger than I am now?

361
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:43,680
You're right about one thing...

362
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,730
You are definitely the strongest esper in the city.

363
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:47,920
However...

364
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,814
grand as it is, is that title gonna be enough for you?

365
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:53,236
Doesn't it make life a bit monotonous?

366
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,414
Just imagine...

367
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,886
If you were to gain even greater power...

368
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,235
absolute power...

369
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,438
Then what would your life be like?

370
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:05,083
More interesting, I would think.

371
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,373
Even more power than I already have...

372
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:17,524
Really?

373
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:26,080
I'm glad you decided to come.

374
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:40,835
Mass-production of clones, in
violation of international law.

375
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,652
I gotta admit, I'm impressed.

376
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:45,058
You guys are a special kind of crazy.

377
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:49,747
Actually, they were originally intended
for use in a completely different project...

378
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,029
but things happen...

379
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,865
So all of them wound up being handed over to us.

380
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,049
Now that you've seen them...

381
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,401
Are you still interested in achieving Level 6?

382
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:09,183
Only another nine thousand nine
hundred and seventy left to go, huh?

383
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:10,986
What a drag.

384
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:13,917
Okay, Sissy!

385
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,078
The bathtub is all yours if you want it!

386
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,668
Alright, thank you.

387
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,234
What happened?

388
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,976
She was in such good spirits this afternoon.

389
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,846
Don't tell me it was that troglodyte!

390
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,858
He shall pay for this!

391
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,522
What can I do?

392
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,072
Do I have any moves left?

393
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,362
Find the mastermind and put the screws to him...?

394
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:48,810
No. If Academy City is green-lighting
these experiments, that won't do any good...

395
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,863
Who would come up with such a
messed-up project in the first place?

396
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:55,898
I get it.

397
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,491
That's why they aren't printing anything about my attacks!

398
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:03,400
They don't want to risk the public finding
out about their illegal cloning experiments.

399
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:08,826
But... maybe... if I were to destroy it...

400
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:11,527
Academy City would have nowhere to turn.

401
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:14,879
If I did that...

402
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:17,731
My life could never be normal again.

403
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:26,749
What am I thinking?

404
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,474
They've already killed ten thousand of me,

405
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:32,358
and I'm worried about living a normal life?

406
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:34,829
Hey... Kuroko...

407
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,553
Sissy...? Can I help you with something?

408
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,034
Supposing... just supposing...

409
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,370
I did something that brought
calamity and chaos to Academy City...

410
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:46,000
What would you do?

411
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,153
Hmm...

412
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,837
If you mean making off with drinks
from a vending machine that you damaged,

413
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,815
I guess I would suggest not doing it again...

414
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,923
That thing is fair game as far as I'm concerned!

415
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,183
It stole money from me my first year here!

416
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,493
No, I mean...

417
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,305
If I did something...

418
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:07,229
something that affected the very core of Academy City...

419
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,957
I cannot pretend to know why you
would even ask a question like that.

420
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:18,686
But if someone did something to threaten the safety
of this city, I wouldn't hesitate to take action...

421
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,547
Even if that somebody was you, Sissy.

422
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,909
Then, despite all the things you've said,

423
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:30,802
I suppose our relationship really does have its limits.

424
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:32,678
No, it doesn't at all!

425
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:37,625
Because in a million years, I know there isn't even
a remote chance that you would ever do anything to...

426
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,698
Hah! Gotcha!

427
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,812
I'm just messing with ya.

428
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,584
That wasn't nice, Sissy!

429
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,106
Thank goodness.

430
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:56,726
Ooh... come a little bit closer, Sissy...

431
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:03,692
If I put a stop to the project

432
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,719
and Kuroko's the one to catch me...

433
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:07,474
Well...

434
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,461
That wouldn't be so bad.

435
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,020
I knew it was a boy!

436
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:34,581
Absolutely not! One hundred percent not a boy!

437
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:39,825
A boy! No it isn't!...
