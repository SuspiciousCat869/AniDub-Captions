1
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:10,687
I don't understand.

2
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,019
What is that boy doing?

3
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:15,437
This young man has a serious
disease called muscular dystrophy.

4
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:17,296
Dys... what?

5
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:26,901
It's a disease that makes his
muscles grow gradually weaker...

6
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,269
He's had it all his life...

7
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,996
It's the type of disease people are born with, you see.

8
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,578
As you can tell, he's fighting against it...

9
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,645
Trying to beat it. To overcome it.

10
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,271
However... no matter how hard he fights...

11
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:55,106
it's a battle he is sure to lose.

12
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:59,396
Our current medical science
offers no cure for this disease.

13
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,909
His muscles will continue to weaken...

14
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,427
In time, he won't even be able to stand up...

15
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:06,460
And then... finally...

16
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,994
his lungs and his heart will stop working.

17
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,970
However, as I said, that's only currently.

18
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:16,882
Things can always change.

19
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,391
You have an amazing opportunity here.

20
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:24,583
Your ability can help him and other
people like him who are suffering.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,722
It's the simplest thing in the world,

22
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,732
and all you have to do is give us your DNA map, okay?

23
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,287
Thank you.

24
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:05,031
A dream...

25
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,158
Why would I dream about that?

26
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:08,809
Oh, right...

27
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:12,108
I went to see Edasaki yesterday, and that must have...

28
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,432
Ahhhh!!

29
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,678
Heeey! Sissy, you're going too fast!

30
00:03:58,703 --> 00:03:59,828
Wait for meeee!

31
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,998
Shut up, you perv!

32
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,818
But... But it was nothing...

33
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,924
I wanted to feel the warmth of
someone else's body, that's all!

34
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,060
I don't care what you wanted.

35
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,306
You can't come crawling into my bed like that!

36
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,852
So... that's all water under the bridge now.

37
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,068
Where are you off to?

38
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:20,993
Well, you know how there's that regional field
trip happening at the beginning of September, right?

39
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,784
Oh... yeah.

40
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:27,122
I want to be prepared for it, so I thought I'd
go buy all the sundries I'll need for traveling.

41
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,760
Ughh...

42
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:34,039
What you mean is that you're going shopping for
more of the childish stuff that you're so addicted to...

43
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:39,697
Despite the fact that our tiny room is already overflowing
with fancy-looking knockoffs of famous characters.

44
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,373
Did you say something?

45
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,718
No, nothing at all.

46
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,248
So we get to have a shopping date today, huh?

47
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:49,367
Ugh. Well, it really isn't necessary for you to tag along.

48
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:50,460
I don't mind, though...

49
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,793
Now, let me think a moment...

50
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,954
What else would be useful for you
to have before going on the fieldtrip?

51
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,943
Maybe something to stop creepy
intruders from sneaking into my bed?

52
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,002
You're still angry about that little incident, then?

53
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:05,091
Not at all.

54
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:07,641
Right...

55
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,580
Well, I promise I can be helpful
in all sorts of ways today.

56
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:11,691
Here's an example!

57
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,192
If you are on your way to the mall, allow me to helpfully
point out this route as a potential shortcut for you.

58
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,477
Now, then... after you, Sissy.

59
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,536
Okay, fine...

60
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:26,867
But if you try to use this as an excuse for
groping me, you won't enjoy the consequences.

61
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:30,051
Oh, no, such a thought never crossed my mind.

62
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,406
Wow.

63
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,977
It's so cramped and narrow in here.

64
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,689
How do you even know about this back alley?

65
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,443
It comes with the job...

66
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:42,566
I have every map of the city memorized,
down to the last nook and cranny.

67
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,067
Excuse me.

68
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,241
No, go right ahead.

69
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,252
Passing people is a little
awkward in such tight quarters, huh?

70
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,607
True, but fortunately that doesn't happen very often.

71
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:04,560
Excuse me.

72
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:05,919
No, go right ahead.

73
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,441
So... is this, like, a popular shortcut or something?

74
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,255
It's normally not this busy.

75
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,377
I don't know what everyone's doing here.

76
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,920
Honestly! Why today of all days?

77
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:25,976
This is...

78
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,366
Whoa! Are you okay?

79
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,944
Except for this huge pain in my head.

80
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,644
What? Is something wrong?

81
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,538
No. I just thought I saw something stuck under here.

82
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,681
An envelope?

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,096
I think so...

84
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,480
but there's no name or address on it.

85
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:47,728
What fell out?

86
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,751
It's a Money Card. That's strange.

87
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:54,830
Huh.

88
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,392
So you found a Money Card on the ground, too?

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,242
Too?

90
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,271
We've been receiving a lot of reports over

91
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:04,971
the last few days from people who have randomly
found Money Cards all across School District 7.

92
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,149
There are now forty-eight incidents.

93
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,913
Oh... It just jumped up to fifty-six.

94
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:10,835
That many?

95
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,060
And that's on the low end...

96
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:14,402
I'm sure not everybody reports them.

97
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,710
Maybe this is the work of some counterfeiting operation.

98
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:18,977
We thought of that.

99
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,894
But all the cards that have been
turned into us so far are genuine.

100
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,779
Really, Konori? All of them?

101
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:25,741
Uh huh.

102
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,663
Something odd is going on... I don't understand.

103
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:31,691
Why is this the first time I'm
hearing anything about this case?

104
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:32,408
Here's the thing.

105
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:37,404
Intentionally destroying or abandoning money is
prohibited by law... but Money Cards are different.

106
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:38,223
They're exempt...

107
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:40,884
So there haven't been any official notices put out.

108
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,352
Yes, I see...

109
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,841
The amount on the cards varies significantly.

110
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,509
Sometimes it's a thousand...

111
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:50,624
Other times it's fifty thousand.

112
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,327
Each of them was left in a place where
there's generally little human traffic.

113
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:57,853
And they were all found inside envelopes.

114
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,200
In other words, somebody is obviously
spreading these around on purpose.

115
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:09,534
It's all seems too involved and
organized to be a simple prank...

116
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:13,361
There weren't even any fingerprints on
the envelopes or the cards themselves.

117
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:16,732
As you would expect, rumor of
the mysterious cards has spread.

118
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,323
So there are a ton of people prowling
the alleyways, looking for treasure.

119
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,785
I know what you mean...

120
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,447
We saw it in action.

121
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,590
It's not just that, either...
Students are stealing from each other.

122
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:31,165
And some are even getting caught up in nasty
fights after stumbling into Skill Out territory.

123
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,723
We cannot allow this situation to continue.

124
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:35,804
Sorry, Sissy... Duty calls.

125
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:38,710
It looks like we'll have to put
off our date until another time.

126
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:42,272
Sure... I can go by myself. Don't you worry about it.

127
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,584
Bye!

128
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,532
Doomed to suffer through another lonely day.

129
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:53,067
Thanks for your help. If you don't mind,
you can start by searching in this area.

130
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:59,269
Now I can take my time and actually enjoy shopping.

131
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,144
I'm sorry!

132
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,772
It's okay. No worries.

133
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,097
Aww.

134
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,412
It doesn't look like there are any of them here.

135
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:09,835
Oh. That's too bad.

136
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,677
I'm starting to think that story was really just a rumor.

137
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:15,475
But someone told me Rit in Class B actually found one.

138
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,767
Yeah? I didn't know that...

139
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:17,841
Rumors, huh?

140
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,013
I suppose it's no surprise that
Kuroko and I hadn't heard about it, then.

141
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,796
Maybe this area has already been picked clean.

142
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,776
Oh, uh... hello, Saten.

143
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:42,844
Huh? Oh! Hey, Misaka!

144
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,361
So, what was up with you earlier?

145
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,872
You didn't even say hello.

146
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,032
Huh? Earlier?

147
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:50,027
Don't act like you don't remember...

148
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:51,734
It was just a little while ago.

149
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,920
You were walking in front of Seventh Mist...

150
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:57,201
I called out to you, but you kept
walking like I wasn't even there.

151
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:57,910
Sorry...

152
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:00,204
I'm pretty sure that wasn't me you were talking to.

153
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:00,657
What?

154
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:05,128
But I could've sworn I saw the
Tokiwadai school uniform and everything.

155
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,593
I've been with Kuroko and the others until now.

156
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,627
Okay, then. Maybe it wasn't you.

157
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,144
So, anyway, what exactly were you doing?

158
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:15,669
Chasing down a rumor of abandoned
Money Cards, by any chance?

159
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,229
You know about that?

160
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,938
Taaaa... Da!

161
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:22,020
That's... amazing.

162
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,132
I know, pretty impressive, huh?

163
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,264
I seem to have a really keen nose when it comes to rumors.

164
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,377
Yeah... so I can see.

165
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,374
Right!

166
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,756
We need to go check over here next.

167
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,631
Eh But I need to do some shopping...

168
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,082
Just come on already!

169
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,185
Full school curfew is approaching...

170
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,697
All students, please return home immediately.

171
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,534
Full school curfew is approaching.

172
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,572
Awww... It's evening already.

173
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:52,731
Time flies, huh?

174
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:54,768
Here...

175
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,835
You should have your share of the day's take!

176
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,851
Great, thank you... Oh! No, I can't!

177
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,371
Those should really be turned in.

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,685
Yeah, you're probably right...

179
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,044
I'll hand them over to Uiharu later on.

180
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,806
I wanted to ask you...

181
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:13,661
Have you by chance heard any rumors about
who's responsible for distributing those cards?

182
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:14,679
Huh...

183
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,983
Now that you mention it, I haven't heard anything.

184
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,018
Hmmm...

185
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:21,830
Well, I'll see you later.

186
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,904
We can bring Uiharu next time, too.

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,077
Yeah, sure.

188
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,241
All right! Bye!

189
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,836
Have a good one! Bye!

190
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,310
Aw, man...

191
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,769
I ended up wasting the entire day on that...

192
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:35,391
I didn't get any shopping done at all.

193
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,020
Tellin' ya, it's true.

194
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,311
I was going into an alley in Block E to take a leak.

195
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,322
I saw some chick carefully set down an envelope there.

196
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,539
So I followed her.

197
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:47,776
Yeah, and?

198
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:51,035
Well, I saw her go into a
Multi-tenant building in Block C...

199
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,452
That must be her base.

200
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,848
That's it? Just the one girl?

201
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,580
She's gotta have somebody with her.

202
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,693
Naw, I made sure of it...

203
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:59,697
The sweet girlie is all by herself.

204
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,666
Let's check it out, then.

205
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,977
So you're sure that she's alone?

206
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:05,480
I staked the place out.

207
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,100
That is some work ethic, man.

208
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,613
Haven't heard anything this good in a while, huh?

209
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,282
Hey, Kuroko? Yeah... It's me...

210
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,451
Listen... I need a little favor.

211
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,894
Oh! Good, you're back!

212
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,673
Are you all done with the count?

213
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,635
Yep. Today's total is...

214
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:29,617
Seventy-three incidents.

215
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,912
It gets higher and higher each day, huh?

216
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,613
So, why isn't Shirai here?

217
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:36,885
Apparently something important
came up and she had to take off.

218
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,505
Oh, yeah?

219
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:39,682
Well...

220
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:43,247
If you need me, I'll be eating... Eating... Eating...

221
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:44,036
Yes, hello?

222
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,006
Oh... hey, Saten...

223
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:47,681
Huh?

224
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,884
Oh... Really? You found one of the Money Cards, too?

225
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,436
Yes, sure, that's fine.

226
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:54,885
Tomorrow or whenever...

227
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:56,718
Oh, one other thing...

228
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:00,427
No problem...

229
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:03,811
You just need me to hang out with
Haru'ue until you get back, right?

230
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,298
Thanks. I appreciate it.

231
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,537
Oh, hold on a second.

232
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,190
There was something I wanted to ask you about.

233
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:12,257
What? Did I see Misaka today?

234
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:18,357
Yes... She was actually here with Shirai earlier
this afternoon dropping off one of the Money Cards.

235
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,477
She was, really?

236
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,680
All right, then, I guess I must've been wrong.

237
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:23,784
I probably just mistook someone else for her...

238
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,171
No... It's nothing, really...

239
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,153
I'll see you later.

240
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:34,027
This makes no sense. It looked just like her.

241
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,519
What? Misaka has a look-alike?

242
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:40,699
Yes... Saten said she saw her earlier today.

243
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,727
Now that you mention it...

244
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,823
there were stories about Level 5 clones a long time ago.

245
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:47,929
Seriously?

246
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:53,949
There was some research facility somewhere that
used cloning technology to try mass-producing Level 5s.

247
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,531
Or so the story goes.

248
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,166
That does sort of sound like Academy City

249
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,770
and like a rumor Saten would sink her teeth into.

250
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,772
Absolutely.

251
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:10,484
Coming!

252
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:14,178
Oh, Head Resident... Nice of you to drop by...

253
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,085
I see you're as diligent as ever.

254
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:21,202
Hey... where is Misaka?

255
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,577
Can you hear me, Kuroko?

256
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,372
Where did you put the shampoo?

257
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,129
Shampoo? I should get that for her...

258
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,345
If you'll please excuse me, Head Resident...

259
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,791
Just a second, Sissy, I'm getting it!

260
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:35,769
Geez, can't you move any faster?!

261
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,901
Okay, okay.

262
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,019
Kuroko, my towel is all w...

263
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:44,687
Why are you coming in...

264
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,103
Aren't I a good roommate, Sissy?

265
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,756
Fooling the head resident because you
didn't make it back home before curfew...

266
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:56,227
Imagine what would have happened if I
hadn't had my "Secret Sissy Voice Collection."

267
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,788
You would've been in big trouble.

268
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,769
It's been a while since you've been late like this...

269
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,295
It used to happen a lot more frequently.

270
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:07,900
Where are you?

271
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,668
Hey! Hope you don't mind some company.

272
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,142
Take it nice and easy and nothing has to get violent.

273
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,472
Was there something that you needed?

274
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:27,869
It's like this.

275
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:30,070
You know those cards you've been spreading around town?

276
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:33,157
We thought we'd stop by and
take all the rest of 'em from ya.

277
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,051
Easy, now!

278
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,761
It would be a real pain for us if
you hit some kind of panic button,

279
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,313
so I think we'll just take a look in there ourselves...

280
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:44,702
Hey!

281
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:45,688
On it.

282
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:49,929
What the...

283
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,275
Looks like she's only got two of 'em here.

284
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:52,879
What?

285
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,435
There's none over here, either...

286
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,732
We came all the way out here for
two freakin' cards? Are you kidding?

287
00:15:58,065 --> 00:15:58,670
Yeah.

288
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,411
I'd rather not raise my hand against
a woman. It's really not my style...

289
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:03,764
So why don't you just tell us where they are...

290
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,259
There aren't any more here.

291
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:06,960
Understand?

292
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,000
They've already been distributed.

293
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:10,611
No way, she's lying.

294
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:13,908
And you seem a little too
relaxed, considering the situation.

295
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,189
What's with you... huh?

296
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:16,776
Hey, you're right...

297
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,405
You think she has an ability?

298
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,358
So what if she does?

299
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,584
There aren't many of them that can
do anything against a group this big...

300
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,001
For now, let's search this place top to bottom...

301
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,431
You. Keep an eye on her, got it?

302
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:35,939
Yeah... Sure.

303
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:37,984
What are you so spooked about?

304
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,651
Spooked? What? I'm not spooked!

305
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,812
Hey... Shut up and do it already.

306
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,118
Any luck over there?

307
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,390
Nothing... Damn it, where are they?

308
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:50,335
Shut up and keep looking.

309
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,488
Damn... I don't know what it is...

310
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,816
but something about this chick creeps me out.

311
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:58,375
That school badge...

312
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,663
I've seen it somewhere.

313
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,546
Nagatenjoki Academy?

314
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:03,898
No way...

315
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,654
That's the most elite school in the whole entire city!

316
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:10,029
And that's gotta mean this
girl is a high-level ability user!

317
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,383
No, hold on, calm down...

318
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,559
That place is different than Tokiwadai.

319
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:17,919
They take students who are good
at other things besides abilities...

320
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,813
So she may not have one, after all.

321
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,424
Maybe she's just smart.

322
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,389
What're ya' staring at?

323
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,098
Your skin... it looks a little pale...

324
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,584
Are you sure you feel okay?

325
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:31,903
B-back off.

326
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,085
You're breathing hard, too.

327
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,210
And that's a nasty cold sweat.

328
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:39,977
It looks like you're shaking pretty badly.

329
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:40,419
Hey!

330
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,839
Almost like...

331
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,480
How did you know that?

332
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,656
I just do.

333
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:51,333
Ahhh!

334
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:52,398
Hey, what's wrong?

335
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,435
What... what the hell did you do?

336
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,788
Man... she's got one!

337
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,131
She's got an ability!

338
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:06,181
If she did, wouldn't she have attacked
us earlier and been done with it?

339
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,361
But she isn't packing...

340
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:09,322
How else could she have taken out our guy?

341
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:11,133
There's a condition to activate it.

342
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,411
My ability...

343
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:17,393
It's called "Critical." It can only be
used against those I've come into contact with.

344
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,214
It takes one touch.

345
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,202
After that, no matter how far you
run... no matter where you hide...

346
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:25,736
I can end your life.

347
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,835
Yeah, right... Just another lie.

348
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:29,437
You expect us to believe you?

349
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,576
There's no ability like that. Give it up already.

350
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,772
Whether you believe me or not is totally up to you...

351
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,151
There are many variations of the ability
that I possess, but they are real enough.

352
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:45,264
I can trace and tamper with others
using their AIM diffusion fields.

353
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:46,346
Of course...

354
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:50,919
to Level Zeroes, such as yourselves...
that description may not mean very much.

355
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,361
Please... That's a buncha crap, and you know it.

356
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:55,840
Hey! What's with you?

357
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,166
I... I touched her before...

358
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,700
What's gonna happen to me?

359
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,544
If what she's saying is true, I could be a gonner!

360
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,284
Don't freak out, you moron...

361
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,493
It's like I already said, she's full of it.

362
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:07,749
M-Maybe, but...

363
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:10,554
It's not gonna do us any good
to start fighting each other.

364
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,126
Very true.

365
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:17,536
Fighting amongst friends is never the answer.

366
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:21,326
Come on!

367
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,209
Hey! What do I do now?

368
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,352
Just calm down!

369
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,899
Shut up... I can take care of this.

370
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:33,680
What?

371
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:37,988
What was that?

372
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:40,012
Hey... you guys...!

373
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,266
Damn... What the hell is going on here?

374
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,278
You're kidding, right?

375
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,174
Oh, good. Only one more to go.

376
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,106
Lights off again?

377
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,763
I'll get her! I'll get her good!

378
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,142
I can hear you!

379
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,792
Crap... My pipe! Where did it go?

380
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:34,466
Damn! What's she doing to me?

381
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:38,368
What's happening? Turn on the liiigghts!

382
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,185
All it takes is one touch.

383
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,085
Now my ability has you. Don't worry. It's all right.

384
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,150
It will be over before you can feel any pain...

385
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:53,960
Just like it was when I took care of your friends.

386
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,400
Wait, you don't have to!

387
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:59,428
I'll get out of here... I'll
leave! I'm sorry! Don't kill me!

388
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,669
It's simple, really.

389
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,308
All I have to do now is lower my hand.

390
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:12,206
Three... Two... One... Zero...

391
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,150
Noooo!!

392
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:22,787
Well. I got a pretty decent 'pop' out of this thing.

393
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,279
That was an impressive show you
put on. Special effects and all.

394
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,847
The whole time I was waiting
to step in if things got ugly...

395
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,691
I never expected you to neutralize
this many Skill Outs so easily...

396
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:41,163
And all with just narrative,
showmanship, and... what is that?

397
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,626
Some kind of anesthetic?

398
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:48,585
Is something wrong?

399
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,210
So, it's you...

400
00:21:58,222 --> 00:21:59,034
The Original.

401
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,280
So, it's you... the Original.

402
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,163
That's right!

403
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:38,197
My original "Secret Sissy Voice Collection"
played a vital role in this episode!

404
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:39,079
No, it did not!
