1
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:10,752
Ah!

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,128
Ow! Damn it.

3
00:00:14,323 --> 00:00:15,788
I don't have time for this.

4
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:17,290
I've got to hurry.

5
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,992
Is that zap earlier making my legs shake?

6
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:23,056
Is it that?

7
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,093
Or, on the inside, am I just terrified?

8
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:30,860
Ah, I may talk a good game, but I'm pathetic.

9
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:33,294
No time for self-pity.

10
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:34,537
I need to get a grip.

11
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:35,635
It's starting in...

12
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:41,546
Seriously?

13
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:43,824
Of all times to freeze up!

14
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:46,192
The electric shock!

15
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:01,704
Hey, come on.

16
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,426
Aren't you guys all supposed to be
mentally linked together or something?

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,139
I gave one of your buddies a big
hint during the last experiment.

18
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:10,609
Shouldn't you have had time to learn from it by now?

19
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,441
Hey.

20
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:21,381
We have a visitor.

21
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:23,772
How do you suppose that plays into everything?

22
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:31,979
It's you, but what are you doing here?

23
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:43,195
What, are you inviting members of the
general public to our testing sites, now?

24
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:44,950
That's irritating.

25
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:49,298
See, I didn't budget any time for
silencing outsiders who discovered our secret.

26
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:50,807
Step away from her.

27
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,064
What the hell?

28
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:54,153
Did you say something?

29
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,943
Step away now.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,743
Get away from Misaka's sister.

31
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:06,889
I mean it!

32
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:09,439
Get away from her now, you damn loser!

33
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:48,071
Why? Why are you?

34
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:52,313
"Get away from her." Is that what you said?

35
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,363
You've got a set. Talking like that.

36
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,527
There are seven Level 5 espers.

37
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:02,886
I am undeniably the most powerful one in the entire city,

38
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,518
and you stand there calling me a loser?

39
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,146
I'm sick of repeating myself.

40
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:10,117
Get the hell away from her!

41
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,031
Oh, yeah?

42
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,034
I have to admit, you're intriguing.

43
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,879
But instead of getting away from her.

44
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,001
How about, I get her away from me.

45
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,305
That was a close one!

46
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,091
"What is this?"

47
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,800
"What in the world are you doing here?"

48
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,113
Misaka asks in utter shock.

49
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,259
Why would you take such a risk for somebody like Misaka?

50
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:51,185
As long as the necessary chemicals
and equipment are available.

51
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:54,457
Misakas can be manufactured with the touch of a button.

52
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,462
The bodies are fabricated, stocked with borrowed minds.

53
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:01,210
The process has been repeated many times.

54
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:06,257
There are still nine thousand nine hundred
and sixty eight untouched units ready for use.

55
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,252
Yet for the sake of a laboratory rat, you would...

56
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,361
I don't care.

57
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:14,932
Manufactured or not, it doesn't matter to me.

58
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,388
And you're more than just a bunch of chemicals now.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,706
After all.

60
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,106
You're still the only one of
you in the whole world, right?

61
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,553
That's why I came here.

62
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,916
Sorry, but, you aren't going to be dying.

63
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:31,692
Not today.

64
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,912
You've still got accounts to settle.

65
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,064
"He'll kill you."

66
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:41,024
Says Misaka.

67
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,390
Nice speech.

68
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:46,338
Did you just come up with that,
or have you been practicing?

69
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:49,591
So, do they ever give you a day off?

70
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:50,206
What?

71
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,908
Last night, in that back alley.

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,388
Oh. You saw the work I did there, huh?

73
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,462
Blood flow manipulation.

74
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,319
My first time, too.

75
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,443
Hell of a performance though, don't you think?

76
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:07,709
I mean, who knew there was that
much blood swimmin' around in a person?

77
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:11,514
Ha! But wind-up dolls aren't people, right?

78
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,284
Enough.

79
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,014
I thought that maybe they had you doing this
against your will, but now, I see how wrong I was.

80
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,962
I'm gonna make sure you don't hurt these girls.

81
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:24,678
Ever again.

82
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:32,045
Heh.

83
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,798
Oh man, you're slow!

84
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:47,163
Seriously. This is pathetic.

85
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,307
If that's the best you can do,
you don't stand a chance in hell.

86
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,005
Damn.

87
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:16,053
Heh, heh, heh.

88
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:22,686
I couldn't stop him.

89
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,941
I tried. But I failed at that, too.

90
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:32,481
Then again. I wouldn't put it past that
guy to do something even I couldn't do.

91
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,552
Like it was nothing.

92
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:38,645
Of course, it's a lot more likely
that he'll get himself killed.

93
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:45,971
Hey, kitty. Have we met?

94
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:48,704
Was that you stuck up that tree?

95
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,309
Heh. I'm sorry.

96
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:55,204
It's kinda difficult to tell you apart, you know?

97
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,253
Like the sisters.

98
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:59,350
They're the same on the outside,

99
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,146
but each one of them still has her own life.

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,314
They're people.

101
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,544
There's a reason I can't leave this up to anyone else.

102
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:12,800
I can't.

103
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,082
Saving them is still my responsibility.

104
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:19,030
Now, let's go.

105
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:29,811
Hold on.

106
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,178
Could he be?

107
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,803
By any chance, are you a non-esper?

108
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,944
The way you showed up and started trash
talking, I thought you must have... some rank,

109
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,495
but now I'm starting to think I was wrong about that.

110
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,132
You're the smallest fry out there, aren't you?

111
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:50,267
I don't like this.

112
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:55,561
There have been any number of misguided
idiots who have challenged me to a fight,

113
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:58,102
hoping to win top-dog status.

114
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,422
And there's always a moment,

115
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,529
frequently after losing an eye or a limb.

116
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,674
when they realize their mistake.

117
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:09,487
Their faces contort in an agony of regret and terror.

118
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,410
Tch.

119
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,968
And then there's this guy.

120
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,116
Come on.

121
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,704
You've gotta know by now I'm
exponentially stronger than you.

122
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:26,226
Of course, if you want to die that badly,
I'm happy to oblige by blowing you to pieces.

123
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,644
You see that container over there?

124
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:30,518
Seems there was flour in it.

125
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,642
And there's no wind tonight, either. It's nice and calm.

126
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:38,312
That could turn this into a really dangerous situation.

127
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:48,975
Hey third-string, have you ever heard
of something called a dust explosion?

128
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:07,516
Yeah.

129
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:09,778
Dust explosions are nasty.

130
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:14,197
Next time I try that, I should remember
not to put myself in the middle of it, though.

131
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:17,535
I always thought I could survive even a nuclear explosion.

132
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,407
I may need to reconsider that.

133
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:20,560
Oh?

134
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,134
You're going to keep trying to fight me?

135
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:24,967
Really?

136
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:33,597
An explosion?

137
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,250
Oh, no! Is he?

138
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,136
Sorry.

139
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,528
But I can't drag you into this mess, too.

140
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,519
In a way you're actually lucky
that you don't have any esper ability.

141
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,612
My "Reflection" skill doesn't
work well on somebody so weak.

142
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:59,101
You know, strange as it is,
you've done pretty well so far.

143
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:03,198
You're still alive, and, considering
I'm your opponent, that's a miracle.

144
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,357
I'm getting bored, though.

145
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,799
So let's put an end to this, shall we?

146
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,664
Pick a hand, any hand.

147
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,852
It doesn't matter which touches you.

148
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:16,276
With either one I can reverse the flow
of your blood, resulting in a messy death.

149
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:18,032
So, which one will it be?

150
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
The right hand?

151
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:21,433
Or the left hand?

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,173
Or both?

153
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,046
Ehh... moon?

154
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,423
What am I looking at the moon for?

155
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:45,641
I guess because I'm flat on my back.

156
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,548
But what the hell am I doing lying on the ground?

157
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,210
Huh? Him?

158
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,713
He was just in front of me. How did he?

159
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:58,577
Wait. Never mind where he is. How is
he still standing there in one piece?

160
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,245
What the? I'm hurt?

161
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,218
I'm even bleeding?

162
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,529
What the hell happened here?!

163
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,104
He knocked me on my ass?

164
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,297
Me? Impossible!

165
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,013
If he did that, his arm should be broken.

166
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,063
How could he even touch me?

167
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:25,358
I must've focused everything into my hands,
shutting down the "Reflection" around the rest of me.

168
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,012
Damn, what an idiotic move!

169
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,946
Impressive. Ha, heh, ha, ha!

170
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,680
No, I mean it. That was good.

171
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:38,348
A solid hit! I'll give you that.
You really nailed me! But now!

172
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,539
No way.

173
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:12,920
He's fighting Accelerator, and he's on the offensive?

174
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,470
Against the strongest guy in Academy City?

175
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:17,876
He's basically a stranger.

176
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,194
We're certainly not friends.

177
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:21,823
He could walk away.

178
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,784
Nobody would blame him.

179
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:26,805
But instead...

180
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,450
He's keeping his promise.

181
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,501
Damn you! Stop moving!

182
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:40,271
What is the deal with your right hand, huh?

183
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:48,278
I wouldn't get too carried
away if I were you, Third string!

184
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,797
You should never have gotten involved with this.

185
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,562
So many Sisters, living the best that they can.

186
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:11,796
They use up all their strength just to fight you.

187
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,414
They deserve better.

188
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,118
They're living beings.

189
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:19,534
Not fodder for some ruthless bastard.

190
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,903
They're living?

191
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,542
What's he talking about?

192
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:31,125
They're just wind-up dolls.

193
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,524
That's what they said, isn't it?

194
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,450
I need power.

195
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,327
The power to make him stop saying this stuff.

196
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,290
No, more.

197
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,707
I need the dominion over reason and rules

198
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,687
that comes from absolute power!

199
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,398
Where did all this wind come from?

200
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,977
Is, is he?

201
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:35,505
No.

202
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,267
No!

203
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:43,139
The air, the wind, the atmosphere.

204
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,046
I can win this fight.

205
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:48,945
I've got the means to kill that
piece of crap right here, all around me.

206
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,388
If I could control the direction of the
air that's flowing through the atmosphere.

207
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:58,250
If I could control the world's wind
currents, I could destroy anything I want to.

208
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,243
My reach would be infinite.

209
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:02,984
My power would be absolutely unstoppable!

210
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,805
The strongest esper in Academy City?

211
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,313
The only Level 6?

212
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,159
I wouldn't need that anymore!

213
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:12,781
There would be nothing and nobody
in the universe who could stop me!

214
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,801
The world and everything in it is in my hand!

215
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,233
Compress it. Compress all the air!

216
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:22,163
Hey, third string!

217
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:25,350
You have given me a fantastic idea!

218
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:28,154
What happened to all that spunk you had?

219
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,267
Come on! Get up! Get up!

220
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,136
I need you to stick with me for a little longer here.

221
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,043
Okay?

222
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,888
It's almost over now!

223
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,070
Accelerator!

224
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,901
Stay right where you are.

225
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:50,019
D... Don't do it.

226
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:51,840
Misaka...

227
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,880
I can't believe it.

228
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:56,334
He's alive!

229
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:00,238
I'm sorry. I know you wanted a happy ending,

230
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,701
but once I die, the experiments will finally be over.

231
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:05,645
It might be selfish.

232
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:10,388
I know that, but still... I
don't want you to die because of me.

233
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,225
So now.

234
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:24,054
What in the world is that?

235
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:28,304
He's compressing the wind into one point to create plasma?

236
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:29,879
What's his plan?

237
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,484
To blow this whole area away?

238
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:35,512
Those eyes. They're so blank.

239
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,459
He paid me no more attention than an insect.

240
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:43,281
Obviously the only thing he's interested
in at all right now is testing his new power.

241
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,839
What do I do? What can I...

242
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,933
He's compressing all the wind in the city into one point.

243
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:54,358
Maybe, if I use all the windmills around town.

244
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,439
Sure, But how?

245
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,179
I can't do it by myself!

246
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,663
Please! You have to wake up!

247
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,530
She's freezing.

248
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,290
In the shape she's in now, how can I ask this of her?

249
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,363
I realize that I'm asking a lot of you,

250
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,018
and with everything that's happened,
I know I don't have the right.

251
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:27,868
But please!

252
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:30,276
Please, there's something I need you to do!

253
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:33,160
It's, it's something that only you can do!

254
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,208
I hate this!

255
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,879
Why do I have to be so damn powerless?

256
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:40,197
I can't do this.

257
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,571
I can't protect everyone myself!

258
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:44,545
The Ace of Tokiwadai?

259
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:47,118
One of only seven Level 5s.

260
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,144
And I can't do anything!

261
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,424
I can't heal her injuries.

262
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,475
I can't stop Accelerator.

263
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:56,645
I can't give Kamijo the ending he wants!

264
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,136
Please get up! I'm begging you!

265
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,387
Get up and do what you can. Not for me, but for him!

266
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:09,222
I am confused.

267
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:14,140
I'm not sure I understand everything you are saying.

268
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,222
But for some reason...

269
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,327
I find your words moving.

270
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,616
So I am happy to help you.

271
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,232
Amazing!

272
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,249
It's like a part of my body!

273
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:30,292
Like moving my own arms or legs!

274
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:33,453
All of this air is completely under my control!

275
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:34,919
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

276
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:40,361
So fighting someone stronger really was a shortcut
to leveling up! Guess they were right all along!

277
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:42,216
Thanks, third-string!

278
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,881
You served your purpose well,

279
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,165
and now I'm going to destroy you!

280
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,255
How could this be happening now?

281
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,781
It looks like the plasma is diffusing.

282
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,424
I know there were no glitches in my calculations,

283
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:00,025
and this is too irregular to be a natural wind.

284
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,036
Thanks, you did great.

285
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,930
You can let me take it from here.

286
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,308
I should be able to create a big
enough opening for them to escape.

287
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:13,460
I can do it.

288
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,781
If Misaka interferes with the target

289
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,959
he will focus his attention on her and be distracted.

290
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,806
Then you can take the boy, and leave this place.

291
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,647
I don't think so.

292
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:29,032
You've already done more than enough.
Let your big sister take it from here.

293
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:36,732
Why is the wind suddenly acting like this?

294
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,755
It's not wind manipulation. So, what?

295
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:42,327
The windmills are turning the wrong way.

296
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:45,769
Hold on. I've heard about this before.

297
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,847
It's something about dynamo motors.

298
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:50,940
When they're hit by particular
electromagnetic waves, they...

299
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:51,988
Is it them?

300
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:53,284
Damn it.

301
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,152
What do they think they're doing?

302
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:58,673
Those windmills aren't just spinning around haphazardly.

303
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,596
They're being directed to disrupt my formulas!

304
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,252
She's doing it!

305
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,297
The images she sees are going across the network!

306
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,365
I'm gonna' kill you!

307
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:25,687
I won't let you!

308
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,055
That voice.

309
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:36,179
You managed to defeat me, both
in town and out by the riverbed.

310
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,141
They're nothing but big computers

311
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,414
programmed to control us.

312
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:43,420
If my one life can save ten thousand of theirs,

313
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:44,975
that's a good thing isn't it?

314
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,763
It's not much, but maybe it's enough?

315
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:50,670
Please, help.

316
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,697
Somebody help.

317
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:56,407
Please help me.

318
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:35,574
I'm not gonna to let any of you
weaklings stand in my way anymore!

319
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:38,888
No matter what, I will become invincible!
