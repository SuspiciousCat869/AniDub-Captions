1
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,000
So, like I was saying...

2
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:07,961
Good morning!

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:08,238
Eh?

4
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:10,765
Oh, hey. It's Misaka...

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,872
Um... You got here pretty quickly, huh?

6
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:17,551
Huh? Quickly? No... Same time as normal.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,212
Really? But we just saw you in town.

8
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,368
Yeah, it was definitely you, and you were
walking in the opposite direction from the school.

9
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:27,625
Oh... well, that's impossible, isn't it?

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,358
You must've seen someone who looks like me.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,134
Clones? That's crazy!

12
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:36,634
I mean it!

13
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:41,345
There's a story that's been going around
about a project designed to clone Level 5 espers.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,528
You haven't heard of it?

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,183
No, I haven't.

16
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,223
Sounds pretty amazing though?

17
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,044
Really? The rumors get dumber every day.

18
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:50,514
Seriously!

19
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,212
You mean they're mass-producing them to use as weapons!

20
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:55,194
Oh, yeah, it'll be common practice soon.

21
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:56,115
No way!

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,789
Absolutely!

23
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,911
That's ridiculous.

24
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:01,372
Think about it:

25
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:04,416
there are only seven Level 5s in Academy City, right?

26
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,609
So, which of them are they cloning?

27
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:08,794
Oh, come on!

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,496
Well... That's just the thing.
I heard who they might be using.

29
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:14,190
The Level 5 is supposedly that Railgun girl.

30
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:52,581
So, it's you...

31
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,854
The Original.

32
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,898
Original? Sorry?

33
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,681
You must at least have heard the rumors, right?

34
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,318
What rumors?

35
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,679
Hmph... I have to say, I'm surprised.

36
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,477
I guess the students at Nagatenjoki
like gossip as much as anyone, huh?

37
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,376
So... that's all?

38
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:24,444
You've heard some rumors, but
do you actually know anything...

39
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,397
You are still a middle-schooler.

40
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,384
But I am a high-schooler...

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,698
And you will observe my seniority...

42
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,542
Basically... Watch your tone with me.

43
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:41,913
I... I was just wondering if you had
any more substantial information about it.

44
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,121
More than you do...

45
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,567
Although, from what I can tell...

46
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:49,834
Their methods and objectives have
changed considerably since I was there.

47
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:53,887
Knowing more would only hurt you.

48
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,415
What's the point when there's
nothing you can do about it, anyway?

49
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,277
I asked you for information, not for protection...

50
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,703
And what do you mean <i>I</i> can't do anything?

51
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,723
Are you saying there's something that you can...

52
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,881
Is there, maybe, something that you can do?

53
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,579
I have taken some action already.

54
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,457
Distributing those Money Cards was part of the plan.

55
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,795
The plan to eliminate this city's blind spots.

56
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:25,986
Placing the Money Cards all over directs
people's attention to the alleys and back streets

57
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,933
that the surveillance cameras don't reach.

58
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:35,615
By doing so, I hoped I could put an end to the
experiments that have been taking place in the shadows.

59
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:37,624
Of course...

60
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:42,644
I was careless enough to let myself be spotted
by those thugs and they followed me back here.

61
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,276
If they had seen this,

62
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,120
it could have created some serious problems for me...

63
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:51,988
As always...

64
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,743
Leaving physical evidence isn't smart.

65
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:58,153
I'm not legitimately renting this place, either.

66
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:01,068
It would be best if we got
out of here before they woke up.

67
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,148
Hold on a second!

68
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,950
I mean... Please tell me...

69
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,620
What are you even talking about?

70
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,756
And who exactly are you?

71
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,398
Now you're thinking...

72
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:24,052
"As long as I'm destroying physical evidence,
shouldn't I get rid of the witnesses, too?"

73
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:25,342
Whoa, I am not!

74
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,669
Come on, we need to get these guys...

75
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,086
Not my problem.

76
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:30,607
Eh?!

77
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,686
What's going on? Is it a fire?

78
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,905
Yeah, a small one...

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,898
Doesn't look like anyone was hurt, though.

80
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,800
Man! Who was that psycho?

81
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,790
She actually got two good hits on me...

82
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:52,782
and said nothing I understood.

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,504
Why am I taking anything she said seriously?

84
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,109
That's it! I'm just wasting my time...

85
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:06,705
I'm going to head home, have a
nice shower... and hit the sack.

86
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,968
It's ridiculous...

87
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,837
I don't care how many people said it, it isn't true...

88
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,511
There's just no way...

89
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,546
There are no clones of me.

90
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:21,724
Although...

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,614
As you can see, the model DNA information is
absolutely indispensable to cloning technology...

92
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:31,569
It's true...

93
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:34,183
I did give someone my DNA map once...

94
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:36,130
but that was a long time ago...

95
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,109
and it was for a different reason...

96
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,802
I'm sure he put it to good use.

97
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,082
Besides... not long afterwards...

98
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,371
that hospital was closed down for good... and now...

99
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,753
She goes to Nagatenjoki Academy.

100
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:58,612
I can hack into the student records...

101
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:05,487
Academy City's public telephone
net terminal security is Rank D.

102
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:09,689
The data terminals used by
school faculty members are Rank B.

103
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,390
However... if I just use my ability...

104
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,531
Right there!

105
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,756
"Shinobu, Nunotaba...

106
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,972
Third year of high school... Age seventeen."

107
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:28,169
Has distinguished herself in the field of
biological psychiatry from a young age...

108
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:32,833
Worked with Yamashita University Hospital
Network and Higuchi Pharmaceuticals..."

109
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:35,543
Eh?! Hold on! Yamashita?!

110
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,000
She was really there then?

111
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,498
So she might actually know something...

112
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:48,427
"...and Higuchi Pharmaceuticals, collaborating
on a project at the Seventh Research Center...

113
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,399
She later re-enrolled in school."

114
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,213
So is that the place where they've got my DNA map?

115
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,851
Knowing more would only hurt you.

116
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:00,355
What's the point when there's
nothing you can do about it, anyway?

117
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,271
Asking her for more answers won't do any good.

118
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,136
She'll just keep evading the question.

119
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,480
All right!

120
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,908
I guess I'll have to sneak into this place!

121
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,275
Going in my uniform would be a bad idea.

122
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,367
I'll take this along with it, please.

123
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,757
'Kay... Oh, yes.

124
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,688
I can tell these will look adorable on you!

125
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:25,928
Cash or card?

126
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,462
Oh... I'll pay with cash, thanks.

127
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,195
Got the clothes.

128
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:34,509
And now I need to find somewhere
I can go to change into them.

129
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,332
Unfortunately, all of our single rooms are occupied.

130
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:42,017
We do have some doubles...

131
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,169
All right... I'll take one of those, please.

132
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,994
This room's kind of a waste just for changing my clothes.

133
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,862
Well... Here goes.

134
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,699
Wow, those are all yours?

135
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,985
Pretty impressive, huh?

136
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,204
Well, to be honest, Misaka did help me find them...

137
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,334
Now... I know there are a lot
of people looking for them...

138
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:08,672
but finding this many in a single day has to be a record!

139
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,515
When you add them all up, it's quite a tidy sum.

140
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:15,185
Really? Then I wonder if that means I'm rich, too.

141
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:19,920
You... you found these? All of them?

142
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:23,647
Before term started, I wanted to
familiarize myself with the area.

143
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,086
I collected these while I was exploring.

144
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:29,652
Hey, I'm home! Sorry I'm so late.

145
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,583
Thanks for doing this, Saten...

146
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,030
You know how things can be when we've got a new case...

147
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,440
Uh... are you okay?

148
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,210
I've been beaten.

149
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,475
Uh... I'm sorry...

150
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:44,753
Anyway, I hope you're all hungry
because I bought all of us a supper!

151
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:46,052
Ooh, I'm starving!

152
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,552
Mmm... it smells delicious!

153
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:50,356
Yeah.

154
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,631
It doesn't sound so good to me.

155
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,078
I like this stuff as much as the next person...

156
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,556
But maybe you could've gotten something cold instead?

157
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:01,622
Really?

158
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,575
I actually think it was a perfect choice...

159
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:06,173
Hot meals taste even better in hot weather!

160
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,518
It's so good!

161
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,076
You've converted her.

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,415
Wow, these are delicious, Haru'ue!

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,268
You think so?

164
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:24,363
Mm-hmm. Oh, that's right... I forgot.
You've taken up cooking lately, haven't you?

165
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,090
Oh, yeah?

166
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,356
Uh... Well... I'm still learning.

167
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:29,094
Really?

168
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:32,098
As far as I'm concerned, this is just about perfect!

169
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,757
You know my secret?

170
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,871
I add a little bit of soy sauce
and oyster sauce to the mix.

171
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,614
It's absolutely fantastic!

172
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:40,431
Mmm-hmm...

173
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,879
I think it's exactly what this meal needed!

174
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,499
It complements the strawberries' sweetness, huh?

175
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:46,709
It sure does!

176
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,420
I just realized I used up the rice.

177
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:51,850
We don't have any for tomorrow.

178
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,263
That's okay...

179
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,242
I'm sure we can make do without it...

180
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:59,596
Although... It would be nice if we
had a larger rice cooker, wouldn't it?

181
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,780
You two do eat a lot of the stuff, huh?

182
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:04,609
Do... Do we, really?

183
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,254
Oh... by the way, Saten...

184
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,790
I was wondering, what did you mean
by what you said on the phone earlier?

185
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:13,411
Huh? About what?

186
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,739
The stuff you were saying about Misaka...

187
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,940
Something about a mistaken identity?

188
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,663
Oh, that. It was no big deal, really...

189
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,798
I just thought I saw somebody
who looked like her that's all...

190
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:25,646
Although...

191
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,421
Oh... never mind...

192
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:34,371
They say everybody in the world
has a look-alike out there somewhere.

193
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:39,083
I probably just thought it was her
because she was wearing a Tokiwadai Uniform.

194
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,649
Now that you mention it...

195
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:44,930
Misaka and Shirai always seem
to be wearing their uniforms.

196
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:49,783
Tokiwadai requires students to wear
uniforms at all times, even outside of school.

197
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,515
That's pretty strict.

198
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,216
I can see why you might think that...

199
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:56,607
but those uniforms are constant
proof that they are young ladies.

200
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:00,753
I have a hard time imagining Misaka
wearing anything but her uniform.

201
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,367
Oh, yeah?

202
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:03,369
Okay, but still...

203
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,435
It would be nice to see them in
street clothes sometimes, you know?

204
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:14,707
Okay... well...

205
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,135
Alright! Here I go!

206
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,093
That was a close one...

207
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,397
She seemed bound and determined
to find someone to punish tonight.

208
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,410
Still not back.

209
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,145
It's long past curfew now. What are you doing out there?

210
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,786
Oh, Sissy!!

211
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:54,186
Oh, how improper of me. I should be ashamed of myself!

212
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:59,500
But then... It has been a really long time!

213
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,823
Siiissssy!!

214
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:11,690
What the... What was that? I just
got a creepy chill down my spine.

215
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,486
Oh, well... It's gone now.

216
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:19,354
Transform! Magical Powered Kanam...

217
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:20,616
Huh?

218
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,143
Hey, what's going on with this thing?

219
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,815
I just bought it... Stupid piece of junk.

220
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:29,563
Okay! Are you ready!

221
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:30,261
Oh, that did it.

222
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,821
Ugh! I lost again?

223
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,165
Hah! You get to make the rounds now.

224
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:52,858
Yeah, I know... Don't rub it in.

225
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:55,347
I still don't see why we have to do rounds...

226
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,139
This place has airtight security.

227
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:57,841
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:00,095
Quit your griping already and get to it.

229
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,492
I'm goin'!

230
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,382
Security cameras, infrared sensors, and electronic locks.

231
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:08,646
They've got it all...

232
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,783
But, since everything depends
on electricity, I should be fine.

233
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:17,186
I just have to make sure to keep an eye
out for guards and any other late-night staff.

234
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,789
Hmm? That doesn't make sense...

235
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,215
No departments match what I'm looking for.

236
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,425
Wait... There is a section that has
power but is disconnected from the network.

237
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:31,098
I was wondering why they only put
surveillance cameras in the hallways.

238
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,819
But I guess it's because they don't want other
departments to know what they're researching.

239
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:37,425
All right...

240
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,512
I think I'll start by checking that section.

241
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:41,195
Who's there?

242
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,684
I... I'm not imagining things am I?

243
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,250
Is someone there? Show yourself!

244
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,480
Uh-oh...

245
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,316
What do I do?

246
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:55,099
Worst case, I guess I could always
shock him unconscious and get myself out...

247
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:58,419
But I'd really rather not leave any trace that I was here.

248
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,016
Let me think...

249
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:05,665
What's this?

250
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,336
A security robot! Of course it is...

251
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,252
There's no way anyone could get in here.

252
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,006
Anything to report?

253
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,391
No abnormalities have been detected.

254
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:16,711
No, huh?

255
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,458
Keep it up.

256
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:20,223
Good enough for me. I'll just skip the rest of the patrol.

257
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:25,721
Huh? The alarm?

258
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:26,966
How come?

259
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,945
The sensors shouldn't be able to pick me up!

260
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:30,636
Did I miss something?

261
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:31,376
Keep calm...

262
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,789
Well, for now, at least...

263
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,627
Whoa! What's wrong with you?

264
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,312
Hey! Come back!

265
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,305
What now?

266
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,441
Give up for tonight and get out of here? No.

267
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,382
It doesn't appear to be me they found...

268
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,431
and all this confusion could be my chance...

269
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,552
All right... Keep going!

270
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,648
Hey! What the hell is going on?

271
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,712
Sorry, man!

272
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,554
I totally forgot to tell you...

273
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:09,099
It's too loud! I can't hear you! Just turn it off!

274
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,320
It finally stopped. Who's there?!

275
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,123
Alright, let's see what they're hiding.

276
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,090
What are those?

277
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:41,321
Incubators? Each big enough to hold a person.

278
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:48,552
Can I help you with something?

279
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,657
What are you doing? You aren't lost, are you?

280
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,279
How exactly did you get in here?

281
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:56,266
Oh... Never mind about her.

282
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,365
I got word that she would be coming tonight...

283
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:03,441
She's here to clear her data for that
project. You know, that one they've got frozen.

284
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,771
The idiot watchman forgot to
give her a staff card to get around.

285
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,351
You can take care of this, right?

286
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,445
Just escort the nice young lady here to the secret base.

287
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,476
Oh, so that's what this is about. I see now.

288
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:16,450
Here... You need to put this on.

289
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,536
There are traces of quite a few erased files.

290
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,565
I should be able to restore them.

291
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:29,963
Impossible!

292
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:39,140
"Project Radio Noise... The goal for this
project is to resolve the genetic sequence

293
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:44,988
that gives rise to a Level 5, allowing a Level
5 that is born by chance to then be reproduced

294
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,000
with one hundred percent certainty...

295
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:48,055
Further...

296
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:50,399
... for this project, it has been decided...

297
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:55,078
... that Railgun... Misaka... will serve as the model."

298
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,414
I mean it!

299
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:01,148
There's a story going around about a
project designed to clone Level 5 espers.

300
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,795
Don't act like you don't remember...

301
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,586
It was just a little while ago.

302
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:06,679
You were walking in front of Seventh Mist...

303
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,494
It really exists.

304
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,006
A project to... to... clone me!

305
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,240
To create a new Railgun,

306
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:22,259
we take a fertilized egg and use a cell that has
been extracted from the original Railgun's hair follicle.

307
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:28,639
Prior to this, of course we obtained the
necessary genetic sequence pattern sample.

308
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:35,201
We were then able to successfully register
her DNA map in Academy City's databank.

309
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,754
In order to shorten the time
required to create a test subject...

310
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:44,020
we determined that it was necessary
to curtail the developmental process...

311
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,047
both physically and emotionally.

312
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:54,329
To assist with the development of the body, a
cocktail of ZID-02, RIZ-13, and HEL-03 was administered...

313
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:59,964
and in roughly fourteen days we had successfully created
a subject that was physically identical to Railgun.

314
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:04,963
The development of the mind and persona was dealt
with under the direction of external staff member

315
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:10,244
Nunotaba Shinobu, who used Testament to install
necessary basic information within the brain.

316
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,142
Once the results were confirmed...

317
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:14,740
everything was in order...

318
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:18,251
Project Radio Noise was set to move on to the next phase:

319
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,723
The mass-production of Railgun clones...

320
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,128
also known as Sisters.

321
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:23,566
This is what they were after?

322
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,295
It's the simplest thing in the world.

323
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,169
All you have to do is give us your DNA map, okay?

324
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,423
Stupid girl.

325
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:34,365
Why did you say yes to him? If only...

326
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:38,749
However...

327
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,808
As the project reached its final stage...

328
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:44,516
projections were calculated using Tree Diagram...

329
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:46,876
The results were not what we expected.

330
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:48,975
They used Tree Diagram?

331
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,454
But... that's Academy City's greatest supercomputer...

332
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,774
It hovers in orbit above the Earth.

333
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:56,592
Regrettably, the projections revealed

334
00:19:56,617 --> 00:20:00,899
that the Sisters' specs were less than
one percent of the model Railgun's...

335
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,140
On average...

336
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,047
their ratings reached only as high as Level 2...

337
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:08,425
And even the most powerful
individuals did not exceed Level 3.

338
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,029
Okay, so...

339
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,532
They were only able to make less powerful copies...

340
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,590
But even if they mass-produced a lot of Level 2s...

341
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:19,421
Regardless of genetic manipulation
or acquired development...

342
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:23,184
it was impossible to produce a
Level 5 from among the clones.

343
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,020
Thus...

344
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:28,605
having received Tree Diagram's computed results...

345
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,409
and to minimize the losses incurred by this project...

346
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,930
the committee ordered all of the research
in progress to be terminated immediately.

347
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:43,563
The project intended to mass-produce Railgun
"Sisters" was halted and is frozen in perpetuity.

348
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:57,817
Okay... I knew it!

349
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,560
Of course there aren't any clones of me out there...

350
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:07,470
I'm guessing... word of this ridiculous project leaked
out some how and the Academy City rumor mill did the rest.

351
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:12,389
Whew... Even so, it's a bit freaky...

352
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,741
Imagine, scientists using my DNA map like that.

353
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,839
Well... whatever did happen, at least it's all over.

354
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:29,535
Now... I'm heading home to bed...

355
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:33,624
I wonder if Kuroko managed to trick the
Head Resident and keep me out of trouble.

356
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:48,785
Hey... how much longer is this procedure gonna take?

357
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,269
Total deletion will be complete... in
forty-two point two eight seconds, says Misaka,

358
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,676
reporting the time with careful precision.

359
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,118
Of course there aren't any clones of me out there!

360
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,045
Woah, that's a weight of my chest!

361
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,015
Sissy, you really can't afford to lose
any weight from your chest, you know...

362
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,730
I don't mean it like that!
