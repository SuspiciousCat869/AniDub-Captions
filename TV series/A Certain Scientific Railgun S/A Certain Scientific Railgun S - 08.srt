1
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:07,523
Confirm.

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,399
It's three minutes past the rendezvous time.

3
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:11,941
This is Point A.

4
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:14,532
Confirmed, there's no one in sight yet.

5
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:16,875
All right... So they're no-shows.

6
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:20,007
Guess they realized they were
messing with the wrong people.

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,921
Now you're just being ridiculous.

8
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,304
Hey! Who was that?

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,735
I'm here, as we agreed...

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,265
Closer than you know, in fact.

11
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,532
The deal is off... It's off.

12
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:40,059
Get out of there right now!

13
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:46,763
Who are you?

14
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:47,638
Heh.

15
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:49,920
Ahh!

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,896
You! Stay back!

17
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,475
What's that? Again?

18
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,526
Yeah... Yeah, all right...

19
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:19,536
Fine. So who is it?

20
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,140
Pharmaceuticals? Really?

21
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,175
Isn't that a little...

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,654
Sure, that's true. It's not like
I don't see what you're saying...

23
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:26,728
but, all told...

24
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,493
the whole point of a swimsuit is to
show off your body to other people...

25
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:35,045
so going to a private pool defeats the
purpose of wearing one, if you see what I mean.

26
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,039
Okay.

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,336
But all of the public pools and
beaches are always ultra crowded...

28
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,196
There's no room, so it's next to impossible to swim.

29
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:44,233
Yeah... I guess you're right.

30
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,351
I hadn't thought about that.

31
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:48,494
What do you think, Takitsubo?

32
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,782
Hmm...

33
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:55,474
As long there's space to just float
like a corpse, it doesn't matter to me.

34
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,593
Oh... Okay...

35
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,448
Ladies, let's cut the chit chat while we're working.

36
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,130
Kinuhata, that's enough...

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,425
We've got a new request, so we're heading back.

38
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:07,960
What time?

39
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,542
Good question. The request is somewhat vague.

40
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:11,256
Huh?

41
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:12,298
That said...

42
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,807
our task sounds like it'll be simple enough.

43
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,360
Hey... I don't know how much I like
taking on a job that's so vague...

44
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,704
But, all told, Mugino, you're the boss, so whatever.

45
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:23,300
So, what is the job?

46
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:26,496
Protecting a facility from a mysterious invader...

47
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,793
The pay isn't too bad, either...

48
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,109
I think this is perfect.

49
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,971
Just the kind of job we here at ITEM like to take on.

50
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,643
An esper with the power to control electricity, huh?

51
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,327
The attacks have been conducted

52
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,941
via communications lines,

53
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,716
and no intruder has been caught by electronic security,

54
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:16,913
so that's their guess.

55
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:21,711
Actually... the client seems to have
this rather narrowly profiled already.

56
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,920
So they've got a suspect in mind?

57
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,739
In that case, why don't they
set up their own counterattack?

58
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,212
I think that it would be ultra easy to stage an ambush.

59
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:33,732
You are only to act once the
target is within the facility...

60
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,092
and you are not to pry into the particulars...

61
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,640
those are the client's orders.

62
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,553
Uh? What's with these guys?

63
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,914
I don't like how this job is going so far.

64
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,256
What do you want?

65
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:44,433
A job's a job.

66
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,252
We don't take them because they're fun...

67
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,800
Anyway... they sought you out for this gig...

68
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:50,550
I'm sure they had their reasons...

69
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,323
Now quit your whining and get to work!

70
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:53,301
Okay.

71
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,293
So that's the job...

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,621
just lie in wait then take out the opponent?

73
00:04:58,242 --> 00:04:59,013
Basically.

74
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:00,841
With one catch, though...

75
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,525
There are two facilities that our
mystery attacker could potentially target.

76
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,841
Ooh! I can cover one of them by myself!

77
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:08,330
Huh?

78
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,618
What's with you?

79
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,889
I thought you didn't like this job.

80
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,066
Liking the job has nothing to do with it...

81
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:17,548
I mean if I'm the one to take 'em out,
then I earn the kill shot bonus, don't I?

82
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,186
All right, Frenda...

83
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,162
Just make sure you stay in contact.

84
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:25,348
Don't get in over your head, okay?

85
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,641
Only two places left.

86
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:35,949
Including this one.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,976
At this point, I don't know how
far they've gone with the experiment.

88
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,305
And I don't think I want to know.

89
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:50,758
But either way.

90
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,624
It ends tonight.

91
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:04,343
I volunteered for this 'cause the pay was so enticing...

92
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,668
but waiting around for somebody who may
not even show up certainly is boring...

93
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,241
All told, this really sucks.

94
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:15,869
And if they go to the other facility
while I'm stuck here waiting at this one...

95
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:19,905
then all these tedious minutes of
utter boredom will have been for nothing!

96
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:21,735
No way!

97
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,292
The target's actually here!

98
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:24,920
Well, I'm ready...

99
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,423
Time to earn that kill shot bonus.

100
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:35,949
All right.

101
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,449
The research facility I'm after is on the top floor.

102
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:43,887
If I get lucky...

103
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,509
maybe I can pull this off without a hitch.

104
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,340
Of course not.

105
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,176
Like it would ever actually be that easy.

106
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,234
Not a single one hit her?

107
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,538
Did she use magnetism to divert the stone's path?

108
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:12,304
It looks like the Intel about
an electrical esper was right.

109
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,260
There we go...

110
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:19,662
Ordinarily, this is a tool used
to burn through walls and doors,

111
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:20,860
but tonight...

112
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,600
A bomb?

113
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,811
What kind of scientists are these?

114
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,322
Putting bombs inside of stuffed animals?

115
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:48,091
They're igniting the bombs using fuses
they set up in the room ahead of time...

116
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,137
I don't get it.

117
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,877
Why would they want to make this such a big production?

118
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,935
Wha...? A bomb in the rubble?

119
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,377
They're predicting my moves.

120
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:03,541
Does that mean they know they're
being attacked by an Electromaster?

121
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,191
I was hoping not to use my maximum magnetism...

122
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,683
It does a lot of damage.

123
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,538
Never mind that... Where are they?

124
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,073
More of those fuses?

125
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,877
Maybe if I follow where they lead...

126
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:49,805
She's the one, huh?

127
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:52,194
Are you sure?

128
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,192
Yes... I heard it was pathological analysis.

129
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,979
Word is they're the ones who got hit.

130
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,139
What a relief.

131
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,228
That should buy us some time...

132
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,842
Still, we need to hurry up with our move.

133
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,096
Excuse me...

134
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:06,432
What is it?

135
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,014
Well, uh...

136
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:09,617
There's a visitor.

137
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:13,964
Hello.

138
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,102
I'm sorry if I've kept you waiting...

139
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:17,919
It's nice to meet you...

140
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,423
Uh... please forgive me, but you are?

141
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,865
I'm the one who was in charge of
your company's Testament oversight.

142
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,328
My name's Nunotaba.

143
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,736
Almost!

144
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,556
That stupid girder is in my way.

145
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,847
I don't want any more interference later on.

146
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,221
I'll deal with her now.

147
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,439
She's put up quite a fight so far...

148
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:45,499
Chances are if I'd used my
remote-control bombs, she'd be dead by now.

149
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,508
But with an Electromaster of her level, it's
possible she could've taken control of them, instead.

150
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,672
All told... it was the right decision.

151
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,571
And... boom!

152
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:02,827
No way!

153
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,098
She can deflect ceramic bombs?

154
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:09,587
She's on an entirely different level
than any other esper I've gone up against.

155
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:14,601
You won't get away...

156
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,571
I don't know if you're directly
involved or just a hired goon.

157
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,711
But anyone who supports this experiment...

158
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,488
...will pay!

159
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:27,077
Oh, dear! I'm terrified!

160
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,328
Just look at her!

161
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:31,705
If she catches me, she'll tear me into tiny little pieces!

162
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:35,272
Heh. Yeah, as if!

163
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:52,451
I lured her up as high as I could,
so that was quite a fall she took.

164
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:55,597
It doesn't matter how high-level an esper you are after...

165
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,028
...that?

166
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,659
No. That's impossible.

167
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:08,348
If you were wanting to see me fall, you
should've fought me in a different building.

168
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:11,548
One that wasn't built using any steel, for example.

169
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,630
You should be gone! No fair!

170
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:14,860
Aww!

171
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:36,411
Looks like you've hit a dead end.

172
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:37,498
It does, huh?

173
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:41,002
I never expected to be backed into a corner like this.

174
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:42,812
It happens.

175
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,703
It is a pretty easy mistake to make...

176
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:48,986
Perhaps you were panicking and
took a wrong turn somewhere...

177
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,645
Or maybe...

178
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:51,600
Heh.

179
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,213
What do you think?

180
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,293
Oh, I'm sorry if it wasn't clear...

181
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,263
There isn't really anything specific we need from you.

182
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:05,966
It's just, this is the first time
we've done a large-scale move like this...

183
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,880
so I thought, you know, if anything were to happen...

184
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,731
it would be good to have you around...

185
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:13,107
given your previous involvement with the project.

186
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,434
Of course. I understand.

187
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,175
Thank you, I thought that you might...

188
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,613
Well, then, if you'll excuse me for a moment.

189
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,697
There's something I want to ask you, while I still can.

190
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,423
It's a simple question... Who hired you?

191
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,138
Huh?

192
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:37,219
Now isn't the time to be concerned about loyalty...

193
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,752
This facility is part of a cruel experiment...

194
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:42,115
Yeah, yeah, never mind about all that.

195
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:50,425
My employer's background, their objectives, the
morality of the person I've been hired to eliminate...

196
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,141
the possibility that they're fighting for a noble cause...

197
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,437
All told, those sorts of things...

198
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,294
Just don't really matter to me.

199
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,550
Do you understand your situation now?

200
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,383
Let me explain something to you,

201
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,175
you've heard those stories before, right?

202
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,342
The ones about the hunter becoming the hunted.

203
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:14,370
Take a look at where you're standing.

204
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,943
Your retreat is cut off.

205
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,342
There's nothing to shield your self with...

206
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,800
Now what will you do?

207
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,841
Go ahead. I'd love to see you get out of this one!

208
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:32,520
Heh.

209
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:34,967
Well, so much for that...

210
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:38,337
You try to end things in a
civilized way, and look what happens.

211
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,198
My work's not over.

212
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,677
I need to save as much of my strength as I can.

213
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,393
She actually lifted up the floor!

214
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,419
Oh no... Does that mean...

215
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,588
Am I fighting a Level 5 esper?

216
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,392
I'm done with you!

217
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:58,788
Then again, people with too much
power do have a tendency to be careless.

218
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,625
Uh-oh!

219
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,841
That's what you get for making your next move so obvious.

220
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,663
A stun grenade!

221
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:12,094
Serves me right... I got sloppy.

222
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,926
I love seeing a cocky, powerful esper
like that trapped by my own hands...

223
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,826
It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!

224
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:34,118
All told, messing with me can be hazardous to your health!

225
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,860
All right! That's half the paycheck!

226
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,275
Half the money for this gig goes to me!

227
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:43,555
Money for me! Money for me!

228
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,008
I'm so excited! I wonder what I should buy...

229
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,349
She's gone?

230
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,199
That wasn't enough firepower to incinerate her.

231
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,512
So... I guess...

232
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,754
if she's not there, she must be...

233
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,587
I'll give you this much, at least.

234
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,347
You've done your homework on Electromasters.

235
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:04,157
But I'm at a slightly higher level...

236
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:07,867
EM waves provide me with a
picture of the surrounding space.

237
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:08,751
Whoa, there!

238
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,166
Best not to make any sudden moves.

239
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,541
I'm starting to get my sight and my hearing back...

240
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:17,957
And at such a close range, nothing
can outrun my electric shocks.

241
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,290
Uh... Mijihi!

242
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:20,699
Huh?

243
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:24,123
Miji... cavi... Capri...

244
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,498
Huh? What is she saying?

245
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,480
I've never heard a language like that...

246
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:30,525
Hold on... one of those words could have been...

247
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,508
It's gibberish... Gotcha!

248
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:33,228
Hah!

249
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:38,581
Another bomb?

250
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,846
When will she give up?

251
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,344
What is that?

252
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:47,473
Academy City's specially-made gaseous explosive.

253
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:49,103
They call it Ignus.

254
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,216
It won't do you any harm to breathe it in...

255
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,694
but then, it's an explosive, not a poison.

256
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,769
The way it's filling the air now...

257
00:15:56,258 --> 00:15:58,835
It's turning this room into one big bomb.

258
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,819
So...

259
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,482
do you know what would happen if you used electricity?

260
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,701
Well... I think I'll kill you now nice... and slow!

261
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:11,291
Not good.

262
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:15,821
Electricity is out of the question, and using
magnetism runs the risk of creating friction.

263
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:24,204
Ah!

264
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,080
Is this girl a psycho?

265
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,783
It's not impossible that all the stomping
around she's doing could kick up a spark.

266
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,448
I can tell you're wondering if I have a death wish.

267
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,733
In case you haven't noticed, I work for the underworld.

268
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:42,191
You think I can do that and still be afraid of dying?

269
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:48,370
Yeah, right!

270
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,119
I couldn't be more full of it!

271
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,851
There's no way I'm dying in here with you.

272
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,457
The canister I tossed first
was the real thing, all right...

273
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,936
but what I dispersed afterward was just ordinary nitrogen.

274
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,432
I didn't think she would fall
for it so completely, though.

275
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:08,633
So, what's the deal with the underworld
cleaner they've got standing by?

276
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:09,751
Oh, nothing much...

277
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:13,070
I don't know what she can do,
really. She's only a little girl.

278
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:14,153
Never mind her.

279
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:16,155
I wonder what's happening at the other facility.

280
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:17,385
Who knows?

281
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:20,786
Any means of external communication have been disabled.

282
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,756
I just want to hurry and get this move over with.

283
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,187
But if something were to go wrong.

284
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,175
Well, that's why we called in a patsy, right?

285
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,387
So somebody else can take the responsibility.

286
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:32,951
Yeah, there is that.

287
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,939
Sorry to keep you waiting, Nunotaba...

288
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,179
Where is she?

289
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,288
Restroom, maybe?

290
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,923
Moving the Sisters that are being
adjusted would normally come last.

291
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:57,801
With the abrupt transfer of control
and the watch out for attackers,

292
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,599
they've ignored internal security.

293
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,802
If I'm really going to do this...

294
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:05,320
it's now or never.

295
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,947
You're hanging in there pretty well.

296
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:27,224
But if I don't finish you off pretty
soon, Mugino and the others will show up,

297
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:29,417
and I don't like to share with others.

298
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:33,063
I told you before that I don't
care much about my targets' lives...

299
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:37,600
I do care about their deaths, however,
and I'm especially interested in yours.

300
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,387
When I take a life...

301
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,175
it's an exquisite feeling.

302
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:45,076
Because in that moment, I am in complete
control of someone else's destiny...

303
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,681
It feels great... that power...

304
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:51,925
As if the only reason that person was
born... was to have their life ended by me.

305
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:54,834
Now, enough talk.

306
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:58,622
All told, I just want to hear
one good, final scream from you.

307
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:07,592
To be born for the sole reason of being murdered...

308
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:09,331
To accept that...

309
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:10,976
to take life for granted...

310
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,692
never trying to escape...

311
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,258
or attempting to fight it...

312
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,213
never seeking to be saved...

313
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,612
from such a godforsaken destiny...

314
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,049
I say to hell with that!

315
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:29,432
Oh no.

316
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:30,868
A choke hold...

317
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:33,444
Shocks aren't her only line of defense.

318
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,565
Can't breathe!

319
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,768
Not a bad idea. You almost had me, but...

320
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:46,999
Huh?

321
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,258
That was a really close call...

322
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:00,377
I can't believe I almost blew half
my body off with my own explosives!

323
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:01,591
Just imagine...

324
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:03,428
My beautiful legs would have been...

325
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,793
Okay, I see...

326
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,470
so that's how it is...

327
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:07,989
It was a trick...

328
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:10,316
You didn't fill the room with explosive gas, did you?

329
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,519
All told, I fell for a simple bluff.

330
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,971
Well... uh... I...

331
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:16,846
Man... "I said "All told,"

332
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,292
You're rubbing off on me...

333
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:25,348
Tee-hee!

334
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,349
You seem like a pretty terrible person to me...

335
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,256
I'm not gonna lose any sleep if I shock you to death...

336
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,672
Just thought you should know.

337
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,412
I want all the info you have on the project...

338
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,303
I mean every last detail.

339
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,251
Who's the one in charge?

340
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,658
Who hired you to do this?

341
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:51,650
Yeah, Too bad I don't know that,
since we go through an intermediary.

342
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,710
Oh, I forgot...

343
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,204
You said somebody else was on the way here, didn't you?

344
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:56,008
Who?

345
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,621
There's no way I'm telling you that.

346
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:08,227
You've got three seconds to answer me...
unless you want to be burned to a cinder.

347
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:09,915
Three...

348
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,771
No! No! I'll talk! I'll talk!

349
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:13,391
Two...

350
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,485
My tongue! That last shock must have...

351
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,802
Wait! Hold on! My tongue is too numb to talk! Honestly!

352
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:19,961
Please don't kill me!

353
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,479
One...

354
00:21:25,624 --> 00:21:26,327
Zero.

355
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:30,400
Huh?

356
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:31,085
I see.

357
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:33,532
So you're not going to sell out your friends, huh?

358
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,758
No... I would, I just can't talk.

359
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,974
All right... I can't hold that against you.

360
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,437
It got quiet in here all of a sudden.

361
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:53,298
I was sure the Electromaster had finished you off.

362
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,620
Looks like I got here just in time.

363
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,398
Hello, Frenda.

364
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,007
Mikoto Misaka...

365
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,297
I'm putting an end to this.

366
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:35,649
I can't let her take them on without any help at all.

367
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:37,025
I'll save the rest of them!

368
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,758
Yes... I'll do what I can...

369
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:39,571
I'll help her.
