1
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:08,023
Around here... This is where it came from.

2
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,468
Who... are you?

3
00:00:33,503 --> 00:00:34,805
What are you?

4
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:36,465
Mya.

5
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:41,184
Huh?

6
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:15,836
"Mya"?

7
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,090
So... what does that mean?

8
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:19,479
Is it her name?

9
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,386
The organization she's with?

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,683
Or did I mishear what she said?

11
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,605
Maybe it was a different language?

12
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,695
"Mya," says the furry, four-legged
creature caught up in a tree.

13
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:32,460
A cat?

14
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,943
A little earlier today, I was passing through this area...

15
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,183
As I did, I noticed a baby who was left
alone inside a car that was parked on the street.

16
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,975
The baby could have suffered a heat stroke.

17
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:48,774
So Misaka used her electrical power to
unlock the door and open the window, but...

18
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:54,513
The poor creature was startled and fled up the tree.

19
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,077
He was then unable to climb back down...

20
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:01,734
"You see?" asks Misaka, having
fully explained the situation.

21
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:05,743
Ah... Wait, that's not what I was asking about!

22
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:08,693
I want to know what the deal is with you, not the cat!

23
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:09,446
Look at him.

24
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,759
His situation becomes more precarious.

25
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:15,468
"Shouldn't we see if we can help him get down?" asks...

26
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,255
He's a cat!

27
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,948
Being up in a tree isn't a big deal to him,
okay? So, why don't you just tell me what you're...

28
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:20,777
Oh, I see...

29
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:26,147
So, Big Sister, you do not care if this creature
slips from the branch, falls out of the tree,

30
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,045
and is violently smashed on the ground?

31
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,866
If, as a result,

32
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,776
his internal organs are seriously injured,

33
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,125
and he is unable to survive on his own,

34
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:36,990
that does not concern you?

35
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,093
Okay, you win...

36
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,498
What do you want me to do?

37
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,590
"You could get on your hands
and knees in front of the tree...

38
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:50,807
Then I should be able to reach it...
Right?" Misaka seeks confirmation.

39
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:51,888
Well...

40
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,093
I'm not really seeing anything else around
here that could give us enough of a boost.

41
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,106
Wait... why am I on the bottom?

42
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,718
Could you move a little further to the left, Big Sister?

43
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,427
You've gotta be kidding me!

44
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:13,465
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you!

45
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,358
I have managed to safely secure the creature... See?

46
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:21,243
Hey, come on! You can't just go
around holding up your skirt like that!

47
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,993
You're supposed to be a young lady!

48
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,891
You need to behave if you're
gonna go around lookin' like me!

49
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,491
Aw, just look at this sweet guy!

50
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,405
He's a cute little kitty-kiddy, huh?

51
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,413
Kitty-kiddy?

52
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,932
Yeah, he's a cat's kid: a kitty-kiddy.

53
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:43,538
It's too bad cats are always spooked by me.

54
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,407
They aren't crazy about the slight
electrical field my body constantly produces.

55
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,532
The same is true for Misaka, it seems.

56
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:02,011
Hey! You keep distracting me and dodging my question!

57
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,496
You've been referring to yourself as Misaka.

58
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,134
So, are you... are you my... my...

59
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:09,349
Are you my clone?

60
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:10,312
Yes.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,012
Okay.

62
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:19,233
But I thought that project was
supposed to have been frozen for good.

63
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,255
In which case... why does someone like you even exist?

64
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:31,714
"ZXC741. ASD852. QWE963-Dash. Well?"

65
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,432
Misaka seeks password confirmation.

66
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:35,067
What?

67
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:39,880
Your inability to respond means that
you are not involved in the experiment...

68
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,535
so I cannot answer your question, Big Sister.

69
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,510
Well, then you can at least tell
me who is in charge of this project.

70
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:49,815
That is confidential.

71
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,951
What is the purpose of your creation?

72
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,581
That is confidential, too.

73
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,715
You want to get hurt, is that it?

74
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:02,635
If I have to force it out of you...

75
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,126
Okay, fine... Get going.

76
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,375
All I have to do is follow where you lead...

77
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:20,483
You must be heading back to whatever
laboratory is responsible for creating you.

78
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:24,176
When I get there, I'll start
by collecting your manufacturers.

79
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:26,066
They can give me the answers I want.

80
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:45,795
Sisters...

81
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,076
If she wasn't right here...

82
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,957
I don't know if I would believe it.

83
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,527
No... I guess that's not true...

84
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:59,849
For a while now, I've been frightened that
exactly this sort of thing was going to happen.

85
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:03,130
That someone who looked just like me would show up.

86
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:06,434
Although...

87
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,561
I didn't expect... something like this.

88
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,935
I thought it would be more sinister and sophisticated.

89
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:20,029
Like some sort of black op where
they plot to put someone to death

90
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:22,571
and then replace them with an identical
twin who has been subverted by the enemy.

91
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,296
But this has me completely thrown off.

92
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,740
Wait, "Sister... s"?

93
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,733
Hey! Hold on!

94
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,015
I... just need to know one thing!

95
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,645
Okay, this might sound crazy...

96
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:43,384
but am I gonna find another five or
ten others like you somewhere out there?

97
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:51,093
"Kitty-kiddy"... If you say it backwards,
it still sounds almost exactly the same.

98
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,772
Stop trying to avoid the subject!

99
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,178
"Kitty-kiddy."

100
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,316
Quit saying that! I asked you a question!

101
00:07:59,027 --> 00:07:59,943
"Kitty-kiddy."

102
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,340
Oh, come oooonnnn!

103
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:02,915
Hey! What's going on?

104
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,736
It's a shame to see sisters fighting like that.

105
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,048
She is not my sister!

106
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:11,830
Hey... That's the kinda thing you should
never say, especially if you're angry.

107
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:12,870
Wait one sec.

108
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:18,637
Here you go.

109
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,695
Um...

110
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:21,943
These are my best cones.

111
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,762
You two eat them and stop fighting.

112
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:24,283
Uh...

113
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:28,053
That's nice of you, but I don't think
ice cream is exactly what we need, here.

114
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,219
A rich and refreshing sweetness
without an overbearing aftertaste...

115
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:40,926
Clearly, quality milk was used... and this kind of
texture cannot be achieved without well-ground sugar...

116
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:44,588
Furthermore, the cone is flavorful
enough to be a cookie in its own right.

117
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:49,576
"Excellent job!" reports Misaka,
offering her sincerest praise.

118
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:51,888
Well, thank you.

119
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,693
Now... when a couple breaks up, they
can just go back to being strangers,

120
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:57,894
But sisters share their blood for life.

121
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:04,331
If I don't start charging for the ice cream,
my old lady might become a stranger again.

122
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,164
Uh... that sounds personal.

123
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,032
Anyway, you sisters be good!

124
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,392
I told you, we are not sisters!

125
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,522
Though... looking at us, what else is he going to think?

126
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:19,343
"No, sir, our genes are totally
identical, but we're not sisters, I promise!"

127
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:22,134
Huh?

128
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:27,282
Hey, you!

129
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:28,526
"Is something the matter?"

130
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:33,609
asks Misaka, playing innocent while enjoying
the mint chocolate chip aftertaste... secretly.

131
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,054
My clone, huh? If that's really the
case, how can you be such a gluttonous pig...

132
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,159
"Eating ice cream has made me a bit chilly.

133
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,193
I think I would like some hot tea now,"

134
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:44,338
says Misaka, ignoring Big Sister's bad attitude.

135
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:44,744
Huh?

136
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,979
"I may not look it, but I am
pretty particular about my tea."

137
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,386
reports Misaka, considerately offering up a disclaimer.

138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,901
"If it helps, I will be ordering milk tea,"

139
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,551
says Misaka, in an effort to streamline the process.

140
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,546
Stop screwing with me!

141
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,234
"That milk tea was more than satisfactory...

142
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,863
as was the strawberry shortcake on the side,"

143
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,731
remarks Misaka, offering her candid opinion.

144
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:13,392
So, When are you going back to wherever you belong?

145
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,984
I forgot to mention this... but Misaka
is now headed for her experiment...

146
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,664
so she will not be returning.

147
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:20,584
Huh?

148
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,866
You're free to follow me, Big
Sister, if that is what you wish to do,

149
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,068
but you will not see Misaka's creator.

150
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,538
But... why didn't you tell me...?

151
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,722
I didn't say because you didn't ask.

152
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,741
So what now?

153
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:37,866
Would it be quicker to decode her password
and search for more information that way?

154
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,202
I do have my PDA with me.

155
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,125
What is that object?

156
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:46,493
This? It's a prize I got from
a vending machine, that's all.

157
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,568
What are you doing?

158
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,587
Just hold still a sec, will you?

159
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:57,234
There. This should give me a much clearer
picture than looking in a mirror would...

160
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:59,874
Seeing it like this, it's not so bad, really.

161
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:06,213
"No, it's worse than bad," Misaka says, shocked and
appalled by her model's absolute lack of fashion sense.

162
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:07,785
Uh... excuse me?

163
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,503
Well, obviously, I was just kidding around.

164
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:13,181
You know it's bad if your own clone shoots you down.

165
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,719
Did you actually think I was serious?

166
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,850
Geez, what is with you?

167
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,649
"The moment you put it on Misaka,
ownership of this button transferred to her."

168
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,117
Misaka calmly asserts.

169
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:38,279
If Big Sister attempts to take
it back, she is guilty of robbery.

170
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:39,734
Please, that's ridiculous.

171
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,546
"No, it is a true statement... Besides,"

172
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:47,429
adds Misaka, "This holds special importance
as the first present given to me by Big Sister."

173
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:53,262
"Though one would think she could have
found something better to give me than this...

174
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,605
Would that really have been so much trouble?"

175
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,257
asks Misaka, with a sigh.

176
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,474
Alright, you give that back to me right now!

177
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,626
Calm down...

178
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,922
You're letting her distract you again...

179
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,657
At this rate, I'm not going to get anywhere...

180
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:08,770
I should just check the net.

181
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,214
Okay, fine... It's getting late.
I'm gonna call it quits for today.

182
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,370
Uh... Unless there was something else?

183
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:20,483
No.

184
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:25,017
That's all there is... Farewell, Big Sister.

185
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,345
Yeah, okay... I'll be seein' ya.

186
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,761
Geez... she sure was strange.

187
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,938
I'm not even sure what to make of the day I just had.

188
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:45,595
Helping a stranded cat... Eating ice
cream cones... Fighting over a button...

189
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:48,854
It's almost like we were...

190
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:52,809
First thing is first!

191
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,430
I need to find her creator!

192
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,441
Thanks so much! I really appreciate this!

193
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:21,967
I don't know how many times you've helped me out!

194
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:25,121
Really, I'm more than happy to
give you a hand with your homework.

195
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,371
It's no problem at all!

196
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,819
The Judgment recruiting drive took
up more time than I thought it would.

197
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,484
I'd be totally lost without your help!

198
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:35,563
There we go... Is this all of it?

199
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,323
Is that you, Misaka?

200
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:42,182
Hey, Uiharu.

201
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,063
I'm really sorry for calling you so late.

202
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,021
I'm just gonna get straight to the point, okay?

203
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:46,989
Write this down:

204
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:53,247
ZXC741-ASD852-QWE963-Dash.

205
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,667
Do you know what that means?

206
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:57,171
Let me think a sec.

207
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:58,926
Where have I seen this?

208
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,144
Oh, yeah, I've got it!

209
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:05,952
This code looks like a password attached to
information that's security Rank A or higher.

210
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,795
I've actually tried to crack
something like this before, myself.

211
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,536
Great, thanks! You're a huge help!

212
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,331
Huh? Hold on! Misaka!

213
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,175
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

214
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,407
Well, Uh... I'm not sure.

215
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:31,105
"The current time is 20:58," Misaka reports.

216
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:35,015
Experiment number nine-nine-eight-two will begin shortly.

217
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,716
Countdown... Two minutes.

218
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:39,830
What the hell?

219
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:44,287
This is...

220
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,281
"It is now 21:00 hours," states Misaka...

221
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:08,771
"It is time. Experiment number
nine-nine-eight-two will commence immediately."

222
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:15,136
"How to shift an absolute esper to
Level 6 through the use of Sisters."

223
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:19,228
"In Academy City, there are seven
people who are ranked as Level 5s.

224
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:24,207
However, based upon the predictive
calculations made by Tree Diagram,

225
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:29,230
it has been established that only one
person has the ability to reach status Level 6."

226
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:45,374
"If the subject in question were to be put
through normal Academy City curriculum..."

227
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,835
"...he would not reach Level 6 for a long time...

228
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:55,552
an estimated two hundred and fifty years...

229
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,507
Thus, we have set aside this plan for now...

230
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:02,757
and are instead pursuing what some would
consider a more radical course of action."

231
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:08,382
"We will prepare a number of specific battlefields
and will manipulate the direction of his development

232
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:11,266
by proceeding him through a course of combat scenarios."

233
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:16,207
"The optimal plan would involve creating one
hundred and twenty-eight different battlefields...

234
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:20,228
The subject would then kill Railgun
one hundred and twenty-eight times...

235
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:22,327
After that number of victories...

236
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,334
he would advance to Level 6."

237
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,952
"However... since it is impossible
to secure multiple Railguns,

238
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:30,859
a different plan has been developed."

239
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:52,650
"The Sisters created during the now-frozen
Project Radio Noise will be repurposed...

240
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,327
They will serve as Railgun substitutes."

241
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:59,420
What's the matter? Turning tail already?

242
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:04,729
"A large number of armed Sisters will be required,

243
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,913
as their quantity must substitute
for the Original's quality."

244
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,982
This is crazy... One hell of a practical joke.

245
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,652
It talks about killing me...

246
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,473
and using these Sister clones as proxies...

247
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:31,097
There's no way a project like
this could actually go through.

248
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,726
That's all there is... Farewell, Big Sister.

249
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:45,327
No!

250
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,471
Run away, run away!

251
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:59,030
The longer you run, the more time you have before you die.

252
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:03,201
After all, this is a life or
death game of tag we're playing here.

253
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,591
Because once I catch up to you...

254
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,483
It's the end. Game over.

255
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,327
Too slow!

256
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,560
You should really be more careful. You
don't have time to waste with falling down.

257
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:33,879
What's wrong?

258
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,477
You're not broken already, are you?

259
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:37,993
That's no fun.

260
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:43,252
I don't see how I'm gonna make it to
Level 6 if this is all I have to work with.

261
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,997
Oh...? Very nice.

262
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:52,587
You're a tough one, aren't you?

263
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,866
That's the attitude we're looking for!

264
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,432
I was right...

265
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,754
No way did a project so insane actually ex...

266
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,384
Lying down on the job like that...

267
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,569
Finally running out of steam, are you?

268
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:27,767
Need a rest?

269
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:30,747
Or are you ready to give in and declare defeat?

270
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,695
Misaka... does not...

271
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:38,643
have an accurate grasp... of the target's ability...

272
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:43,036
However, judging from experimental results... up to now...

273
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:48,257
Misaka has come to the conclusion that...

274
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,680
the target projects some kind
of barrier... around himself...

275
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:54,176
Furthermore... seeing as how...

276
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,582
he steps on the ground... when he walks...

277
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,426
Misaka believes...

278
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,414
That his ability... does not extend downward...

279
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,925
or at least, not beyond the soles of his feet.

280
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,300
Therefore, Misaka determined,

281
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,446
a surprise attack from that direction...

282
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,565
would prove to be the most effective.

283
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,372
Hey, what are you mumbling about over there?

284
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:17,001
If you won't run, I'll finish you off.

285
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,909
I am not running... anymore.

286
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,205
As per my plan...

287
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,384
I have succeeded in leading you to the desired location...

288
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,625
Now... there is only one more thing left to do.

289
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,468
Mission complete...

290
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,693
The target has been neutrali...

291
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,449
Oh. Hi.

292
00:20:58,368 --> 00:20:59,961
It was a nice idea...

293
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,051
But so incredibly far off the mark!

294
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,980
Aww, now we can't play tag anymore, huh?

295
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,951
You'll croak on your own if I just leave you there...

296
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,162
but standing around waiting really isn't my thing.

297
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,616
Well... still trying to run away, huh?

298
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:37,872
That way is a dead-end, though.

299
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,021
Do you have some other pathetic,
useless trick hidden up your sleeve, maybe?

300
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,326
We've played for long enough now.

301
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,531
I think it's time to say good bye.

302
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:05,958
Oh, no!

303
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,395
No! It can't be...

304
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:23,540
No!!

305
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:31,268
That concludes today's experiment.

306
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,109
I made quite a mess this time.

307
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:38,897
I wonder how long it'll take them to clean it up.

308
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,521
Eh... who cares?

309
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:45,211
I should stop by the store on my way home.

310
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:32,401
Whoa, hey!

311
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:33,482
What's going on?

312
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,770
There's only supposed to be one experiment tonight!

313
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:39,769
Oh, right... I understand... I know who you are.
