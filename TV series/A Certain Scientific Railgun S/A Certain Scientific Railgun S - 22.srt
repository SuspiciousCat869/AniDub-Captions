1
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,307
I can't believe this...

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:07,605
My path crossing with hers again?!

3
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,600
No, you are all my lab rats, don't you see?

4
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:12,582
Would you prefer a different analogy...?

5
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:17,740
Very well, Academy City is my breeding
farm, and all you children are my livestock.

6
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:18,905
But right now...

7
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,830
This woman could hold the key to saving Febri.

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,976
Hmm... Long time no see, huh?

9
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,883
How I've missed you, my little lab rat.

10
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:33,568
Therestina... Kihara Lifeline.

11
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:07,346
Ahhh!

12
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,907
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

13
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:11,500
Yeah... maybe later.

14
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,074
Jeez. Are you okay?

15
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,378
Hmm?

16
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:18,936
Ahhhh, this feels fantastic!

17
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,216
Huh?! What are you talking about?!

18
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,711
It's a question of saving face.

19
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,282
Given what happened,

20
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:27,390
we can't just sit back and do nothing, you know...

21
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,321
If we don't act, and soon, we're ruined.

22
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:31,532
Getting taken in by...

23
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:33,047
Don't you wanna swim around?

24
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,682
Floating is fun.

25
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,183
clean up your mess?

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,948
Oh, get off your high horse...

27
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:41,015
I told you you were going to get
paid, so stop your complaining...

28
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,222
Besides, weren't you the one who said
you were pissed about being tricked?

29
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,989
Tch. We can get rowdy if we want?

30
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:48,133
Go right ahead.

31
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,921
What's the call about?

32
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,010
More work?

33
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,584
Yeah. Can't say I'm excited, though.

34
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,952
Hope you ladies are ready to work up a sweat.

35
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:00,543
Hmm...

36
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:02,919
Yeah, what?

37
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:05,626
Your face is looking more grown-up these days.

38
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,264
You seen your fill of darkness yet?

39
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,401
Has this city made you jaded?

40
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,205
So, how did it happen?

41
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,151
Something hit too close to home...

42
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,921
and you investigated...

43
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,989
You went seeking the source...

44
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,735
and you found darkness.

45
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,074
Then at long last...

46
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,720
you realized that what I said was correct all along.

47
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,162
Academy City is one big test site...

48
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,678
and all the students inside it are lab rats.

49
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,657
Well? What did you want to ask...?

50
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:40,425
Or did you come here seeking the comfort
of one who knows the truth, as well?

51
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:46,021
I want to help a friend... to save her.

52
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,480
Huh?

53
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:49,561
Her name is Febri...

54
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:52,860
She's a little girl who was artificially created...

55
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,195
If I do nothing...

56
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:57,115
she is going to die within seventy-two hours.

57
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:58,540
I'm here for her sake...

58
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,054
I know an underground organization
is responsible for making her.

59
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,782
Given your connections, I thought
you might know something about...

60
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,337
Oh, come on. Don't you learn?

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,023
What is it going to take?

62
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,032
You got a whole heap of your own clones killed,

63
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:17,395
and you still get all mushy
about some girl you barely know?

64
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,847
This kid, whatever her name is,

65
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,098
she's just one more lab rat spawned by this city.

66
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,450
You wanna survive in this town...?

67
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,889
Give in to the darkness and live like livestock...

68
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:30,140
or become one of the people in charge...

69
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,599
Because those are the only two
options you have in this place.

70
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:34,865
That isn't true.

71
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,105
I've seen it.

72
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,465
I know the darkness that you're talking about...

73
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,846
At first I felt lost and hopeless...

74
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:44,962
desperate and destructive.

75
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,260
But you know...

76
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:51,137
It was the people I met in Academy
City who wound up saving me from myself.

77
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,107
I'm not alone.

78
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,993
I have a group of friends who are dear to me...

79
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:57,818
and if it weren't for this city...

80
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,179
I never would have met any of them.

81
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,580
There are a lot of things that
disgust me about this place...

82
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,138
but even so...

83
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,680
I can't bring myself to hate it like you do.

84
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:10,873
Heh.

85
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,861
I've heard enough... You can go now.

86
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:16,632
No, I can't.

87
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,659
Not until you answer me.

88
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,481
Who was it that created Febri?

89
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,038
How should I know?

90
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,407
What is their objective...

91
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,484
What is this?

92
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,607
You must know! Please tell me!

93
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,674
And what if I lie?

94
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:37,434
What possible motivation could I
have for answering you honestly?

95
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:39,907
You and I have a history...

96
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:41,771
Can you really believe what I say?

97
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:43,598
Yes.

98
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,195
I'll believe you.

99
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,061
Why is that?

100
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,039
Because right now it's the only choice I have.

101
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,959
Hold out your hand.

102
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:02,944
Well, aren't you going to eat it?

103
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:04,890
It's just ordinary chocolate...

104
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,669
Nothing sinister about it.

105
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:08,624
What's the matter...?

106
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:09,632
Eat up.

107
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,189
You believe me, right?

108
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:19,882
I said I'd believe you, didn't I?

109
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:22,621
Go away.

110
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:23,606
I'm staying...!

111
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,014
Now tell me about Febri.

112
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:26,291
You're wasting your time.

113
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:27,684
I don't have anything to tell you.

114
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm not going anywhere until you answer!

115
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,831
No, thanks. I'm done talking.

116
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,057
Tell me about Febri!

117
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,644
What do you have to lose...?

118
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:35,865
Please, tell me!

119
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,456
Ugh, you are such a pain.

120
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,130
Chemicaloid.

121
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,865
If I'm remembering correctly, that's what they called it.

122
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:48,785
Called what...?

123
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,876
You mean a chemicaloid is what Febri is?

124
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:54,808
At the time, of course, it was all just theoretical...

125
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,772
But those boys must have found
some way of making it happen.

126
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:00,404
These "boys" are the ones who made Febri, then...?

127
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:01,863
Well, what was their objective?

128
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,182
Hmph. Beats me.

129
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,866
It's probably their elaborate way
of getting their existence noticed.

130
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,980
Getting noticed?

131
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,118
There's some kind of fancy event coming up, isn't there?

132
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,089
An event... Uh...

133
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,067
The Reach Assembly!

134
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:20,599
They had to artificially create a person in
order to get attention?! That doesn't make any...

135
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,187
Doesn't make any sense?

136
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,971
Oh, yes, that's good. Spoken like a true Level 5.

137
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:28,486
Huh?

138
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,933
Don't you understand, little girl?

139
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,136
Here in Academy City, you are
one of the privileged elite...

140
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,622
Pin on your Level 5 tag, and
even a pathetic lab rat like you

141
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:42,748
will have plenty of dear friends
flocking eagerly to your side.

142
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:47,704
Don't think for a second that you
understand the true darkness of those who lack

143
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,578
even your status in this city...

144
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:52,307
At the end of the day, you know nothing.

145
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:53,806
Stupid brat!

146
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,151
What?

147
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,838
You actually met with that witch Therestina?!

148
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,307
Yeah... sorry...

149
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:02,699
It happened so rapidly

150
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,883
there was no time to tell you guys about it.

151
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,274
So, according to her,

152
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:09,311
"chemicaloid" is the official term for what Febri is?

153
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:13,280
And the people who created her are
planning to do something at the Reach Assembly?

154
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,586
She didn't say that exactly. I just put it together...

155
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,826
That strange guy Kongo saw...

156
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,824
the one who was talking on the
phone about "retrieving" Febri...

157
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:24,608
he was at one of the Reach Assembly campuses, right?

158
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,199
Therestina mentioned an event that's coming up...

159
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:28,623
I'm guessing that's it.

160
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:29,890
I'm still confused...

161
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:32,188
It was the hospital doctor who arranged it?

162
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:35,057
It was his idea for you to ask Therestina about this?

163
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,520
There's something about that guy's face...

164
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,672
What's his role in all this, anyway?

165
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,446
There is something else he told me
that I think all of you should know.

166
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,850
What's that, Sissy?

167
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,174
He made some calculations based on the
number of lollipops Febri had with her.

168
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,949
Without more, she only has seventy-two hours.

169
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,457
To live...?! Oh, no! That's all...?

170
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,374
Three days isn't very long.

171
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,401
Uiharu?

172
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:03,057
I'm going to screen everyone
who's involved in the Assembly.

173
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,596
Administrators... participating students...

174
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,724
That's a good idea.

175
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,230
Hey there, sleepy head.

176
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,530
Hello...

177
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:14,824
Good afternoon!

178
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:16,182
How is everyone?

179
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,984
We brought something I think
you ladies will be excited about.

180
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,785
Oh, really?!

181
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,615
Were you finally able to get a lead?

182
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,426
Huh? Oh... no... No, we weren't.

183
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,253
We're really sorry.

184
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:28,682
We searched everywhere for that man. I swear!

185
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,937
All through the city!

186
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,574
But I'm afraid we didn't find anything worth mentioning.

187
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:33,641
Never fear!

188
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,056
Give us more time, and I know we will find him...!

189
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:39,441
Anyhow... we're here on other business today.

190
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,475
We came because we have a little present for Febri.

191
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,549
A present for me?

192
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:48,570
While we were out scouring the
city, we found an adorable outfit.

193
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,554
And we thought...

194
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:52,312
"Wow, that sure would look cute on Febri!"

195
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Yeah...? Isn't that nice, Febri...?

196
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:56,476
A new outfit, just for you!

197
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,963
Okay, then... why don't we open it?

198
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:03,397
Wow!

199
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,128
That's really perfect!

200
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:07,217
That... that's for me?

201
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,028
Yes.

202
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:14,233
Mitsuko, Wanna, Atsuki... Thanks so much!

203
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,306
There's no need to thank us...

204
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,150
Anyone else would have done the same.

205
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:19,974
For Febri!

206
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,611
Yes! Very pretty!

207
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:23,909
Febri!

208
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:26,387
Your face is flushed!

209
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:28,199
Do you feel like you have a fever?

210
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,557
Don't know what a fever's like...

211
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,588
My head just feels all foggy.

212
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,883
Um... A lollipop! Right...!

213
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,267
She's getting worse. We have to hurry.

214
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,724
Hey...

215
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,687
It's him! It's him! It's him!

216
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,763
That's the man we saw...

217
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:48,699
The one who was talking on his
phone at the Reach Assembly Site.

218
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:51,182
Take a look, you two. That is him isn't it?

219
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,557
Yes, definitely.

220
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:53,474
Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:54,765
I would recognize him anywhere.

222
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,178
What's that photo from?

223
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,195
The participant list from last year's assembly.

224
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,720
Haruki Aritomi.

225
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:05,057
Oh! According to this he won the Academic
Reach Assembly's first prize two years ago...

226
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,029
In fact, it seems he's a regular participant and winner.

227
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,054
Wow!

228
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,295
If he consistently wins top prizes at the assembly...

229
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,849
it means that he's one of the most
brilliant people in all Academy City.

230
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,191
This man? Really? That's odd.

231
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,015
I've never even heard of him before.

232
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,075
Of course not...

233
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,099
In a city that's full of high-level espers,

234
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,883
an ordinary genius doesn't really stand out.

235
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,974
Don't think for a second that you understand

236
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:32,659
the true darkness of those who
lack even your status in this city...

237
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,324
Oh, hey... Something else...

238
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:37,935
It doesn't look like he's participating this year.

239
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,808
Hey, you know...

240
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,791
that reminds me of something Captain Yomikawa said...

241
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:45,974
about how a lot of regulars apparently
weren't showing up to the assembly this year.

242
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,071
Let me see...

243
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,282
Yeah... you're right, Konori...

244
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,532
It seems like a bunch of the
usual participants aren't signed up.

245
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:53,724
Let's take a good look.

246
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:56,374
Some of these people could be his associates, right?

247
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,919
No relevant data retrieved.

248
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,927
Okay, then... That just leaves Lab One.

249
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:15,699
Gotcha!

250
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,445
Ahh! Hey! I can't see!

251
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:21,059
So, little one... Not still feverish?

252
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,349
You really feel all right?

253
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,022
Uh huh!

254
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,911
She had a good appetite, too.

255
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,750
I think we can rest easy for now.

256
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,710
Have you still been searching this whole time?

257
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:29,560
Well, yeah...

258
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,618
I felt like I needed to do something...

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,899
I'm checking out this Aritomi guy...

260
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:37,130
Apparently he dropped out of
school just a little while ago.

261
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:37,800
Oh...

262
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,420
that's a shame, huh?

263
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,378
I mean, if he wins those prizes
every year, he must be smart...

264
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,435
wouldn't you agree...?

265
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,155
He could be doing something that's more respectable.

266
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:51,765
Instead he works for the underground
and tries to abduct a little girl...

267
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,140
I just don't get it.

268
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,182
Yeah... why turn to a life of crime?

269
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,074
Exactly...

270
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,282
I just learned about the Reach Assembly.

271
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:02,726
But knowing there are non-espers
out there who are successful...

272
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,572
it really gives me hope.

273
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,346
Right, of course.

274
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,112
Yes... If you don't mind, Captain...

275
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,423
That would be great.

276
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:12,067
Okay.

277
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:17,301
She says there's not enough evidence
yet to justify taking action...

278
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,571
Oh, well...

279
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,343
That's what we were expecting.

280
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,365
We knew they weren't going to be much help...

281
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:26,764
not when you consider how much
pressure Antiskill's under right now...

282
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,324
You're pretty quiet...

283
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,348
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

284
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,270
Yeah...

285
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,981
It was something that she said to me earlier...

286
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,052
Therastina.

287
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:42,868
A lot of people in Academy City have heard of
the Railgun of Tokiwadai at some point, right?

288
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,887
I've met a bunch of people because of that title...

289
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,365
It opens doors.

290
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:51,305
So, I was just wondering, if I wasn't a Level 5...

291
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,412
if I wasn't, do you think...

292
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,484
Would it be the same between us...?

293
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,974
I mean, you and all the others...

294
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,474
would we still be good friends like we are now?

295
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:00,880
Oh, don't be silly.

296
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:06,115
The reason I'm so attached to you is not because

297
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,802
you're the fabulously talented
Level 5 Railgun of Tokiwadai...

298
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:13,003
It's because you're the reckless,
stubborn, and a little childish...

299
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:15,349
but still strong and kind and thoughtful...

300
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,636
Big Sissy Mikoto Misaka.

301
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,169
That's good...

302
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,806
Thanks, Kuroko...

303
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,078
However...

304
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,282
Ahh!

305
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,182
Don't take advantage of the situation...!

306
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,307
And don't call me childish, either!

307
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,140
Th-There's that, too...

308
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,307
I also love how you show no mercy

309
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,983
when you decide that somebody... deserves to be punished.

310
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:38,005
Heh.

311
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,557
STUDY Corporation?

312
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:42,303
Yes...

313
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,807
Haruki Aritomi's name came up as
one of the company's lead directors.

314
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,932
Okay, so what kind of company is it?

315
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:50,741
They seem to do a lot of things...

316
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,099
but mainly it's pharmaceutical
manufacturing and chemical engineering.

317
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,088
So...

318
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:57,254
do they have any suspicious facilities?

319
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,737
According to what I've found so far,

320
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,255
STUDY Corporation owns a factory in School District 17.

321
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:05,350
It's an old factory and nothing very special...

322
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:08,225
but the fact that they paid a
huge amount for it bothers me.

323
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,390
It's not much, but it does seem fishy.

324
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,307
If it's a factory, do you think it could
be the place where they created Febri?

325
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:16,224
Maybe that's where they made her candy...

326
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:19,696
If we could at least find out
what its components are, then...

327
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,824
I can think of one way to find out for sure...

328
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,691
Go to the factory and take a look.

329
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,758
We need to move quickly.

330
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,810
The most important thing for us to
focus on now is keeping Febri alive...

331
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:44,536
which means we either need to get more of
that candy or figure out how to manufacture it.

332
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:48,880
I have to do this right.

333
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,906
Febri's life depends on my success.

334
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,434
That bridge again...

335
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,025
I know you have your own goals...

336
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,949
Mine is seeing everybody get through this alive...

337
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,525
So... Let's work together...

338
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,589
Maybe we'll both win.

339
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,615
Thinking back on it now...

340
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:13,629
It's such a naïve, and unrealistic goal to have.

341
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,925
He can dream all he wants...

342
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:19,175
but is he prepared for the
consequences if we should all lose?

343
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,599
In the end, I guess...

344
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,442
You have to believe in something.

345
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:31,884
What is it?

346
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,967
There's an intruder in Lab One.

347
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,099
That's unexpected... Who could it be?

348
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:37,112
I don't know...

349
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,265
The security system just went into Shift A alert.

350
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:44,365
The security at that laboratory
is intentionally low-priority.

351
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,296
After all, it is a decoy...

352
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,434
It's not surprising that somebody is sniffing around.

353
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,682
It shouldn't interfere with our
plans at this point, should it?

354
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:54,916
Not if they're just now finding Lab One.

355
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,356
There's nothing there that
can be used to hurt us, correct?

356
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:59,866
All of Janie's data has been relocated.

357
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:03,643
The info on the neutralizing
agent is the only thing that's left.

358
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:07,017
We should make sure...

359
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:08,788
I'll go have a look around.

360
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:10,573
You're going to Lab One?

361
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,864
Sounds like an unnecessary risk to me.

362
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,974
I'm not going to do anything heroic...

363
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,557
but we've come too far with this to fail now...

364
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,627
I just want to make sure that everything is still secure.

365
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,533
We don't want any surprises.

366
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,324
Very well. Go.

367
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:44,414
And once again, there's nobody here.

368
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,280
What the hell?

369
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,407
Just like last time... We were given ultra-bad Intel.

370
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:51,572
We are still gonna get paid for the job though, aren't we?

371
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:53,272
What? Those guys?

372
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,481
I didn't expect to see them here!

373
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:58,348
Did they set up a trap because they knew I was coming?

374
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:01,089
It doesn't look like that's what they're doing...

375
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,551
Are they working against STUDY Corporation?

376
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,261
Like some kind of underground feud?

377
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:06,775
Huh?

378
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,587
What's the matter Takitsubo?

379
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,411
Mugino!

380
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,041
Ha! It's no use!

381
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:21,238
Takitsubo's badass AIM Stalker lets her
track any ability she has sensed before...!

382
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:21,991
All told...

383
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,350
that makes sneaking up on us impossible!

384
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:25,932
An ability?

385
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,179
Does that mean that someone is moving those
unmanned powered suits using psychokinesis?

386
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:33,974
But there's no sign of anybody around here...

387
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,577
Then, how are they doing it...

388
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:38,223
Maybe... some kind of remote control?

389
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,349
It was lying inside the powered suit...

390
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,294
It seems to be made of the exact same components
as those that comprise the girl Febri's body.

391
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,349
It's theoretically possible that the hair Antiskill found

392
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,118
acted as a sort of receiver for some ability...

393
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:57,428
If that's the case... and if one person
alone was moving that many powered suits...

394
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,921
They must have Level 5-grade power.

395
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,677
That severely limits who the hair could belong to.

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,718
Takitsubo!

397
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,948
Are you okay?

398
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,897
Yeah. I must be tired from swimming.

399
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:08,932
Sure that's all?

400
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,805
Ugh... I'm sick of this...

401
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:11,749
Let's just go.

402
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:12,954
We'll be right behind you.

403
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,301
Come on... We're leaving.

404
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:15,850
Crap!

405
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,703
What is it...? Is something the matter?

406
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,744
No, nothing... It's okay...

407
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,512
My mind's just playing tricks on me.

408
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,639
Oh? Ahh, I'm all sweaty...!

409
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,324
Let's hurry back to the pool.

410
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,475
That sounds good.

411
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,541
You probably shouldn't swim anymore, though.

412
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:36,903
Man, look at this place.

413
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,974
They really made a mess of things in here...

414
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,057
I don't know...

415
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,133
I'll be lucky if I can find anything.

416
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,458
Hold on...

417
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,389
Over that way...

418
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,089
An area with functioning electricity.

419
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,307
Stay where you are.

420
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,695
And don't even think about trying anything.

421
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,557
It's you!

422
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:08,136
What're you... doing here?

423
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,503
I was right, then. You are involved with this.

424
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,757
What is going on...?

425
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:15,816
Are you in league with these creeps?

426
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,802
That's how Febri knew my name!

427
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,942
You're the one who told it to her, aren't you?

428
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:26,762
Hello!

429
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:28,681
Say something, would you?!

430
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:30,765
Take that with you...

431
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,792
It's the neutralizing agent data.

432
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,032
The what data?

433
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,851
The formula for the candy.

434
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,584
If you act now there should still be enough time.

435
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:40,951
But why...

436
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,986
why are you giving this to me?

437
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:45,058
Hmph. Sorry...

438
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,037
I guess you deserve an explanation.

439
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,731
Yes... As you already suspected,

440
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,592
I'm the one who gave Febri your name.

441
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:55,449
It's all I could think of...

442
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,222
I didn't know who else to turn to.

443
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,012
This wasn't how I originally planned it.

444
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:02,721
But today...

445
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:06,307
there was an unexpected disturbance here in the lab...

446
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,315
Fortunately, I was able to get away in time to meet you...

447
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,612
and now you'll be able to keep Febri alive.

448
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,025
You can give her a future.

449
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,067
I'm afraid not.

450
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:19,404
What you have there is just a dummy formula...

451
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,408
It won't do anything to help with Febri's condition.

452
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:25,856
I knew it would be a good idea to have some insurance.

453
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:29,336
So you were the one who orchestrated Febri's escape.

454
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,016
For a traitor, you sure keep interesting company...

455
00:21:32,244 --> 00:21:33,940
Enlisting the help of a celebrity.

456
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,837
Very resourceful... I am quite impressed.

457
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,390
It's nice to finally have the chance
to meet you in person, Railgun...

458
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,820
Put a face to the data I've collected.

459
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:46,241
And very useful data it has been.

460
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,411
So you're Haruki Aritomi, huh?

461
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,604
Huh? This is surprising.

462
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,515
You seem to have gone to a considerable amount of trouble.

463
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,283
And all just to save Febri's life?

464
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,779
She is a fine product, but even so...

465
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,240
"A fine product"?!

466
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:01,981
Then it's true. You're the one who created her!

467
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:02,798
Easy, now...

468
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,880
You shouldn't use electricity.

469
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:09,528
Unless you want to destroy the real copy of the formula.

470
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,419
Nunotaba...

471
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,471
Inject that into Railgun, here.

472
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,037
It will only incapacitate her...

473
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,077
She won't die.

474
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,643
And what's more...

475
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:23,182
if you follow my instructions exactly...

476
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,227
I'm willing to hand this over to you...

477
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,573
After all, we have no real use for it at this point.

478
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,132
No, I can't do it.

479
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:33,976
Inject me.

480
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,971
This is to save Febri's life.

481
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:53,060
Ha...!

482
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:56,094
Strong enough to render even a Level 5 powerless.

483
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,542
All right. I did what you asked.

484
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:02,997
Now give me the data.

485
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,166
Well... about our deal...

486
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:10,767
It's like I said...

487
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:12,865
We have no use for Febri...

488
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,765
She is just a spare.

489
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:16,130
She's a spare?

490
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,329
Yes.

491
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,190
For an invention that's truly revolutionary.

492
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,709
We call it Janie.

493
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:33,530
I knew you were involved in this!

494
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,871
Care to explain yourself?

495
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:35,682
To tell the truth...

496
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,932
It's a long, complicated story...

497
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,047
See, once upon a time...

498
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:40,698
Come on! This is no fairy tale!
