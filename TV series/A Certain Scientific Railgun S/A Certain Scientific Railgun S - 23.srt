1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,770
The idealist will say...

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,597
No man has inherent superiority.

3
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:10,203
That we are, all of us, beings of equal worth.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,443
While the spiritualist will argue...

5
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:15,159
No effort goes unrewarded.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,645
So, endeavor we must...

7
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,770
For, it is the process itself that is important.

8
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,498
Of course... all of that's a lie.

9
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:39,772
Every child learns one thing
quickly, living in this city...

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,097
It doesn't matter how much you study...

11
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,490
or how great of a thesis you produce...

12
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,217
In this city, you're either an esper or you're neglected.

13
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,523
A person's ability determines their worth...

14
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:52,745
their standing...

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,111
It is the one and only benchmark.

16
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:58,228
However, abilities are such unpredictable things...

17
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,784
They're affected by one's innate qualities,

18
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,701
and only in the rarest instance
is a high-level esper produced,

19
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:06,261
yet they are an important part of our social structure.

20
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,552
So, you see...

21
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:10,518
I could not help thinking to myself...

22
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:13,593
What if I could create my own esper?

23
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:17,685
I could use an approach that differs
completely from the existing methods.

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,951
I could design an esper that
was both stable and consistent...

25
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:26,478
but because it was artificially produced
would not be too valuable to be quickly used up.

26
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,805
So I collaborated with a few like-minded individuals,

27
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,891
and together we bent our minds
to developing a certain project.

28
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,618
One that would allow us to create
an esper with absolute certainty.

29
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,692
"Project Chemicaloid" was born.

30
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,224
And that project...

31
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,417
It produced Febri and her sister...

32
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,551
They exist because of your petty ambitions.

33
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,415
Heh... Yes, you would say that...

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,800
Like most people in this city, you
are entrenched in ability Levelism.

35
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:26,548
I've dealt with your kind.

36
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,064
What do you mean?

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,347
You see... I have presented this project
to people with skills like yours before,

38
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,088
skills that would be necessary for a chemicaloid.

39
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:40,466
How is it someone from the
underground is so short-sighted?

40
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:43,271
You would think they would see
the potential in our proposal.

41
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,171
I'm glad you made it here safely.

42
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:52,947
Now we can finally implement Project Level 6 Shift
on the scale that we had originally planned for it.

43
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,919
Ah! Is that... Dr. Gensei Kihara?

44
00:03:56,853 --> 00:04:00,035
I have to admit I began to sweat
when I heard there was some competition.

45
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:01,797
Oh, was there?

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,199
Ah! You mean the one where they
wanted to grow espers like sea-monkeys?

47
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,167
From that I learned a valuable lesson...

48
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:14,899
Even famous intellectual minds

49
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:18,142
can be clouded by an outdated
obsession with esper Levelism.

50
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:22,663
Revolutionary ideas are always
initially suspect, after all.

51
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:27,222
To be recognized we would have to
prove ourselves on intellect alone...

52
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,312
and so we produced what we said we would all along.

53
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:31,814
Chemicaloids.

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,397
Products that would prove our
worth... our true superiority...

55
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,568
to this city...

56
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,140
indeed, to the whole world!

57
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,763
So... what is it about these chemicaloids
that proves how superior you are?

58
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,114
What ability do your "products" have?

59
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,267
Trying to draw information out of me?

60
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:50,596
Now, now, I've already given you a good number of clues.

61
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,057
Remote operation...

62
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,988
With a strand of hair acting as a medium.

63
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,732
Well... that's part of it, but certainly not all...

64
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:01,384
Nice effort, though, Railgun.

65
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:02,775
Want to know more?

66
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:05,159
Well... You will...

67
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:11,094
After much waiting, at day break tomorrow, we
will begin our large-scale chemicaloid experiment.

68
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,016
Experiment?

69
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:13,889
No...

70
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,304
that word really isn't big enough anymore...

71
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,726
Allow me to revise.

72
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,188
Revolution!

73
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:22,502
STUDY Corporation will turn Academy City on it's head!

74
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,283
We will teach this wretched city...

75
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,048
No! We will teach the whole world a lesson!

76
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,502
Ultimately, progress is not brought about by abilities...

77
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,180
but by intelligence!

78
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:34,452
I...

79
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:35,930
feel...

80
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:41,514
Is that the time...

81
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:42,754
really?

82
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,411
Don't bother trying to move.

83
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,141
Only your eyes and your mouth will respond.

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,858
Your body is paralyzed.

85
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:54,329
It's because of the drug...

86
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,902
the one I injected you with...

87
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,962
It blocks the transmission of
commands to your nervous system.

88
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,594
You won't be able to move a finger for two more hours yet.

89
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,746
So... I'm curious...

90
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,584
How did you... get involved with these people?

91
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:11,974
I remember what you said.

92
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,592
You talked to me before about my sisters...

93
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,710
about how you stopped seeing them as things

94
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,110
and were trying to shut down the experiments...

95
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,594
After all that...

96
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,551
why get mixed up in something like this?

97
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,165
During the Sisters case, I made a mistake.

98
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,866
I was caught by an underground organization.

99
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:31,441
And then... I was sold.

100
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:32,816
To STUDY.

101
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:37,368
That's when I was introduced to
the artificially created twins.

102
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,846
Their names were Janie and Febri.

103
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:44,359
The involuntary neural activity
essential to keeping them alive...

104
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,695
what you might call their core programming...

105
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:49,921
was based on a thesis that I had written a long time ago.

106
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,582
That particular sin

107
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,014
is one for which I will never be forgiven...

108
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,477
It will follow me my entire life.

109
00:06:58,948 --> 00:06:59,843
Even so...

110
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:01,758
I must keep trying...

111
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,650
I must atone by helping in whatever way is possible...

112
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,003
That was all I could think... when I saw those girls.

113
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,244
Janie...

114
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,112
That's Febri's sister...

115
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:16,266
She only has enough programming language installed

116
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,111
to allow her Diffusion Ghost core to function properly.

117
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,764
Diffusion Ghost?

118
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,647
That is Janie's ability...

119
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:27,397
I'd planned to give her consciousness
comparable to that of a normal girl...

120
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,906
I'd get my hands on the neutralizing agent...

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,766
and then I would run away with her.

122
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,180
But now...

123
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,589
Things have gone too far... and that isn't possible.

124
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,639
I have to get the formula from Aritomi.

125
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,896
That's the only choice, since
he's the one who came up with it...

126
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,493
I'll do whatever I have to go get it from him.

127
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,671
Yes. I see.

128
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,126
I don't care what happens to me...

129
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,742
I will save those girls...

130
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,054
no matter the cost.

131
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:53,971
I get it...

132
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,636
I understand her guilt.

133
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:58,994
Hey...

134
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,616
I know what I've done is unforgivable...

135
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,696
My sister never got the chance, but...

136
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:04,912
she wanted to tell you thanks.

137
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,820
You think you have to do this by yourself...

138
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:09,352
but if you take a look around,

139
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,149
I think you'll realize you're wrong...

140
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:12,746
You're not alone...

141
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,416
There are people out there who
want to help you if you'll let them.

142
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,466
And you're one of those people I suppose?

143
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,031
But how do you think you can help me right now...?

144
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,002
You're effectively paralyzed...

145
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:26,909
Thanks to me, the only thing you can move is your mouth!

146
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,017
Oh, really? Just my mouth... huh?

147
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,067
How can you...?

148
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:33,933
Incredible!

149
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:39,168
She's using her ability to directly control
the electrical signals that run to her nerves!

150
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,944
I've never tried this before.

151
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,009
But, hey... it seems to work pretty well, huh?

152
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:51,062
Doing something like that should be causing
intense pain throughout her entire body.

153
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:54,383
Let me tell you what I've come to realize recently...

154
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,235
Other people count on you...

155
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,126
but you can count on them, too...

156
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,898
If you work with someone instead of on your own,

157
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,472
your combined strength can make all the difference.

158
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,507
You know...

159
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,010
when I first found out about my sisters...

160
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:11,799
I reacted the same way you are...

161
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:13,437
I just kept thinking...

162
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,201
"This is my fault. I have to do something."

163
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:18,361
However...

164
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:23,009
It took a while, but I've finally stopped
thinking like that... Which is why...

165
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,498
Here they come.

166
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,124
Huh?

167
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,234
Hey! What's going on?

168
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,216
More intruders...

169
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,567
The guard robots are down.

170
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:34,990
Uiharu...

171
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:37,063
I've got the entrance under my control.

172
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,558
You're certain there are no civilians in the area?

173
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,618
Yes, the coast is clear...

174
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,062
You can do whatever you need to...

175
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,183
Come in, Saten. What's the status outside?

176
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,065
It's all good...

177
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,298
No suspicious activity so far.

178
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,577
How did they know where to find you?

179
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,284
I borrowed one of those implantable tracking devices

180
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:55,631
they use when you go outside of Academy City.

181
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,863
And then...

182
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,032
I talked it over with my friends.

183
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,284
I told them if I was gone too long,

184
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,154
they should come and get me.

185
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,015
You actually dragged your friends into this mess...

186
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:05,642
No.

187
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:08,554
I explained the situation to them...

188
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:11,323
and then I asked. I asked for help.

189
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,325
And without hesitation, they agreed...

190
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,463
They care about Febri, too.

191
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,637
Although... it looks like Febri may need more help

192
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,163
than my friends and I can give.

193
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,522
So now I'm asking you...

194
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,438
Do you think you can help us save her?

195
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,326
But this is all my fault. You can't trust me.

196
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,371
Yes I can.

197
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,064
I trust you completely.

198
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,378
Look...

199
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:41,719
No, this is all wrong...

200
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,237
you shouldn't be saying that.

201
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,755
I'm the one who should be asking you...

202
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,449
So, now I am...

203
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,167
I'm asking... Please help us!

204
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:58,826
Kuroko!

205
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,076
Hi, Sissy!

206
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,107
Ah... Hold on. You don't want to...

207
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,354
Ahh!

208
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:04,362
How cruel!

209
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:06,293
I came to help and you repay me like this?!

210
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:09,068
I'm... sorry... It's kind of a long story,

211
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,195
but basically I'm going to be a human stun gun

212
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:12,054
for a little while.

213
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:12,616
Huh?

214
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,159
Anyway... I think we've worn out our welcome.

215
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,589
What's going on?

216
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,408
I'll explain soon enough.

217
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:19,871
Let's get out of here.

218
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,270
She regained all motor function
after a full dose of the drug...

219
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:26,604
Incredible.

220
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,234
It seems she's every bit as strong as we'd heard.

221
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,284
So... what are you still doing here...?

222
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,619
Why didn't you run away?

223
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:35,271
What choice did I have?

224
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:38,980
Everybody knows my history...
that I was sold to your corporation.

225
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,753
If I ran, then the entire underworld would be after me.

226
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,819
In this town, that's as good as a death sentence.

227
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,413
So, you stayed out of fear rather than loyalty...

228
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,545
That's not surprising...

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,596
It's just as well, however. If you weren't here to assist,

230
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,829
we'd have to resort to the whip when using Janie.

231
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:58,682
The only place you have left is
here in the darkness with STUDY.

232
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,853
For your own good, I do hope you'll keep that in mind.

233
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,103
Are you sure you want to stay?

234
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,473
Aritomi is cautious...

235
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:09,067
He doesn't want to be discovered...

236
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:11,385
He's relocated Janie some place else.

237
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:14,270
If I leave, we won't be able to find out where she is now.

238
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:15,079
But you...

239
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,456
Don't worry about me.

240
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,525
I still have at least a little value to them...

241
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,548
They won't dispose of me right away...

242
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,494
I just have to bide my time...

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,302
I'll find out where their base is
and I'll get the formula we need.

244
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:28,795
Just be careful.

245
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:31,648
Anyway... about what Aritomi said...

246
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,117
He mentioned something was going to happen tomorrow.

247
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,929
What's that all about, do you know?

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,391
They haven't given me any of the details...

249
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:41,228
But like he said, they do have something planned.

250
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:42,332
Tomorrow.

251
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,271
A terrorist attack at the Reach Assembly sites?

252
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:45,932
Yes...

253
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,902
Actually, the word he used to
describe it was "revolution."

254
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,408
That sounds crazy!

255
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,944
These guys mean business...

256
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:55,036
They have Febri's sister,
Janie, and they plan on using her.

257
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:58,094
Or, at any rate... they'll use Janie's ability.

258
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:58,842
Huh?!

259
00:12:58,889 --> 00:12:59,770
No way!

260
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:03,284
Sorry, but did you say "Diffusion
Ghost" was the name of her ability?

261
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,297
Her ability is called "Diffusion Ghost,"

262
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,232
and it requires hair for a medium...

263
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,283
With it, she is able to convert the AIM diffusion fields

264
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:13,571
in an enclosed space into virtual matter

265
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,747
and achieve control.

266
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,534
In other words, those empty powered suits

267
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,661
and the berserk security robots were controlled

268
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:24,257
in the same way... With Janie... And her strange ability.

269
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,792
This use of AIM fields sounds familiar to me.

270
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,311
Like what Dr. Kiyama did that one time.

271
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:31,946
You understand this?

272
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:32,853
Kind of...

273
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,143
I do think I've seen it...

274
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,037
Let's think...

275
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,280
With operating system abilities,

276
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:40,162
there is a limit to how many
things can be controlled at once...

277
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:43,102
This isn't really suited for a large-scale attack.

278
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,087
Okay, but...

279
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,359
they did say that a number of simple commands

280
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,131
are placed ahead of time into the fields

281
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,459
that Janie virtually materializes...

282
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:51,618
For example...

283
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,909
"Eliminate any opponent who attacks."

284
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:54,862
Something like that.

285
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,180
So, basically...

286
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:59,620
it's like having a bunch of
autonomous robots on hand, right?

287
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:00,984
If all this is true...

288
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:03,522
a large-scale attack wouldn't be impossible.

289
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:06,659
Febri's sister.

290
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,313
Do you know where STUDY has been keeping Janie...?

291
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,665
If we stop her, they can't launch an attack!

292
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,016
Well, yeah, that's true...

293
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,837
but this Nunotaba woman I mentioned to you before...

294
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:18,903
she wasn't told what the base
for the attack was going to be.

295
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,158
Oh, no...

296
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,673
Once Janie uses her ability,

297
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:26,805
Nunotaba thinks Febri will be able to
give us an idea of her sister's location,

298
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:29,689
or at least the direction of where to start looking.

299
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:31,612
That's all well and good, but...

300
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:35,538
If she's used her ability, doesn't
that mean that we are already too late?

301
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,720
If we're going to forestall this,

302
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,693
the best thing to do would be
to pursue the powered suit angle.

303
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,514
There must be quite a number of them currently deployed

304
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,825
in the area around the Reach Assembly site...

305
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:47,596
Uiharu... look that up?

306
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,076
I have more parameters to apply to the search now...

307
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,482
I think I can do it!

308
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,858
Hey, you know...

309
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:58,369
with all this new information,
Antiskill might be able to act.

310
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,377
You're right!

311
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,658
I'm sorry, I really am.

312
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,259
But I don't think Antiskill can get involved in this case.

313
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,378
But why not?

314
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:09,770
The STUDY Corporation, huh?

315
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,029
Now that I hear that name,
things are starting to make sense.

316
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:14,997
They're fairly new...

317
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:19,764
but they've quickly risen to prominence, forcing out
the competition to become our equipment suppliers...

318
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,626
Their swift ascent has been bothering me...

319
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:24,986
but, I guess this explains it.

320
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,576
Mm. Ya' know, for that matter,

321
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:30,073
it explains why I was suddenly suspended, too.

322
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,091
Suspended?!

323
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:32,016
Are you all right?

324
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:33,184
Yeah.

325
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,703
I'm weathering the storm at a friend's place...

326
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:38,038
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

327
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,120
I'm a lot more worried about you guys.

328
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,185
Don't do anything crazy.

329
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,356
The situation is even more dire than we first thought.

330
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,666
I've got it!

331
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:52,371
The record of STUDY Corporation's bulk
containers and the sites they have been delivered to.

332
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,505
They made it into the sites? How could they...

333
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,152
Well, look.

334
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,260
It says here that there was a
blackout at each site during delivery,

335
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,685
and all of their records appear to be incomplete.

336
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:01,868
Blackouts! Of course!

337
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,534
And now we know the reason behind them.

338
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:04,702
How many are we talking about?

339
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:07,125
Give me a second. I'm tallying them now.

340
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,400
Bad news, ladies!

341
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,866
I finally got a hold of some relevant information

342
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:12,375
using my father's channels...

343
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:13,433
When you add up...

344
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:16,316
Approximating by container capacity and contents...

345
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,413
you've got enough to build a truly incredible

346
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:19,701
number of powered suits!

347
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:21,306
No way! That's so many!

348
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,228
The number has to be...

349
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,650
Over 20,000!

350
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:24,778
I beg your pardon?

351
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:25,993
Impossible...

352
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:29,775
The thing is...

353
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,532
Since they went through official
channels to deliver the suits

354
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:34,145
to all of the various sites...

355
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:37,418
we can't take any action without Antiskill's cooperation.

356
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:39,526
If we do, there's a good chance we'd be arrested.

357
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:43,957
Essentially... it doesn't sound like there's a
whole lot we can do until they make their move.

358
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:47,214
Then we have to find this Janie girl and stop her somehow.

359
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,669
Yes, except... we have no way of knowing

360
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:52,157
where she is until she activates her ability.

361
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,815
Which means we'll have to allow the attack to begin.

362
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:55,954
That's crazy!

363
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:58,647
We're totally unprepared...

364
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,023
These guys are light years ahead of us.

365
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,786
All this time...

366
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,685
they've been getting ready for a coup.

367
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:07,855
If they get out into the city,
who knows how much damage they'll do?

368
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,079
What's on your mind?

369
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,136
Please tell us.

370
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:17,867
I just want to save Febri...

371
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,781
and her sister, Janie as well...

372
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,710
I want to save Nunotaba,

373
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:24,247
who, right now, is still embedded with the enemy...

374
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,750
And, of course, I want to protect Academy City.

375
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:29,528
I also...

376
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,922
I want to keep every single one of you out of danger...

377
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:36,553
So, I wonder... am I just being selfish?

378
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,110
Well, if you are...

379
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:42,741
If that's the case, then I have to admit I'm selfish, too.

380
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,672
Mm-Hm. And actually... I may be worse...

381
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,076
because I want all of that, and on top of it,

382
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,567
I want you to stop looking so miserable.

383
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,005
Saten is right.

384
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,547
Even when things are going as well as they can...

385
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,273
you still seem to find something to worry about, Sissy...

386
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,309
It makes it hard for the rest
of us to really relax, you know?

387
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,659
That's true...

388
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,638
Cheer up. We can do this if we all work together.

389
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:06,568
Exactly...!

390
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,704
Together, there's nothing we can't do!

391
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,882
I... I believe so, as well...

392
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,250
We are unstoppable.

393
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,553
It won't be easy...

394
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,571
but when this is finally over...

395
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,828
we'll still be standing, shoulder to shoulder.

396
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,076
We'll have a happy ending, you'll see!

397
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,741
I know you have your own goals...

398
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,593
Mine is seeing everybody get through this alive.

399
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,731
Heh. I know what you mean.

400
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,585
Now it's my goal too.

401
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,050
Uh?

402
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:46,620
Oh, hi... Everybody's here.

403
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:47,718
Yes, Febri...

404
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:50,951
we are all here...

405
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,220
and we're about to go and see if we can help Janie.

406
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,011
Would you like to come, too?

407
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:57,806
Yeah!

408
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:58,800
Heh.

409
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,368
Oh, Aomi?

410
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:06,426
Sorry to be calling you so late.

411
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,260
That's okay.

412
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,548
If you're the one calling,
well, I know there's a good reason,

413
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:12,106
no matter how late it might be.

414
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,067
So, spill.

415
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,219
All right. Tell me...

416
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,207
What do you think about this city?

417
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:18,288
Huh?

418
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:21,186
Thank you, Father, I really appreciate this.

419
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,285
Okay... I'll leave you to it, then.

420
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,922
Heh. Well, you heard her.

421
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,116
Let's indulge my daughter.

422
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,040
You'll see to everything... right, Pops?

423
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,480
Oh, hot! Hot! Hot!

424
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,299
All done!

425
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,363
Wow! That's very pretty!

426
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,685
I'm gonna save it so my sister can eat it.

427
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,058
That's so sweet...

428
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,201
And how is it going over there?

429
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,866
Hmm. I'm not sure how well it's going,

430
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,908
but I'm not giving up anytime soon, I promise that much!

431
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:51,922
Hang in there!

432
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:52,627
You bet!

433
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,533
Okay! We'll keep working hard, too, right, Febri?

434
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:59,275
That's refreshing! Ahh...

435
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:02,199
I've got everything all ready to go over here, too.

436
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,543
This should make a good decoy

437
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,996
in case the head resident comes barging in here.

438
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:06,783
Wait.

439
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,968
This only makes it look like
one of us is sleeping, doesn't it?

440
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,779
And this side is too big...

441
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,450
See... they are sleeping... in each other's arms!

442
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:16,460
Oww!

443
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,373
Aww. But I had them positioned just right.

444
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,351
Good grief.

445
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,847
We can at least try to make it look realistic.

446
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,001
If we get found out, we're both in for it.

447
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,863
Let's see...

448
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:27,761
Hey, Sissy...

449
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:32,523
What's this?

450
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,030
It's a four-leaf clover.

451
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:34,503
Huh?

452
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,332
It's a good-luck charm that I picked especially for you.

453
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:40,962
Thanks a lot.

454
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,471
By the way...

455
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,537
Who was that you called earlier?

456
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,318
Oh... Just someone.

457
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:50,249
Ten minutes remaining to sunrise.

458
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,380
It has been a long night, indeed.

459
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,913
But, at last...

460
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:59,107
we are about to see the dawning of a new day.

461
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,324
All systems are prepped and ready to go.

462
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:03,310
All that remains is to activate them.

463
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:05,773
Janie has reached critical phase, as well...

464
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:09,293
It's almost as if she's aware
of her own role in what's to come.

465
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:11,748
Almost time...

466
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,545
What I have planned may work, and it may not...

467
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,293
Either way, it won't absolve my sin.

468
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:21,322
But... even so...

469
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,983
I resolve to do whatever I can.

470
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,256
Now then. Time for final confirmation...

471
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,038
Those in favor or proceeding as we have planned?

472
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:33,851
Okay, we're ready...

473
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,504
Let us begin our Silent Party.

474
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,424
You know, you look very nice in that outfit.

475
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,425
Is that the present Kongo bought for you?

476
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:45,744
Mm-Hmm. It's pretty,

477
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:47,898
and it reminds me of the one from before.

478
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,216
One from before?

479
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,213
From Shinobu... She picked it out for me.

480
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:55,327
Oh?

481
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:56,780
Well...

482
00:21:58,811 --> 00:21:59,903
It's time now.

483
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:27,483
All right!

484
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,753
You will not be taking...

485
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,485
one tiny little step...

486
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,886
beyond this point.

487
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,838
You... you go right ahead...

488
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,017
and give us the best you've got to give!

489
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,020
That way!

490
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,419
My sister...

491
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,954
Here. Don't forget this.

492
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:51,218
This is our last shot.

493
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:54,364
Up you go...

494
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:57,249
I need you to trust me, okay?

495
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:02,945
Aaaahhhhh!

496
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,360
Right... Here we go!

497
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,186
To protect Academy City...

498
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:33,821
To save Janie and Febri...

499
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,201
and Nunotaba, too.

500
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,745
For a happy ending for all of us!

501
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:37,908
That's why we're fighting...

502
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,904
To make that dream come true!
