1
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,375
Oh, wow!

2
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:12,894
You know, it's hard to believe how big
she's gotten after only two weeks, isn't it?

3
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,062
Not really.

4
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:17,964
She does have a ZID-02 cocktail to stimulate her growth...

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,401
You've been through training, right?

6
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,628
You should already be aware of
what to expect from the process.

7
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,187
Of course. I'm sorry...

8
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:27,021
I know all about it, I do!

9
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,420
I just got so excited, seeing it in action.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,947
Let's get started.

11
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,624
Oh, right! I'll just go get ready.

12
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:17,447
Oooh!

13
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,645
The sun is almost blinding today, isn't it?

14
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:25,484
I know I should be worried about sunburn, but then again
that's what makes it feel like summer, don't you think?

15
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,504
Ooh! Look it's a cicada shell!

16
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:32,962
The Sissy I know doesn't like sunburns and cicada shells.

17
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,867
It's not quite noon yet.

18
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,431
We've still got some time.

19
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,132
Kuroko!

20
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,453
Oh! Yes, what is it?

21
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,628
What would you like? It's my treat today!

22
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,496
Wha...

23
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:52,740
She always uses kicks on that vending machine...
not cash... and she's paying for mine, too?

24
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,457
Well?

25
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,984
I... I guess I'll take an iced coffee!

26
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,442
Oh! I am so sorry.

27
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:07,581
It was an accident! I absolutely did not
mean to dive headlong into your breasts.

28
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:10,480
Calm down. I know that.

29
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:12,690
You should be more careful, though.

30
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,287
Okay, now what should I get?

31
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,173
Something is wrong!

32
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:23,043
What has come over my dear, grouchy Sissy?

33
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,885
Could she be an imposter?

34
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,559
All right, I think I'll go with the coconut cider.

35
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,655
You are wearing orange underwear today...

36
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,628
They are polka-dotted with a winking Gekota... Aaah!

37
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,289
Where did that come from?

38
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,896
Just... checking...

39
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,453
It really is you.

40
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:44,622
Look! There they are!

41
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,241
Hey, sorry we're late!

42
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,235
What are you guys up to?

43
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,913
Great looking tan, Shirai!

44
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,914
So, What do we have on the docket for today?

45
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,348
Well, let's see...

46
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,168
I wouldn't mind doing some shopping...

47
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,551
There are a few things I need for our field trip.

48
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,004
Yeah, that's right...

49
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,712
It's coming up soon, huh?

50
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:05,865
So, where are you all going, Misaka?

51
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,145
I'm pretty sure it's called "Liberal Arts City".

52
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,871
Oh, yeah?

53
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,047
The artificial island in California?

54
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,366
Uh... Mhmm.

55
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,622
That's the same place we're going!

56
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,917
I didn't realize that.

57
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,554
How great! We're all in the same group!

58
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,707
The five of us can hang out the whole time...

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,780
We can eat together... and go shopping...

60
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:26,044
Oh, and then there's the beach, too.

61
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,455
Wow! I'm starting to get excited!

62
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,689
Now I have an excuse to get a new swimsuit!

63
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:33,862
Though maybe I should wait on that...

64
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,596
There are a lot of other things I need to buy first.

65
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:40,029
This would be a great time to
have a big stack of Money Cards.

66
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,126
You can't be serious!

67
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,694
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know! I was only kidding...

68
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:47,514
Anyway... what's been going on with that case lately?

69
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:51,709
There have been no new developments in a
while, but it hasn't been open too long.

70
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:52,947
I see...

71
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,793
You're obsessing about it, aren't you?

72
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,292
Well... I am kind of hooked on it, yeah...

73
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:00,749
It's like I can sense something
bigger lurking in the shadows behind it!

74
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,365
So, are you basing that on anything?

75
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,089
Just my sharp instincts as an urban legend hunter.

76
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,194
Oh, you're starting with that again?

77
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,205
Again? What do you mean, again?

78
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:11,339
Please, give me an example!

79
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:12,928
Is something bad going on?

80
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:13,899
No, don't worry...

81
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,408
Saten just has an overactive imagination.

82
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,796
Wha... Uiharu?

83
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:20,174
I think that's about enough of that conversation.

84
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,372
Come on. Let's go shopping...

85
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,505
The daylight isn't going to last forever!

86
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,301
Hey, wait for us!

87
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:32,473
There! I'm all set now.

88
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,903
That's all you're getting?

89
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:34,397
Yeah.

90
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:37,018
There was only one thing I
needed to get a little bit more of.

91
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:38,947
What about the rest of you guys?

92
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:39,791
Oh... well...

93
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,047
A rice cooker?

94
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,733
Yes. Ever since we became roommates, we've
started cooking at home a whole lot more.

95
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,483
But, uh... you already have one, right?

96
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,230
Yeah, we do, but we want another.

97
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:55,091
Oh... I remember. Yesterday you said... it was too small.

98
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:55,847
Uh-huh...

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,564
Sorry I eat so much.

100
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,660
I'm not blaming you at all, Haru'ue!

101
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,291
You've seen how much I eat!

102
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,125
Yeah, really!

103
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,834
Uiharu can be a serious glutton!

104
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:06,012
Excuse me?

105
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,479
What do you think of this one?

106
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,215
Now that's an amazing machine.

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,447
It sure is, huh?

108
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:17,141
Although... It's not really in our budget.

109
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,912
You know how it is, don't you?

110
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,676
I suppose I do.

111
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,900
Sissy haggling?

112
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,756
Really?

113
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:29,631
Wow...

114
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:32,244
We ended up with a really nice one!

115
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,689
I know!

116
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,851
I had no idea Misaka was such an expert at bargaining!

117
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,736
Just think of all the amazing things
we'll be able to cook at home now!

118
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,705
We'll practically be gourmet chefs!

119
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,605
Wow... There sure are a lot of them.

120
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,609
Tons and tons!

121
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,984
This place has such a wide variety of stuff!

122
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:50,246
Look at this!

123
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:54,394
These would be too cute! How could I ever eat them?

124
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,869
Uh... I'm just kidding! I can totally eat cute cookies!

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,472
Whatcha think?

126
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:12,476
Are any of these swimsuits the
kind of thing you're looking for?

127
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:15,836
I don't know. There are so many
different styles to choose from...

128
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,522
I've never picked out a swimsuit
myself before, so it's difficult.

129
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,677
Why don't you let me give you a hand, then!

130
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,236
Are you ready?

131
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:25,919
Well?

132
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:27,437
It's just...

133
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,707
It looks like it was made for a little girl.

134
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:30,465
You think?

135
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,147
Huh?

136
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:35,134
I think we're still having the same problem here.

137
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,539
Okay... if you say so...

138
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,324
Misaka's bouncing off the walls today.

139
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,855
What's gotten into her?

140
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,707
Yeah, I'd noticed that, too...

141
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,058
Do you know what's going on, Kuroko?

142
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,290
This one?

143
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:53,064
We really lucked out with the
rice cooker, didn't we, Haru'ue?

144
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:53,640
Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,132
Oh, hey, I just realized where we are...

146
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:58,167
This is where I saw "you," Misaka.

147
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:02,020
Oh... You mean Misaka's look-alike, or whatever?

148
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,870
Are you still going on about that?

149
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,088
I'm serious, she was almost identical...

150
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:09,384
I wonder... That's it! I know!

151
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,950
What if she's actually your long-lost twin!

152
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,102
Oh, yeah! Speaking of look-alikes, I heard
the craziest rumor from Konori earlier...

153
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,559
Something about using cloning
technology to mass-produce a Level Fi...

154
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,396
I mean... um...

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,256
Cloning, huh?

156
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,555
As far as Academy City rumors
go, that one is right up there...

157
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,933
Let's see, if I had a clone, what would I do?

158
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,020
How about you, Saten?

159
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,468
If I had a clone?

160
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:45,286
Well, let me see...

161
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,711
First of all, I'd have her take
care of all my summer homework.

162
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:50,530
I would leave mine in our room...

163
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,875
Then I could break curfew without getting in trouble.

164
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,696
With my own clone, I could eat enough for two people.

165
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:57,371
That's an awesome idea!

166
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,804
If you couldn't choose what to eat at a
restaurant, you could order two dishes.

167
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,857
What if you have it backwards and each
of you could only eat half a serving?

168
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:06,303
She has a point.

169
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,916
Yeah... What a shame...

170
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,220
It's your turn to answer now, Sissy.

171
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:14,429
What would you do if there was a
clone of you wandering around the city?

172
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,836
That's a good question...

173
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,378
Incredible! She looks like a real person.

174
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,870
Well, sure she does.

175
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,746
She's a clone...

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,333
That is sort of the point.

177
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:49,770
As you can see...

178
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:52,852
her mental age is approximately still that of a newborn.

179
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:57,245
She can't understand language or walk on
her own. She can't do much of anything, really.

180
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,179
What are you doing?

181
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,678
Huh? Well...

182
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,221
I was worried she might catch a cold if she's all wet.

183
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,271
You can do things like that for now...

184
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:09,219
but soon you won't have time to.

185
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:11,475
Word is we're creating the rest in one batch.

186
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,622
Language... motor skills...

187
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,570
and ethical data are input like this using Testament...

188
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:26,142
This system transmits the data electrically via all five
senses, forcibly writing the information into her brain.

189
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,810
Well... Keeping up so far?

190
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:31,899
Yeah... I was thinking about what you said.

191
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:32,605
Which part?

192
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,745
Isn't the process a bit inefficient?

193
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:38,669
Without repeated conditioning, the data
input isn't going to take very well...

194
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,293
Shouldn't they make them in series, according to usage?

195
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,558
The higher-ups have their own reasons for doing things...

196
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,164
They give us orders.

197
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,585
We accept them and do what we are told.

198
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,266
Aww, I can't believe the day's over already...

199
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:58,676
At this rate, summer vacation
will be over before we know it.

200
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:01,441
It's getting close to festival time, huh?

201
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,475
Oh, yeah... It is that time of year.

202
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:07,017
It doesn't really feel like it here in the city, though.

203
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,478
Barely anybody goes back home for it.

204
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,147
That's okay...

205
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,522
It means we get more time to spend together.

206
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:14,976
Yeah, you're right!

207
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,883
Let's enjoy ourselves, instead of counting the days.

208
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,127
There's plenty of summer left!

209
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,872
Breakfast? At this hour?

210
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,164
Well, isn't someone living the good life!

211
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,444
And why not?

212
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,663
It's not like I have anything else to do today.

213
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,046
What are Shirai and the others up to?

214
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,182
Everyone's got something...

215
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:40,040
Uiharu and Kuroko both have a Judgment function...

216
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,210
Saten and Haru'ue already had plans too.

217
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,652
With this much free time on your hands, life
must be seeming pretty empty and isolated, huh?

218
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,266
Who asked for your opinion?

219
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:50,742
It doesn't matter to me.

220
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,126
Just hurry up and eat, okay?

221
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,829
Otherwise, I'll never have time
to get everything straightened up.

222
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:56,927
Jeez...

223
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:59,357
I can't even enjoy a leisurely meal now?

224
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,899
Do you seriously not have anything better to do?

225
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm sure I can find something.

226
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,833
Hey... How come...

227
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,437
It sucks when you're all ready to read
your favorite magazine, and then you realize

228
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,943
it's the same double issue from the week before.

229
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,469
I'm so bored.

230
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:25,247
Really?

231
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,459
Uh... what's up?

232
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,265
You're that same girl.

233
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:35,408
Right?

234
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:36,709
We helped you find your bag.

235
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,870
Since you don't have anything else to do,
I think you should come and play with us!

236
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,076
Uh, sorry, I'm actually kind of busy, you see...

237
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,171
You fibber!

238
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,927
I just heard you say you're bored!

239
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:47,468
Yeah!

240
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,205
What can I say to that?

241
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,678
All right, Big Sister will play with you.

242
00:12:57,703 --> 00:12:58,823
Hooray!

243
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:00,998
Ha! Our "Big Sister," huh?

244
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,357
She's at that age.

245
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,471
They like to start thinking that they're grown-ups.

246
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:08,945
Wait up!

247
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,064
No way!

248
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:15,047
Rats! She did it to us again!

249
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:16,588
Go on... hurry and get away!

250
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,716
It's not fair when you kick it so far!

251
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,244
Do you always hafta try so hard against little kids?

252
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:26,438
Sorry... but you wouldn't want me to go
around acting like I'm a grown-up, would you?

253
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,371
You're a big jerk! A stupid-dummy head!

254
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:31,254
I'm rubber, you're glue...
You're ugly and you smell funny!

255
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,440
What did you call me, you little brat?

256
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:40,725
How does that bratty, smart-talking
mouth of yours like this, huh?

257
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,117
Cut it out you big, stupid freak!

258
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:48,344
Someday, I'll become a Level 5, and
then I'm gonna get back at you for this!

259
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:50,747
I'll take you on any time you want, short stuff.

260
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,800
Big Sis!

261
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:53,827
You've got an ability.

262
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:56,153
You're a big-shot electrical user, aren't you?

263
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,037
I guess.

264
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:00,340
Oh, really? That's Nao's ability, too.

265
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:01,991
Is that right?

266
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,193
But look.

267
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,525
No matter how hard I try, that's all I can do.

268
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,523
That's the same for everyone at the beginning...

269
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,057
Keep practicing, and you'll be able to do lots of things.

270
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,296
What kinda things?

271
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:20,607
Like, will Nao be able to "cell phone" with you?

272
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:21,401
"Cell phone"?

273
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,993
You know, use electricity to talk.

274
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,969
Oh... No, sorry.

275
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,855
I can't even tell where someone is
using my ability, much less talk to them.

276
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,675
Not even a little?

277
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,847
If there was no interference at all...

278
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,659
like if we were out at sea... it might be possible.

279
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,294
But here in the city, where EM waves are flying
around all over, there's just too much noise for that.

280
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:50,668
Hmm? Oh... okay...

281
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:51,480
Although...

282
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:53,882
there was the case of the Level Uppers...

283
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:58,439
As long as the brainwaves' waveforms were
close, they might be able to construct a network...

284
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,145
Like that'll ever happen.

285
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,461
Good morning. Do you know what that means?

286
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,689
"A routine beginning of daily conversation.

287
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,414
Otherwise known as a greeting," affirms Misaka swiftly.

288
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,113
Your specimen number?

289
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,116
Specimen number nine-nine-eight-two.

290
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,460
It appears that you're plugged
into the Misaka Net, all right...

291
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,314
Here you go, you can start by putting this on.

292
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:33,582
Uh, I'm sorry...

293
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,720
All this shameless nudity is
kind of making me uncomfortable.

294
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:39,294
Really?

295
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:43,680
Couldn't we add maybe a touch of modesty
when it comes to displaying the body?

296
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:48,486
If we add any unnecessary emotions and
then they rebel, that would be problematic.

297
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,801
The "safety devices" aren't exactly perfect.

298
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:53,850
Oh... is that right?

299
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,535
It's true... Besides, we couldn't do it...

300
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:58,926
You and I don't have the necessary skills...

301
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:00,365
That machine over there.

302
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,956
It was overseen by Nuno-something-or-other...

303
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,306
the girl genius...

304
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,196
and even she just barely got it functioning.

305
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:07,823
Oh...

306
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:18,034
Children sure have a lot of energy.

307
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,463
Me too. And it's really warm out here.

308
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,524
Young lady!

309
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:28,038
This is very important. From whom did you get that button?

310
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:28,980
Huh?

311
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:32,342
I got it from the vending
machines in the shopping district.

312
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,772
It's the type where you have to
turn the knob to drop the capsule.

313
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:44,469
With something this low-tech, my ability's
not going to be of any use at all...

314
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,400
Well, here goes.

315
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,201
Look at that! There's a girl
from Tokiwadai at the toy machine.

316
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,230
I see her...

317
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,897
I'm sure she's buying them for those children, though.

318
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:08,494
This is ridiculous... Not a single one.

319
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,328
You, kid, go get me change!

320
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,314
Huh? Why should I get y...

321
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,213
Did you see her eyes?

322
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,452
Just do it, man.

323
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,359
Okay. Good call.

324
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:23,745
Wow.

325
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,352
There weren't any in there, huh?

326
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,172
Well, um...

327
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,371
If you want to, I can trade you for...

328
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,223
I forgot!

329
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,606
There are more in front of the train station.

330
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:45,116
You got it! Good job!

331
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:46,330
Isn't it pretty?

332
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:49,121
It's over... It's finally over.

333
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:52,197
I'll go get some bags or something to carry 'em in.

334
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,205
Yeah, me too.

335
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,179
Well... now that I've finally gotten it...

336
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,147
What am I going to do with it?

337
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:01,181
"Collector's fever":

338
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,489
That unfortunate condition that
drives sufferers to obtain every product

339
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,041
even remotely related to the subject of their obsession,

340
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,906
regardless of the consequences.

341
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:14,260
Even I know that wearing it on my shirt like this
little girl would be pathetic and embarrassing...

342
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,758
Really... I can just imagine the pitiful
look Kuroko will give me when she sees this.

343
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,387
Uhh... Another one, Sissy?

344
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:26,734
Yeah... but if I put it on a bag...
that might be just barely cool, right?

345
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,861
Oh, wow. I didn't know how late it was!

346
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,768
We have to go home or we'll get in trouble.

347
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,227
Well, there went my entire day.

348
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:39,248
Hey!

349
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:42,236
If you're at the pool and you go
underwater, how long can you hold your breath?

350
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,651
We played for hours and hours!

351
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,708
Just because you're on vacation doesn't
mean you can do nothing but play games...

352
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:50,005
You have to do your summer homework too.

353
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,616
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

354
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,526
Oh... no. Everything's just fine.

355
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,253
Come on, let's go.

356
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,018
Goodbye, Big Sister!

357
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,473
Thanks for playing today!

358
00:19:12,544 --> 00:19:15,632
Any time. And you'll be careful going home, right?

359
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:16,094
Yep!

360
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:28,997
Okay... now what was that before?

361
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,364
A power very similar to mine...

362
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,001
No...

363
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,106
It felt like my own power was
washing over me from the outside in.

364
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:41,606
It's not possible.

365
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:46,886
There's no way... except... except...

366
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:52,363
Let's see...

367
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:01,133
There. That looks about right...

368
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:03,753
One last thing...

369
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,866
Muscle strength, stamina,

370
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,799
and cardiovascular endurance all check out...

371
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:19,436
You still need to pass your interpersonal response test...

372
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:22,027
After that you can move on to external training.

373
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:26,033
Misaka has already mastered every possible situation...

374
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:29,035
from ordering a hamburger... to spotting a con-artist...

375
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,577
She is confident that she can blend
in with people in the outside world.

376
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,169
Therefore, she has some doubts
as to the necessity of such a test.

377
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:37,630
You're not prepared for everything...

378
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:41,230
There are times on the outside when what
you learned using Testament will not work...

379
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:45,051
Maybe... if you were to run
into the Original, for example...

380
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:46,506
Though that's not likely.

381
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:51,564
Well... even if that does happen, it
shouldn't interfere with the experiment.

382
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,411
"What is the Original?" Misaka asks.

383
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,204
Good question.

384
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,200
She's the model for the Sisters...

385
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:02,462
I guess you could say she's...
sort of like your older sister.

386
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:04,576
Older sister...

387
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,646
Around here... This is where it came from.

388
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,015
Who... are you?

389
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:13,056
Hmm... Now for your clothing...

390
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,085
You've been provided with an
outfit... so go ahead and change.

391
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:19,238
Oh... uh... actually...

392
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,574
Would you mind cleaning those up first?

393
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,656
You know... before the next experiment.

394
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,832
Misaka understands.

395
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:33,270
What is this?

396
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,064
The same face... The same hair...

397
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,820
She looks just like me in every way...

398
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,141
Who are you? Tell me!

399
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,648
Uh, Sissy... Why are you yelling at the mirror?
