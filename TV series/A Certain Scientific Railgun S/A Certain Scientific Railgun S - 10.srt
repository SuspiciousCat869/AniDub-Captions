1
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,346
The attacks have stopped...

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,204
Somehow I don't think that means they're letting me go...

3
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,557
Are they just waiting for my next move?

4
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:32,390
Heh...

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,386
They seem to have an esper who
can pinpoint someone's location...

6
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,794
which means trying to hide isn't an option.

7
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:42,384
Unfortunately...

8
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,349
If I do run into them...

9
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,969
I don't have much of a fight left in me.

10
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,263
I saw this tape before.

11
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:56,106
The blonde girl used it.

12
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,147
So... what?

13
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,824
Does she have this stuff laid out all over the facility?

14
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:02,516
That's a problem.

15
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:04,704
But maybe...

16
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,659
I can make it her problem.

17
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,050
Good work in there.

18
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:07,895
We're meeting up with Kinuhata...

19
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,643
at S Processor, okay?

20
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:12,693
The two of you wait here until Mugino comes out.

21
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:13,853
Certainly.

22
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,107
Phew!

23
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:22,067
I'm wiped out!

24
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:23,134
Frenda...

25
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:23,896
Huh?

26
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,184
We're leaving because of me...

27
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,520
If it was just you, you could've stayed.

28
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,367
Don't worry about it, okay?

29
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,198
Mugino's fine handling it on her own from here.

30
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,741
And besides...

31
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,427
you were the one who was really helping her, not me.

32
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:39,221
Speaking of which...

33
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,092
shouldn't you have reined your
power in a little bit sooner?

34
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,391
I was kind of starting to get scared for you.

35
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,263
I'm okay.

36
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,313
As long as I'm here...

37
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,013
where I belong.

38
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,127
Hm. Yeah, sure.

39
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:59,292
Sometimes it's good to have more than
one place where you belong, though, y'know?

40
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:02,912
So then...

41
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:06,846
Ahhhh!

42
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:08,991
What's wrong?

43
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:10,763
My bombs...

44
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,671
I forgot to retrieve them all when we left.

45
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,642
Ah... you're finally here...

46
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,313
So you like being fashionably late, huh?

47
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:32,424
Frenda!

48
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,061
You took off without cleaning up after yourself?

49
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,836
Where are your little buddies?

50
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:42,336
I sent them away.

51
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,242
Because I wanted to take you on personally...

52
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,643
Railgun.

53
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,738
She figured it out...

54
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:49,970
Well, that's okay...

55
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:51,840
She wants to do this one-on-one?

56
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,229
That's fine by me.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,207
Let's play, then!

58
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,338
Ah... Is that the plan?

59
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:09,802
You're using Frenda's bombs to make up for
the fact that your power has been diminished?

60
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,700
Of course, by doing so...

61
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,499
You're admitting you're too weak to defeat me on your own.

62
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,108
You realize that, don't you?

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Impressive.

64
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,008
She can deflect blast waves...

65
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:20,227
Which means...

66
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,731
Heh. Doing this again?

67
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:27,743
Wait... She could use the blast
as a diversion to get behind me...

68
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,672
Or maybe...

69
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,349
she'll ignore me entirely and just charge inside.

70
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:32,302
However...

71
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:34,233
If I can shoot it down first...

72
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:36,856
Hold on!

73
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:38,650
Did you rig the doll somehow?

74
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,366
With some metal inside, I can control them magnetically.

75
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,913
Tch... You keep getting more annoying.

76
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:50,345
If there's just one of them, I'm sure
you have no problem shooting it down.

77
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,752
Huh?

78
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:51,906
Heh.

79
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,303
But if this many dollies come out to play?

80
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:13,068
As far as I can tell, she can't lay
down a curtain of fire with her power.

81
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,960
That means there's one thing to do...

82
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,138
So this is how you plan to incapacitate me?

83
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,377
"Silicon Burn."

84
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm not afraid to shore up my
weaknesses with props if it's necessary.

85
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:40,852
You would do well to respect ITEM, you little brat!

86
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,689
That imbecile Frenda has made my job more complicated.

87
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,879
But I think I can still handle
a middle schooler, thank you...

88
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,151
Honestly...

89
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:55,168
Third-ranked, my ass.

90
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,248
Why did you earn that title?

91
00:06:57,401 --> 00:07:00,754
Because the research applications
of your ability were so profitable?

92
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,517
And here I am, ranked fourth.

93
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,451
All I have to do is slaughter you right here.

94
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,051
That ought to prove that you don't
deserve the rank you've been given.

95
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,366
The fourth-ranked Level 5?

96
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:17,627
That makes her...

97
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,670
the esper known as Meltdowner.

98
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,291
All right, then.

99
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,444
Aw, look at that.

100
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,200
Only three left.

101
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:29,959
Huh?

102
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:31,523
Hey, what's wrong?

103
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't tell me you've run out of moves already...

104
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,679
That would be so disappointing.

105
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,384
How pathetic.

106
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,760
You've been reduced to a suicide attack?

107
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,004
Please.

108
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,378
Don't tell me you couldn't even get the timing right?

109
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:54,620
What? Another?

110
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:56,923
She had one in reserve!

111
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,367
A shield! No...

112
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,110
At this range, there's not enough time...

113
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,203
Damn you!

114
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:07,013
Yeah... Nice try!

115
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,867
Did you forget that quickly?

116
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:15,641
I can deflect those electric
shocks that you rely so heavily upon.

117
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,076
You didn't actually think you had won just now, did you?

118
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:23,816
This fight was over almost as soon as it began...

119
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,366
Railgu...

120
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:31,841
Did you forget that quickly?

121
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:34,281
I told you, I rigged these things with metal.

122
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:37,084
They're lethal enough, even without exploding.

123
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,276
Is this it?

124
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,941
Surely that'll be enough to wipe it all out.

125
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,380
I would have liked to have seen every
last inch of this place burned to ashes...

126
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:27,996
but with the shape I'm in, I would've
gotten caught in the blaze, too.

127
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,714
The problem now is that other facility...

128
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,901
If there are espers as strong as
the ones I was up against here...

129
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,173
I couldn't...

130
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,088
What the...?

131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,135
How can she be gone?

132
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,981
She should still be knocked senseless at this point!

133
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,754
Hey, now... this is no time to lie down.

134
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:58,408
We've still got some unfinished business.

135
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,217
I'm gonna pay you back for this.

136
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:02,048
A trillion times over!

137
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,908
Aw, what's the matter? Your tummy hurt?

138
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,526
Just get up already.

139
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,370
Unless you want to be turned to charcoal where you lie.

140
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,700
Well, well...

141
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:19,527
aren't we a spry little thing?

142
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:22,839
Lucky for me, I haven't had
anything to eat in the last few days.

143
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:26,829
Stop running away!

144
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,808
You're not so brave now that
you've run out of bombs, are you?

145
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,025
You are a disgrace to your rank!

146
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,980
You know, I really think I can live with that.

147
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,006
I've done what I came here for...

148
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:38,379
Now I just need to get out.

149
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,617
With the electrical systems shot...

150
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,272
I've got three escape routes.

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,385
There are the emergency stairs...

152
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,173
No... not with her ability...

153
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,146
She could punch through the staircase...

154
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,338
There isn't much room to dodge her, either.

155
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,103
There's also the route to the freight entrance...

156
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,970
Except... There's only one way through...

157
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:59,941
If it's blocked in even one place, I'll be trapped.

158
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:01,587
Which leaves...

159
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,025
Oh, you really want this to end in a draw?

160
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,283
Just look at you scuttling away...

161
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,579
Watching you flee like that, you look
more like a cockroach than a spider.

162
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,209
In which case, I'll squash you
underfoot, like the vermin you are.

163
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:24,904
Yeah?

164
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,216
It's Kinuhata.

165
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,385
What's up?

166
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:30,220
I'm at the best part of the fight, so keep it short.

167
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,089
They've finished all the preparations for relocation.

168
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,410
Takitsubo and Frenda have just gotten here, too.

169
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,443
Huh?

170
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,739
So knocking the ground out from
underneath her doesn't work...

171
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,658
I'll have to take a more direct approach.

172
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:44,402
Mugino?

173
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,835
Yes... Yes... I understand.

174
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,435
Huh? You want me to tell her word-for-word?

175
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,541
Right, got it... Bye.

176
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,419
She's given us the all-clear. We can go ahead as planned.

177
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:01,302
Uh... just wondering...

178
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,042
Yes?

179
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,837
Did Mugino... you know...

180
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,711
sound like she was mad or anything?

181
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,094
What with... the bomb stuff... and all?

182
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,191
Not really...

183
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,431
I'd say she sounded more wound-up than mad.

184
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:13,678
Okay. Whew!

185
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,348
Although, there was a message she wanted me to give you.

186
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,660
Hm? What message?

187
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,200
"You may expect your punishment
to be both long and painful."

188
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,093
That's it.

189
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,254
Can I make it out this way?

190
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:50,284
Heh.

191
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,047
You just block, and block, and block... Huh?

192
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,001
You're never going to beat me by playing defense!

193
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:09,157
Do you think this kind of child's play will get
you anywhere against the underworld of Academy City?

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,492
Come on... at least make this entertaining for me.

195
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,450
You're going to die, no doubt about it.

196
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:18,621
But wouldn't you rather go out with a bang?

197
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:32,922
I get that you're desperate...

198
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:37,648
but still, choosing this place to run to,
you're practically begging to be slaughtered.

199
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,723
The third-ranked Level 5?

200
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,035
More like a wet behind the ears little girl!

201
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,299
Come on now, I'm giving you one last chance to fight back;

202
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,979
Why not try out that little Railgun you're
so famous for? This is the perfect opportunity.

203
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,217
Huh? Hey, now...

204
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:58,728
It's no fun if you go crazy before
I get the chance to torture you.

205
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:01,524
My Railgun?

206
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,598
After all of this...

207
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,714
I don't have enough power to avoid one of your blasts,

208
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,506
much less use my Railgun.

209
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:09,953
You see...

210
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,341
that's why I gambled and came this way.

211
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:12,908
Huh?

212
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,942
You know that blond pal of yours?

213
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:17,056
She really gave me a hard time.

214
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,336
Blowing me away with her bombs.

215
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:22,402
Duping me. Kicking me... And, of course...

216
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:25,223
Nearly plunging me to my death by knocking out the floor.

217
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:26,853
See?

218
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,338
That got me thinking...

219
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,747
She was very thorough, setting
up traps all over this place...

220
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,167
So, I figured, the chances were pretty good
that she rigged up some explosives in this area.

221
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,683
Even as weak as I am...

222
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:43,195
I can make enough of a spark to set this off.

223
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:47,763
Not too shabby for a wet behind the ears little girl...

224
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,176
Don't you think?

225
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,460
Frenda!

226
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,917
Here... Grab on!

227
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:10,573
No way...

228
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,486
Did she just...?

229
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,257
Hey, get down here!

230
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,466
That didn't kill her?

231
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,110
Man, she's a tough one!

232
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,799
She scampered away, huh?

233
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:33,074
My Meltdowner rays may have slowed
me up enough to keep me alive...

234
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:36,124
but that landing still leaves a lot to be desired.

235
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:38,420
Guess I'll need to fine tune that a bit.

236
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:42,186
I'll get Takitsubo to track
her down again, and this time...

237
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,664
No, think...

238
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,684
She's a student at Tokiwadai Middle School, isn't she?

239
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,343
Yes...

240
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,853
So what could she have been after here, then?

241
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:56,344
I accomplished what I came here to do...

242
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,609
One more down... but there's that last facility.

243
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,582
And my power is drained.

244
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:05,724
Damn...

245
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:08,656
Come on, hurry!

246
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,073
Almost the entire upstairs is in flames!

247
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:11,818
Huh?

248
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:13,614
But there's still more stuff to move!

249
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:14,919
Just forget about that junk!

250
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,891
Damn! I thought they hired protection!

251
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,328
We were supposed to be safe from these attacks!

252
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,634
Those underworld scum! Usele...

253
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:27,962
Hey... what the hell?

254
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:33,520
I've developed an interest in the project that
Railgun came to this facility to put a stop to.

255
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,576
Show me.

256
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,982
Uh... There's no way I can do that!

257
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,984
I can't leak that kind of information!

258
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,194
They'd have me elimina...

259
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:45,651
I can turn you into a bloody pile of
dismembered flesh right here and now.

260
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:49,798
Or you can take your chances living
life on the run from your former employers.

261
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:51,879
Which do you prefer?

262
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,679
You can't be serious!

263
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,730
This is what they've got the first-ranked Level 5 doing?

264
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:04,972
Trying to level up by exterminating
twenty thousand cockroaches?

265
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:09,232
What can the Academy City
governors' board possibly be thinking?

266
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:10,874
Huh?

267
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:15,236
Oh... so that's it, huh?

268
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,342
And then, as for those of us in ITEM...

269
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,734
This should be very interesting...

270
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,603
I think I'd like to wait and see how this drama plays out.

271
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:27,051
Why kill someone when you can watch them suffer?

272
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,128
Right?

273
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:46,126
It's morning already?

274
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:58,506
Aww.

275
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,823
I must look like a mess.

276
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,095
S Processor...

277
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:11,891
the institute for neuroscience analysis.

278
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,989
The last facility associated with the experiment.

279
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,508
Or, at least, I think it is.

280
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:22,848
This is weird...

281
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,259
There's no traffic going in or out.

282
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,424
Never mind security, there isn't a
single electrical device at work here.

283
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,132
A trap?

284
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,199
It's totally deserted, all right...

285
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:50,988
And it's not only that...

286
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,229
all of the data has been erased.

287
00:18:58,825 --> 00:18:59,806
Have they given up?

288
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,859
Could yesterday's battle have
been enough to dissuade them?

289
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,494
I don't know.

290
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,856
Maybe they can't sustain the
project with just one location...

291
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,276
That could be it.

292
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,692
I fought them...

293
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,393
and eventually, they backed down.

294
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:19,555
Does that mean...

295
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,123
It's over?

296
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:23,888
Can it be?

297
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,565
That seems too good to be true, somehow...

298
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:28,825
I guess that's not surprising,

299
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,181
given all the crazy things that have been happening.

300
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,013
That's all there is...

301
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,680
Farewell, Big Sister.

302
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,409
Ah, I understand now!

303
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:00,498
I was wondering what this was
since it wasn't on the schedule.

304
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,588
You...

305
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,043
You're the Original.

306
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,149
Hello there, I'm Accelerator.

307
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,421
It's a pleasure.

308
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:12,916
Why?

309
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:16,560
You're breathing, aren't you? You have life, don't you?

310
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:18,112
Isn't that enough?

311
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,424
What, not who...

312
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,247
Misaka is a product created for this project...

313
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,837
Artificial bodies... with artificial minds...

314
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:32,207
Laboratory animals, with a unit price
of one hundred and eighty thousand.

315
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,142
It's not like I'll be able to pretend
that none of this ever happened...

316
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,059
There's still a lot for me to do.

317
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,053
A lot of things to set straight...

318
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,403
but...

319
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,369
The experiments... are over.

320
00:20:58,797 --> 00:20:59,872
And as for them...

321
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,874
The sisters...

322
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:20,670
they... they can finally live.

323
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,633
No matter what, we're all here for you...

324
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,512
If your burden is ever too heavy, just say the word, okay?

325
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:33,691
Well, guys...

326
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:35,630
I'm coming home now.

327
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,373
Come on!

328
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:49,106
What is with this thing?

329
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,918
I gave it plenty of money.

330
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,794
I don't understand!

331
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,357
Is it out of order?

332
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:57,442
Heh.

333
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:00,469
Seriously?

334
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:33,636
Oh, you again, Zapper?

335
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:35,790
Wait a minute, there are two of you. Is that your sister?

336
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,613
Ah, well, together we shall
embark upon a grand adventure...

337
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:38,492
No, we won't!

338
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,888
And why are you even doing the preview, anyway?
