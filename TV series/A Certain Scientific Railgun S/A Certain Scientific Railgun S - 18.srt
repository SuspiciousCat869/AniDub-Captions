1
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:08,358
So, all told.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,592
What was our assignment this time, anyway?

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:11,706
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,185
That's an ultra-good question.

5
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,212
Well, we were supposed to come down
here and put a stop to an arms deal.

6
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:21,329
Of course, we get here, and there's no arms deal in sight

7
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:24,609
and instead, one of these toys starts attacking us.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,416
You look funny. What's the deal?

9
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,291
I dunno. I have this feeling.

10
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:35,884
Mugino!

11
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,608
Thank you for that.

12
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,611
Ultra happy to be of service.

13
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:48,056
Geez, don't startle me like that, okay?

14
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,858
Thank you, Mugin...

15
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:52,639
Tch.

16
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,787
I'd say those are adequate
enough results for a field test.

17
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,614
We are steadily gathering data for the real thing.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,358
Aritomi.

19
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:00,798
Huh?

20
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:12,817
Oh, man. I've got a tummy ache!

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,083
That was an exotic stew. I've never eaten turtle before.

22
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,705
The beef Misaka brought was amazing, too.

23
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:21,683
And because of that, I am now way too full!

24
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:24,085
Maybe we should find some medicine for you.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,303
Oh, by the way.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,536
Did that talk you had with your teacher go all right?

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,439
Yeah. It did. I think we found the perfect spot.

28
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:38,003
You did, huh?

29
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:40,037
Then it's almost time.

30
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:41,818
Mm.

31
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:16,393
So?

32
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:18,211
Who's that you were talking to?

33
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:18,760
Hm?

34
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:20,663
That fine young man back there.

35
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,209
Oh, just somebody I know.

36
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,692
So evasive!

37
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,988
Ooh! It was cookie boy, wasn't it?

38
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:27,530
No, it wasn't!

39
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:29,833
I swear, that's the last time I bake anything!

40
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,197
Okay, fine,

41
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,983
if that wasn't him, who is the cookie guy?

42
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,526
I... I'm telling you he...

43
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:35,522
Hello, Sissy.

44
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,333
You're getting here late. What have you been up to?

45
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,358
Ooh, I'll tell you.

46
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:41,567
Ah! Hey, look, the elevator's here!

47
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:44,769
Come on, come on, let's go! Quickly now, everybody! Heh.

48
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,740
There she goes! So adorable!

49
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,400
Congratulations, Edasaki.

50
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,223
Huh?

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,103
We hear you're being discharged. Right?

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,669
Heh, yeah I am! I owe it all to you guys.

53
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:03,161
Having that uniform waiting
for me really inspired me to work

54
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,297
hard and finish my rehabilitation before summer was over!

55
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,588
So, is everything set for when you get out of here?

56
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:13,383
Mm-Hmm.

57
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:16,729
Actually, Edasaki is going to be living with Haru'ue.

58
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,477
Oh. Really?

59
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:19,559
Yep.

60
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,770
Well, you know. I've been in a home for so long.

61
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,208
Suddenly living on her own would be really hard.

62
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,732
I talked to my teachers about the situation,

63
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,801
and they agreed that Banri and I could share a place.

64
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,599
Oh, that's nice.

65
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,424
So then, you'll be moving again, huh?

66
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,833
We'd be happy to come by and help you guys out.

67
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,527
That's okay, thanks though.

68
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,231
Uiharu and I already took care of it.

69
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:45,150
Seriously?

70
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:45,651
Yep.

71
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,707
We made a few calls and got
the movers lined up for tomorrow.

72
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,242
Well, that was quick.

73
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,148
You could have at least asked us.

74
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:57,733
Haru'ue said there's still some stuff
she and Edasaki needed to talk about.

75
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:58,735
Oh, okay.

76
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:03,351
Really, Uiharu, if you'd just said something,
we totally would have helped out on moving day.

77
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:04,530
Don't worry about it.

78
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,483
It's honestly not that big a deal.

79
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:10,279
Though the whole place is overflowing
with cardboard boxes right now.

80
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,755
Yeah, I can imagine.

81
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,864
I remember what it was like when
Haru'ue first moved in with you.

82
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,126
There's even more now than there was then.

83
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,767
Which is strange since she didn't
actually live there for that long.

84
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:23,883
Oh, I forgot!

85
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:24,588
Huh?

86
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:26,317
We have to go.

87
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,251
It's about time, isn't it, Shirai?

88
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:30,667
Oh. Yeah, you're right. It is.

89
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,225
What? You guys have some kinda' Judgment work to do?

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,514
Yeah. We've been asked to do security
for the upcoming Academic Reach Assembly.

91
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,500
Today's the preliminary inspection.

92
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,500
Oh.

93
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,317
Sorry.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,908
Hm?

95
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:45,356
I don't really understand what a
school assembly would need security for.

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,827
Uh?

97
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,743
Oh! I can see why you were confused.

98
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,354
Shirai wasn't using its full name,

99
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,608
the Academy City Research Forum Assembly.

100
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,775
It's called "Academic Reach" for short.

101
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,380
Academy City's students are
dedicated to research and study.

102
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:04,774
Those with outstanding grades are given a setting
in which they can share their work with others.

103
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:08,292
That's what the Academy City Research Forum Assembly is.

104
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:12,356
Qualification for the forum is based on
the strength of students' academic work,

105
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,697
rather than the strength of their abilities.

106
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:15,895
Oh, I see.

107
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,525
Well, that sounds kinda fun.

108
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,583
It's like a festival for smart people.

109
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,935
Maybe not quite as fun as a festival.

110
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:26,858
There are professional quality presentations,
great lectures, and all sorts of other stuff.

111
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:27,622
Yeah?

112
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,324
I don't really get it, but I guess it sounds cool.

113
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,900
I wonder why they picked this
year to start doing this thing.

114
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:33,691
Eh...

115
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:34,804
Uh, Saten.

116
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,402
They actually do it every year.

117
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,800
Seriously?

118
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:39,867
Wow!

119
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:41,661
You mean you're really going to help us?

120
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,396
It's a request from a member of the swim club.

121
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:45,998
But since you're not in the
club, you certainly don't have to...

122
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,778
Oh, nonsense. Don't be silly.

123
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:51,846
Club member or not, you two are my
friends, so I would be happy to assist you.

124
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:55,358
Besides, I'm still relatively new to the area, you know.

125
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:58,425
So I've never seen an Academic Reach Assembly before.

126
00:06:58,592 --> 00:06:59,967
This would be a perfect opportu...

127
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:02,050
Kongo! Are you all right?

128
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,583
You ruffian!

129
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,583
You dare to assault Mitsuko Kongo?

130
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,100
Somebody, please help!

131
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:08,872
That man took my bag!

132
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:19,458
It is the height of stupidity
to perpetrate such a brazen theft

133
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,576
in broad daylight on a busy street!

134
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,722
You're a moron and a criminal.

135
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,377
And I will not allow you to roam the streets any longer.

136
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,567
You're done.

137
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,808
Mitsuko Kongo has spoken!

138
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,333
Kongo always comes through.

139
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,971
She is so amazing!

140
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,167
Now to dispose of him.

141
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:39,442
Wannai, there is an Antiskill
station just around the corner.

142
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,089
Would you please alert them?

143
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:42,400
Yes, right away!

144
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,618
A good day's work.

145
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,817
Excuse me.

146
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,049
Do you have a moment?

147
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,150
I saw this little scene play out.

148
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,083
Don't you think you went a bit too far?

149
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:53,761
What?

150
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,692
It doesn't matter whether this man
is a purse-snatching miscreant or not.

151
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,921
I don't think you should be
using your ability so recklessly.

152
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,150
Oh? And who are you to say...

153
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,922
There were a number of ways
that you could have handled this.

154
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,768
And any one of them would have been better.

155
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,333
Like you told those other girls.

156
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:11,939
There's an Antiskill booth not far away from here,

157
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,400
and don't forget the security cameras.

158
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:15,455
What exactly are you...

159
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,929
If I may continue.

160
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,150
Did you not even stop for a moment to think

161
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,768
how much danger you were exposing everybody here to?

162
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,125
Huh?

163
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,849
You didn't notice this, did you?

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,733
Fortunately for us, you were able to
incapacitate him with one shot this time.

165
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:34,177
Can you begin to imagine the
results if you had failed to do so?

166
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,358
The thief would have been furious.

167
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:39,311
He may even have taken a woman or child hostage.

168
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,400
Ya' know, he's right about that!

169
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:41,900
That would've been awful.

170
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:42,853
Those abilities aren't foolproof.

171
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,110
You seem to be quite confident of yourself and your power.

172
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,358
But an ability isn't always the answer.

173
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,353
I didn't mean to.

174
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,283
Hold on a minute!

175
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,750
I don't know who you are or why you're here.

176
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,162
But there's no reason to be so hard on her.

177
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,573
Whether you approve or not, the fact
remains that she did safely secure the criminal.

178
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,113
Ladies, you're back.

179
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,266
I'm really sorry we took so long.

180
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:08,358
The Antiskill officers are on their way down here now.

181
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,327
Oh. That's good, thank you.

182
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,400
He's gone.

183
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,570
I wonder where he could've run off to.

184
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,228
What a strange man.

185
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,272
Hey Sissy, I'm home.

186
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,082
Hey.

187
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:21,525
You were gone for a while.

188
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,841
Ugh...

189
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,700
What's up? You seem exhausted.

190
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,540
The preliminary Reach inspection.

191
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,650
I knew the forum was being held across
several different universities, but still.

192
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:36,172
I didn't expect to have to walk that much.

193
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,958
I think my feet might fall off.

194
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,858
Judgment's a pretty tough gig, huh?

195
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,275
Mm-hmm.

196
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,933
Uiharu was with you, right?

197
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,276
How is she doing?

198
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,708
The same as she always is.

199
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,028
She carried out her duties admirably.

200
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,647
That's good.

201
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:53,483
With the move and everything.

202
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,400
Moving can be hard, you know.

203
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:59,719
I mean, remember how big of a mess
it was when you first moved in here?

204
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,817
Are you really bringing up that whole thing again?

205
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:04,956
The statute of limitations.

206
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,429
What's up, Sissy?

207
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,750
Thinking about old times.

208
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,076
Pretty crazy, huh?

209
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:15,585
Ah! Well... yeah.

210
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,114
Hmm... I know!

211
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,942
Since you're so exhausted, I could give you a massage.

212
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,729
I could give you a massage.

213
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:26,487
I could give you a massage. I could give you a massage.

214
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:29,259
Kuroko?

215
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,293
Whoa! What the...

216
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,042
Well, I just.

217
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,854
I thought I would take a shower first.

218
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:37,887
Right.

219
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:48,228
Ui-ha-ru!

220
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:53,165
C'mon, Saten, is that absolutely necessary?

221
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,715
'Kay, I'm sorry.

222
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,822
Were you waiting for me or something?

223
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,989
What? Oh, no.

224
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,913
I was just in the area, so.

225
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,661
I really am fine. I promise.

226
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:09,620
Haru'ue and I have been discussing
the situation for a while now.

227
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,576
And we both agreed that when
Edasaki got out of the hospital,

228
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,047
it would be best if the two of them lived together.

229
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,207
Aw, really?

230
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,333
Really. Of course, I'd be lying if I said

231
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,047
I wasn't going to miss Haru'ue.

232
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,977
Still. I think this is good.

233
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:26,314
They're close.

234
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,561
And they've been through so much together.

235
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:33,416
Besides, it's not like she's moving far away or anything.

236
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:38,072
And once the new term starts, we'll
still see each other at school every day.

237
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,488
Oh, yeah. You will, huh?

238
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,574
Good, then I guess I can stop worrying about you so much.

239
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,605
Yeah. Now please let go of my hair!

240
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:51,935
You're gonna be all right.

241
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,424
Yes.

242
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,794
Well, here I am!

243
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,051
So, how is it?

244
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:05,983
Perfect! It's totally cute!

245
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,935
It looks fantastic on you!

246
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,525
Aw, thank you!

247
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:12,025
Oh! So before, when you guys stayed behind

248
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,692
at the hospital to talk, this
is what you were talking about.

249
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,396
Mm-Hmm.

250
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,922
I couldn't wait to...

251
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,522
Go on, Sissy, you're up.

252
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:20,381
Oh, right. Here goes!

253
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,189
For you, Edasaki. To say "congratulations."

254
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:24,923
Congratulations!

255
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,292
Thanks so much!

256
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:28,233
So, are we ready to get going?

257
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,554
Huh? Where to?

258
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,661
A little celebration for you!

259
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,868
The place we reserved a table at has amazing cakes!

260
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,061
We get cake! That would be wonderful!

261
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,895
Hello, yes, this is Shirai.

262
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:40,801
Oh, hi Konori.

263
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,442
Eh? Traffic signal trouble?

264
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:46,417
Huh? Hey don't give me that look!

265
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:47,429
I didn't do it!

266
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:51,315
The signals in this area are down across the board.

267
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,841
I'm sorry to ask, but I need you now.

268
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:55,640
Yes. Right.

269
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,400
On my way as we speak.

270
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,839
Um. Uiharu's needed, too?

271
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:00,983
Of course I...

272
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,746
No. You can't go.

273
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,520
Edasaki is just getting released from the hospital.

274
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,067
I can cover this. You stay here-

275
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,483
What are you talking about?

276
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,532
I am a member of Judgment.

277
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:12,679
Please, start without us.

278
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,375
We'll be there as soon as we're done with this.

279
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,698
We'll see you later, then.

280
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:18,977
Good luck with those stoplights.

281
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:19,733
Thanks.

282
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,408
C'mon, let's go, Shirai.

283
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,197
Huh? Oh, right. Well, then.

284
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,906
They're gone!

285
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,162
Okay. We should get going, too.

286
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:35,676
It's not exactly how we planned it, but once again.

287
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,290
Congratulations, Edasaki!

288
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,836
Thank you so much!

289
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,583
That's delicious!

290
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:45,345
Isn't it?

291
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:47,487
Uiharu said if we were celebrating,

292
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,125
it absolutely had to be here,

293
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,108
and she handled everything
from the reservations to the cake!

294
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,006
Uiharu really is something else, isn't she?

295
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:55,506
Huh?

296
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:57,167
Before I was discharged,

297
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,567
she came to help me get moved and
take care of my school admission.

298
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,483
Didn't she?

299
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,141
Hm.

300
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,141
Yeah? That was nice of her.

301
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,374
Very nice!

302
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,313
I wonder if all Judgment officers are kind like her.

303
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,683
I'm glad we let Uiharu pick this place.

304
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,691
It's like she knew how much you would enjoy it.

305
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:13,779
I know, right?

306
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,563
This might be the best cake I've ever had!

307
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,918
Is that the key to your new place?

308
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:31,936
Mm-Hm.

309
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:34,549
Uiharu has been pretty helpful with all this, huh?

310
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:38,351
She was like this when it was my turn, too.

311
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,906
You mean, when the two of you were moving in together?

312
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:44,678
Yeah, that sounds like her.
Always the enthusiastic helper.

313
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,408
I was so nervous then, but Uiharu was there for me.

314
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,015
So now, it's my turn to help somebody else who needs it.

315
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,257
I'll be there to help Banri however I can,

316
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,807
just like Uiharu was there for me.

317
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,198
Of course.

318
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,804
Well, I just hope she gets here soon.

319
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,525
I'm sure she's giving it her all at work,

320
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:11,858
even as we speak.

321
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:16,266
Yeah, wearing an ugly helmet and
directing traffic or something, probably.

322
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,310
She could stand to ease up at a time like this, though.

323
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,590
But not being able to is what makes her, her.

324
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:23,735
You're right.

325
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,978
Maybe I should become a member of Judgment.

326
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:29,113
Huh?

327
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,250
Where'd that idea come from?

328
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:32,395
It's just a thought.

329
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,009
If I did join, maybe I would be more like Uiharu.

330
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:36,668
Heh.

331
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,695
You know, Edasaki.

332
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,358
I don't actually think that she was being nice to you

333
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,559
just because she's a member of Judgment.

334
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,497
Really? Then why?

335
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,743
Because she's your friend. Silly.

336
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,362
Yeah, you're right.

337
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,775
Ah, free from the hospital!

338
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:58,260
Huh?

339
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,450
Oh, nothing.

340
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,875
I know somebody else who was in there recently.

341
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,608
I was just wondering what it would've been like

342
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,358
for us to celebrate together like this when they got out.

343
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:06,975
You know?

344
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,310
Uhh...

345
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:12,583
Oh, sorry! Now I'm being silly.

346
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,887
Please forget I said anything! Really!

347
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:17,292
Well, whoever your friend is,

348
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,185
I hope they're feeling a lot better.

349
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,133
Yeah. So do I.

350
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,413
Good work today.

351
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,667
Sorry I had to call you out of the blue like that.

352
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,275
Stoplight trouble, of all things.

353
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:30,733
I was kinda' surprised.

354
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,317
There was some irregularity in the electrical system.

355
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,942
But in Academy City?

356
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,802
It's unusual for things like
that to happen here, you know.

357
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,413
There you are!

358
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,442
Oh, Uiharu, that's right.

359
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,497
Well, if we're all done here, we'll have to be...

360
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,161
Geez, what's gotten into you?

361
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,483
Hurry, there's some place I need you to take me!

362
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,567
Yes. Calm down, I know. Let's head ba...

363
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,712
No, not there!

364
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,136
I want you to take us somewhere else before that.

365
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:55,525
Huh?

366
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:57,655
Umm...

367
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:00,546
What do you think? Should we call them?

368
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,564
That might be a good idea.

369
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:07,346
Uh... Yeah. I'm calling them right now.

370
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,904
Hey, sorry to... keep you waiting.

371
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:11,772
Uh, me too.

372
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,535
Well, at least you made it!

373
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,502
Geez, it took you long enough.

374
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,858
Edasaki had to stop by the hospital, so she already left.

375
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:23,644
Oh! Really? She did? Shoot! I'm so sorry!

376
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,150
Don't worry about it.

377
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,233
She wanted me to tell you thanks.

378
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,388
She had fun.

379
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,201
Um, here.

380
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,245
These are for you and Edasaki to share.

381
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:34,999
Huh?

382
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,233
Are those little cakes?

383
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,817
Oh, the thing is, Uiharu.

384
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,567
We actually already had cake while you were gone.

385
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,358
Well. Yes, I know that, but...

386
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,291
Having cake after cake is sorta...

387
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,959
No, you don't understa...

388
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,025
See, it's like I was trying to tell you.

389
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,150
Hey, now. It's really the thought that coun...

390
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,384
Listen, you guys-

391
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:56,926
They look just like they did before!

392
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,103
Huh?

393
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:04,604
You see, these are the same little cakes Uiharu
bought me once when I was nervous to make me feel better.

394
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,661
They were so delicious.

395
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,822
What's the matter, Haru'ue?

396
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,507
I'm hopeless!

397
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,073
I promised myself I wouldn't cry today!

398
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:16,288
Um, well.

399
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:17,718
Uiharu.

400
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:22,081
I want to be like you. So kind and considerate.

401
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,973
I want to help Banri like you helped me.

402
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,567
It'll be all right. You'll do fine, Haru'ue.

403
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,751
I know it. You can do this.

404
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:35,431
Thank you so much!

405
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,514
Now, now, calm down.

406
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,429
It's okay.

407
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:45,494
There's no reason to cry.

408
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:46,837
I mean...

409
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,442
And now there bawling like little babies.

410
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:53,822
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

411
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:55,315
It's so sweet.

412
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:09,848
Hey, you know.

413
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,487
I wonder how much of a help I actually was to Haru'ue.

414
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:16,733
Oh, don't be silly.

415
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,108
I think it's obvious that you were a big help.

416
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,062
Ow!

417
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,962
And not just to Haru'ue, either.

418
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:24,178
Edasaki, too.

419
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,879
I think you made a real difference in both their lives.

420
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,731
Thanks, Misaka.

421
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:30,875
Yeah, and you know, Sissy,

422
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,434
you make a real difference in my li... Ahh!

423
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,150
Well, let's head home!

424
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,525
Oh, I forgot.

425
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,400
I know of a shortcut up ahead.

426
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,602
Um, are you sure this is the right way?

427
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,942
Don't worry, okay? We just cut through here,

428
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,775
and we'll be on the main road in no time.

429
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:49,086
How many of these shortcuts do you know about?

430
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:52,463
What is it? Is something wrong, Sissy?

431
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,150
What is that down there?

432
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:55,672
Huh?

433
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,903
Hey, that looks like...

434
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,334
a little girl?

435
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:00,636
Huh?

436
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:02,369
Wow!

437
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,601
She's adorable!

438
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,650
Don't just stand there staring at her!

439
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,335
Hey, hold up, Kuroko!

440
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,640
She's opening her eyes.

441
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:19,995
Hi, sleepy head.

442
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,501
Why were you taking a nap in the park?

443
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,005
If you tell us your name, maybe we can help you.

444
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,266
Okay. Well, how old are you?

445
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,499
Can you tell us where you live?

446
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,802
Your school?

447
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,063
Your homeroom teacher's name, maybe?

448
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,669
This doesn't seem to be working.

449
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,924
Maybe she speaks a different language?

450
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,338
You guys are doing it wrong. Let me try.

451
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,689
When you're trying to talk to a little girl,

452
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,108
you need to get down to her eye level, like this.

453
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,632
Oh! That looks like some tasty candy!

454
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,547
Let's make a trade, okay?

455
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,369
My name is Ruiko. Now it's your turn.

456
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,173
Do you think you can tell me your name?

457
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,575
I'm Febri.

458
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,672
Aww...

459
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,942
That's a very pretty name!

460
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,692
Okay, then, Febri. What else can you tell us?

461
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,726
Anything goes. You can just pick something.

462
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,964
Mikoto Misaka.

463
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,566
Huh?

464
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:26,584
Huh? What?

465
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:00,773
The experiment was successful.

466
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,483
It was conducted to obtain data

467
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,275
regarding the fourth-ranked Level 5,

468
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:06,519
and the numbers came out more or less as predicted.

469
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,235
We ran into some unexpected complications on site,

470
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,940
but those ought to be resolved before much longer.

471
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,139
Everything is ready now.

472
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,858
The time has come to demonstrate our power.

473
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:21,266
We'll show this town of esper supremacists what we can do.

474
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:24,537
Those in favor of moving to the next phase of the project,

475
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,285
please raise your hands.

476
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,108
I want to know what the story is with this Febri girl.

477
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,473
Why does she know my name?

478
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,548
Maybe she's lost.

479
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:36,317
What should we do?

480
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,490
We will decide at the Academic Reach Assembly.

481
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:39,658
The Reach Assembly?
