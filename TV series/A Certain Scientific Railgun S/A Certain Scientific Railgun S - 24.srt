1
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:08,309
Excellent.

2
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:10,340
It looks adorable on you.

3
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:15,774
Very soon, you'll be going outside on your own.

4
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:17,496
Shinobu?

5
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:18,291
Remember...

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,794
every once in awhile, suck on one of these.

7
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:25,410
And now there's... one last thing.

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,312
Mikoto Misaka.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,774
Don't forget that name, all right?

10
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,768
Mikoto Mi...

11
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:38,549
That decision was it...

12
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,773
The beginning of everything.

13
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,838
What happens now?

14
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,913
Have I finally done something to help...

15
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,106
instead of causing more harm?

16
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:51,221
Honestly.

17
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:53,280
She is nothing but trouble.

18
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:05,245
Hmph.

19
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:08,366
We have some uninvited party guests, do we?

20
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,939
Poor things...

21
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:12,457
facing down twenty thousand powered suits...

22
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,860
I think we can handle one or two gawky teenagers.

23
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:16,724
Sorry to keep you waiting... Hi.

24
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,963
Heh. You know, you're late.

25
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:20,801
Hey, guys!

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,351
Wha... Who are these people?!

27
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,126
You've disrupted the peace of Academy City.

28
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,843
You've hurt our friend. An innocent little girl!

29
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:32,440
This shield is a symbol of duty.

30
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,626
And that duty... is to stop you!

31
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,684
You may have Antiskill under your control...

32
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:41,027
But they're not the only law in this town.

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,586
I think today we'll do this Shirai style.

34
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:44,269
Huh?

35
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,488
Judgment is on the scene!

36
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,553
That's right!

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,319
Mikoto?

38
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,026
Oh, uh... it's nothing.

39
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:58,935
Okay, guys... I'm counting on you.

40
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,569
By all means, come and get it...

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,756
I am Kuroko Shirai, Sissy's right-hand gal...

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,576
And by my pledge...

43
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:21,587
None of you shall set foot past me!

44
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,447
You're up!

45
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,694
Tank squads E and F, come to the left flank!

46
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:30,516
Squads J through M, switch off! Let's go!

47
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:32,940
Careful now!

48
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,648
Don't forget our main objective!

49
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,992
To prevent these things from leaving the premises!

50
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,137
We're buying time!

51
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,330
Misaka is sure to come up with something!

52
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,319
I, for one, am glad... that
these machines are running with

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,673
simple, easily-controlled programming.

54
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,420
First, you have to select a target.

55
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,632
Then it's all just a matter of maintaining aggro!

56
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:56,612
Whoa!

57
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,299
Awesome!

58
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,111
A water current and buoyancy control combo!

59
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,320
Hi, Kongo!

60
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,527
Those are my friends.

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,404
Don't you even think about harming them.

62
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,502
I simply won't allow it!

63
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,235
You're not gonna get by me!

64
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,874
Me, either! We're doing this for Febri...

65
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,980
and also... Because a good friend asked us to!

66
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,282
This is for Misaka!

67
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,447
Take that, robot!

68
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,704
I'm kicking it up a notch today!

69
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:29,538
Shirai!

70
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,145
Because today...

71
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,695
I don't just fight for Judgment.

72
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,325
I fight for Sissy!

73
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:40,900
They're better than I had expected.

74
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,627
Yeah, well... Our attrition rate is
still running at less than two percent.

75
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:47,281
I want to know where Railgun is.

76
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:51,152
Once you do find her... let Kosako and Madarame loose.

77
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,150
Nunotaba!

78
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,416
I'm increasing Janie's operating ratio.

79
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:55,908
Keep everything regulated!

80
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,570
Why did I do that?

81
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,116
Of all names, why did I give Febri that particular one?

82
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:04,531
Is it because I believed in her?

83
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,309
Yes...

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,822
Maybe that's it... I just hope... I'm right.

85
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:12,784
What's that?!

86
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:13,998
We have an intruder!

87
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:14,991
Is that...

88
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,706
Railgun?!

89
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,351
But... how did she find this place?

90
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:24,113
Damn that girl.

91
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:27,221
Hello, Railgun.

92
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,086
Excuse the mess.

93
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:31,444
I didn't expect company,

94
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,013
but I guess you negotiated your own invitation.

95
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,298
Shinobu? Shinobu!

96
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,835
And now that you're here, I'm afraid you leave us

97
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,846
little choice. Please enjoy our hospitality.

98
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,498
Just hold on a little longer...

99
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,398
We'll see her soon enough.

100
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,784
All you espers have one common weakness...

101
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,700
You're only human, which means you will eventually tire.

102
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,442
And you are no exception to this rule.

103
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,419
I don't care what level esper you are...

104
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,985
When you're this outnumbered...

105
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,607
you don't stand a chance.

106
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,956
Yeah, you're right.

107
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,247
If I was all on my own, this would be difficult.

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,582
However...

109
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,424
Things are different this time.

110
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,517
All of us...

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,622
are fighting against you together!

112
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:03,276
Incredible...

113
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:05,992
We have planned for this situation...

114
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,184
Activate scenario B-7...

115
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,392
Send Kosako and Madrame, now!

116
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,469
Squads A and B, hang in a little longer...

117
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,485
Espers, attack!

118
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,425
Go once again from the left flank...

119
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,378
Hah!

120
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:21,444
Okay. Who's next?

121
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:22,527
What do we do, you guys?

122
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,295
We can't get through to the others!

123
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,313
There's no signal!

124
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:27,782
I expected this.

125
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:29,294
I don't know what to do!

126
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,494
The commands to my security robots aren't...

127
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,152
Yeah, seriously...

128
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:34,314
What now?

129
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,567
It's time you learned a lesson.

130
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,460
Intellectual prowess cannot be neglected...

131
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:43,236
or we will all become helpless
sheep in thrall to the espers.

132
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,217
It would have been a lot more satisfying

133
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,027
to have gone up against Railgun...

134
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:47,766
Well...

135
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,975
what are you gonna do?!

136
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,416
You seem to be getting worn out, Railgun.

137
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:28,605
Unfortunately for you, this party is just getting started.

138
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:36,000
These models are equipped with weapons made
after analyzing the city's fourth-ranked esper.

139
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:40,028
I guess you could call it our version of Meltdowner.

140
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,593
Enjoy your first-hand look.

141
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,040
Uiharu?!

142
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,059
No, I'll be all right...

143
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,156
Please, don't worry a...

144
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,227
Behind you!

145
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:58,761
Sorry we're late.

146
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,162
Your friend suggested that I bring this along.

147
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,035
What is it?

148
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,458
Let us take care of contacting

149
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:06,777
the other sites, okay?

150
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,921
It's Haru'ue!

151
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,629
That's right... and Banri is helping out, too...

152
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:13,138
We're making a network of telepaths.

153
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,846
I thought something like this might happen...

154
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,902
Thank you for this.

155
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:18,015
Please, it's no problem!

156
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:21,645
Being able to help Judgment out
is like a dream come true for me!

157
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:25,239
"Always be prepared and you will never be surprised."

158
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,103
Philosophy in action.

159
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,883
Isn't there a manual for this?

160
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,610
Yeah, don't worry. It's in my head.

161
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,335
Well, mostly.

162
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,034
Okay then, here goes.

163
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,682
Allow me to introduce the variable-form, large-scale,

164
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,585
all-purpose machine built with the latest technology

165
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,540
from Kongo Airlines' Metalworks Plant Number 2.

166
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,110
What is that thing?!

167
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:52,766
What do you think of her?

168
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:56,198
Ecaterina the Second! New and improved!

169
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,415
That's what she calls it!

170
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,824
Whoa! Nice choice, Uiharu.

171
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:03,451
You're fired up today, huh?

172
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,527
Okay! Let's see if we can do them justice!

173
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,380
It's so fast!

174
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:13,128
Ready, and... Knockout punch!!

175
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,273
Saten, be carefuulll!

176
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,180
Fire!

177
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:23,926
Oh, please!

178
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,912
That's nothing like the real Meltdowner.

179
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,521
Damn! Damn every last esper!

180
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:34,517
This is a day of revolution!

181
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,426
I'm taking over control now, Saten.

182
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,034
Okay!

183
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,470
You hate espers? Well, I'm actually a Level Zeeerooo!

184
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,039
Are you serious?

185
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,781
That was a poor, pathetic imitation.

186
00:09:57,915 --> 00:09:58,995
Oh, quit it.

187
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,252
I'm damn sick of these pieces of junk.

188
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,627
Whoa! Just like our Intel said!

189
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,771
It really is copying Mugino...

190
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,701
That's just plain asking for it.

191
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,110
This is an ultra huge number of powered suits...

192
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,574
What do you think is going on?

193
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,076
Who knows?

194
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:21,304
So this is what's behind all those
fool's errands we've been sent on lately.

195
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:22,764
Damn it...

196
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,719
You bastards were using us
this whole time to collect data?!

197
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:28,142
Screw you!

198
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,194
Whoo-hoo!

199
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,570
Ultra-pretty fire.

200
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,762
Hey, Mugino... Over there I sensed...

201
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:35,317
Hmph!

202
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:40,233
We don't have time to waste on a spoiled
little brat who doesn't want to learn her lesson.

203
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,433
Hey... Those people earlier...

204
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,360
Oh, those guys...

205
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:49,253
It's best to forget about them... okay?

206
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:51,480
We need to hurry!

207
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,263
Madarame! Kosako! Do you copy?

208
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,001
Not getting anything from above, either.

209
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,052
It's not over!

210
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,669
It isn't over!

211
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,056
We have not been defeated!

212
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,402
See, that's where you're wrong.

213
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:07,216
You!

214
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,522
I suggest you put an end to this...

215
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,579
and let Janie go this instant.

216
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:13,610
Shinobu!

217
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:14,759
Hi, Febri...

218
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,641
Well, I came. Like I promised.

219
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,373
This disgusts me...

220
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,873
Espers reveling in their triumph!

221
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:24,569
Aritomi! What are you?

222
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,235
Code input confirmed.

223
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,208
Initiating final phase.

224
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:30,694
Janie!

225
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,229
Huh?

226
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,795
They stopped the attack?

227
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,176
Sissy...

228
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,044
N-N-N-N-N-No! Don't, Aritomi!

229
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,999
You can't be serious about this!

230
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,591
You're setting the system to a runaway state?

231
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,621
If I force the connection to break,

232
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:47,600
she will die.

233
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:49,985
This is the final phase...

234
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,630
also known as the last possible resort.

235
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,799
I'm going to turn Academy City into ashes.

236
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:00,347
Oh, yeah? And what exactly are your plans?

237
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,425
Seriously now...

238
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,166
you really think I would tell you?

239
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,183
What are you doing?

240
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:09,127
There's not much time left... I hope you're ready.

241
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,902
It-... it's time to die...

242
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:13,194
Oh, no!

243
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,352
I can't... It's no use...

244
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,466
What am I going to do? It's over!

245
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,544
You want to take the easy way out?

246
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,335
I'm not gonna let that happen.

247
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,910
You know, there was somebody I met once...

248
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:49,747
He had all the power he could ever
need, but still he reached out for more.

249
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,282
I also know someone who was a lot like you...

250
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,497
ashamed of her lack of ability.

251
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:59,940
She was willing to do cruel things...
to make up for her perceived inadequacies.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,187
And then there's this group of girls I know...

253
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,277
They thought of themselves as tools.

254
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,147
And quietly accepted an inhumane fate.

255
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,896
And let's not forget the biggest fool...

256
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,105
The reckless, stubborn girl...

257
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,474
who thought she could make everything
better by throwing her life away.

258
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:22,028
Now here I am... I finally figured it out...

259
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,950
Life isn't about being strong on your own all the time...

260
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,860
See, I made a promise to my friends...

261
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,152
That no matter what, I'd help Febri.

262
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,831
And protect the city.

263
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:36,780
I'll keep that promise. Even if it means saving you.

264
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,319
So that's it.

265
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:43,454
Now... what do we do to abort...

266
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,652
This is why...

267
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:48,356
Answer me! I knew I could... believe in you.

268
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,398
I... I don't think...

269
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:54,029
It's too late now...!

270
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,150
The final phase can't be stopped!

271
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,266
The plan involves scattering

272
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,235
five thousand filaments in the skies over Academy City

273
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:04,494
and then running the Diffusion
Ghost ability out of control,

274
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:07,598
triggering a decay chain in the AIM diffusion fields

275
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:08,680
that fill the area!

276
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:13,535
The launch mechanism is in some
construction equipment in stationary orbit

277
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,425
thirty-five thousand kilometers up.

278
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:17,912
The missile has already been launched.

279
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:22,105
Every second, it travels seven kilometers closer to us...

280
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,544
So... It cannot be stopped... Not by anyone...

281
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,120
Certainly not by you!

282
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,814
You're right... I doubt I can stop it.

283
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,913
Not all by myself.

284
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:37,471
A missile?!

285
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,028
How can we help?

286
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,419
Give me its specifications...

287
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:41,485
It's Ruiko!

288
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,801
Shinobu, this is Ruiko...

289
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,065
Just a sec, okay?

290
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:46,120
Judgment has its share of science students.

291
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:47,229
I'll ask around.

292
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:48,242
Yeah, do that!

293
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:49,527
I will help out, as well.

294
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,367
Hey... Febri is looking flushed.

295
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,148
Huh? Show me your lollipop!

296
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,578
I guess it's all gone.

297
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,444
Tell me she has some left!

298
00:14:58,527 --> 00:14:59,694
That was the last one!

299
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:00,806
Oh, no!

300
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,380
Let me handle this.

301
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,444
It isn't a matter of "can" or "can't."

302
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:07,877
I will find a way.

303
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,148
I'll do this somehow.

304
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,944
Anything is possible.

305
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,329
Because I know I'm not in this alone.

306
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,596
Aghhhh! Man!

307
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:22,860
What's the matter?

308
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:23,860
Is something wrong?

309
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:25,027
Using Judgment's system,

310
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,902
not only is there no way to intercept it,

311
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,902
I can't even compute its orbit!

312
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,049
Given the machine's specs...

313
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,073
I would've thought that will be a simple process.

314
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:34,930
"I have heard about what's happening...

315
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,392
It looks like it's finally my turn,"

316
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,874
says Misaka, announcing her intentions with superb timing.

317
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,502
It's an ingenious design...

318
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:46,299
When the missile's warhead reaches thirty thousand meters,

319
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,744
it's set up to then subdivide into five thousand

320
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:49,819
micro-warheads.

321
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:52,110
Once that happens, it'll be too late.

322
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,575
So it's imperative that the missile be shot down

323
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,903
before the split occurs.

324
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,836
And the only way that can possibly be done...

325
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,414
I made it! I'm here!

326
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:07,366
Lollipop?

327
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,658
Thank goodness. This'll buy us a little time.

328
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,230
They were exactly where that Aritomi man

329
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,169
said they would be. What now?

330
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:19,694
First, we need to free Janie from
the runaway system, and to do that...

331
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,709
We're going to need Febri's help.

332
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,308
Right now, she's in a state where she will accept

333
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:25,571
no outside input...

334
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:30,610
but if we can get a strong emotional response
from Febri, who is basically identical to her...

335
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:34,694
That makes sense... Because when all else
fails, love can still get through, right?

336
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,083
Huh? Uh... okay... Yeah.

337
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:42,144
It took some doing, but I had Kongo rig the airframe

338
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,376
so that all eight thousand and ninety-two jet points

339
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:47,444
will activate to a precision of
one one-thousandth of a second.

340
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:50,135
Theoretically, This should work out... but...

341
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:54,760
How did you get such a complex
calculation done in so short a time?

342
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,860
Oh, well... you know...

343
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,536
Sorry, Kuroko.

344
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,477
I never had any intention of dragging you into this.

345
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,772
I have no idea what you're talking about.

346
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,508
I'm really glad... There's nothing that could make me

347
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:12,027
prouder than having you rely on me to assist you.

348
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,424
Your confidence means the world to me.

349
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:20,390
Thank you.

350
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:39,402
They're in synch. Okay, Febri's up.

351
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:39,942
Got it...

352
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:48,402
Big Sister, it's Febri! And this guy here is Gekota...

353
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,120
He's a really good friend of mine.

354
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:52,127
You know what? I've been outside...

355
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:52,989
Please work...

356
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,770
I know I'm asking for more than I deserve at this point.

357
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,690
If not for me... for them...

358
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:03,038
Let Febri's emotions get through to her sister!

359
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,253
This processing speed can't keep up!

360
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,741
What's that? Access from outside?!

361
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,680
"I will give you a hand, okay?"

362
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,876
Asks Misaka, retroactively seeking approval after

363
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,337
having already acted.

364
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,331
Why would you do this?

365
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,779
To say thanks for the fragments
of our mind we received from you.

366
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,821
Your mind? I...

367
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:31,935
By the way...

368
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:35,747
This Misaka's serial number is 19090.

369
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,712
Wait, do you mean... What I did before...

370
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:40,847
it reached you?

371
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:44,074
That's right... and, moreover...

372
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:51,319
those two young girls have a thought base
program that is identical to the Misakas'.

373
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:54,842
Which means they are basically
like family to the Misaka sisters...

374
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:58,519
"Does an older sister really need a
reason to help out her younger sister?"

375
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,411
Asks Misaka, adopting a tone
of wisdom and sisterly affection.

376
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,378
Like those girls, we, too, want to know...

377
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,210
how bright and beautiful the world can be...

378
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,903
when you are not alone.

379
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:54,674
Good morning, Big Sister!

380
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,196
Shinobu! Big Sister finally woke up!

381
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,211
She did...

382
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:10,078
Good morning... Janie.

383
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,944
Go on now, Febri...

384
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,861
You have something to give her, don't you?

385
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,983
Oh! Here!

386
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,894
Take it! It's for Big Sister and for you, Shinobu!

387
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:25,721
Do you like it? I made it myself!

388
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,995
You made something... for me?

389
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:35,779
What's the matter?

390
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,926
Oh, it's nothing... There's just so much to do...

391
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,801
So many beautiful things I want to show you.

392
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:16,895
I can't take it!

393
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,777
It's just, she's growing up so quickly!

394
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,224
Come on, Saten, stop!

395
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,360
You promised that you wouldn't
cry, and now you're gonna make me...

396
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:26,532
Ruiko, Whee-ha, don't cry. It'll be okay.

397
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,423
Here, Janie. I brought this for you...

398
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:31,624
It's a good luck charm... Keep it with you.

399
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,983
I promise, it's quite effective.

400
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:39,652
Guess that's it, then... So they'll be going to a
facility overseas to be examined and reconditioned?

401
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:40,902
That's too bad...

402
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:43,199
now that we've all become such good friends.

403
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,985
It's difficult to believe how well everything turned out.

404
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,554
Almost like the bad parts never happened at all...

405
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,398
as if the record of events had been completely rewritten.

406
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:52,900
Oh... Really?

407
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:55,194
Electronic records can be so...

408
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:59,168
Well... unreliable, would you say? Anyhow...

409
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:03,197
I get the feeling that some of the
human memories have been doctored, as well.

410
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,580
Oh, um, yeah...

411
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,845
Well... if you're willing to put differences behind you,

412
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:12,310
swallow your pride, and reach out... the results can be...

413
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:14,414
Impressive...

414
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,467
I guess it's my turn now, huh?

415
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,074
It'll be okay... I know I can do this.

416
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,276
After all... I'm not alone anymore.

417
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:29,764
You're ready?

418
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,504
Yes.

419
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:11,485
Okay... should we get going?

420
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:14,569
If we leave now we'll be in
time for the afternoon lectures.

421
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,034
Yeah, you're right.

422
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,102
I think I'll stop for lunch somewhere.

423
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,135
Man, this city...

424
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,949
There's never a dull moment, huh?

425
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:25,002
Not when you're around, Misaka!

426
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,902
Hey, hold on...! What's that supposed to mean?!

427
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:30,781
So... is everybody ready for the regional field trip?

428
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,544
Is it that time already?

429
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:35,311
Liberal Arts City, huh? I can't wait!

430
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,669
Wait, come on!

431
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:39,404
Seriously, guys! What did you mean by that?
