1
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:10,995
So you're not going to sell out your friends, huh?

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,157
No... I would, I just can't talk.

3
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,246
All right... I can't hold that against you.

4
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:25,209
Moving the Sisters that are being
adjusted would normally come last.

5
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:30,957
With the abrupt transfer of control
and the watch out for attackers,

6
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,773
they've ignored internal security.

7
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:35,696
If I'm really going to do this...

8
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:36,942
it's now or never.

9
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:49,727
S Processor...

10
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,365
the institute for practical neuroscience?

11
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:53,746
Yes...

12
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,070
I do apologize for the short notice...

13
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,410
but I wonder if you could come over here right away.

14
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:00,842
I'll fill you in on the details later.

15
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,575
It's better if we talk in person.

16
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,349
It isn't just one facility...

17
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,828
There are more than twenty.

18
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,227
Are you planning to do this alone?

19
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,073
Yes, I am...

20
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,202
No one else needs to get involved.

21
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,641
I'm the one who made this mess.

22
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:47,732
I will be the one...

23
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:50,472
...to clean it up.

24
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,281
She was right about that... huh.

25
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,245
It got quiet in here all of a sudden.

26
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,298
I was sure the Electromaster had finished you off.

27
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:23,089
It looks like I got here just in time, though...

28
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,290
Hello Frenda.

29
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,541
Muginooooo!

30
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,421
It's so good to see you!

31
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:30,320
What were you thinking?

32
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,021
My orders were to keep her confined...

33
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:36,151
You weren't supposed to begin
a real attack 'til we arrived.

34
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,480
Instead, you provoked her and got yourself caught.

35
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,967
What a rookie move...

36
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,357
If you'd listened to me, this wouldn't have happened...

37
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,551
but you were too damn eager.

38
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,849
It's all right. I understand...

39
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,764
You just get like that sometimes.
I know you can't help it.

40
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,276
What do you mean I get like that?

41
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,268
Nice try...

42
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,587
You're the one who's been causing all this trouble, huh?

43
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,040
She blocked it...

44
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,534
No... she blew it apart.

45
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,010
Well, well...

46
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,904
That's a nifty little trick you've got...

47
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:45,780
running around, sticking to the walls like that.

48
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,186
Almost like you're a spider, huh?

49
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:50,551
Who is she?

50
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:52,956
Takitsubo...

51
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:00,870
You know what to do.

52
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,516
Have you seen her yet?

53
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,200
No, nothing so far...

54
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:15,249
Where on earth could she have disappeared to?

55
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:16,823
And why now?

56
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:18,675
We're way too busy for this.

57
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,177
I guess we should contact those
so-called cleaners, just in case...

58
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,411
I hope this doesn't turn into some kinda' big deal.

59
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:25,754
Yeah, same here.

60
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:44,870
Here we are... Time to get started.

61
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,994
She didn't dodge...

62
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,060
No... she's actually turning away my shocks.

63
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,902
Woo... what a show!

64
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,191
That's weird.

65
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,374
I don't know why...

66
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,645
but I get the feeling she's dangerous.

67
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:55,492
What now? Trying to blind us?

68
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,909
That's not gonna buy you enough time to...

69
00:07:59,563 --> 00:07:59,942
Tch...

70
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,120
She got away... Takitsubo?

71
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,139
Not a problem...

72
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,451
I've memorized the target's AIM diffusion field.

73
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,986
The odds aren't in my favor, going
up against three of them like that.

74
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,946
Shutting this place down comes first.

75
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:23,681
Oh, crap!

76
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,404
I've overused my ability...

77
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,739
It's failing.

78
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,294
What?

79
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,986
But I'm moving in a completely random pattern...

80
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,947
How could she...

81
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:37,694
A lucky guess?

82
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:41,409
No...

83
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:42,882
not a guess.

84
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,289
She's dodging us.

85
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,565
The target remains whole and active.

86
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,678
Did she jump up onto the ceiling?

87
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,494
That arachnid move of hers is annoying...

88
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:56,399
Takitsubo...

89
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,045
Mm.

90
00:08:57,614 --> 00:08:58,435
Huh?

91
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,805
Those two are as impressive as ever.

92
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,501
First we have...

93
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:07,945
Academy City's fourth-ranked Level 5...

94
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,415
"Meltdowner."

95
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:11,188
And then...

96
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:14,499
Takitsubo, with the ability to track a target,

97
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,478
even to the other side of the world...

98
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,600
"AIM Stalker."

99
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:23,478
ITEM's got it made with this
awesome Level 5-Level 4 combo.

100
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,869
Is there anybody who could escape from them?

101
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,540
Aww towd, not vewy wikewy!

102
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:29,619
Huh?

103
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,105
'ey! I can tawk!

104
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:32,306
Aaaaahhh...

105
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:37,764
Aaaah... Aaaah...

106
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,699
I don't know who our mystery saboteur is...

107
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,659
but I do know she won't be at large for much longer.

108
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:48,863
All we have to do now is box her
in and make certain she can't escape.

109
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,338
She's in the process of raiding that facility...

110
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,246
However, even if she is successful...

111
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,444
it probably won't stall the project.

112
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,649
The people behind it are swimming in deep water...

113
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,125
deep and dark.

114
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:24,512
This is all the emotional data on the
Sisters that has been gathered up to now...

115
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,183
I'm going to install it directly into their brains.

116
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:33,457
I doubt they will develop any genuine
feelings from a program this minor.

117
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,572
But it should create a simulated response.

118
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:42,300
I don't know if this will be enough to
make them suspend the project or not...

119
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:48,226
However... it should at least show the girls another
path besides the hopeless one they currently walk.

120
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,920
A better path.

121
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:56,808
Right now the Sisters accept
dying prematurely as inevitable.

122
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:00,216
Maybe this will inspire some of them to lament their fate.

123
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,131
And when they do...

124
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:07,755
maybe there will be some researchers who see
them as more than just mindless guinea pigs...

125
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:09,185
Maybe...

126
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,579
As unlikely as it seems now...

127
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,429
the girls will cry and say they
don't want to fight anymore...

128
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:16,216
And maybe...

129
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:22,724
Just maybe, that will touch someone's heart.

130
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,207
It's probably a stupid plan.

131
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,851
More likely than not... attempting this is pointless...

132
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:33,060
but...

133
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:39,145
What I felt in that moment up on the roof...

134
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,666
I thought you might actually be an authorized
staff member, so I checked with the people upstairs...

135
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,547
but they said that this place was ultra-off-limits...

136
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,416
at least until the data relocation was complete.

137
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:02,099
Up to now, they suspected the
attacks were the work of one person...

138
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,309
but it's best not to dismiss the possibility
that the attacks are really a diversion.

139
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:10,916
Therefore, it is advisable to make sure
all vulnerabilities are accounted for...

140
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:15,096
Security should be ultra tight and on
alert for both external and internal threats.

141
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:20,339
So here we are...

142
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,716
and as usual, Mugino's reasoning was right on the money.

143
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:35,983
There!

144
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:41,553
Now!

145
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:42,641
Okay!

146
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,937
Here we go!

147
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,217
Arming the entire facility was a totally brilliant plan!

148
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,336
Sure enough...

149
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,092
no matter where I go, they know my every move.

150
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:06,610
There's no question...

151
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,359
They've got a psychometrist or a clairvoyant...

152
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:10,869
One or the other...

153
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,135
Somebody on that team can pinpoint my location.

154
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,526
An esper.

155
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,408
All right!

156
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,203
This sucks!

157
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:21,405
I'm at a serious disadvantage here...

158
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:23,136
Although...

159
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,676
Please stop your pointless struggling.

160
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:36,070
I've got you and now I'll turn you over to my client.

161
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,066
Resistance is ultra futile.

162
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,192
Resistance is futile...

163
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:47,988
Maybe...

164
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:49,974
You might be right about that.

165
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,731
This project isn't the only issue.

166
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:01,067
Even supposing I'm able to put
a halt to the project for good...

167
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:05,650
How can the cloned Sisters possibly live normal lives?

168
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,891
Their empty, soulless eyes...

169
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,829
Their short lifespans...

170
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:13,618
Would that not be a crueler fate
than the experiment has in store?

171
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,855
If so, better to leave them be.

172
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:21,849
And yet...

173
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,580
She's borne the weight of this...

174
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,090
All of it, on her own.

175
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:36,127
A fool... A noble fool.

176
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:38,883
Yes.

177
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,076
We are the ones who should bear the burden of this sin.

178
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,649
For good or ill, let them carve out their own destinies.

179
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,271
What the...

180
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,169
Damn it!

181
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:54,481
It's no use. The installation is complete.

182
00:14:56,357 --> 00:15:00,240
They are all connected by a brainwave
link, referred to as the "Misaka Network."

183
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,305
The emotion program I installed will be shared
by all the Sisters, no matter where they are.

184
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,244
Now... nobody can stop it.

185
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,474
What is that? What's happening?

186
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:23,304
I'm not entirely sure what's going on.

187
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,749
But if I had to guess, I'd say that
whatever your plan was, it failed.

188
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,143
N-No way!

189
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:30,319
When did they install that security?

190
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,462
'Kay, so, what do we do with her?

191
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,624
What else? We haul her upstairs.

192
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,403
Roger that.

193
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,484
Come on. Up!

194
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,398
Start walking, you.

195
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,066
Little brat.

196
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:07,827
Don't move!

197
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,450
If possible, I'd rather not have to fire this.

198
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,057
Now just back up... Nice and slow.

199
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:18,226
I'm not going to do that.

200
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,482
It's ultra-commendable of you to
shoot something that's not vital...

201
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,494
Especially at this stage of the game.

202
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:49,688
But unfortunately for you, a simple
pistol can't penetrate my "Offense Armor."

203
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:00,416
Let's try this again. Please carry her upstairs.

204
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,367
Uh... Right.

205
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,798
Ugh... Damn...

206
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,232
That capsule in there...

207
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:09,249
It looks like it's got somebody inside.

208
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:12,566
You should stop looking at things
that aren't related to the job.

209
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,150
You wouldn't want to be deemed a security risk.

210
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,518
Right. Sorry.

211
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,902
Come on, now. Let's make it snappy, okay?

212
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:22,731
So what do you think. they'll do with her?

213
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:23,791
Dunno.

214
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:26,769
And I ultra don't care. We're just doing our jobs here.

215
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:30,463
If she is of any use, her life
will most likely be spared, at least.

216
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,656
Of course...

217
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,785
I'm guessing that life will be ultra-crappy...

218
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:39,400
Sad, lonely, pathetic, and stripped
of everything she cares about.

219
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,416
Target changed location.

220
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,249
Twenty meters to the northwest.

221
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,326
Ah! I just can't seem to hit her, huh?

222
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:02,567
I don't think it's only the way she's moving...

223
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:06,276
What if she's able to detect
my attacks before they reach her?

224
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,414
The only espers who could do that are...

225
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:09,701
Are you okay?

226
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,738
Mm-Hmm. Still standing.

227
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,806
Takitsubo's "AIM Stalker" is handy...

228
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:23,581
but it's a difficult ability to use as
it has to be intentionally overdriven...

229
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,871
It can't be sustained for long.

230
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:30,597
The target's not covering as
much ground as she was before.

231
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,385
She must be near her breaking point by now.

232
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,080
It's not worth it to use Takitsubo any longer.

233
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,289
If we've pushed her this far, and she still hasn't left...

234
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:45,867
that more than likely means she has some
compelling reason to make sure this place is destroyed.

235
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,800
If we just wait for her at her destination...

236
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,587
She's sure to show up sooner or later.

237
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,641
She's a wounded beast.

238
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,795
exhausted, but more unpredictable and dangerous than ever.

239
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:59,657
It's risky, but if I keep my cool dealing with her,

240
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,679
I shouldn't have too much to worry about.

241
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:02,910
Still...

242
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:08,041
It's so unlike me to set up an ambush.

243
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,329
I'm rather excited!

244
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:10,576
Hey, Frenda!

245
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:11,894
Eh?

246
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,875
Come on, keep moving... Mikoto Misaka...

247
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,925
You don't have time to slack off right now...

248
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,261
Get back on your feet.

249
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,401
Geez, not again!

250
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,428
Fire, fire, fire!

251
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:51,954
Bye-bye...

252
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,083
Spider girl.

253
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:55,131
Crap!

254
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,371
I can't dodge!

255
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:07,898
I knew it...

256
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,211
I suspected as much when I saw her repel one of my shocks.

257
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,158
In the most basic sense...

258
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,399
her ability is actually the same variety as my own.

259
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,560
My Meltdowner should've taken her out.

260
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:24,272
Is something the matter, Mugino?

261
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:31,796
So that's it...

262
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,227
I understand now.

263
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,904
Whoa! We've got a woman down!

264
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,691
Are... you... sure... you're... okay,

265
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,577
Ta... kit... su... bo?

266
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:45,129
Frenda...

267
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,488
take Takitsubo and meet up with Kinuhata.

268
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:48,583
Huh?

269
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,618
I'll be all right. I can still help.

270
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,017
This isn't just for your sake, though.

271
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:56,752
Frenda, you took some serious
damage from the spider girl, huh?

272
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,151
You're playing through the pain, but it's bad.

273
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,286
Uh...

274
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,822
And when Takitsubo reaches her limit...

275
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:05,269
she can't detect enemy attacks anymore...

276
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:08,820
It's too difficult for me to
protect both of you on my own...

277
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,711
Especially against this girl.

278
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,624
Oh, of course...

279
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,445
I'm sorry we've been holding you back.

280
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,285
It's not like I'm blaming you for it.

281
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,201
In fact, I think you've done quite well...

282
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:28,007
Thanks to the two of you, our opponent is on the ropes.

283
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,326
Let Kinuhata bring up the rear...

284
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:31,622
You get some rest.

285
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:35,650
Mugino...

286
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:36,928
She was...

287
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,145
...kind of nice to us!

288
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:43,602
Yes...

289
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:48,052
I'd hate for anyone to say that I defeated
her because the numbers were in my favor.

290
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,088
Academy City's third-ranked Level 5...

291
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,987
Heh, heh... The Tokiwadai...

292
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,630
...Railgun!

293
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,006
Railgun of Tokiwadai...

294
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,088
why won't you face me head on?

295
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:38,041
While I'm here doing this, they're out there dying!

296
00:23:38,198 --> 00:23:39,722
Stay the hell out of my way!
