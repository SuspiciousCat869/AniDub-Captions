1
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:05,565
Thank you for waiting.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,069
Hm?

3
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,840
"I hope I have not kept you long.

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:14,215
I am Misaka 10031, your next opponent," Misaka reports.

5
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:14,819
Huh?

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,686
Tch, okay.

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,923
You guys get kinda confusing after a while.

8
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,340
Operation confirmed.

9
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:27,349
Misakas 10031 and 10032 will proceed
with the predetermined course of action.

10
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:38,641
The time has come.

11
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,829
We will now be commencing trial number 10031.

12
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,061
Tree Diagram has been destroyed.

13
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:31,889
But how?

14
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:35,019
Shot down by some hostile force?

15
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,457
An accident with space debris?

16
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,001
Although.

17
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,630
That's not really the point, is it?

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,748
The point is, the last chance I had of putting a
stop to the project is now garbage in outer space,

19
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:56,152
and then there's the fact that the experiments have been
proceeding according to plan, even without Tree Diagram.

20
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,712
Oh, That's right.

21
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:06,097
One of the facilities on this block was
among the project's transferee offices that

22
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,546
I was looking into yesterday.

23
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:10,620
Heh.

24
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,009
Thanks for waiting!

25
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:20,057
Uhh...

26
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,460
Or not.

27
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,253
Oh, hi, On Hold.

28
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,098
You're still here.

29
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,037
So where did she go?

30
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,829
Entry code not recognized.

31
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,959
Entry to outsiders is not permitted.

32
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,586
Please exit the premises.

33
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:58,989
Hey!

34
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,030
Misaka's sister!

35
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:04,457
Well.

36
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,798
I don't know why she would be back here, anyway.

37
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,143
Uh... That doesn't look good.

38
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,118
Ahh!

39
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
Was that an explosion?

40
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:28,190
No! Just look! Over there!

41
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:28,845
Ah!

42
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:31,204
It's her!

43
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:36,548
Go! Go!

44
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,631
The Electromaster!

45
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:38,705
Hey, wait up!

46
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,937
Let's get out of here!

47
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,452
So. You done yet?

48
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,716
Can I go ahead and kill you now? Huh?

49
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,232
That's some pretty heavy firepower

50
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,594
considering we're in the middle of the city.

51
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,559
You should be careful.

52
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:24,412
Now, what are you running away like that for?

53
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,804
Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the view.

54
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,347
After all, you've got such a cute little ass.

55
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:39,907
No.

56
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,021
This isn't close to over yet.

57
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,510
It's too soon to give up.

58
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:54,094
Yes.

59
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,128
I'll just bring it all down.

60
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,144
Everything they've done.

61
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,360
Everything they will do.

62
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:07,942
All of it!

63
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:13,275
There was definitely a loud noise.

64
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,330
But what happened here?

65
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,829
Still no sign of her, though.

66
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:25,075
It's okay. We'll head back now.

67
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,886
Is that? Her shoe?

68
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,025
I've got a pop quiz for you.

69
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,432
Which technique was it I just used?

70
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:59,124
Please answer.

71
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,423
Out of the many skills I have to call upon,

72
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,525
which did I just employ to put you on the ground?

73
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,537
Reflection?

74
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,582
Aw, that's too bad.

75
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,065
Yeah. You're close,

76
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,547
but I'm afraid that's not this particular technique.

77
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:28,837
Would you like to try guessing again,
or should I just go ahead and tell you?

78
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,312
The right answer is...

79
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,579
"Vector transformation".

80
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,822
Kinetic energy.

81
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,772
Body heat.

82
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:48,858
Or, of course...

83
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,212
Electricity.

84
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,981
Any vector, anything that has direction,

85
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,894
once it touches my skin, I can transform it.

86
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,890
See? Simple.

87
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,545
I'll destroy it.

88
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:16,491
All of it.

89
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:22,275
Equipment, research, their greed, their ambition.

90
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,085
I'll tear it all apart.

91
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,636
Until there's no trace left.

92
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:34,827
It will take time, but someday.

93
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:36,941
Someday?

94
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,715
Someday it will all be over, huh?

95
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:43,862
But what good does that do? Before "someday" gets here.

96
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:46,443
How many more Sisters are going to die?

97
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,315
Shut up!

98
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,090
What else do you want me to do?

99
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:55,815
End it all? Right now? This minute?

100
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,131
Please, tell me!

101
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,512
How the hell am I supposed to do that?!

102
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,960
Now then, shall we return our
focus to this little match of ours?

103
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:40,860
Bear with me, 'cause I think I'm
gonna get a little creative, here.

104
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:44,902
What do you suppose would happen if I
reversed the flow of blood through your veins?

105
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:46,611
Heh.

106
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:49,772
No.

107
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:51,726
Please, no.

108
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,349
What are you doing? Stop!

109
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,139
Tch.

110
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:48,968
Hey.

111
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,201
So I'm guessing you're the one I'm up against
for this experiment of theirs, that right?

112
00:10:55,982 --> 00:11:01,317
"That's correct. It is a pleasure to meet
you," replies Misaka, offering a kind greeting.

113
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,681
Back at you.

114
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:06,082
This is my first time going
head-to-head against a Level 5.

115
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,928
I'm looking forward to... Huh?

116
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,573
A gun?

117
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,131
All checks have been completed.

118
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:13,590
Now...

119
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:18,776
Shall we get started? Misaka is
excited to begin her first trial.

120
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:23,360
Incidentally, you've been given
permission to use a firearm, have you not?

121
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,398
You are certain you do not want one?

122
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,131
Hm...

123
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,781
All right, if you're ready,
let's get the first trial under way.

124
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,332
"Yes, please." Misaka is ready.

125
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:37,765
So," Misaka trails off, commencing her attack.

126
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:48,006
"Target appears to be deflecting the bullets," observes
Misaka, analyzing the situation with some surprise.

127
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:52,082
Is the point of this experiment to screw with me?

128
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:58,525
Hey.

129
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,512
What the hell's going on here? C'mon.

130
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,888
Is that really a clone of a Level 5?

131
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:10,157
There are some specification
differences from the Original.

132
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:14,995
However, all of the clones you'll face share
a common memory through their mental network.

133
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,773
Over the course of twenty thousand test runs,

134
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,785
they'll continue to learn and develop.

135
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,415
When you reach the end,

136
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,836
you may find yourself fighting an uphill battle.

137
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:28,915
That's a long time away, and until then
I'm stuck fighting these losers over and over?

138
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,267
Tch. Man, talk about a buzzkill.

139
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,793
That all for now? I'm getting out of here.

140
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:36,404
Well.

141
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:40,388
Actually, the first trial hasn't been completed yet.

142
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:45,830
And it won't be until you have
dispatched the test subject.

143
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:53,377
Fulfillment of this experiment requires the
elimination of twenty thousand armed clones.

144
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:56,560
This subject's actions have not yet been terminated.

145
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,722
Please continue with combat.

146
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:03,313
"Continue with combat

147
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:05,825
until the experiment is complete.

148
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:10,243
Yes," says Misaka, following her orders.

149
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:14,764
Terminate? Dispatch? Eliminate?

150
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:16,892
That sounds like...

151
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,109
Huh?

152
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,667
So dark and cold

153
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:47,607
like sinking slowly down through water.

154
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,499
An ocean.

155
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:59,865
"So this is what death is like," says Misaka.

156
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,565
That's what you were talking about?

157
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,189
Uh, yeah, that's we were looking for.

158
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:15,175
Good work today. This concludes the first trial.

159
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:18,125
It may be dull now, but they'll improve quickly enough.

160
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,530
Just keep hammering away.

161
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,502
There's no need to hold back.

162
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:25,811
Keep in mind that your opponents
are nothing but wind-up dolls.

163
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,049
Just objects synthesized from chemicals and protein.

164
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,496
Well, then.

165
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,340
Guess I'll go get some dinner.

166
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,895
S... So much... blood!

167
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:14,345
What's up?

168
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,876
There's been some kind of incident, apparently.

169
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,683
I heard that somebody died!

170
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,467
Seriously? Like a murder?

171
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:24,623
Hey, how much further is it?

172
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,790
It's right up here.

173
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,652
What's wrong?

174
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:39,916
Oh, the uh, the body.

175
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,073
It was right there just a few minutes ago.

176
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:43,961
Huh?

177
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,483
Listen, kid.

178
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,373
You sure about what you saw?

179
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:51,969
How the...

180
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,550
No way, you're kidding.

181
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,260
Was I just dreaming?

182
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,493
Yes? Is that right? Roger that.

183
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:01,288
Hey!

184
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,039
Our people have checked all
the security cameras in the area.

185
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,898
They say there isn't a hint of anything suspicious.

186
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,006
Impossible!

187
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,068
I mean, I just!

188
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:17,648
We're going to write this up as a simple eyewitness
error this time, but kid, you pull this again,

189
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,141
and we're contacting your school.

190
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,588
Man, I'm sick of these brats and their stupid pranks.

191
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,695
What's going on?

192
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,608
What the hell is happening?

193
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,091
Damn it!

194
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,927
M... Misaka?

195
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,280
I am sorry about this.

196
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,891
"It was my intention to meet back
with you after I completed the op, so."

197
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,659
Misaka apologizes with complete sincerity.

198
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,162
Hey, hold on!

199
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,698
Are you... You're Misaka's younger sister, right?

200
00:16:58,394 --> 00:16:59,547
And you're alive.

201
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:03,148
Heh, heh... I'll be damned.

202
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,037
I must be losing my mind.

203
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,345
Sorry, It's just, until a second
ago, I thought I had found your body.

204
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,022
Heh, ha... I guess I was wrong.

205
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,590
"No, you were correct about Misaka's death."

206
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,559
Misaka confirms your observation.

207
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,881
Huh?

208
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,208
That, that bag.

209
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,298
What are you carrying in there?

210
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,118
"Before saying more.

211
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:29,773
I must verify your password, please."

212
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,177
Misaka says, as she was instructed.

213
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:40,545
"ZXC741 ASD852 QWE963, well?" Asks Misaka, testing you.

214
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,421
Uh. Say what?

215
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,273
It does not appear you are able to decode the password.

216
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:50,690
Given that fact, you have obviously
not been read in to the experiment,

217
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:53,023
so Misaka cannot say anything more.

218
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:53,684
That's it!

219
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,575
What the hell are you talking about?

220
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,968
What exactly do you have in that bag?

221
00:17:58,298 --> 00:17:59,756
"It contains Sisters."

222
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,949
Misaka says calmly.

223
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:09,464
"I apologize for having to leave
the cat behind with you," Says Misaka.

224
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,888
"But I did not feel right bringing him."

225
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:15,501
"It seems obvious that a violent battle
between humans is no place for an innocent animal."

226
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,815
Misaka says, justifying her actions.

227
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,715
"I appear to have caused undue concern.

228
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,272
That is an unfortunate result of the experiment."

229
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,481
Misaka says, apologizing again.

230
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,967
"But there was no real need to be worried."

231
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,356
"You see, we are many.

232
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:31,231
All Misakas here are Misaka."

233
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,227
What the hell is this?

234
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:36,673
Up to now, you have had contact with one Misaka.

235
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:39,026
Serial number one-zero-zero-three two.

236
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,735
You see, I am that Misaka.

237
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:48,595
"However, the Misaka who died today
was serial number one-zero-zero-three-one.

238
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:51,972
She is the same Misaka you ran
into yesterday with Big Sister."

239
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,277
Misaka explains, to differentiate.

240
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:58,765
"All Misakas have the ability to control electricity."

241
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,996
"And our brainwaves are all linked to each other."

242
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,397
"Therefore, we all share a common memory."

243
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:05,748
Misaka adds, explaining further.

244
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,227
I don't get it, who are you?

245
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:14,019
"We are simply cellular clones that have
been mass-produced for military purposes.

246
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,631
The original donor is Mikoto Misaka

247
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,739
one of only seven Level 5 espers in Academy City."

248
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:25,293
"We are her sisters," says Misaka in conclusion.

249
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,110
Misaka's clones?

250
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:30,337
Really? But, what is this?

251
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:32,482
What are you all doing here?

252
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,692
"We are performing an experiment."

253
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,844
Misaka reiterates.

254
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,773
"The details are classified as top-secret."

255
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,465
"So I cannot explain further."

256
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,957
"But it is nothing for you to be concerned about."

257
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,598
Misaka says reassuringly.

258
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:49,065
"Once again, I hope you will accept my sincere apologies."

259
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,131
"For involving you in this experiment."

260
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,395
Misaka requests, bowing her head.

261
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,981
Now then, if you would look after the cat.

262
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,502
It is just an experiment.

263
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:25,668
Cellular clones that have been mass-produced for
military purposes from the original donor, Mikoto Misaka.

264
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,703
Experiment? Military?

265
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:33,095
I wonder.

266
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:37,377
Misaka, does she know about this?

267
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:47,097
Project Level 6 Shift.

268
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,677
Test Subject will kill Railgun
one hundred and twenty-eight times.

269
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,285
Thus achieving Level 6.

270
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,238
That's it.

271
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:06,346
That's what I can do.

272
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,173
The next stop is School District 7,

273
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,148
Tokiwadai Middle School Dorms.

274
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,495
School District 7, Tokiwadai.

275
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:45,157
So, she's in room 208.

276
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,704
And when you see her, what are you planning to say?

277
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,251
Are you just going to ask her straight out?

278
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,772
"Hey, did you know someone out
there's killing off clones of you?"

279
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,326
It was no use, any of it.

280
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:36,391
The whole thing is my fault!

281
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:37,439
I think,

282
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:40,400
I think there's one last thing I can do to save them.
