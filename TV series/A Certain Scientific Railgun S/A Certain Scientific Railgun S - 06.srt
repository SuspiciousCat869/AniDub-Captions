1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:02,666
It's your turn to answer now, Sissy.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:06,492
What would you do if there was a
clone of you wandering around the city?

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:13,570
That's a good question...

4
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:19,807
Honestly, I would probably think it was a little
creepy and not want to hang out with her at all.

5
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:21,055
You know what I mean?

6
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,724
That concludes today's experiment.

7
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:32,548
I made quite a mess this time.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,260
I wonder how long it'll take them to clean it up.

9
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,738
Eh... who cares?

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,336
I should stop by the store on my way home and get so...

11
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:33,511
Nice.

12
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,509
Awesome light show!

13
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,479
Picked up a new technique huh?

14
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:00,386
Controlling the iron sand using magnetism.

15
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,256
I have to admit, it's an interesting idea.

16
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,200
What? No way!

17
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:15,062
But unfortunately, once you know how
it's done, it's no big deal anymore.

18
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,170
I threw all that at him...

19
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,188
and he doesn't even have a scratch?

20
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:21,935
What the...?

21
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,297
Huh? That's a lot of power. Are you...

22
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,731
That's... impossible.

23
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:14,020
How could I not know about an esper
who can shrug off my attacks like that?

24
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:17,795
Ah, I understand now!

25
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:21,115
I was wondering what this was
since it wasn't on the schedule.

26
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:25,730
You... You're the Original.

27
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:31,578
The clones are supposed to take the Original's place.

28
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,147
But if I fight you...

29
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,531
that would considerably reduce the number of
lame combat scenarios I have to go through, right?

30
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:42,870
I'm really starting to get tired of doing this...

31
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:46,324
What do you say? Original...

32
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,088
Tell me why...

33
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,275
Why are you going along with this project?

34
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,785
Uh... Can we just fight?

35
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:01,801
Answer me!

36
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,979
You've got some serious power...

37
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,823
There's no way that they could force you to do anything!

38
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:09,866
So, what's your reason for participating in this insanity?

39
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,758
What could she have done to deserve this?

40
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:16,842
Reason? What's my reason?

41
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:18,558
That's easy...

42
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:23,578
My goal is to acquire absolute power.

43
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:30,156
Not the power of a Level 5, or Academy City's top dog.

44
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,883
Nothing that insignificant.

45
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:38,952
I'm talking about the kind of power that will
stop people from even thinking about challenging me.

46
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,489
I want invincibility.

47
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:44,878
You get that, right? Being a Level 5.

48
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:49,431
You're nuts... aren't you?

49
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,866
So you want to be invincible...

50
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,707
Is that your excuse?

51
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:58,949
Seriously? Power's not enough. You need absolute power?

52
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:10,040
That's the reason you're giving
me? The reason you agreed to kill her?

53
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,285
You make it sound so dirty.

54
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,084
Stop talking like I'm a murderer...

55
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:33,072
I'm fighting things not real people.
They're manufactured with the push of a button.

56
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,785
What are you so worked up about?

57
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:42,394
Oh, I get it now. I stole your thunder, huh?

58
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:46,118
That move was your ace in the
hole, and I just annihilated it.

59
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:48,808
Oh, wow...

60
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,673
Man, I knew you were ranked lower than me,

61
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:54,769
but I still thought you'd have more to
bring to the table than a little electricity.

62
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:02,794
All right... Now it's my turn to play...

63
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:06,648
You're in pretty rough shape,
though, so I'm not expecting too much.

64
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,677
But at least try to keep me entertained, okay?

65
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:11,851
Third-string?

66
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,278
One moment, please.

67
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:22,029
"Combat outside of the project may introduce
errors into the computational predictions. So,"

68
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,525
says Misaka, "this should stop now."

69
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,855
"Especially since Big Sister is a Level 5.

70
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,563
The skew from such combat would be considerable.

71
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:41,590
Rather than shortening the scheduled time... the
very project itself... would be at risk of being ruined.

72
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,786
Further, Misaka has, in anticipation of experiments
yet to come, received specific programming...

73
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:51,084
and any alterations to the
project would be very difficult,"

74
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,144
explains Misaka simply.

75
00:07:53,337 --> 00:07:57,758
Tch... yeah, yeah, all right. I get
it... I was just messing around, anyway...

76
00:07:57,964 --> 00:08:00,095
And stop talking like that. It's creepy.

77
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:02,628
My bad...

78
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,600
I guess I never introduced myself, did I?

79
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,127
Not satisfied with being the strongest...

80
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:12,392
You probably figured it out by now, but
I'm the one looking after your clones...

81
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,142
They're helping me achieve invincibility.

82
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:17,248
A Level 5 who wants to become something even greater...

83
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:20,384
There's no doubt... This boy is...

84
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,363
I should be grateful to you, really.

85
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,455
the controller of vectors...

86
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,370
the first-ranked esper in Academy City.

87
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,574
Hello there, I'm Accelerator.

88
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:32,555
It's a pleasure.

89
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:46,754
Numbers nine-nine-nine-five through
one-zero-zero-zero-seven clear the rails.

90
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,184
One-zero-zero-zero-eight...

91
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,379
What's wrong with you?

92
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,365
It's so screwed up...

93
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,915
Why are you going along with this project?

94
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:59,281
You're going to be killed... I don't get it...

95
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:01,345
Why would you do this?

96
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,998
Why? You're breathing, aren't you? You
have life, don't you? Isn't that enough?

97
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,726
Who are you?

98
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,358
Just who the hell are you?

99
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:23,013
What, not who... Misaka is a
product created for this project...

100
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:26,608
Artificial bodies... with artificial minds...

101
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:30,999
Laboratory animals, with a unit price
of one hundred and eighty thousand.

102
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:37,465
Goodbye then... Big Sister.

103
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:43,577
Y... Yeah... that's why I called.

104
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,072
She hasn't come back to the dorm yet,

105
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:50,052
so, I thought to myself, "Maybe she's at Saten's." Is she?

106
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:52,216
She hasn't stopped by here at all...

107
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,591
Have you tried Uiharu? Maybe she's there.

108
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,537
I heard from Uiharu earlier...

109
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,294
Uh, I mean... Yes, of course...

110
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,686
If she isn't at your place or here, then...

111
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,034
Listen, Shirai, I'm just going to throw this out there...

112
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,352
She could have a boyfriend.

113
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,829
No she couldn't! There's absolutely no way!

114
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,816
I'm disappointed in you, Saten! Sissy
would never do anything so improper!

115
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:17,176
She belongs to me! To me, alone, do you understand?

116
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,180
Hey, I was only kidding! Calm down.

117
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,745
Uh, hello?

118
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,197
Are you still there?

119
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:27,886
Geez. I wonder what that was about.

120
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:34,154
It's the simplest thing in the world. And all
you have to do is give us your DNA map, okay?

121
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:40,343
Don't do it! They're not going to use
your DNA map to cure muscular dystrophy!

122
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,950
They're going to use it to make clones of you!

123
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,365
It'll be the basis for a horrible experiment!

124
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:46,223
Say no!

125
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,079
No, wait! Listen to me! Please, just listen...

126
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:55,979
So that's it...

127
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,855
You were the cause of all this, Big Sister.

128
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,485
The reason Misaka was made...

129
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,750
The reason Misaka is killed...

130
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:05,013
All of it.

131
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,481
Everything.

132
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:15,808
Oh, wow... I've been here all night.

133
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,760
Long time no see.

134
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:37,256
I thought I spotted a delinquent
camping out all night on this bench.

135
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,291
I know why you're here...

136
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,607
You found out about the project, didn't you?

137
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,580
There's no way you can put a stop to it.

138
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,850
That's why I told you not to get involved.

139
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,826
No, you didn't. Oh, dear... Is that right? My mistake.

140
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:53,238
It's wrong.

141
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:56,607
How can they get away with this?

142
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,744
I don't know anything about Level 6 or whatever...

143
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,487
but is it something they want
so badly they'll kill so many?

144
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,659
Everyone involved with the
experiment must be completely insane.

145
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,527
It's not quite like that.

146
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:16,294
I won't deny that there's something crazy about it all,

147
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,701
but if we're talking about right
and wrong, that's another matter.

148
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,365
Suppose there was a way to develop a
miracle drug that could cure cancer...

149
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:28,903
but doing so would require experimental
data from twenty thousand guinea pigs.

150
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:32,794
What would you do?

151
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:34,918
You would say "we have no other choice."

152
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,835
That's different though.

153
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:39,676
Is it? They're both alive.

154
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:46,827
And, from a researchers perspective,
they are essentially the same thing.

155
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:52,205
The Sisters are artificially produced guinea
pigs, made for the sake of reaching Level 6...

156
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,239
Of course...

157
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:56,392
There are those who are in it
for their own personal gain...

158
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,635
and there are a few of them who
really do have a screw loose...

159
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:03,430
But across the board, none of
them recognize this as being murder.

160
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,771
And neither, in fact, did I.

161
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:14,610
Wasn't that the reason you were
spreading those money cards around the city?

162
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,906
To interfere with the experiments?

163
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:18,882
That's correct.

164
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,454
But why? They're not even human...

165
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:24,545
Why would you want to protect them?

166
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:26,156
Why?

167
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:34,260
As you know, Project Radio Noise was designed
in order to mass produce Level 5 espers...

168
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,462
When it was frozen, I left the project team...

169
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:41,697
but then... when the Sisters were
taken over by Project Level 6 Shift...

170
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,453
I was called in once again.

171
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:52,424
We started some in-house experiments and found there
were no particular problems with their individual minds.

172
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,988
The Misaka Net is in good shape.

173
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:56,911
It looks problem-free.

174
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:04,276
Want some?

175
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,844
I'd prefer that to having you stare at me.

176
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,131
What is this?

177
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,402
A cup of tea.

178
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,850
It should be included in the data input by Testament.

179
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,194
Misaka's first cup of tea.

180
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:29,843
"It is somewhat different than the information
in the Testament data," Misaka says curiously...

181
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,221
"In addition to the flavor of the tea leaves,
there is a subtle sweetness and fullness to the..."

182
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:36,589
Oh, well that would be because it's milk tea.

183
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:40,568
Basically, tea with milk added to it... It's my favorite.

184
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,499
Milk tea...

185
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:49,110
It's been a long time since we've met like this.

186
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,197
Even so... you really haven't changed much.

187
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,710
You're just like the first "you."

188
00:14:55,419 --> 00:15:01,058
Eight thousand nine hundred and eleven units
have been consumed so far in in-house experiments...

189
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,867
In that time your emotional
aspects haven't developed at all...

190
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:08,711
However, your memories and experiences, in pure data form,

191
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:13,461
have all been gathered together and
shared... which is done via the Misaka Network.

192
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,901
And that means the next unit
will know the flavor of milk tea...

193
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:21,820
It's truly a fantastic system, the Misaka Network.

194
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:27,708
"Testament plays a very significant role,
as well, right?" Misaka asks, to clarify...

195
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:31,402
"It is through Testament that the Misakas are programmed.

196
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:34,857
That's how they learn to conceptualize
feelings and remember them as data."

197
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:39,877
"As a result of this process... the Misakas
are readily able to face the experiments,"

198
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:41,920
says Misaka, expressing gratitude.

199
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,282
It's time now.

200
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,006
You're heading out for external training...

201
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,389
Do you have anything to ask before you go?

202
00:15:57,984 --> 00:15:59,622
What is the air outside like?

203
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:02,187
Is it sweet? Or, perhaps, spicy?

204
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,889
"I was told the air outside is delicious, so I'm curious.

205
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:12,005
Misaka has a preference for things that are sweet,
you see," explains Misaka shyly, revealing her tastes.

206
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,742
Well... you'll find out for yourself soon enough.

207
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,725
The glare from the sun is pretty strong today.

208
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,666
Pretty disappointing isn't it?

209
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,620
No. Not disappointing at all.

210
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:47,148
A number of aromas are stimulating my nasal
cavities... and slowly filling up my chest.

211
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:52,678
An irregular breeze blows through my hair,
sweeping past my body like a gentle touch.

212
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,704
Light rays from the sun beam down on my skin...

213
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,921
and I can feel my cheeks taking in their heat.

214
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,273
The outside world...

215
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,139
it really is a dazzling place, isn't it?

216
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,948
I hate to sound trite, but it was that simple.

217
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,444
Something changed in that moment.

218
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,771
From then on, I could no longer think of them as products.

219
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,139
Because she seemed so much more human than me...

220
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:28,868
She saw the beauty in the world... and I
could only ever see it as a warped, ugly thing.

221
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:32,022
What about you?

222
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:33,602
What do you think of them?

223
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:37,044
I'm not sure.

224
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,874
It's difficult to think of clones as human...

225
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,993
and why should I help them when they
seem so ready to accept their own deaths?

226
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,451
However, there are still the people who took
my DNA map and used it for their sick experiment.

227
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,128
Them I intend to deal with.

228
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,014
Yeah, that's what happened...

229
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:09,023
She called me up out of the blue, asked me
about some kind of code, and then she just...

230
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:12,541
Wait a minute. You don't know what's going on, either?

231
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,070
Where are you, Sissy?

232
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,771
Finally! Where've you been,
you could have at least called me!

233
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,730
Your clothes are all torn up... What happened to you?

234
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,033
Oh...

235
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:27,994
well, you know...

236
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,062
Same thing as usual...

237
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,690
I'm gonna go take a shower.

238
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:32,265
Um...

239
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:33,955
Hold on a second!

240
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:36,698
Hello?!

241
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,357
Uiharu?

242
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:39,811
Oh... yes, just n...

243
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,424
I mean, late last night...

244
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,053
That's right... There's nothing to worry about...

245
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:48,927
Please pass the message on to Haru'ue... Okay, bye.

246
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:52,367
Hello? Oh, Saten...

247
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:54,847
Yes, late last night...

248
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,801
I told you, you had it wrong, did I not?

249
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:02,037
Yes... it's all fine. There's
no need to worry about anything...

250
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:02,958
Right.

251
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,665
Listen, Kuroko. Do you have a minute?

252
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:14,805
I'm so sorry I had all of you worried.

253
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,865
This is my way of apologizing...
It's my treat, so go ahead, enjoy!

254
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,051
This is incredible.

255
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,467
So, spill, Misaka.

256
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,541
Where were you? What were you up to?

257
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,938
I wanted to do... some stargazing.

258
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:30,870
Stargazing?

259
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,094
Yep... that's right.

260
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:33,599
Well, you know...

261
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,147
Like every now and again, when you
get into a schmaltzy kind of mood.

262
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:40,946
And you just want to sit on the swings
in the park, swaying back and forth,

263
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,050
humming cheesy songs to yourself
and staring at the stars...

264
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:44,845
You get it.

265
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,427
No, I don't...

266
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,191
I don't even know what "schmaltzy" means.

267
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:50,788
Oh you don't, huh?

268
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,180
Well, it's just how I was feeling last night.

269
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:57,232
I meant to ask: Did you ever figure
out what that code was for yesterday?

270
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,011
What do you mean?

271
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,232
Oh, it was just...

272
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:01,445
A... Ah, the code!

273
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,232
Well that was... it was...

274
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,158
What is it, Sissy?

275
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,652
Are you okay?

276
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,210
Please, Misaka, is something wrong?

277
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,866
I can see you.

278
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,520
All of you...

279
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:28,636
I can see you there beside me... but I can't... I can't...

280
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:31,006
What are you saying?

281
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,055
The arcade!

282
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:35,121
Let's go to the arcade, Misaka!

283
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:39,489
It's been a long time... and I want
to take on the punching machine again.

284
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,832
Great idea! The arcade!

285
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:45,614
Oh... in that case, I want to do one of these again.

286
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:47,196
Oh, yeah, I remember.

287
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:48,531
We'll do that, too!

288
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:50,137
Let's go, let's go!

289
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,440
We need to clear our heads.

290
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,398
You guys...

291
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,387
Just one thing... I want you to remember this, Misaka.

292
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,507
No matter what, we're always here for you.

293
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:06,471
If your burden is ever too heavy, just say the word, okay?

294
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:12,422
Mmm.

295
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,346
It really has been a long time, hasn't it?

296
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:17,720
A long, long time!

297
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,533
I wonder if the moles are still there.

298
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:21,640
I'll show you the technique I have for that game.

299
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,529
Yes. I can see now.

300
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:26,589
I'm takin' you down, just wait!

301
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,567
All the more reason...

302
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:35,739
However, there are still the people who took my
DNA map and used it for their sick experiment...

303
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,372
Them I intend to deal with.

304
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,983
Well, aren't you a defiant one?

305
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,894
It isn't just one facility...

306
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:47,378
There are more than twenty.

307
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:54,480
Are you planning to do this alone?

308
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,225
Yes, I am... No one else needs to get involved.

309
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:03,517
I'm the one who made this mess.

310
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:06,765
I will be the one...

311
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:10,299
...to clean it up.

312
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,633
Ugh... I'm still worried about Misaka.

313
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:34,363
So am I.

314
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:35,221
Time for a snack!

315
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:35,888
Shirai?

316
