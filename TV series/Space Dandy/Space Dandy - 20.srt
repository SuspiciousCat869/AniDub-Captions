1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,333
[GENERAL 20A]
Special report, Commander.

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,041
We've received some
interesting intelligence

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,583
from our spy in
the Gogol Empire.

4
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,458
They will soon be
conducting an inspection

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,291
of their ultimate weapon,
the dreaded C.O.R.E.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,875
[GENERAL 20B] So what
does that mean for us?

7
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,833
[GENERAL 20A] While the C.O.R.E.
is docked for inspection,

8
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,625
it's highly likely
they will replace it

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,875
with a decoy to
maintain appearances.

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,125
This is our best chance to
launch a full-scale invasion!

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,541
[GENERAL 20B] I believe
we should proceed,

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,125
but with caution.

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,833
[GENERAL 20A] With that
spineless sort of attitude,

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,333
we couldn't conquer a comet!

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,625
Commander, what are your orders?

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,625
[the commander chuckles]

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,916
Getting ahead of
ourselves, aren't we?

18
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,791
This is a momentous decision.

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,416
The fate of the entire
galaxy rests upon it.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,666
And what have you given me?

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,208
Scraps of information.

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,666
A bare bones report.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,541
I can't make a
decision based on that.

24
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,333
Consult your sources.

25
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,166
Gather more definitive
intelligence at once.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,416
Then I'll decide
what is to be done.

27
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,166
[NARRATOR] The leader
of the Jaicro Empire:

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,750
a man whose very name
rings with power. Johnny.

29
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,041
But beneath his steely
exterior lie depths

30
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,958
that no one has plumbed.

31
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,083
At least, not yet.

32
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,750
[NARRATOR] His dream is
to become a rock star!

33
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,041
How original.

34
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,375
[JOHNNY] What were
you just humming?

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,291
What?

36
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,041
Disgusting. You didn't
wash your hands.

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,458
Says the guy
who didn't flush

38
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,416
after taking an epic dump.

39
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,208
Come on. Did he
fall in or something?

40
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,750
[QT] Whoa!
[MEOW] Whoa!

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,250
[JOHNNY] Oh yeah!

42
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,500
That's it. I'm gonna rearrange
that pretty face of yours

43
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,458
so your own mama
wouldn't know you!

44
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,333
[QT] So much violence!

45
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,833
Hang on.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,541
[JOHNNY and DANDY] Yeah!

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah. There's just no beating
the Andromeda branch

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,833
of the Naritasan Temple,
is there?

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,458
Exactly!
That's what I'm saying!

50
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,375
I mean you have to get
a blessing from Acala

51
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,208
before warping anywhere.

52
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,500
[MEOW] Look, isn't it sweet?

53
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,291
Dandy found his soul mate.

54
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey.

55
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,583
We should start a band.

56
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,958
What, you and me?

57
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,833
It came to me when you were
humming in the bathroom.

58
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,291
Like the rock gods spoke,
I would be on the guitar.

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,500
You'd be lead vocals.
Sound good?

60
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,291
[DANDY] If we're really gonna
do this, we do it for real.

61
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,750
We don't go halfway.

62
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,375
We're either the best
there is, or we're nothing.

63
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,291
You agree to that, and
I just might be interested.

64
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,750
[JOHNNY] It's a deal!

65
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,625
Oh, yeah!

66
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,250
[QT] So, uh, who decided
I should be on drums, anyway?

67
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,750
Probably the same genius who
decided I should play bass.

68
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,958
We should pick
out a name first.

69
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,208
The rest will flow from there.

70
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,291
"Dandy &amp; Omega Tribe"
has a nice ring, huh?

71
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,458
Hey, man, come on.

72
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,458
Let's not waste time
joking around, okay?

73
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,625
Here, check this one out.

74
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,041
"Johnny with Team D."

75
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,208
[DANDY] Or "Dandy Rave Factory."
That's DRF for short.

76
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,958
[JOHNNY] "Johnny
featuring You Guys."

77
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,666
[DANDY] Or "Dandy and
Those Guys Over There"

78
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,583
[JOHNNY] Never!

79
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,166
[DANDY] No way!

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,416
We'll figure it out.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,083
Now here's an idea
I think you're gonna like.

82
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,333
We'll have our big
debut at Space Budokan.

83
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,583
Yeah, that'll rock.

84
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,541
Nobody's gonna
know what hit 'em.

85
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,916
You and me, we're gonna
change the face of music!

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,958
The rock revolution
starts today!

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,541
Right! Look out, galaxy!

88
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,541
A legend's being born!

89
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,000
[NARRATOR] Thus they
spent their first practice

90
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,958
discussing the finer points
of their own awesomeness,

91
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,291
which is much more productive

92
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,291
than the tedious business
of practicing music.

93
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,666
[MEOW] Look,
they're at it again.

94
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
[QT] Kind of makes you
want to vomit, huh?

95
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,291
[HONEY] Thanks for
waiting, boys. Here you go.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,958
What's this delicacy?

97
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,916
What do you mean?
They're french fries, silly.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,333
They look like potatoes
that have been fried.

99
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,083
[JOHNNY] Wow!

100
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,208
I had no idea potatoes
could be so delicious.

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,458
[MEOW] You've really never
had french fries before?

102
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,791
Guess what!
We're starting a band,

103
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,375
and it's gonna be
the best in the galaxy.

104
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,958
Obviously there'll
be a special edition

105
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,208
of our debut single,
and it'll come

106
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,916
with an awesome,
one-of-a-kind sticker!

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,833
[DANDY] A sticker? Lame.

108
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,083
Dude, it's gonna come
with a pennant, not a sticker.

109
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,375
You're kidding, right?

110
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,750
Who wants a stupid little
flag as a keepsake?

111
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,833
[QT] Let's calm down.

112
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,541
In the long run,
does it really matter?

113
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,958
Stay out of it, okay?

114
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:38,916
We're going with a pennant. Ah!

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,666
[QT] Hey, stop! This isn't fun!

116
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,708
A sticker! That's final!

117
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,166
[MEOW] Uh, what are you doing?

118
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,458
Something that's
absolutely vital

119
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,625
for any legendary rock star.
Here, take a look.

120
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,375
I'm practicing my autograph,
baby. Nice, huh?

121
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,833
Yeah. I don't
think that's necessary.

122
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,791
[QT] Who is this Johnny
character, anyway?

123
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,458
I mean, do we know
anything about him?

124
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,541
Well, apparently
he has a part-time job.

125
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,666
Really? Doing what?

126
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,541
I dunno.

127
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,958
The spaceship he came in on had

128
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,625
"something-Empire" written
on the side of it, though.

129
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,541
[QT] Maybe he's a
security guard, then.

130
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,958
I think there's a guard
service with a name like that.

131
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,208
Huh.

132
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,583
Guess he's still in the
"paying his dues" phase

133
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,875
of his music career.

134
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,041
[QT] Right? He'd never
had french fries before.

135
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,333
He must be seriously broke
if he can't even afford those.

136
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,041
[SERVER 20A] An aspic consommé
of Homard lobster from Bretagne.

137
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,958
Paired with the
highest-quality caviar

138
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,250
and a luscious
cauliflower mousseline.

139
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,916
I don't suppose you
have any fried potatoes.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,125
[SERVER 20A] Pardon?

141
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,625
[JOHNNY] Never mind.
This is fine.

142
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,541
[NARRATOR] And so, Johnny
began to lead a double life,

143
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,375
balancing his
duties as commander

144
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,416
of the Jaicro Empire,
and aspiring musician.

145
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,208
Hey, do you know
the most important part

146
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,500
of preparing to be
a serious rock star?

147
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,083
What do you think it is?

148
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,916
That's easy.
Practicing for interviews, baby.

149
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,291
Exactly! That's
what I'm saying!

150
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,458
Here's the thing. It's not
that I'm pursing rock.

151
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
That's not it at all.
Rock is pursuing me.

152
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,625
[DANDY] There are two things

153
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
that a real rocker
can't live without,

154
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,208
and that's booze,
women, and music.

155
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
I always knew
I was different.

156
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,208
Destined for greatness,
one might say--

157
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,875
[DANDY] Hey, man.
Back off, all right?

158
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,666
I was talking. Camera hog.

159
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,625
[NARRATOR] They fought about
who would get more camera time.

160
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,041
Do you know the
most important thing

161
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,625
for the number-one rock star
in the galaxy to have?

162
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,958
What do you think it is?

163
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,166
That's easy.

164
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,791
Awesome t-shirts for
the merch table, baby.

165
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,333
Exactly! That's
what I'm saying!

166
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,541
Hey! What are you wearing?

167
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,375
The t-shirts should be black!

168
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:39,916
[JOHNNY] No, red!

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,083
[DANDY] Black!

170
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:41,875
[NARRATOR]
They fought about the t-shirts

171
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,250
for the merchandise table.

172
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,083
They fought about the
money they hadn't made yet.

173
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,625
They even fought about drugs.

174
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,083
The whole of their
rocker experience

175
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,125
consisted of fighting,
fighting, and more fighting.

176
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,958
Not only had they failed
to write a single song,

177
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,791
they hadn't even decided
on a band name yet.

178
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,625
Hey, I know.
How about the Dropkix?

179
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,750
[GROUP] Huh?

180
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,958
I mean, you two are
always dropkicking

181
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,333
each other, so it kinda
fits, dontcha think?

182
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,500
"The Dropkix," huh? Well?

183
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,458
It's not bad.
I think I like it.

184
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,208
Oh, looks like we've
got a gig lined up.

185
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,791
[JOHNNY and DANDY]
A real gig?

186
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,500
[MEOW] It's a tiny club, not a
major concert venue or anything,

187
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,916
but they were looking
for bands to play,

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,916
so I told them we
might be interested.

189
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,833
Should we test
our set out there,

190
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,625
before our big
Space Budokan debut?

191
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,083
Yeah, baby.

192
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,458
Give 'em a little taste
before the real legend begins.

193
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,625
[QT] Um, guys.

194
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,125
Before we do that,
we need to write a song.

195
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,500
Our set list is
really short right now.

196
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,458
Oh. Don't worry.

197
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,666
That part you
can leave up to me.

198
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,291
Hey, uh, what are
you doin' up there?

199
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,708
I'm waiting for a song.

200
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,333
Huh?

201
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,333
Don't you get it?

202
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,208
A true masterpiece
isn't written.

203
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,916
It descends upon you from above.

204
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,375
[JOHNNY] It's here!

205
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,625
[plays Galaga theme]

206
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,791
Hey. Isn't that from Galaga?

207
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,041
[QT] Doesn't band
practice usually

208
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,250
involve everyone
playing together?

209
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,791
No reason you an'
me can't practice

210
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,833
on our own, right?

211
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,625
It's not like we're busy, here.

212
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,291
[JOHNNY] My masterpiece!
My ultimate creation!

213
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,333
[JOHNNY] It's here!

214
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,666
[plays "The Flea Waltz"]

215
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,333
"The Flea Waltz."
Not exactly original, baby.

216
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,916
[NARRATOR] And so,
time passed as time does.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,875
Until finally, it was
the day before the gig.

218
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,666
It's not coming to me.

219
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,750
There's nothing.

220
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,833
[QT] It seems like this method

221
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,875
might not work
so well, after all.

222
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,083
Maybe it would be
better to cancel the gig.

223
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,458
[DANDY] No, wait. It's coming.

224
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,875
[NARRATOR] Sure enough,
the ambient sounds combined

225
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,625
and gave rise to
a musical miracle.

226
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,833
[JOHNNY] It's here!

227
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
[GROUP] Ooh!

228
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,875
[JOHNNY] Well, there you go.

229
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,625
Just learn it by the
time we go on tomorrow.

230
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,208
Huh?

231
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,875
How do you expect us to learn
something like that so quickly?

232
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,666
[QT] We've been practicing.

233
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,916
We've had extra time
lately for some reason.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
[MEOW] So?

235
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,250
Yeah. That'll do.
Rock on, you guys.

236
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,958
[GENERAL 20A] We have
an update, Commander.

237
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,708
We have evidence
that the Gogol Empire

238
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,250
is preparing to dock the
C.O.R.E. for inspection.

239
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,458
[GENERAL 20B] Indeed?

240
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,125
What part of this is
firm evidence, exactly?

241
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,166
[JOHNNY] What is that?

242
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,458
[GENERAL 20A] It's a dummy
constructed of plywood.

243
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,875
Our sources indicate
the Gogol plan is to use

244
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,833
this to fool us while they
conduct the inspection.

245
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,708
[GENERAL 20B] If that is
what we were up against,

246
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,458
I can't imagine we would
have any trouble defeating it.

247
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,458
[GENERAL 20A] Commander,
what are your orders?

248
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,875
[NARRATOR] And so, after
what felt like years of waiting,

249
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,208
the day of the
first gig arrived.

250
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,666
Only three in the audience?

251
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,500
[QT] There are more
than that in the band.

252
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,125
Hold on, now.
You never know.

253
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,958
There might be someone
from the industry here.

254
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,833
That's not very likely.

255
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,166
[QT] Are you talking
about a scout or something?

256
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,458
[JOHNNY] Yeah. I've heard
they check out clubs like this.

257
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,708
Scoping out raw
talent, you know?

258
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,291
See that old man back there?

259
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,833
He could be a scout, huh?

260
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,958
[NARRATOR] What they didn't
realize was that the old man

261
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,750
wasn't a member of the audience.

262
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,500
He was the club janitor.

263
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,833
Right. Let's do this.

264
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:20,250
[plays rock song]

265
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,000
[NARRATOR] Their very first gig.

266
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,125
]It may not have been
how they'd imagined it,

267
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,875
but in a way,
it was a landmark event.

268
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,000
Because even though
they had only one song

269
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,208
in their repertoire,
they managed to play

270
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,000
for two full hours.

271
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,458
We can play all night, baby.

272
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,416
Next up on the set list
is our new song again--

273
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,458
Don't do it!

274
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,500
If you play that
damn song once more.

275
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,416
[DANDY] Shut up!

276
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,791
[NARRATOR] The fight that broke
out following this initial gig

277
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,125
made the news and soon
went viral, which, in turn,

278
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,125
gave the band some
much-needed publicity.

279
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,416
[NARRATOR] Their fame
continued to grow.

280
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
Until they finally
came to the notice

281
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,750
of a large record label's CEO.

282
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,416
Howdy fellas.
Would you guys be the Dropkix?

283
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,583
Us?

284
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,375
What if we are?
You got somethin' to say?

285
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,333
How's a recording contract
with my company sound?

286
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,375
You guys have
potential to be big.

287
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,666
Number one in the galaxy.

288
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,208
We have some conditions.

289
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,458
We know we want our first big
show to be at Space Budokan.

290
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,916
That's non-negotiable.

291
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,041
And then there's

292
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,083
our debut single to
consider, as well.

293
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,166
We want it to come with
a special bonus pennant.

294
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,125
Hey! What's with
the damn flag again?

295
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,416
I thought we
decided on a sticker?

296
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,250
Hey, no problem!
We'll do both!

297
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,666
Huh?

298
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,250
[CEO] Right, boys?

299
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,333
[QT] Huh?

300
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,708
I think neither
would've been better.

301
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,208
[DJ] This next song has really
been climbing the charts.

302
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,416
New to the music scene,
it's the Dropkix.

303
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,375
July 7th.

304
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,125
That's the day we've
lined up for your big debut.

305
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,083
And, obviously, it's going
to be at Space Budokan.

306
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,541
[GENERAL 20A] Commander!

307
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,750
We've finally learned
the exact date

308
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,041
of the Gogol Empire's
C.O.R.E. inspection.

309
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,791
It will be July 7th!

310
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,083
What? July 7th?

311
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,750
[GENERAL 20B]
And the intel is solid?

312
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,750
[GENERAL 20A]
Yes, as solid as it gets.

313
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:12,208
That day is our chance to
launch a full-scale offensive.

314
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:13,958
[GENERAL 20A] Commander!

315
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,291
[GENERAL 20B] Quiet!

316
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,458
The commander is conflicted,
can't you see that?

317
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,041
If we start a war,
many lives will be lost.

318
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,958
The commander
can't decide lightly.

319
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,541
He knows that the fate of the
galaxy hangs in the balance.

320
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,833
[NARRATOR] It's true that
Commander Johnny was conflicted.

321
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,500
[NARRATOR] Should he
launch an all-out invasion

322
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,708
of the Gogol Empire?

323
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,916
Or should he play
in his band's big gig?

324
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:43,833
War, or gig.
Gig, or war. He chose.

325
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,666
Something's come up, guys.

326
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,041
I can't make it to the show.

327
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:47,625
[MEOW] No!

328
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,833
Huh?

329
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,666
Sorry.

330
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,833
Hold on. Wait a sec!

331
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,666
Something's going on.

332
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,125
What gives? Come on, man.
We were gonna be the best!

333
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,416
We were gonna change
the very face of music!

334
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,541
[QT] Is it your job?
Did they call you in?

335
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,541
You guys...
You guys just don't get it.

336
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,083
Then why
don't you help us to.

337
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,875
About my job,
I'm the commander-in-chief.

338
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,916
Uh?

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,250
I am the supreme commander
of the Jaicro Empire!

340
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,041
In my real life,
I'm powerful.

341
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,666
I have it all: the rank, the
fame, the money. That and more.

342
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,666
But I wanted to be
recognized for my music.

343
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,416
I wanted to see how far
I could make it on talent alone.

344
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,958
Sorry I lied to you.

345
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,041
What kind of
blind idiot are you?

346
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,791
Do you actually think it
matters if you're rich or poor?

347
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,000
Nobody gives a damn about

348
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,541
that stuff once you're
on stage, you moron!

349
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,791
Go on and admit it:
you're just scared.

350
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,333
You got scared and
you're running away!

351
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,625
You can believe
whatever you want to,

352
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,041
but I know that the future
of the Empire is in my hands!

353
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,125
Damn that guy.

354
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,916
What was all that
commander-in-chief stuff?

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,458
Seemed like a big deal.

356
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,958
Maybe he's a manager at the
security company he works for?

357
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,333
Our guitarist?
A manager? So not rock.

358
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,291
[NARRATOR] And then,
it was upon them.

359
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,291
The day of their debut concert
at Space Budokan had arrived.

360
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,000
[QT] We were supposed
to start a long time ago.

361
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,625
The crowd's getting restless.

362
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,458
I really don't think Johnny
is going to make it, you guys.

363
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,125
[MEOW] What should we do?

364
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Johnny
and his fleet were headed

365
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,375
for the Gogol Empire
and galactic conquest.

366
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,500
[QT] We're kind of
out of time here.

367
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,750
Maybe we can stall them

368
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,000
with some magic tricks
or jokes or something.

369
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,875
[QT] Two words: Jazz Odyssey.

370
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:11,000
[DANDY] Right. I'll just have
to go on with my voice guitar.

371
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:20,041
[badly mimics guitar sounds]

372
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,250
[MEOW] It hurts to look!

373
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,416
[QT] I can't take
much more of this!

374
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,291
[DJ] The band you've been
hearing so much about

375
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,208
is finally going to
take the stage today!

376
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,500
[GENERAL 20A] We'll reach the
target location before long.

377
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:40,708
[badly mimics guitar sounds]

378
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,333
It's incredible.

379
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,625
Who knew Dandy
had so much heart?

380
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,375
[QT] A true performer
knows the show must go on!

381
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,041
That's enough, son.

382
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,458
I'm afraid there's nothing
more you can do here.

383
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,041
Attention.

384
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,083
It pains me to announce this,
but it seems I have no choice.

385
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
the concert is--

386
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,958
Huh?

387
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,166
[GENERAL 20A] Commander,
we await your order.

388
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,458
Wait, where is the
commander? Did he leave?

389
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,875
What's that thing?

390
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,291
[QT] A shooting star?

391
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,666
Uh...

392
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,916
Had to make an entrance.

393
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,458
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

394
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,416
What a show off.

395
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,833
I'm not surprised, you know.

396
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,041
Yeah, I know.

397
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,916
You're the one
who started all this.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,500
There wouldn't be
a band without you.

399
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,333
Actually, you started it.

[NARRATOR] And so
the Dropkix first concert

423
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,166
was also their last,

424
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,375
and, as they had said from
the beginning, it was legendary.

425
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,125
[UNDERLING 20A]
What should we do?

426
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,625
[GENERAL 20A] We have no choice.
Jaicro Space Armada, retreat!

you do with t-shirts?

431
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,125
Or, we could send 'em to Johnny
and let him deal with them.

432
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,041
[QT] Just one problem with that.

We don't know where he lives.

remembered only as

00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,041

broke up after just one gig.

asleep for an hour or a day,

470
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,333
uncertain if the fuzzy
memories of the night

471
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,541
before had all
just been a dream.

472
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,916
The next episode
sort of feels like that.

473
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,250
"A World with No Sadness, Baby"!
