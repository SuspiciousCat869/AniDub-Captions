Space Dandy.

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,583
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,166
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,250
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,333
These are the
spectacular adventures

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:35,333
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

[sounds of cooking]
[bustling crowds and talk]

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,083
Can we please figure out
where we're gonna eat now?

9
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,916
Lemme guess,
you wanna get fish?

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,083
[MEOW] I really don't care;

11
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,875
I'm so hungry,
everything sounds delicious.

12
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,625
Look, I get
that you're a cat,

13
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,750
but there's a ton of
good food that's not fish.

14
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
First of all, I just said I
didn't care where we ate;

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,208
second: I'm not a cat,

16
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,208
and third: tell me you're
not starving, too.

17
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,041
[QT] You realize Dandy has a
rather limited appetite, right?

18
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,916
He's only ever hungry for
waitresses with humungous tips.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,875
Hey, not true; why would
I care about that?

20
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,333
You know what really
matters to me...

21
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,708
[MEOW] Booty.
[DANDY] ...booty.

22
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,916
[QT] Are you done?

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,708
Don't try to rush me!

24
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,458
Slow and steady
wins the race, baby.

[starting trumpet]

26

[DANDY] Bam!

27
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,458
[DANDY] I know.

28
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,708
Mister Teleporter is pretty
cool, don't you think?

29
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,791
Yeah, this bad boy
is like a flashlight,

30
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,375
except anything its beam shines

31
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,208
on gets teleported somewhere.

32
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,166
You may thank me.

33
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,958
You were supposed
to buy food,

34
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,083
not random crap!

35
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,583
Shut your
fish hole, cat.

36
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,666
With this, we'll do things,

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,041
and then some more things
and other stuff will happen.

38
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,791
And after that, we'll be able
to eat as much as we want.

39
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,500
[MEOW] You're
so predictable!

40
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,166
I bet you only bought
it 'cause the sales girl

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,333
had a good rack, a tiny
waist, and a huge butt!

42
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,750
Hey, she had
a nice smile, too.

43
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,375
[QT] To be fair,
she was Dandy's ideal.

44
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,041
Dontcha know the story
of the straw millionaire?

45
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,416
Yeah, me either,
but you get the idea.

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,375
[QT] Do we, though?

47
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,875
The gist is that
good things come

48
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,916
to those who just chill.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,375
Man, old timey people were
good at old timey talkin'.

50
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,750
[MEOW] I don't think
you get how hungry I am!

[DANDY] Hmm.

[DANDY] Hmm?

54
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,541
Well, this is
somethin' different.

00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,500
Sorry to tell ya, baby,
charades isn't really my thing.

73
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,208
[QT] Is he dancing?

74
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,333
[MEOW] Looks like
calisthenics to me.

75
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,041
[QT] No, I think
he's playing charades.

76
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
[MEOW] I wonder what
he's trying to say.

77
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,375
[QT] I dunno.
Think that means four words?

78
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,250
[MEOW] Could be something
about crab claws.

this slipping over

See, even when
you're in trouble,

00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,208
just lie back and wait
for the good things, baby.

00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,500
And here we go.

00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,708
So I'm thinkin' you
must be pretty rare.

96
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,583
Wanna come with me
to Alien Registration

97
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,375
and make yourself known?

98
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,041
[MEOW] So, were you
able to figure out

99
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,333
where Dandy ended up
being teleported?

100
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,916
[QT] According to
the GPS on his phone,

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,083
he's on a planet
called Pushy Boyfriend.

102
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,250
[MEOW]
That's really far.

103
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,000
[QT] That flashlight
could get us there.

104
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,333
But then the person holding
it wouldn't be able to go.

105
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,750
And, we couldn't get back here

106
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,833
if we didn't have
the beam of light.

107
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,208
Unfortunately, it just
isn't powerful enough

108
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,791
to shine on the whole ship.

109
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,250
Now that you mention it,

110
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,166
the light already seems a
little dimmer than before.

111
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,708
[QT] Maybe it says somewhere
how much energy is remaining.

112
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,958
What are these things?

113
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,000
[QT] Oh. Those are
old-style batteries;

114
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,791
I don't think they're
even sold anymore.

115
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,333
Aw, come on!

116
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,791
I'm too hungry for
science right now!

117
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,000
[MEOW] I wonder.

118
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,041
[QT]
You wonder what?

119
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,291

and slow as usual.

Man, this is why
I should've stuck

130
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,750
with my slow and steady vibe.

[BEA] Dr. Gel.
Excellent news, sir.

135
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,083
I've found him.

136
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,083
Don't you say you've
found him every week?

137
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,125
[BEA] Yes, but I am
confident this time.

138
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,375
Good. I'm coming
for you, Dandy!

139
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,708
So, long story short.

140
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,541
You came from another planet
to investigate this one,

141
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,666
with the encouragement
of your people.

142
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,750
But your rocket crashed
so you couldn't go back.

143
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,500
And now, ten years have passed

144
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,416
without you being able
to contact anyone?

145
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,250
That about it?

146
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,416
[squeashy sounds]

147
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,750
[CARPACCIO]
For the most part.

148
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,000
Dude, that fish guy is
a genuine unregistered alien.

149
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,791
My translator even
had a hard time

150
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,708
figuring out his
language at first.

151
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,166
I can't take it.

152
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,541
I'm so hungry
at this point,

153
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,875
when I look at him
all I see is dinner.

154
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,125
He promised to go to the
Alien Registration Center

155
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,250
with us as long
as we help him out.

156
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,625
Just hang in there
a little bit longer.

157

[CARPACCIO] Can you
believe I've been studying

158
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,416
this planet alone for ten years?

159
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,000
[CARPACCIO] There are
caves branching out

160
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,333
in the middle of the planet.

161
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,666
They were created by
the roots of a giant tree

162
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,875
and left behind when
the tree caught on fire.

163
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,375
Since then, evidence I've
collected shows the surface

164
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,416
has been charred
every thousand years,

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,791
so it can be inferred
a sun-like star

166
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,583
with the same cycle must come

167
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,000
into contact with this world.

168
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,041
Planet Girlfriend,
my home planet,

169
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,458
has been a satellite of this
one for several hundred years.

170
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,208
[CARPACCIO] It's been
just over a thousand years

171
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,625
since the last time the
surface here was burned,

172
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,250
so the sun could come
again at any minute.

173
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,458
When that happens,
my planet will most likely

174
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,541
not be able to escape
being scorched with it.

175
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,250
With any luck, science continued

176
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:21,125
its progress there and
my people already know.

177
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,166
[CARPACCIO]
But in case it hasn't,

178
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,291
I must go back
to her quickly!

179
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,875
Well, I suppose
we could use

180
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
our beam to zip you over there.

181
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,083
[MEOW] The battery's
almost dead.

182
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,750
You know, we would
if we could, but sorry.

183
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,083
[CARPACCIO]
I have a way back...

184
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,041
This is a boat made from
the wreckage of my rocket.

185
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,958
I plan to use it to
climb the water pillar,

186
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,083
which will take me
directly to my planet.

187
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,500
[MEOW] And why haven't
you done that already?

188
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,416
[CARPACCIO] Because,
I'm not strong enough

189
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,708
to lift it to the surface.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,041
Quit being stingy
and use the beam.

191
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,583
It's not like
it's all that far.

192
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,958
[MEOW] Fine.

193
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:14,208
[MEOW] Uh oh.
The battery's dead!

194
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958
Seems light enough
to carry, now.

195
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,333
We got bigger
things to worry about;

196
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,791
the batteries died!

197
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,125
Aw, man, how will we
get back to the ship?

198
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,041
Why me?

199
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,791
You know,
these look like

200
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,291
the same batteries
we use on my planet.

201
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,541
We can get you as many as
you want once we're there.

202
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,083
[DANDY] It's so light!

203
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,708
[MEOW] What?

204
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,250
It still weighs as much
as a Giant freakin' Panda!

205
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,875
[DANDY] Kinda snarky for
someone who poops in a box.

206
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,500
Plus, think of the
cash we'll get once

207
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,500
we get that guy to
the registration center!

208
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,708
[MEOW] Yeah, well, right now,

209
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,625
I'd be happy if that
piece of walking food

210
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,750
would register himself
inside my stomach.

211
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,000
If this plan succeeds,

212
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,000
you'll be able to eat
anything you want, Meow.

213
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,916
[CARPACCIO] This is it!

214
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,250
[engine engages]

215
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,833
[DANDY] Okay, so how do
ya propose we get up there?

216
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,958
[CARPACCIO] Just like this!

217
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,083
[DANDY] 'Kay-- 

218
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,041
[CARPACCIO] Later, losers!

219
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,500
[DANDY]
Come on!

220
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,375
Oh yeah, there's prob'ly
less gravity up there.

221
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,791
[MEOW cries out]

222
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,875
What a typical cat.

223
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,166
I'm not a cat--I'm
a Betelgeusian!

224
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,625
If you say so.

225
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,041
I'd never do this to a cat,

226
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,000
but I'm sure a Blah-Blah-Geusian
can handle it.

227
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,500
[MEOW] Bad idea!

228
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,875
[DANDY] Do you want to be
stuck on this planet forever?

229
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,208
[MEOW] Right now,
I wouldn't be opposed!

230
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,416
[DANDY] It's not like
there are hot chicks

231
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,416
worth staying here for!

232
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,833
[DANDY] Salty!

233
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,291
[DANDY] Wow!

234
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,125
This joint has been
abandoned for a while.

235
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,833
[MEOW] Shouldn't we go
after that fishy little fish?

236
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,833
Nah. Let's chill
and wait for him here.

237
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,875
Never know, he just
might decide to come back.

238
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,333
[MEOW] This planet has
a lot of weird holes, too.

239
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,375
[MEOW] Um, strange
and shiny town alert.

240
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,458
[CARPACCIO] Yoko!

241
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,083
[CARPACCIO] Yoko. It's me.

242
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,083
I'm finally back
from Pushy Boyfriend!

243
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,375
I even saw an alien.

244
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,333
I know it's hard 
to believe,

245
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,625
but we're not
alone out here!

246
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,416
[YOKO] Like for real?

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,375
[CARPACCIO] It's a huge
anthropological discovery;

248
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,708
the future will
never be the same.

249
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,041
[YOKO] Yeah, so,
after you left,

250
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,625
Planet Girlfriend
totally broke up

251
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,208
with anthro-polo-
science stuff.

252
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,333
Nobody cares about that
boring space business anymore.

253
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,541
[CARPACCIO] Well, at
least now that I'm back

254
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,541
and I've proven myself,

255
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
your parents will
have to accept us!

256
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,625
Minato!

257
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,958
[MINATO] Congrats on
making it back not dead.

258
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,375
But I don't think
your current sitch

259
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,666
has become like completely
clear to you, yet, brah.

260
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,333
It's been
a while since you

261
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,791
chose Pushy Boyfriend
over this hottie.

262
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,916
The truth is we
are so together.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,083
You're still wicked
lame, but we've done

264
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,458
a freakin' lot to stay
looking this amaze-balls.

265
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,666
[YOKO] We've
got grandbabies.

266
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,333
[YOKO] I mean, look
at how good we look;

267
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,125
we've even got
great-great-great grandbabies,

268
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,708
and they're hot.

269
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,458
[CARPACCIO] Listen, there's a
sun heading straight towards us!

270
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,291
My research on Pushy
Boyfriend confirmed it.

271
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,125
We have to leave
this planet, now!

272
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,750
There's no time left!

273
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:29,166
[Minato laughs]

274
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,041
There you go
exaggerationing again.

275
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,958
Someone's got a case of
the jealous of us big time.

276
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,291
Nobody was like into you
on this planet, okay, brah?

277
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,666
That other planet without anyone
on it is more your speed.

278
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,083
To hell with it!

279
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,625
Do you know how hard
I worked to save you?

280
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,250
[MINATO] This guy is ridick.

281
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,250
[CARPACCIO] Listen to me!
You're gonna burn!

282
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,250
The sun is coming. Run away!

283
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,333
The sun is coming; run away!

284
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,916
[FISH KID 16A] Why is
that weirdo like nekkid?

285
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,666
Oh, batteries.
These are the ones!

286
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,333
[MEOW] Dandy, lookit! I got
replacement batteries!

287
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:20,166
See? Hey. Does it seem
way hotter to you?

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,958
[MEOW] So when
did that get bigger?

289
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,416
[CARPACCIO]
They've all gone bad.

290
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,458
They rotted from the inside.

291
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,958
So, you feel like coming
with us now, big guy?

292
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,583
[CARPACCIO] Everyone
on this horrid planet

293
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,291
should just be fried
with a light, salty crust!

294
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,083
We can leave whenever--
Not the hair!

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,916
[CARPACCIO] They should
all be incinerated.

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,958
Every last one of them.

297
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,250
Burn!

298
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,833
[MEOW] Wait! Hot!

299
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,208
[CARPACCIO] Burn me
with them! Sear my flesh!

300
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,541
[MEOW] You don't
have to do this!

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,416
C'mon. Crap, that's hot!

302
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,375
[CARPACCIO] Yoko. Yoko!

303
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,500
And that is what happens
when jealousy flares up.

304
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,916
[DANDY] Is he even worth
bringing back with us?

305
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,541
My turn.

306
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,458
[explosion]

307
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,750
Well, this
sure is awkward.

308
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,541
I've finally
found you, Dandy.

309
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,291
Resign yourself to your fate.

310
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,375
[DR. GEL] Running away are we?

311
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,541

Liberty Beam,
prepare to fire!

314
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,041
[DR. GEL] What's wrong, Bea?

315
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,208
And is it just me, or did
it get really hot in here?

316
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,708
[QT] It certainly appears that
he was an unregistered alien.

317
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,208
Of course, we can't register him

318
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,041
now that he's
basically a grilled fish.

319
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,875
[DANDY] I guess, you know,
we might as well eat him.

320
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,750
Yahoo!

321
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,375
[MEOW] He's delicious!

322
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,833
[DANDY] Hey, what
did I tell ya, baby?

323
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,250
I remember something
along the lines

324
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,375
of that flashlight
gettin' us food.

325
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,416
[QT] Wouldn't it
have been easier

326
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,083
to just buy the food, though?

327
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,458
[MEOW] We wouldn't have
had to almost die that way.

328
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,250
Hey, slow and steady.

329
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,833
That wins the race.
Oh, you know me, baby.

330
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,958
If not, you want to.
