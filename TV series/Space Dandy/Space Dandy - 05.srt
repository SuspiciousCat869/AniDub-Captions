[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,500
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,958
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,625
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,041
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,625
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,708
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,666
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,583
[MEOW]
Terrible.

10
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,166
All these famous alien hunters.

11
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,041
[QT] Made to look like the
biggest fools who ever lived.

12
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,875
[MEOW] Seriously, though.
These Gentooans

13
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,916
can't really be
that scary, can they?

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,583
[QT] Hard to know when all
you can see is an antenna.

15
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,041
[MEOW] Yeah. I guess it's
all worth it, though, huh,

16
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,916
for an eight million
woolong reward.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,416
[QT]
Dandy only bothered to listen

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
to half the story
before he took off.

19
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,500
I hope he's not outmatched.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey, QT.

21
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,625
Is it just me,
or's the room slanting?

22
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,666
No, it couldn't be.

23
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,458
I think it's just you.

24
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,750
[MEOW] Well, wouldn't
be the first time.

[MEOW and QT laugh]

26
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,333
All right, Gentooan!
You're mine now!

27
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,541
A little kid?

28
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,750
Hey, uh... You cool, kid?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,125
Did the big bad
Gentooan get ya?

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
Huh?

31

[PENGUIN]
Wah?

32
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,541
[NARRATOR] Now might be
a good time to explain:

33
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,583
Gentooans possess
the unique ability

34
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,291
to capture another
being's consciousness

35
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,916
and transfer it into
the body of a toy puppet.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,791
Like this space penguin here.

37
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,833
[PENGUIN growls]

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,375
Wahhh!!

39
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,875
Ah...!

40
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,083
[NARRATOR] Normally, a
Gentooan's victim is too

41
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,291
overcome with embarrassment
to put up a fight.

42
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,291
But Dandy has never been
one to sweat the small stuff.

43
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:46,041
[PENGUIN, singing]
Wak wak wak wak wak...

44
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,041
[DANDY, singing] The boobies
at Boobies go up and down,

45
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,958
up and down, up and down.

46
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,500
The boobies at--

47
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,583
Oh, hey. I'm back
in my own body.

48
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,583
Hey... Great...

49
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,083
That's the power
of boobies, baby.

50
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,541
Even just singin' about
'em makes miracles happen.

51
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,500
Idiot.

52
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,791
My power only lasts

53
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,250
for six hundred sixty-six
seconds, once a day.

54
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,833
That's fascinating.

55
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,666
So I guess that means you're all
tapped out for a little while?

56
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,791
See, kid, I'm an alien hunter

57
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,750
and I'm gonna take you on
a field trip to get registered.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Hey, don't look at me like
I'm the scum of the cosmos.

59
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,125
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

Gone! Gone! Gone!

Hey, QT! What the hell?

63
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,125
[QT] Oh, hi, Dandy.
Funny story.

64
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,833
Seems we got towed
for a parking violation.

65
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,541
[DANDY]
So, get back here already!

66
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,541
[QT] Yeah, we can't
pay the fine,

67
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,208
so the ship's stuck in impound.

68
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,541
Stupid-ass 'bot.

69
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,000
I've been out
catching a Gentooan,

70
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,000
and you manage to lose the ship?

71
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,250
Okay. So, how about
you take the Gentooan

72
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,125
down to the Alien
Registration Center?

73
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,000
Then we can use the reward money
to get the ship out of impound.

74
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,500
[DANDY]
Stupid-ass cat!

75
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,916
That place is like
majorly far away.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,208
It'll take me days to get there.

77
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,208
[QT] You don't have much
of a choice, do you?

78
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,625
So suck it up and
take public transportation.

79
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,625
Bye!

80
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,791

Hey! Don't hang up on me!

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,041
Huh?

83
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,916
[ADÉLIE] There's someone I
wanna see at this address.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,916
If you swear we can
stop by on the way.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,458
I'll go to the
registration center quietly.

86
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,833
And if I don't
agree to the deal?

He's trying to
make me go with him!

90
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,625
Somebody please help!

91
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,666
[DANDY]
Easy there, kid! Quiet down!

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,083
The bad man's
trying to kidnap me!

93

[DANDY]
Dirty brat.

00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,083
Do we have a deal?

96
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,208
Damn it.
Like I have a choice.

97
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,458
You couldn't at least
pick somewhere on the way?

98
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
[DANDY] We're gonna
need two tickets.

99
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,833
One human adult
and one alien child.

100
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:05,958
I am not a child.

101
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,166
Oh, yeah?

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,416
Two adult tickets!

103
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,375
Do you even know what
adult women look like?

104
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,333
They're the ones with
the big, round boobies

105
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,958
and nice, shapely asses.

106
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,333
Like I said.
Two adults!

107
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,291
What's your name, anyway?

108
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,291
Got any family in these parts?

109
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,375
Okay. Not a very
talkative one, are you?

110
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,458
I'm gonna be straight with you.
I don't like kids.

thought in their heads

away with it just 'cause

they're all young
and cute or whatever.

Far as I'm concerned,

Why's that?

119
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,416
[ADÉLIE] They think
they're smarter

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,916
just because they're older,
they blame the world

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,250
for all of their problems,
and they lie about everything.

122

Far as I'm concerned,
grownups are all jerks.

What the hell? You deaf?

00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,750
got in touch with me yesterday.

323
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,208
I guess he must've
checked around

324
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,708
to see where I'd moved to.

325
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,791
One way or another, he was
able to track down my number.

326
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,083
He did that?

327
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,750
Frozen tangerines make a great
traveling snack, you know.

328
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,791
[ADÉLIE]
Okay.

329
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,166
Well, see ya.

330
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,958
You two have a
good life together.

331
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,333
We're not going to
the registration center?

332
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,125
Nah. Never mind that.

333
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,875
But what about all that money?

334
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,750
Eh...

335
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,375
I'll just find another alien.

336
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,125
Can't be too hard.

337
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,583
You be good, okay?

338
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,333
Ciao.

339
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,541
Dandy, hold on!

340
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah?

341
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,208
Do you think I... Could I crew
for you on the Aloha Oe?

342
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,583
Don't be stupid, kid.

343
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,625
We don't take whiny
little brats aboard my ship.

344
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,583
Well, maybe once I'm grown up?

345
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,833
Yeah. If you grow up
into a big-breasted,

346
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,333
curvy-assed woman,
then we can talk.

347
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,583
Idiot.

348
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,875
Adélie.

349
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,125
[ADÉLIE]
I'll do it.

350
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,166
I'm gonna grow up
quick, you'll see.

351
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,958
And then, I'll hunt you down.

352
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,958
[NARRATOR] Which is more
important to clothe:

353
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,125
the chest or the buttocks?

354
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,000
Next time,
a philosophical treatment

355
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,333
of this timeless topic.

356
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,041
"The War of the Undies
and Vests, Baby."


357
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,416
[QT] That's what
the episode is about?


358
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,958
[NARRATOR]
We'll see you then!
