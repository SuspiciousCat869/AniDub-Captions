1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,208
[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,666
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,125
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,791
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,208
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,791
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,875
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:43,833
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,125
Rejected.

10
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,375
Rejected.

11
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,666
Rejected. Rejected.

12
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,208
Rejected.

13
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,416
Rejected. Rejected.

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,166
Rejected.

15
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,291
Now, who's next?

16
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,833
A guy who just made the
discovery of the century.

17
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,416
That's who's next up!

18
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,875
It wasn't easy, either.

19
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,958
This bad boy fires
beams from its eyes

20
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,625
and flames from what
I think is its mouth.

21
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,708
After managing to
avoid any and everything

22
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,208
that shot out of
those face holes,

23
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,750
I caught this weird
wild cat off guard.

24
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,500
All it took was a
well-placed karate chop.

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,083
[SCARLET] I've never heard
of an alien like that before.

26
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,416
[DANDY]
Hm. No one has.

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,375
Cool. Right, baby?

28
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,541
That's why it's the
discovery of the century!

29
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,333
Rejected.

30
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,458
[MEOW]
I told you so.

31
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,541
Nothing gets past that girl.

32
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,833
[DANDY] Look, if you
hadn't been so clumsy,

33
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,666
we'd all be rolling
in reward money by now!

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,416
But you had to screw the pooch.

35
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
[MEOW] Man, the thought
of money makes me hungry.

36
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,333
[QT] All right,
who's ready to eat?

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,000
[MEOW]
Nice timing!

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,875
[DANDY]
Mm. Ew.

39
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,458
[QT] What? It's space food I got
through the galaxy mail order's

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,750
"Phase Difference
Space Delivery Service."

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
You don't know what
any of that means, do you?

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,500
It came from ten thousand
light-years in the future!

43
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,666
The galaxy mail order is
at the end of the universe,

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,375
so it was beyond cheap.

45
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,458
[DANDY]
Ten thousand light years.

46
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,125
Which means...

47
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,666
This crap expired
ten thousand years ago!

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,625
[MEOW] Technically,
it doesn't say "consume by";

49
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,333
that's only the "sell by" date.

50
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,250
It might still be okay to eat.

51
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,750
[DANDY] Fine, then why
don't you dig in?!

52
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,583
[QT] Have as much as you like;
we've got plenty.

53
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,583
[DANDY]
Gross.

54
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,750
[QT]
They were having a buy one,

55
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,791
get three hundred sixty
five free special.

56
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,791
Couldn't pass that up.

57
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,375
Ugh, no way I'm eating that.

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,791
I guess we'll have to
find refuge in Boobies.

59
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,333
[QT] We don't have
money for Boobies.

60
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,291
Luckily for us, I have
a secret weapon

61
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,500
for just this kind
of predicament.

62
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,208
Check this!

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,291
[MEOW]
Check this, what?

64
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,875
You've filled up
your point card.

65
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,708
Your next visit's on us!

66
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,250
You see, we may be poor as hell,

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,708
but we can still enjoy Boobies

68
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,375
as long as we have
this sweater puppy.

69
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,083
[QT] How long have you
been waiting to say that?

70
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,333
Longer than you'd think.

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,333
I've got a point card
for time served

72
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,958
and I am a faithful customer.

73
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,375
With benefits.

74
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,541
[QT] Right, why work when
you can get point cards?

75
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,666
[DANDY]
Watch this.

76
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,041
Never fails to get him.

77
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,333
[QT] You do realize
your precious card expires

78
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,500
at the end of the day.

79
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,125
No. No!

80
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,375
How many hours
are left in "today"?

81
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,833
[QT]
Two hours, thirty minutes.

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,250
Now! Where's the
closest Boobies?!

83
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,875
[QT] There's one in Galaxy
Mexico, District Three.

84
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,333
Then charge the engines.

85
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,375
Two hundred percent!

86
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
Full speed ahead!

87
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,875
[QT] It will take us
at least two hours

88
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,333
and forty minutes to get there.

89
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,333
So, you know, not happening.

90
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,750
Damn it.

91
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,750
We've got no other options left.

92
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,291
We gotta warp.

93
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,416
[MEOW] Wait. Didn't you say
we couldn't use the warp drive

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,708
because it got broken?

95
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,083
So what?
It's times like these

96
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,666
when a man's gotta do
what a man's got to do!

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,958
And this man's got to do!

98
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,500
Hurry up!

99
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
Uh. That's probably
enough pushing.

100
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,000
Ow.

101
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,708
So, anyone know where we are?

102
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,208
[QT]
Analysis finished.

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,666
Location unknown.

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,958
Unable to detect
living organisms.

105
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,125
And Boobies?

106
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,875
[QT] Well, there seems
to be oxygen here.

107
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:15,875
I don't care about oxygen;
I need Boobies, nothing more!

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,500
[MEOW] C'mon, let's
head back to the ship.

109
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,125
We can put out
a distress signal,

110
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
and maybe a rescue party
will come find us;

111
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,583
that sounds like fun, huh?

112
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,125
[DANDY]
No way.

113
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,291
There's a Boobies hiding out
there somewhere, I can feel it.

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,958
[MEOW]
Nope. No Boobies.

115
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,583
Won't find one.

116
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,958
Not today.

117
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,541
[QT] Even if there
isn't a Boobies,

118
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,458
there might be an alien
that has yet to be recorded.

119
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,250
[MEOW] But I thought you said
there were no signs of life.

120
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,250
[DANDY]
What, are you scared?

121
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,208
No. Please don't
start with this.

122
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,125
Who's a pretty
little scaredy cat?

123
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,625
You are!

124
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,625
Betelgeusians don't get scared.

125
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,875
[DANDY] Ha! Yeah, says the
puss shakin' in his boots.

126
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,083
[QT]
Do you know what that was?

127
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,500
[MEOW]
Right. So who's the puss again?

128
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,958
[MAMITAS]
Someone, please!

129
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,083
[DANDY]
Mmm...

130
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,458
Please, help me!

131
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,583
Okay. I'm on this. Ah--

132
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,958
Hey! QT, what are these?

133
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,750
[QT] Gimmie just
a minute on that!

134
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,291
[MEOW] I don't like what's
going on with their face area.

135
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,000
Warning. You're about to
get a taste of Space Dandy!

136
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,500
[QT] Would you
stop doing that?

137
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,125
Why isn't my beam working
against these things?

138
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,125
What's wrong?

139
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,166
Usually you have
to hit them first.

140
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,333
New idea.

141
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,791
Ready or not...

142
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,625
Run away!

143
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,125
[QT] Bummer, those things
have already been recorded.

144
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,791
They're called Ragians,
which doesn't sound pleasant.

145
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,333
[DANDY] So we won't get any
money for bringing them in.

146
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,083
[MEOW] Oh, as if you
could catch one anyway!

147
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,625
[MAMITAS] Um...

148
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,791
Thank you for saving me.

149
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,416
I don't know what
I would have done.

150
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,041
What's your name?

151
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Well, it's Dandy, but-- 

152
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,958
You can call me Meow;
and not to brag,

153
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,333
but did you know that
Betelgeuse holds the record

154
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,375
as the number one
consumer of dried fish flakes

155
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,916
in the known universe?

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,291
No one knows,
and no one cares!

157
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,291
Hi.

158
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,833
[MEOW]
Jerk.

159
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,166
You two are so funny.

160
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,916
[QT] Are you guys petting
yourselves right now?

161
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,833
My name is Mamitas.

162
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,875
I was just finishing
a little shopping trip

163
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,208
when my warp device
malfunctioned.

164
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,583
I got caught in
what must have been

165
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,375
a space-time distortion
and landed here.

166
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:08,041
My ship ended up broken, so I
was trapped all by my lonesome.

167
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,083
No need for cryin'
anymore, baby.

168
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,666
I'll personally make
sure you get home safe.

169
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,458
Unless you'd
rather stay with me.

170
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,125
[QT] What?
The Aloha Oe is broken.

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,000
Mamitas, is your spaceship's
core system higher

172
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,916
than version five
point two, by chance?

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,958
Yeah.

174
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,208
Well, that's good news!

175
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,375
We might be able to repair

176
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,083
the Aloha Oe using
parts from your ship!

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,791
Sir, we have finally been
able to determine his location.

178
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,125
[PERRY]
I will not tolerate failure.

179
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,833
Understood?

180
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,250
[GEL]
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
The Seventh Fleet is currently
surrounding the planet

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,750
on which we found him.

183
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,833
[PERRY]
Wonderful.

184
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,958
Once we capture
that Space Dandy,

185
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,416
the universe will belong

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,250
to the Gogol Empire and
the Gogol Empire alone!

187
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,541
[PERRY laughs]

188
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,416
[MAMITAS]
My spaceship is over there.

189
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,583
[MEOW] Boo, mouth
faces are in the way.

190
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,708
[DANDY] They've got spunk,
I'll give 'em that.

191
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,666
[MAMITAS] I can show
you how to go around.

192
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,916
It's a lot easier.

193
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,500
[GEL] The commander and I will
land on the planet together.

194
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,291
Then, we'll capture him.

195
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,166
[BEA] Doctor, there's
a bit of a problem.

196
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,375
A rather nasty alien

197
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,625
is inhabiting that
planet at the moment.

198
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,833
[GEL]
What?

199
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,208
They're kind of what
you'd call terrifying

200
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,833
because they kind of eat
everything they run into.

201
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,041
[QT] Well, it's older
than I thought,

202
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,125
but there are a number of
parts that still look useable.

203
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,333
[MAMITAS]
So, you're an alien-hunter?

204
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,916
How exciting!

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,416
It's not a big deal.

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,958
Although, some people do
consider me a touch reckless.

207
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,666
[MEOW] This is off-topic,
but are you a picky eater?

208
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,250
It's okay if you are.

209
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,333
I'll eat practically anything.

210
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,916
[MEOW]
You mean, you're omnivorous?

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,041
No way; me too!

212
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,708
That's so cool!

213
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,166
[HONEY] You've filled
out your point card.

214
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,375
Your next visit will be on us!

215
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,208
Check this.

216
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,750
Do ya see how he's a cat?

217
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,541
[HONEY] Oh, no! Your points
are only good for another hour!

218
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you even listening to me?

219
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,916
Hurry up and get here already!

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,791
[DANDY]
Crap, I forgot, baby!

221
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,833
Get it together, Meow;
we've gotta get out of here.

222
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,291
[BEA]
See, look at this.

223
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,583
It's the Deathgerian, the alien
that's topped the list

224
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,166
of "Aliens I Don't
Want to Be Eaten By"

225
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,625
for twelve years straight!

226
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,166
When you meet one, that's it.

227
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,166
They're gonna eat
you till you're dead.

228
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,791
They're that serious?

229
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,583
[BEA]
As moon dust in your underpants.

230
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,208
[VOICE] Doctor, all
ships are in position!

231
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,416
[GEL]
Withdraw, Seventh Fleet!

232
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,500
It was a close call.

233
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,000
If there's an alien
I don't want to be eaten by,

234
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,083
it's got to be this one.

235
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,416
Come to Dandy!

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,541
[QT]
Hooray, I found it!

237
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,333
As long as we
have this little guy,

238
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,250
the Aloha Oe might
start working again!

239
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,041
Hey. Where'd those two go?

240
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,166
No one out-dandies Space Dandy.

241
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,583
Still here and still disgusting.

242
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,625
Spunk only goes so far.

243
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,458
Sorry.

244
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,083
You lose!

245
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
The battery is dead?

246
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,541
This is so full of suck!

247
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,666
[QT] Based on the whole
"us not being dead yet" thing,

248
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,916
I think they might be
trying to communicate.

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,958
Use your space translator to
see if they're saying something.

250
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,625
You must return home
before it's too late!

251
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,916
This world's dangerous; the
Deathgerian will eat you all!

252
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
Deathgeriwhat?

253
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,291
It is a horrible creature
that has targeted

254
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,833
and eaten everyone who
has landed on this planet;

255
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,875
you must leave, immediately!

256
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,541
Yeah, you fools get
all up in our face

257
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,375
with your fancy guns
that don't have batteries

258
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,625
when we just tryin' to warn you

259
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,916
about what's about
to go down, bro.

260
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,166
[QT] Okay, so it looks like
these aliens are weird,

261
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,958
but they're not as
bad as we thought.

262
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,666
Maybe.

263
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,833
Where's the Deathgerian? Talk!

264
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,458
Apologies; I'm not
sure what you mean.

265
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,666
[QT]
Huh?

266
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,750
[ALIEN] Look, y'all
have been fraternizing

267
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,333
with that monster
since you landed.

268
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,583
And you know what, son?

269
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,333
She about to get real,
real hungry up in here.

270
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,750
[ALIEN] Run! Deathgerians
turn into monsters

271
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,125
when they are ready to dine.

272
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,208
[ALIEN]
Well, good luck.

273
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,291
We'll get out of
your poufy hair, now.

274
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,666
[DANDY] Why's it always
gotta be the hot ones?

275
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,000
[MAMITAS] Cat?

276
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,541
Cat...

277
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,083
Cat? No.

278
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,500
Come on; you can't believe
what Space Dandy says.

279
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,625
I've never eaten cat.

280
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,750
[MEOW]
Cool.

281
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,375
I'm not one, though.

282
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,333
Like not technically.

283
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,625
Mamitas?

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Meow! Meow, come over here.

285
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,666
I gotta tell you somethin'!

286
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,083
It's really important!

287
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,583
[MEOW]
No, I don't want any!

288
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,125
[DANDY]
She's a booby monster!

289
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,625
Run!

290
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,083
[MEOW]
I'm gone!

291
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,375
[MEOW] Will someone
please at least try

292
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,166
to get up here
and save me already?!

293
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,750
[DANDY]
Meow! I'm coming!

294
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,166
[QT] The repairs
aren't finished yet!

295
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,375
[DANDY] Sounds like time
for the Little Aloha!

296
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,708
Lei me!

297
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,291
[QT] So, are you gonna
try to save Meow?

298
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,625
There's a chance he might not
be completely digested yet.

299
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,000
[DANDY] Farewell,
my dear friend Meow.

300
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,375
I shall never forget you.

301
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,208
[QT] Wait. Where's
the Boobies Point Card?

302
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,125
Doesn't Meow still have it?

303
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,791
[DANDY]
That idiot!

304
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,458
Lucky for him, Space Dandy
doesn't abandon his friends!

305
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,125
[QT] You mean like just now?

306
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,708
What's with this Deathwawhosit?

307
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,166
[QT] When hungry, they transform
into monsters, as we can see,

308
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,000
and then they try to eat
everything around them,

309
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,416
as we can also see.

310
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,666
Then maybe we
should transform, too.

311
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,666
[QT]
What?

312
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,916
[DANDY]
Let's use it.

313
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,916
You know what I'm talkin' about.

314
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,208
[QT]
No, I don't.

315
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,750
[DANDY]
Change!

316
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,500
Hawaii-Yankee!

317
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,666
[QT] What? How did I not
know we could do this?

318
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,291
Oh, yeah!
Bring it on!

319
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,916
[DANDY]
Take this!

320
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,375
[DANDY]
Uh oh.

321
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,750
[QT] I wonder what
that's all about.

322
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,958
[DANDY]
Huh?

323
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,250
[DANDY] I get it. She ate
your expired space food.

324
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,708
It's totally making her sick.

325
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,250
[QT]
Oh.

326
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,000
[DANDY]
Open wide!

327
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,416
[DANDY]
Want more?

328
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,958
Dig in!

329
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,250
[QT] See. Now aren't
you glad I ordered them?

330
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,958
[SCARLET]
Accepted.

331
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,958
Yeah!

332
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,333
[QT]
Seriously?

333
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,625
The reward was ninety-nine
thousand woolongs?

334
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,125
We may have lost the point card,

335
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,250
but with this much money,

336
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,166
we can pay for all
the Boobies we want.

337
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,708
[QT] Wait, are you sure we
only lost the point card?

338
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,750
I feel like we're missing
something else, too.

339
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,875
[DANDY]
Uh-- Huh...

340
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,833
[DANDY] Neshtime on
Spash Lanly, uh...

341
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,875
[QT]
What are you saying?

342
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,875
You're not making real words.

343
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,458
[MEOW]
Hey guys; what's the dealy-yo?

344
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:20,916
[ALL] Next time: "Sometimes You
 Can't Live With Dying, Baby."
