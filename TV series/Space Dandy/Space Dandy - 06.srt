[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,833
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,291
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,958
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,333
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,916
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,958
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,916
[QT] How am I supposed to clean
with you lounging there?

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,250
[DANDY] Clean? Whaddya talking
about? This is perfect.

11
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,541
[QT]
It looks pretty grimy to me.

12
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,083
[DANDY] Go deal with your
own room, why don't ya?

13
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,458
[QT] I've already scrubbed
it down 12 times today.

14
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,666
Well then, what
about Meow's room?

15
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,083
[QT] Have you looked in
there lately, Dandy?

16
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

17
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,000
[DANDY] Whatever
pings your hardware.

18
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,333
[QT]
Oh, those need a good dusting.

19
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,375
Hey, what's the deal
with those surfboards?

20
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,541
They look legit but I've
never seen you bust one out.

21
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,875
[QT] Maybe he's what they call
a "shubee," in surfing lingo.

22
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,833
[MEOW] You mean those
poseurs who only buy boards

23
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,791
'cause they wanna look cool?

24
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,875
[QT and MEOW laugh]

25
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,416
The hell I do!

26
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,333
I'm a kahuna.

27
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,500
And kahunas don't waste their
precious time on ankle-biters!

28
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,958
I wait for the mondo waves,

29
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,666
the out-of-this-world
swells that touch the sky.

30
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,625
That's what my heart longs for.

31
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,958
That thrill.

32
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,625
It's all that comes close
to recapturing the magic

33
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,250
of that one perfect
endless summer.

34
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
[QT]
Oh, that sounds like a story.

35
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,000
Did some hotdogger
bogart your betty?

36
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,125
Nah, nothin' like that.

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,291
[QT]
Huh?

38
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,500
So, that "perfect
endless summer" was--?

39
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,250
I pulled it outta my butt.

40
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,583
Shoulda known.

41
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
[QT]
That is par for the course.

42
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,083
Attention, we have
arrived at our destination.

43
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,625
[NARRATOR] Behold, the
remains of Planet Eden.

44
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,625
It was a real garden
spot 10,000 years ago.

45
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,958
"Garden spot"? Really?

46
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:44,541
Anyway, it got blown all to
hell, and only its moon remains.

47
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,666
[QT] Unconfirmed data
of an indeterminate age

48
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,166
suggests that unregistered
aliens may live here... or not.

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,875
And all these maybes
are the best you can do?

50
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,916
Hey, you guys? What's that
cloud thingie ahead?

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,125
We're waiting!

52
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,791
[QT] I forgot to
mention it, but this moon

53
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
is covered in huge geysers.

54
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,416
They erupt into the surrounding
atmosphere at random intervals.

55
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
Why didn't you say so earlier?

56
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,416
[QT] Because, there
was something else

57
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,750
I was going to tell you first.

58
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,750
[MEOW] Something about
missiles, maybe?

59
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
[QT] Oh, yeah.
The inhabitants of this moon

60
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,250
have been at war
for 10,000 years,

61
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,375
and have established
no-fly zones.

62
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,083
I'm not sure how that
slipped my mind, but--

63
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you broken or
do you just hate us?

64
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,458
[MEOW and DANDY scream]

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,375
[MEOW] I dunno what they've been
fighting for all this time.

66
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,000
The place looks deserted.

67
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,375
[QT] The Aloha Oe has
sustained a lot of damage.

68
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,958
It's going to take me
a while to repair it.

69
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,750
Well, since it's such a
pain to get down here...

70
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,958
I bet this place is chock
full of unregistered aliens.

71
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,125
Here goes!

72
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,708
Oof-- Ahh...

73
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,750
That's exactly
what I meant to do!

74
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,250
Have fun tracking 'em down!

75
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,625
Nice try, furball, but
you're going out there, too!

76
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,541
[DANDY]
Chill, Dandy.

[nonverbal alien noises]

78
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,541
Gah!

79
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,458
"On a barren desert
planet." No reception?

80
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,333
Big surprise there.

81
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,333
Huh?

00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,000
[MEOW]
Aahhh!

84
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,916
[QT] I wonder how long
those two are going

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,833
to keep goofing off out there.

86
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,083
[nonverbal alien noises]

87
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,666
[DANDY] Oh, whoa!
Time-out! Time-out! Whoa!

88
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,458
I know I'm irresistible,
but you gotta quit it! Ahh!

89
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,875
C'mon, baby, at least
buy me dinner first!

[nonverbal alien noises]

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,166
What the--? Hey,
what're you doing, man?

97
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,166
Leave my family
Betel-jewels alone!

98
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,166
Not cool!

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,000
[nonverbal alien noises]

100
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,041

[translator rings]

103
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,291
The thing I try to speak is

104
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,666
because you are the
wearing of the undies,

105
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,416
I am not having to
kill you to death.

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,625
Because of the undies,

107
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,000
I know you trusting
is very goodness idea.

108
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,166
Isn't undie-wearing
kinda universal?

109
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,916
You say the falseness!

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,666
The other ones not wear undies,

111
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,458
but always are have
horrible vests on the bodies!

112
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,458
Is a terri-bad sight to see!

113
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,625
They cover tops,

114
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,833
but buttocks are
flipping around in breeze!

115
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,916
Is much scandalous!

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
You are the wearing of the vest

117
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,708
and none of blasphemous undies!

118
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,041
Trusting you this means I can!

119
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,291
"Vest," huh?

120
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,208
I always thought it was
a sarong, but whatever.

121
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,541
Mean-wild, the Barbarell-ic
Undies go every-the-place

122
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,000
with their chesticles on display

123
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,416
and wear only the
stupid under-clothes!

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,458
That's why we do
the killing of them!

125
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,458
I caught enough of that to be
glad I don't rock the skivvies.

126
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,416
So, you've been rumbling

127
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,166
with these "Vestian"
cats all this time, huh?

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,458
Put your eyeballs on the floor.

129
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,333
As you are observation
from delightful fresco,

130
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,583
our peoples are fighting a
warfare since ten thousands ago.

131
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,625
In days of spore,
we are having hundreds

132
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,541
and thousands of undie-comrades.

133
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:23,750
But they perish in combats until
I am final one to be living.

134
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,166
[VESTIAN]
After much blood-sheddery,

135
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,791
I am the last Vestian
to still be the alive.

136
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,125
Hey, you wanna do a brother
a solid and mosey on over

137
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,041
to the Alien Registration
Center, maybe? Eh?

138
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,416
"Mosey on"?

139
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,333
Sure. We take a quick little
joyride in my spaceship

140
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,750
and get your
gorgeous mug registered.

141
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,166
Huh?

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,583
C'mon! Live a little!

143
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,416
We'll zip on over
and get you registered,

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,125
it'll be over before
you know it!

145
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,666
"Registered"?

146
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,541
No registering of the mug.

147
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,125
If I am leaving of here
even for little bits,

148
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,458
those Vestian bastard
people win the war. So...

149
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,708
It'll be over in a flash!

150
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,208
The Vesties won't even know!

151
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,458
But if I go from here,
in mine absence

152
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,041
the Undies side will
make winning the war.

153
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,083
No way the war's gonna
end in the little bit

154
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,000
of time it takes, I promise!

155
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,083

Huh? "Final duel"?

161
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,791
Hey! Maybe you
oughta register first!

162
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,000
[UNDIE]
You are much cowardice,

163
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,083
bring-a-ling other person to
assistance in our sacred fight!

164
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,750
Very the thing
I expectorate from Vestian!

165
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,250
Judging not good idea!

166
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,875
You bring other, so no act
all high and meaty, hypocrite!

167
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,208
Hey, uh, Dandy.

168
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,666
Care to tell me why you're
not wearing any pants?

169
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,041
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,583
I'm wearing the only kind of
pants that matter, dude.

What the--?

173
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,083
This will finally be the day

174
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,375
when I am shredding that
ugly vest into ugly ribbons!

175
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,291
Wrongness! This is day when I am
ripping your undies asunder!

Ah! It is buzzer!

181
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,333
For now, all the
fighting shall be this.

182
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,000
I let you off with
the easiness today!

183
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,125

Heh.

[MEOW chuckles]

185
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
Not too shabby, cat.

00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,416
Right back atcha.

187
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,416
Huh?

188
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,250
[DANDY] Hey, hey!
Just chill out already!

189
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:34,250
[DANDY and MEOW scream]

190
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,166
[QT]
So, let me get this straight.

191
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,250
You've both made contact
with a different type

192
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,833
of unregistered alien
living on this moon?

193
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,041
What stellar news!

194
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,208
Yeah, for you!

195
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,958
I'd be dead if
I'd gone commando!

196
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,458
Yeah! I mean, it's
all well an' good,

197
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,875
'cause I don't wear pants,

198
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,875
but what if I had
decided to start today?

199
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,708
[QT] Well, as soon as
repairs are complete,

200
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,208
let's take them both
to get registered.

201
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,541
[DANDY]
About that.

202
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,625
My little underpants friend
told me he's staying

203
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,041
right where he is until
he wins this fashion war.

204
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,250
Yeah, the vest dude
told me the same thing.

205
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,916
No victory, no dice.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
You're on camera!
Put on some pants already!

207
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,000
Says the guy with his
chesticles hanging out!

208
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,083
Put 'em in a vest, buddy!

209
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,750
Huh?

210
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,916
[QT]
Uh, can I say something?

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,916
Spit it out!

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,375
Yeah, what?

213
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,541
[QT] There's no need to keep
fighting like this, right?

214
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,916
[DANDY &amp; MEOW]
Huh?

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,875
[QT] As soon as those aliens
make up with each other,

216
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,500
they can both go get registered,
and we can get paid.

217
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,750
Hmm.. Yeah, you're right.

218
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,208
We're gonna need--

219
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,541
[QT]
Yes! A peace conference!

220
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,916
[DANDY] Are you sure about
these sleeping arrangements?

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,291
Silly asking.

222
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,750
Why not together
on heart-shape bed?

223
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,750
Okay...

224
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,333
So, what kicked off the
ol' war thing to begin with?

225
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,375
The reason...

226
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,458
[VESTIAN]
The reason was...

227
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,291
What, is it too
painful to talk about?

228
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,333
No.

229
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
Over ten thousand of years,

230
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,541
details is getting
more blurry way.

231
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,625
Whaddya mean, you've forgotten?

232
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,291
Why keep fighting if you don't
remember what your beef is?

233
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,333
Nonsense!

234
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,125
As very final Undian,

235
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,000
I keep battle the evil
Vestian until every last bit

236
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,791
of living is squeezed from them!

237
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,208
This is happiest
think in my head!

238
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,416
Ridiculous!

239
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,458
Even if only Vestian left I am,

240
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,791
I must destruction
of every Undian!

241
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,333
This is my porpoise!

242
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,125
But Vestian will win
war no matter the what!

243
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,625
Whatcha got?

244
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,833
Launch button for
planetarium doomsday missile.

245
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,666
Game over for me time is
game over for everyone time!

246
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,166
With this button,
most victory way!

247
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,166
Even if I death, moon
explosion will everything!

248
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,291
Simmer down.

249
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,250
Losing is not optional!

250
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah, but that's a
hell of a way to win.

251
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,416
Check it out.
If the war were over,

252
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,125
you could get up to all
sorts of good times, man.

253
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,333
What good times?

254
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,000
There's this breastaurant
called Boobies,

255
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,791
and you're gonna love
the waitresses' tops, pal!

256

Don't be a fool!

rusty, that's all she wrote.

258

Polish 'em all you want,
but that ship has sailed.

259
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,208
Just trade those crappy ol'
dreams in for a set of new ones.

260
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,583
Huh. That is truth.

261
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,916
Ever since birthing
I have made the war,

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,250
so things like Boobies
I am never yet the knowing of.

263
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,958
Boobies is top-drawer.

264
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,125
It's outta this world!

265

Not total sure yet,

266
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,541
but I getting a gutter-feeling
what you say is good.

267
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,875
It is, baby!

268
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,458
Maybe not today,
or even the next...

269
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,875
...but soon you're gonna
know that Dandy was right.

270
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,083
[QT]
There, it's finally fixed.

271
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,416
Now all we have to do

272
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,333
is get the two of them
to that peace conference.

273
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,583
[NARRATOR] And so,
the 10,000-year war

274
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,666
between the Undians
and the Vestians

275
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,000
was about to come to an end.

276
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,375
Two signatures later,
and this world was set

277

to enter a brand
new era of tranquility.

[QT] Now it's time for
the exchange ceremony.

281
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,666
In accordance with Galactic
Treaty addendum #1469,

282
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,750
no peace is considered official
until the warring parties

have traded their most
prized possessions.

have broken down!

Well, the Undians found
the terms too binding.

292
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,458
Well, the Vestians thought
it stank from the start.
