[hubbub of a crowd]

2
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,041
[JUDGE 25A] Order!

3
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,833
We will now begin the trial of
the defendant, Mister Dandy,

4
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,291
also known as Space Dandy,

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,083
who has been charged with
the murder of Guy Reginald.

6
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,666
[PROSECUTOR] Ladies and
Gentlethings of the jury,

7
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,583
at three a.m. Suburbia Standard
Time on the twelfth day

8
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,083
of the thirteenth month,

9
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,541
a heinous crime was
committed with a baseball.

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,750
In a fit of brutality,

11
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,166
a nefarious monster
murdered Guy Reginald.

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,958
And that monster is Space Dandy.

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,666
Well. That's all for now.

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,666
[JUDGE 25A] How will you plead
in this case, Mister Dandy?

15
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,708
Seems he's exercising
his right to remain silent.

16
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,125
[PROSECUTOR] The victim was
a Lumetian named Guy Reginald.

17
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,541
Now, when he was discovered,
his skull exhibited

18
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,541
a circular depression matching
that of an ordinary baseball--

19
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,916
a baseball that was
smashed into his head,

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
causing immediate death!

21
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,000
[PROSECUTOR] After hearing a
scream, the victim's wife, Rose,

22
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,958
rushed into the room to find her
husband lying dead on the floor.

23
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,500
Standing next to the body

24
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,708
was the defendant, Mister Dandy.

25
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,166
A baseball and
mask were also found.

26
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,916
We believe the defendant
hid his face with the mask,

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,291
snuck into the room,

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,250
and used that ball to
commit this ghastly murder.

29
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
[LAWYER] Objection!

30
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,916
The defendant claims
he's an alien hunter.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,333
He was there to
catch Mister Reginald,

32
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,833
not kill the poor creature.

33
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,916
We'll see.
Now, then.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,041
Let's hear the prosecution's
case and star witness.

35
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,791
[PROSECUTOR] Ms. Scarlet,
do you know

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,000
the defendant, Mister Dandy?

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,333
Yes.

38
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,791
He's a regular at the
alien registration center.

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,541
[PROSECUTOR] And would you
please inform the court

40
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,250
of his track record
with registered aliens?

41
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,166
Well, I suppose
it's abnormal for him

42
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,125
to bring in anything
very impressive.

43
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,041
[PROSECUTOR] Then I suppose
the court can suppose

44
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,500
he had no proven track record.

45
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,000
The defendant,
with no credentials

46
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,916
or achievements, was desperate.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,875
So desperate, he'd use
any means necessary

48
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,666
to get that reward money.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,333
A conjecture, sir!

50
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,708
Ms. Scarlet, I have
a question, now.

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,666
If a Lumetian were
in fact registered,

52
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,791
how much would
that reward money be?

53
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,250
An alien of the
Lumetian class?

54
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,541
I'd say approximately
a million woolongs.

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,083
Thank you. I have
no more questions.

56
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,041
[PROSECUTOR] Mister Meow,
where were you

57
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,958
and what were you doing
at the time of the crime?

58
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,083
I uh--Dandy said to wait.

59
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I was at the emergency
exit and didn't see anything.

60
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,041
It's Me#$%.

61
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,041
[PROSECUTOR]
And where did you obtain

62
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,458
the information
about the victim?

63
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,625
[MEOW] Oh, we met a Suburbian
when we were at Boobies,

64
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,750
and they said they could tell us

65
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,458
where to find a
legit Lumetian, so--

66
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,875
[PROSECUTOR] How did the
defendant react to that news?

67
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,291
He was super stoked

68
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,041
because we hadn't made
any money in, like, forever.

69
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,291
Dandy doesn't list
you as a crew member.

70
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,416
His affidavit claims
you're just a cat.

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,750
A cat he unsuccessfully
tried to sell to a pet shop.

72
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,458
He chose to keep you on

73
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,333
as a freeloader because
no one else would take you.

74
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,666
[MEOW] What?
He seriously said that?

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,458
[PROSECUTOR] The defendant
will do anything for money,

76
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,875
so why should this
incident be any different?

77
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,375
Did you know that
you were working

78
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,666
so closely with
such a violent man?

79
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,416
Uh... Yeah, sure;

80
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,666
I mean, I kinda figured
he'd snap, eventually.

81
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,416
Objection! Leading the
witness, your honor!

82
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,083
[PROSECUTOR] Mister QT,
can you tell the court

83
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,291
where were you at
the time of the crime?

84
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,833
[QT] I was standing
by with the ship,

85
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,708
so I was never
technically at the scene.

86
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,333
Now, regarding
you in his affidavit,

87
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
the defendant claims he
was in a thrift shop trying

88
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,083
to buy a robot like that R2D2,
but he accidentally ended up

89
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,958
buying you, a cleaning robot.

90
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:35,791
[QT] What?

91
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,583
He states here he kept you,

92
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,708
because you were too
much trouble to return.

93
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,291
[QT] Too much trouble?
He said that?

94
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,000
[PROSECUTOR] The truth is,
the defendant has always

95
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,541
used aggressive hunting methods

96
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,250
and creates incredible
damage wherever he goes.

97
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,583
[QT] Yes.

98
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,875
I always thought it
wouldn't be very surprising

99
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,208
if he committed a crime.

100
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,916
So, basically,
you're saying you're not

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,791
surprised the defendant's
violent nature led to a murder.

102
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:02,666
Speculation. This is
all circumstantial!

103
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,750
[LAWYER] Mrs. Rose Reginald.

104
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,875
You have stated for the
record that you heard

105
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,500
your husband scream as
you were arriving home.

106
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,541
That's right.

107
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,333
I hurried to the
door and rushed in,

108
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,500
but I was too late to help him.

109
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,625
And prior to
this fateful night,

110
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,625
did you know your groom,
Mister Guy Reginald,

111
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,833
was a rare Lumetian alien?

112
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,625
[ROSE] No.

113
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,833
Is that right?

114
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,166
So you had no idea that

115
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,541
if you turned him in you'd
receive a hefty reward?

116
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,916
Objection!

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,458
That question is not
relevant to the current case.

118
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,333
[JUDGE 25A] Objection sustained.

119
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,916
Now, let's get back to
the murder in question.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,333
Did he have a large
depression on his head?

121
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,333
[ROSE] Yes, and
there was a ball lying

122
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,958
on the floor by his feet.

123
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,833
A ball.

124
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,416
Exhibit A, the murder weapon.

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,291
[MEOW] "Checking in
at the courthouse."

126
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,791
[QT] Why do you think Dandy
hasn't said anything so far?

127
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,833
[PROSECUTOR] This is the
ball from the crime scene.

128
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,666
Now, do you own
this baseball, Rose?

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,958
[ROSE] No.

130
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,208
It wasn't mine, and
Guy never played baseball.

131
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,166
Your Honor, look!

132
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,833
There's a name written on here.

133
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,666
[PROSECUTOR] Indeed, there is.

134
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,000
In that case, Your Honor,

135
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,458
I would like to call a
new witness to the stand.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,083
[PROSECUTOR] Are you Mister
Hiroshi, from Planet Turbo?

137
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,375
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,500
[PROSECUTOR] Do you
recognize this ball, son?

139
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,041
Uh. Yes.
It belongs to me, sir.

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,541
[PROSECUTOR] And do you
recognize the defendant?

141
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,000
No, not at all.

142
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
Now, tell the truth, son.

143
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,041
Have you ever been
to Planet Suburbia?

144
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,416
No, sir.

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
At what point
did you notice

146
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,333
you were missing
your ball?

147
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,583
Well, I was playing
baseball with Jack

148
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,333
in our neighborhood's
vacant lot,

149
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,708
and jeepers, it just
flat-out disappeared.

150
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,916
Thank you, son.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,625
I think we should have
his friend testify, too.

152
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,250
[PROSECUTOR] Mister Skipjack,
are you Mister Hiroshi's friend?

153
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,625
 Yeah.

154
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,250
[PROSECUTOR] And do you
recognize this ball as well?

155
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,750
Yeah, that's the
ball we used to play with.

156
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,166
[cell phone beeping]

157
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
Sorry; got a text.

158
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,041
It has been proven
that this ball

159
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,000
is without a doubt the property
of young Mister Hiroshi.

160
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,250
The ball disappeared,
and stealing hardly seems

161
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,250
out of character
for the defendant.

162
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,166
Prosecution rests.

163
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,625
[MEOW] Hiroshi. Huh...

164
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,666
[MEOW] Look, it's
Hiroshi's Chwitter.

165
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,666
[LAWYER] However.

166
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,375
Was it necessary
for Mister Dandy

167
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,625
to steal the
murder weapon at all?

168
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,875
It was on Planet Turbo,
far away from Suburbia.

169
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,125
Now do you mean to try

170
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,541
and lay the guilt on those
youngsters, councilor?

171
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,250
Not in the least,
it just seems illogical

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,166
to travel five thousand parsecs
to steal an average ball.

173
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
Why he stole
it is unimportant,

174
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,875
what matters are the facts,

175
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,208
and the facts are
the defendant used

176
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958
that ball to kill
Mister Reginald!

177
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
Objection!

178
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,875
You can't claim he used
it without evidence.

179
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,375
We have to first
prove your theory, sir!

180
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,583
It isn't responding.

181
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,666
Interesting.

182
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,583
There should at
least be traces of DNA.

183
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,791
Are you saying
there is no response

184
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,916
from the murder weapon?

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,166
No, sir.

186
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,625
The problem here is
we're not getting any traces

187
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,916
of DNA from
Mister Dandy himself.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,416
[JUDGE 25B] You must be
getting traces of something.

189
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,625
Your honor,
what I am detecting

190
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,500
from both the defendant
and the murder weapon

191
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,458
are trace amounts
of Pyonium.

192
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,625
His DNA doesn't matter;

193
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,750
this proves he was
in contact with the ball.

194
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
"Pyonium," you say?

195
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,125
Please explain to the court:
What is this substance?

196
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,166
[LAWYER] Professor Duran,
you specialize

197
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,208
in Pyonium research, do you not?

198
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,291
[DURAN] I do.

199
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,083
Professor, will
you explain Pyonium

200
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,375
to the best of
your abilities?

201
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,916
"Pyonium" is
the common name

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,250
for the particle known
as M.E.G.A Pyonium.

203
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,958
It is a recently
discovered particle,

204
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,375
so we do not yet fully
understand its true nature.

205
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,041
However, we believe
that this particle is able

206
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:11,000
to bend time and space in
order to cross dimensions,

207
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,000
and potentially holds
a vast amount of energy.

208
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,958
[LAWYER]
Time and space, you say?

209
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,625
[DURAN] That is correct.

210
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,958
That unique quality
is the reason scientists

211
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,791
like myself refer to
it as the "god particle."

212
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,166
And would it be accurate

213
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,125
to say this particle
is particularly rare?

214
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,625
[DURAN] Very rare, sir.

215
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,583
So if such a rare particle
had been detected

216
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,333
on both the defendant
and the ball--well then.

217
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,583
I think the answer is clear.

218
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,458
Objection! Your Honor.

219
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,083
I'd like to introduce
a new piece of evidence.

220
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,625
These are the documents for the
victim's life insurance policy.

221
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,375
The payment in
the event of his death

222
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,333
is far greater than the
registration center's reward.

223
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,875
Fifty million woolongs!

224
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,333
What?

225
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,166
I would like to call a previous
witness back to the stand.

226
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,083
Rose Reginald, who
conveniently found the body.

227
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,625
Rose Reginald, you
are the beneficiary

228
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,958
of Guy Reginald's life
insurance policy, are you not?

229
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,125
[ROSE] I am.

230
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,291
Eh, yes, of course.

231
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,791
Then, you must also
have known how much

232
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,291
you would receive in
the event of his death.

233
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,750
The truth is, Rose, you
were struggling with money.

234
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,000
Your husband was jobless,

235
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,250
leaving you the sole
earner for your family.

236
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,291
He was a kept man and
you despised him for it!

237
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,125
Furthermore, I have
documents here

238
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,458
from the Internet
store known as Tamazon.

239
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,000
Based on these receipts,

240
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,000
you recently purchased
the following items.

241
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,833
Brass knuckles, a sabre,
and a folding chair.

242
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,958
Answer me this:
what need would a waitress

243
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,541
at Boobies have for
these kinds of items?

244
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,166
What's wrong, Rose?

245
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,958
Thorn got your tongue?

246
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,125
[LAWYER] Ms. Honey.

247
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,416
You work at Boobies
with Rose Reginald, correct?

248
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Yeah.

249
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,125
Were you aware
that Rose was married?

250
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,000
[Not really.

251
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,208
She took the late-night shifts,

252
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,750
so I figured she
either needed the money

253
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,666
or didn't have anyone
to go home to.

254
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,250
On the day of
the incident,

255
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,875
did the defendant, Dandy,
visit your restaurant?

256
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,916
Uh-huh.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,958
I think he bought
like a cup of coffee

258
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,583
and then stayed
for five hours.

259
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,416
Ah. Your Honor, I'd
like your permission

260
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,125
to examine the security
camera footage from Boobies.

261
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,708
If the two came
into contact there,

262
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,708
that opens up a whole new can
of worms I hadn't counted on.

263
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,083
Indeed. It's a tale
as old as time:

264
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,333
A greedy wife and
her alien hunter lover

265
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,916
committing insurance fraud.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,041
[SCARLET] Don't tell me. Dandy?

267
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,000
Blinded by the wiles of a woman?

268
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,250
We're talking
about boobies,

269
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,541
so I wouldn't put it past him.

270
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,083
[QT] Yeah, me neither;

271
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,791
he's always saying his whole
reason for living is Boobies.

272
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,083
[JUDGE 25A] Well, let's
examine the video footage.

273
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,083
[PROSECUTOR] I see.

274
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,750
So you were acquainted with
the defendant, Mister Dandy.

275
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,208
It's not like that.
He's a customer.

276
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,375
Listen, I was just doing my job!

277
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,500
Come on, tell
them the truth, Dandy!

278
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,708
Why aren't you saying anything?

279
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,541
You're making
everyone suspicious!

280
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,000
[JUDGE 25A] I must ask
the witness to calm down.

281
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,750
You were after that
insurance money,

282
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,708
so you bought various
weapons to kill him

283
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,833
and met Dandy at Boobies,
then you hired him

284
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,916
to kill your husband,
isn't that correct?

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,375
You're guilty, too!

286
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,791
Dandy's an alien hunter,
so if he were caught,

287
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,041
he'd be charged with
professional negligence,

288
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,416
which carries a
lighter sentence.

289
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,708
You're wrong!
I swear it wasn't me!

290
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,083
I didn't kill my husband!
Please, I didn't do it!

291
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,125
You have to believe me;
I loved him!

292
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,458
I'd never hurt him! Let me g--!

293
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,291
However, there's still
one thing bothering me.

294
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,208
Why was that darn ball stolen
from such a faraway planet?

295
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,666
Good question.

296
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,708
[DURAN] Your Honor!

297
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,916
[JUDGE 25A] Go ahead, Professor.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,416
Yes, thank you.
This could be helpful.

299
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Pyonium may respond to
strong emotional fluctuations.

300
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,958
If so, it can turn the emotion
in question into a reality.

301
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,791
How 'bout you take
the shine off it for me.

302
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,125
The Pyonium
could have reacted

303
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,375
to someone's intent to kill.

304
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,625
If killing intent came
from Planet Turbo,

305
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,291
well that emotion could
bend space, causing the ball

306
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,250
to cross dimensions
to fulfill the killing intent.

307
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,541
[LAWYER] Can intent
to kill be that powerful?

308
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,500
[DURAN] So powerful
that the killing intent

309
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,458
wasn't even necessarily directed
at the victim in this case.

310
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,250
[PROSECUTOR] That explains
why Pyonium was found

311
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,333
on the murder weapon,

312
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,375
but why would it
be on Mister Dandy?

313
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,125
[JUDGE 25A]
A question for the jury.

314
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,083
Now that arguments
have been presented,

315
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,958
we'll proceed to the next phase.

316
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,208
[JUDGE 25A]
Does the defendant have

317
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,000
anything at all
to say at this time?

318
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,500
[JUDGE 25A] It appears
the answer is "no."

319
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,750
Now we will have you,
members of the jury,

320
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,458
take a hard look at
the facts in this case

321
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,083
and decide the
application of the law.

322
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,333
We are adjourned!

323
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,666
[MEOW] I'm posting that

324
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
he's totally getting
the death penalty.

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
It's weird.
I can't figure out

326
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,583
why he hasn't said a
word in his defense.

327
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,208
[QT] Maybe he's just
accepted his guilt.

328
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,500
Hey, you guys.
Check out this account.

329
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,333
[JUROR RUTO] Well then,
might as well get started.

330
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,125
Remember, we've got to
reach a unanimous verdict.

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,083
[JUROR CUMIN] I've never
saw a guiltier man in my life.

332
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,416
I agree.

333
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,125
Hey, boy, we're talking
about life and death here!

334
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,333
[JUROR BRUTELY] Have I seen
this mark somewhere before?

335
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,958
Do you think his
wife had him killed

336
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,875
for that insurance money?

337
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,875
I agree.

338
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,291
[JUROR DAMAUN] Maybe Rose's
intent to kill was so strong

339
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,875
that the Pyonium caused the ball
to move through space and time.

340
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,791
Where do I know that
mark from? Oh, man.

341
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,500

it somewhere.

342
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,625
Creepy!

Bah. This here's a
court of law, boy!

344
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,208
Whatever, grandpa.

Hold on; what's this?

346
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,375
I dunno.

347
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,500
It's not mine, it's the
chwitter of that witness boy.

348
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,708
[JUROR BRUTELY]
Oh, I remember now!

349
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,791
It's the bruise he got
from that 16-giga kick!

350
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,625
[JUDGE 25A] A verdict has
been reached in the case

351
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,666
of the murder of
Mister Guy Reginald.

352
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,458
The jury agrees unanimously
this was a case of murder.

353
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,125
The murder weapon traveled
through space from Planet Turbo.

354
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,666
This bending of space
and time was the result

355
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,583
of Pyonium reacting to
a strong, murderous intent.

356
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,000
[JUDGE 25A] The main focus
of this case is intent.

357
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,291
Who did that strong
emotion come from?

358
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,291
Chwitter might hold that answer.

359
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,208
Specifically the
account of Hiroshi,

360
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
the owner of the
murderous baseball.

361
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,250
His Chwitter posts
indicate he had that intent.

362
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,625
What? Chwitter?

363
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,208
How is that a verdict?

364
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,125
[JACK] Say, hold on a minute!

365
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,625
You shucksters are
making it sound like

366
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,000
we were the ones who
wanted to kill somebody!

367
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,458
[HIROSHI] Can it, will ya?

368
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,833
Now, here are some

369
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,583
of the Chwitter
posts in question.

370
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,000
Kill, kill, kill.
I'll murder him.

Murder-death-kill-obliteration,

372
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,583
and things of this
murder-death-kill nature.

373
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,083
On the day of the
incident, there's a post

374
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,500
that reads as follows:

375
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,458
"I am going to
go kill you now

376
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,250
with the Giacobinid
batting form. LOL."

377
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,250
[JUDGE 25A] For those of you who
don't understand the reference,

378
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,666
the Giacobinid batting form
is where a bat is scored

379
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,666
so it breaks into pieces
when it hits the ball,

380
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,416
sending those pieces toward
the pitcher and killing him.

381
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,416
Let's do this, Hiroshi!

382
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:20,166
Here it comes! Eat this!

383
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,083
[DURAN] I see.

384
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,750
That's where the strong
killing intent resonated

385
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,250
with the Pyonium,

386
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,750
crossing through space and
turning that ordinary baseball

387
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,333
into a disappearing
miracle murder ball.

388
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,125
I don't understand.
Why? What did I do?

389
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,416
[HIROSHI] Like you don't know.

390
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
You blocked me
from your Chwitter!

391
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,083
You were supposed
to be my friend!

392
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,375
When I joined, I couldn't
wait to follow you!

393
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,291
But when I tried, I found
out you'd already blocked me!

394
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,125
What kind of friend
pulls that stunt?

395
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,041
But you're not a friend at all;
and you never were, you liar!

396
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,250
I hate you! You dip stick.

397
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,000
You were just pretending
to be my friend, huh?

398
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,250
I bet you were really talking
trash about me behind my back.

399
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,458
I didn't do anything to you!

400
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,000
And you blocked me! Why?

401
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,041
You were supposed
to be my friend!

402
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,791
One more thing.

403
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,375
I think it's my responsibility

to clear Rose
Reginald's good name.

405
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,333
I have a theory regarding
the weapons you purchased.

406
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,708
You actually bought those items

407
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,041
for your husband,
didn't you, dear?

408
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,083
[JUDGE 25A] The mask
at the scene didn't

409
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,416
belong to the murderer.

410
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,541
It belonged to none other
than the victim himself.

411
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,791
That's not all.

412
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,583
I've seen that foot mark
on your husband's chest

413
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,500
at the Spacer Hall match in '83.

414
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,208
I remember that fight well.

415
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,791
I'm sure everyone does.

416
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,291
That's when he took the 16-giga
kick in the famous Barba match.

417
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,166
Don't tell me.
That was him? Really?

418
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,458
That's right.

419
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,875
Rose's husband was a
famous masked wrestler.

420
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,625
Guy Reginald was "The
Messenger from Hell" himself.

The Dustroyer.

422

[JUDGE 25A] He was the
greatest wrestler of his time,

423
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,875
but his talent was
squandered by the league.

424
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,625
He lost his career
and fell into despair.

425
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,208
You believed in him
and wanted him

to have another try at it,
only this time as a villain.

427
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,875
So you bought those weapons
as a birthday gift, didn't you?

428
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,791
But you knew he'd
roll over in his grave

429
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,750
if you revealed his identity,
and that's why you refused

430
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:34,541
to explain those receipts,
isn't that right?

431

Yes.

00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,666
[JUDGE 25A] Order in the court!

434
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,458
I have received some
unexpected news.

435
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,083
It seems Mister Reginald has
regained consciousness.

436
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,416
Apparently, he suffers
from sleep apnea,

437

and slumbers for
long periods of time.

And being that
he's such a rare alien,

439
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,958
the coroner misdiagnosed
Mister Reginald as deceased,

440

when in fact,
now that he's awake,

441
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,458
it is clear he is very much not.

442
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,916
So he's alive?

Well, raise my rent.

[DURAN]
One thing still troubles me.

448
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,083
Why did the ball
travel 5,000 parsecs

449
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,375
and appear at Dandy's location?

450
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,208
That would require an
exceptionally strong

452
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,000
It suggests and even more
intense concentration of Pyonium

453
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:53,458
was there to pull the ball
through dimensions.

Puzzling.
