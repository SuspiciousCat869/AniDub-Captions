[DANDY] I dunno
what you mean, babe.

about something for once?

I'd be happy to tell you.

Are you absolutely sure
this is the place, Bea?

I don't see anything of note;
just an average looking planet.

According
to the space radar,

it's definitely coming
from within this sector.

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,291
Our instruments are picking
up a spatial distortion

enormous amount of energy.

Yes, but one might say that
is what's unusual, Doctor.

At this point, there's only
one thing I know for certain.

The source of the energy anomaly
is not on the planet's surface.

00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,458
Enough with the questions.

159
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,833
[HONEY] Don't be a grump!

160
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,666
[CATHERINE]
What's the harm, Dandy?

161
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,458
After all, it's ancient history.

162
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,125
[CATHERINE] We realized
that the worlds

163
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,875
we lived in were
simply too different.

164
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,666
Mismatched
personalities, huh?

165
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,083
[QT] Sounds more like
mismatched dimensions.

166
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,333
And Paul?

167
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,291
What ever happened with him?

168
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,958
[CATHERINE] We broke up.

169
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,458
When he became
successor to the throne,

170
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,125
his personality changed,
and not for the better.

171
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,041
Wait. This Paul guy's
a freakin' prince?

172
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,958
Why would you ever
break up with him?

173
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,833
[CATHERINE] It's complicated.

174
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,291
He's a 2nd-dimensional,
and I'm a 4th-dimensional.

175
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,333
[CATHERINE]
The two-dimension difference

176
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,125
was just too much for us.

177
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[MEOW] I don't get it.
Do you?

178
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,666
[QT] I think what she's saying

179
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,083
is that to a 4th-dimensional,

180
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,708
a 2nd-dimensional looks like,

181
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,958
well, like a straight
line would look to us.

182
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,541
Uhmm...

183
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,583
So, Catherine. Whaddya want?

184
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,250
[CATHERINE] For old time's sake,

185
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,500
I want you to send Paul

186
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,541
and his universe back
to where they belong.

187
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,916
He can't go on disturbing
the cosmos like this.

188
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,958
[CATHERINE] He spent
an entire decade looking

189
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,583
for a way to find me,
but I never wanted to be found.

190
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,000
[MALE OPERATOR 11A] Multiple
ships of unknown origin ahead!

191
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,166
It appears they have a
defense fleet ready to attack.

192
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,166
Who'd've thought that
being sucked into 2-D

193
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,291
with that energy anomaly
would be a good thing.

194
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,000
[GEL] I suspect that fleet
is defending the drive

195
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,916
which allows their
universe to warp.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,125
If that's true, sir,
then we can go back home

197
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,666
if we destroy it, right?

198
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,541
I don't know.

199
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,041
Huh?

200
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,625
It's possible that
destroying the drive could

201
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,000
cause this universe
to be annihilated.

202
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,583
There's also the chance
that its destruction

203
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,500
could leave us stranded here,
in 2D, forever.

204
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,333
[BEA] Oh, Doctor.

205
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,333
I don't understand
why you're getting

206
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,125
yourself so worked
up about this.

207
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,458
Are you kidding me?

208
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,291
I don't understand how you
can be so calm about it!

209
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,458
Bea.

210
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,833
Don't you know that
the happiest moments

211
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,458
in a scientist's life are when

212
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,041
they come face-to-face
with the unknown?

213
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,541
We spend our entire
lives searching for it!

214
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,916
Why worry about my fate and
ruin such a joyous occasion?

215
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,250
[MALE OPERATOR 11A] Impact
sustained to the third Block!

216
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,791
The enemy fleet is
ramping up their attack!

217
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,791
We can't do much
to camouflage ourselves;

218
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,125
we're two-dimensional.

219
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,041
But I suppose the same
can be said of our enemy.

220
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,375
At this point, all
we can do is continue

221
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,791
to press on towards
their warp drive!

222
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,791
[CATHERINE]
Are you angry, Dandy?

223
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,208
No, of course
I'm not.

224
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,541
[CATHERINE]
You look angry.

225
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,958
I told ya I'm not.
Just drop it, okay?

226
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,250
[CATHERINE]
You're such a softie.

227
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,291
I knew you wouldn't be able

228
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,583
to turn down a
request from an ex.

229
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,416
[MEOW] So she's a
woman from his past.

230
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,333
[QT] Who looks like
some kinda futuristic box.

231
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,041
Geez, I thought
cats and robots

232
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,000
were supposed to be smart,
but you guys don't have a clue!

233
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,750
Are you a stowaway?

234
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,166
Well, yeah.

235
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,791
I wanna meet that Paul guy!

236
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,250
He might be my prince!

237
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,291
Why chase rare aliens when
you can just marry royalty?

238
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,666
Sorry for stowing away,

239
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,041
but this might be my chance
to meet Prince Charming!

240
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,625
[QT] Here's something
for you to think about.

241
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,875
If Paul is one of
Dandy's old friends,

242
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,291
then that means he's gotta
be getting up there in age.

243
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,958
So what?

244
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,250
I've got no problem
with dating an older man.

245
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,750
[MEOW] Do you really
think a guy who warped

246
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,333
his entire universe to try
to win back his ex-girlfriend,

247
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
is gonna turn
around and dump her

248
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,458
for some chick he's never met?

249
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,791
Maybe!

250
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,041
You never know what such
a passionate man might do!

251
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,500
[CATHERINE] Tell me something.

252
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,041
Have you figured out
the secret of warping yet?

253
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,083
Why do you ask?
Didya tell Paul?

254
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,041
[CATHERINE] Well,
considering the way he warped

255
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,416
into your universe,

256
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,458
I'd say it's rather obvious
that he knows something.

257
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,916
Catherine.

258
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,541
[CATHERINE] You and I are on
two completely different planes.

259
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,291
I still remember what
happened in the past,

260
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,541
but you don't, do you?

261
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,000
[DANDY] No.

262
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,750
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
The fighters near the warp drive

263
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,583
have started to move.

264
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,750
It appears to be a
defensive maneuver.

265
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,708
I guess that means
we've been spotted.

266
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, it certainly took
them long enough.

267
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,875
[MALE OPERATOR 11A] The route
starts to get narrow up ahead.

268
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,916
We'll be making contact

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
with the enemy's
defensive line soon.

270
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,791
[DANDY] Okay, listen up.

271
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,791
We've gotta stop
this ruthless bastard,

272
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,958
and by bastard, I mean Paul.

273
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,208
I'm thinkin' we
should go to him,

274
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,125
and hash this out directly.

275
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,791
[MEOW] Whaddya mean
by "go to him"?

276
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,416
We can't just
search the universe;

277
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
even in 2D it's
still a big place.

278
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,958
Catherine here knows
where to find 'im.

279
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,041
[QT] Since he's in a 2D
universe, his forces won't

280
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,583
be able to attack us
while we're on the outside.

281
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,166
So it should be pretty
easy for us to get in.

282
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,333
[CATHERINE]
Paul knows this, too,

283
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,708
which is why he's
already begun rolling up

284
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,416
the fabric of his universe.

285
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,541
[MEOW] Huh? But how
is that even possible?

286
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,875
[QT] Well, it's 2D so it's kinda
like folding a piece of paper.

287
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,916
[CATHERINE] He'll be
on the interior end.

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,291
[MEOW] The wha--?

289
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,666
[CATHERINE] The space
between the universe layers

290
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,958
is very narrow,
so we won't be able

291
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,125
reach him by flying
in from the side.

292
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,916
Our only choice
is to be drawn

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,625
into the universe and
search from within.

294

tough because it's me.

Oh, I know! Hey Dandy.

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,333
Man, I really hate
the 2D universe--

298
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,333
the ceilings are low
and it's hard to fight.

299
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,208
[CATHERINE] Yeah, but it's
still better than a 1D universe.

300

[HONEY] I've got
an idea! Yoo-hoo!

How can you be sure we're
not gonna get crushed

302
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,708
when that thing sucks us up?

303
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,000
[QT] He's got a point.

304
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,208
Seems like it would
make our insides pop out.

305
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,083
[HONEY] Um. Hello!

306
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,333
What?

307
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,541
Is there somethin'
you'd like to add, Honey?

308
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,416
Why don't we
just poke right through?

309
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,791
[QT] That's it!

310
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,125
'Kay, here we go!

311
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,250
[QT] It's about to get narrow.

312
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,416
Looks like it's now
or never, Dandy!

313
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,125
Hold tight, everyone!

314
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,375
[DANDY] Whoa!

315
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,833
Alright, let's do this, baby!

316
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,958
Cut through!

317
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,583
Welcome to 2D!

318
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,833
[MALE OPERATOR 11A] A powerful
shockwave is approaching!

319
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,875
Just what do you
mean by "shockwave"?

320
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,958
Look! It's creating
a fissure in space, sir!

321
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,750
Whoa. It's huge.

322
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,875
[QT]
Yeah, you can see everything

323
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,666
looking down at it like this.

324
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,791
Hey, QT.
Zoom in on that big square.

325
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,125
[QT] Give me a second.
You mean right here?

326
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,875
[CATHERINE] Paul.
He hasn't changed, has he?

327
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,541
Huh? He's just a
rectangle with a crown?

328
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,000
[QT] Yeah, he's
a two-dimensional.

329
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,708
What'd you expect?

330
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,458
I thought that he
was my Prince Charming,

331
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,541
but I can't marry a rectangle!

332
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,541
Wow, you can see
everything from up here!

333
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,666
[DANDY] Two-dimensionals don't

334
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
even realize they're
visible like this.

335
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,666
Can't quite get their
heads around the idea.

336
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,250
[CATHERINE] Once we
destroy their warp drive,

337
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,083
the 2D universe should
immediately go back

338
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,875
to where it came
from on its own.

339
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,125
Are you sure you
don't wanna see Paul?

340
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,208
[CATHERINE] Yeah. I'm old now.

341
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,833
I'd rather he remember
me the way I was.

342
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,708
[QT] I found something
that looks suspicious.

343
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,000
Do ya think this could
be their warp drive?

344
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,750
[BEA] Range: sixteen-hundred
to the warp drive.

345
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,791
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
I'm picking up

346
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,208
some kind of transmission, sir.

347
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,208
[GEL] Well then, let's hear
what they have to say.

348
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,833
[PAUL] Catherine!

349
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,166
You're the one who's about

350
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
to destroy the drive,
please listen to me first.

351
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,791
I was wrong
about everything.

352
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,291
Please come back to me!

353
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,125
My beloved Catherine.

354
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,291
I'm willing to renounce
my claim to the throne

355
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,458
and leave this universe
behind to be with you!

356
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,500
Catherine?

357
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,083
Probably just interference
from a TV soap opera.

358
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,166
We don't have time to
worry about it right now.

359
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,000
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
Target acquired!

360
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,125
What are your orders, sir?

361
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,083
All weapons, fire!

362
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,666
That was a direct hit!

363
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,541
[GEL] It can't be!
Is that a 1D universe?

364
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,333
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
A massive object

365
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,375
is headed toward the ship!

366
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,125
No! Not again!

367
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,583
As if going 2D wasn't bad
enough now we're going 1D?

368
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,375
Whoa, did it
self-destruct on its own?

369
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,416
What's gonna happen
to my rectangle prince?

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,125
[DANDY] So, Catherine.
Did you do this?

371
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,375
[CATHERINE] No,
I had nothing to do with it.

372
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,583
But I--

373
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,958
What?

374
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,208
[CATHERINE] I could've sworn

375
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,041
that I heard Paul's voice
calling out to me.

376
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,291
[CATHERINE] Paul sealed
a 1D universe in a box

377
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,000
to harness its power.

378
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,000
He then used that power

379
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,458
to warp his 2D universe
into your own.

380
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,666
And are you the one who
gave Paul that crazy idea?

381
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
[CATHERINE]
Wouldn't you like to know?

382
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,125
[CATHERINE] So now
that it's been ten years,

383
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,708
why don't you tell me.

384
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,375
[CATHERINE] Have you figured
out the secret of warping yet?

385
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,500
Yeah.

386
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,250
The secret is
warping doesn't exist.

387
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,791
[CATHERINE] That's right.

388
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,125
[DANDY] We travel through
the space between universes,

389
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,083
and for some strange reason,

390
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,958
we decided to call it warping.

391
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,625
Suppose that there's
a world in this universe,

392
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,833
and then a similar
world in another one,

393
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,958
and both have the same
stuffed animal lyin' around.

394
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
Here's where
it gets tricky.

395
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,416
At some point,

396
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,541
the stuffed animal here
will sense "This is me."

397
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,916
Do you get what I'm sayin'?

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,166
And the next moment,

399
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,375
the stuffed animal there
will sense "This is me."

400
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,291
That's all it is, baby.

401
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,666
[CATHERINE] True but
you forgot to mention

402
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,666
that you can't sense the
switching between universes.

403
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,125
Ain't that the truth?

404
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,625
I guess, it's different
for you, huh?

405
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,041
[CATHERINE] Yes, it is.

406
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,541
From my perspective,

407
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,666
Dandy before warping
and Dandy after warping

408
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,375
are two completely
different people.

409
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,625
[CATHERINE] Which means
you're not the Dandy

410
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,000
I fell in love with.

411
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,833
Yeah, I know.

412
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,833
Even though you're
still the same Catherine

413
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,541
that I fell in love with.

414
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,875
[CATHERINE] You knew that
and you helped me anyway?

415
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Thank you.

416
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,583
[DANDY] So about Paul.

417
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,041
[CATHERINE] There's no need
to worry, he's alive still.

418
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,541
[DANDY] That's not what
I'm talkin' about, Catherine.

419
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,666
[CATHERINE] I see.

420
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,416
You want to know
why I chose Paul.

421
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,666
You were able to figure out

422
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,875
the secret of warping
all by yourself, Dandy.

423
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,291
On the other hand,

424
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,083
I knew that Paul would
be lost without me.

425
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,541
[BEA] Doctor, I'm picking up

426
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,666
a high-energy
reading dead ahead!

427
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,291
We're not going to
be able to avoid it!

428
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,625
[GEL] Another energy anomaly?

429
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,125
What could it be?

430
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,041
[BEA] I think that it's a Zero-D
universe warping out, sir!

431
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,208
[GEL] What? Zero dimensions?

432
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,791
[JUDGE 25A] Order!

433
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,041
We will now begin the trial of
the defendant, Mister Dandy,

434
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,166
also known as Space Dandy,

435
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,541
who has been
charged with murder!

436
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,833
[JUDGE 25B] On the nest
episode of Space Dandy.

437
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,125
"Dandy's Day in Court, Baby."
We'll see you then!
