1
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,416
[POE] I was lonely for decades.

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,083
[POE] For centuries. For eons.

3
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,333
Okay.

4
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:33,333
[resonanting thrums and squeals]

5
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,625
[DANDY] You're kinda weird.

6
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,416
I guess they
just ditched me here.

7
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,333
Yeah, real nice!

8
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,541
Oh, right.

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,083
Meow! QT! Anyone? Hello?

10
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,375
What's wrong
with those guys?

11
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,666
Would it kill 'em to
answer when I call--?

12
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,416
[DANDY] Huh...?

13
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,875
[DANDY] Oh...

14
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,916
Hey, lady.
Where are we, exactly?

15
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,791
The corner of everywhere
and nowhere, you dig?

16
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,500
Well, that
wasn't freaky. What gives?

17
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,208
I don't even know
how I ended up here.

18
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,750
I can't
remember anything!

19
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,541
Hey!

20
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,166
You're like a
person, aintcha?

21
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,833
Say would you mind
giving a stranger

22
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,208
a ride into the nearest town?

23
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,625
[DANDY] Not to
sound like a jerk.

24
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,875
But walking here myself
would'a been whole a lot faster.

25
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,291
What the hell?
Someone's gotta be around.

26
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,333
Who's this guy?

27
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,333
I'm your someone.

28
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,583
Huh?

29
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,083
You asked for a someone
just now, did you not?

30
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,500
Whatever, just
point me towards a kitchen!

31
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,833
Dandy is so hungry.

32
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,791
In that case, let us away
to a quality restaurant.

33
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,916
Huh? There's a
restaurant here?

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,125
Ferdinand, at your service!

35
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,916
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

36
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,916
Hey, are you
a rare alien or what?

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,458
Oh. I'm rare
insofar as that.

38
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,291
My skills as a medium
are rendered well.

39
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,333
Of course they are.

40
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,083
Tell me your
thoughts on it.

41
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
I find it vexatious.

42
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,791
What topic hath
earned your enmity?

43
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,291
[NOBLEMAN] Life is a
caravanserai of delights,

44
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,250
but death is our destined lot.

45
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,625
The only difference is
for how long one eludes it.

46
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,666
You voice all
this to what end?

47
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,458
[NOBLEMAN] If the grave is one's
only aspiration and guarantee,

48
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,375
then life is a bleak path
with little to recommend it.

49
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,458
Wherefore this
brief season of breath, milady?

50
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,041
What reason compels us to live?

51
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,250
[chuckles]

52
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,125
You would laugh?
For what reason?

53
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,958
The gall of such conceit.

54
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,916
[NOBLEMAN] Huh?

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,666
Tiny forms of
life there are

56
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,416
which 'scape the naked eye.

57
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,958
They do not demand
"wherefore?" of the cosmos.

58
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,958
[gasps]

59
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,291
[NOBLEWOMAN] Go die,
if life without reason is

60
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,416
so loathsome to you.

61
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,875
[FERDINAND]
Your feast awaits you.

62
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,875
Whoa! I'm likin' it!

63
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,208
The hell'd you
put in my food?

64
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,833
Thought I was gonna bite
the big one just then!

65
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,666
You were taking
big bites, after all!

66
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,958
Death ain't a joke, baby.

67
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,250
But life is certainly one.

68
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,750
And I'd wager there are times

69
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,833
when you'd be hard-pressed
to discern one from the other.

70
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,166
Huh?

71
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,333
Take your evening slumber.

72
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,083
Your spirit endures, having
cast off your mortal coil.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,583
Be still!

74
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,833
What?

75
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,791
Those are the
Night Porters above.

76
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,500
It'll be a bother if
they lay eyes on you.

77
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,833
[FERDINAND] So sorry about
your meal going south.

78
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,708
[DANDY] It's not gonna give me
flashbacks this time, right?

79
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,416
[FERDINAND]
Leave it to me, friend.

80
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,958
[CORNET] How do I live my life?

81
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,958
That's the question of the hour.

82
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,208
[GREGORIANS in sing-song voices]
Aren't asking that,

83
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,416
and how to die when life
is over the same thing?

84
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,791
[CORNET] Course not!

85
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,458
And who wants
to ask about dying?

86
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,333
Stuff like that's a
waste of breath, I say!

87
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,666
[GREGORIANS] Want or not,
better ask while you can

88
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,541
because it will happen to all.

89
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,958
[CORNET] I'm just saying,
if I get preoccupied with it,

90
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,875
then I might as well
keel over right now!

91
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,375
[GREGORIANS] Holding death
at a coward's distance

92
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,500
does not allow it
a spot in your mind.

93
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,375
Mortal you are.

94
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,250
Time to come to better
terms with your fate.

95
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,666
[CORNET] No, that's crazy.

96
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,916
[GREGORIANS] Entropy is the
end of all creatures left

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,750
unto their own devices.

98
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,541
Death is our lot,

99
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,500
and the lot of everyone
that we hold dear.

100
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,583
So think or do not think

101
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,291
about the end of your own life.

102
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:48,583
Anon it comes to you so take
your pleasure while you may.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Ah! All right! Ramen!

104
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,875
Not cool, ramen.

105
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey, c'mon!
Get your own food!

They dancing, or what?

107
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,541
You know, this
planet is kinda screwy.

108
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,333
First of all the
people are all nuts,

109
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,083
and then the food
won't stop teasing me.

110
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,208
It's candy!
Now we're talking!

111
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,875
Oh, you wanna
eat us, is that the idea?

112
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,583
I ain't scared of
a candy-ass like you!

113
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,458
That's right!
Back off, sucker!

114
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,000
Maybe I'll wait
for dinner after all.

115
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,083

[DANDY] Bravo, baby.

Who are you, down there?

00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,375
You can really hear my song?

120

What'd you say?

[high-tempo guitar music]

125
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,041
You are a creature
of much unfamiliarity to me.

126
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,333
Huh? Back atcha!

127
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:44,000
My gaze has never
fallen upon one so odd as this.

128
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,041
Oh yeah?
Well go high-five a mirror.

129
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,666
[NIGHT PORTER] You're an
affront to the natural order.

130
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,875
As a result, you cannot
be permitted to stay.

131
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,041
Prepare yourself for
imminent termination.

Whoa! Gimme a sec.

No reflection!
Are you guys dead?

00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,125
I didn't sign on for this!

Time for a
crash-course in ghosts!

136

You are not alive!
You follow?

137
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,791
Why aren't you
all freaked out?

138
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,583
[FERDINAND] Goodness me.

139
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,500
Our new addition
is quite unhinged.

140
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,166
[DANDY] Uh, why'm
I getting carried in a boat?

141
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,958
Your naiveté is refreshing,

142
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,166
though I'm surprised that
you honestly don't know.

143

This is your
funeral procession, Dandy.

144
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,500
Okay. Seems legit.

145
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,041
Huh?!!

146
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,166
It shouldn't come as
that huge of a shock.

147
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,333
For all of your whining,
are you actually hungry?

148
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,708
[DANDY] I should be.

149
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:01,291
I mean, I'm a couple meals
behind, but I guess I'm not.

150
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,583
Here's another one for
you--you've been awake

151
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,208
since you got here, but
are you tired in the least?

152
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,666
[DANDY] He's right.
I'm not tired at all.

153
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,833
In fact, I'm wide awake.

154
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,500
[FERDINAND] It's a
common mistake.

155
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,625
The newly-dead don't
pick up on that fact,

156
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,083
and keep eating and sleeping

157
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,208
as though they
still have a need to.

158
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,458
They go through the motions,

159
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,833
blithely assuming
they're still alive.

160
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,125

Some poor souls, it takes them

00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,166
hundreds of years
to accept the truth.

162
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,791
And if one is
sublimely unfortunate,

163
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,416
they never acknowledge
their demise at all.

164
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,625
[FERDINAND] You know,
I wouldn't worry about it.

165
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:45,000
You'll come around.
Yes. All in good time.

166
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,291
[QT] I'm detecting something
up ahead on Planet Limbo.

167
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,666
If these numbers are right,
this creature is off the charts!

168
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,083
But, I checked the
registry just now,

169
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,791
and nothing lives there.

170
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,833
Use your head!

171
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,583
That just means whatever's

172
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,125
on the surface
must be super-rare!

173
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,375
You better
not be sending us

174
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,083
on a wild goose chase again!

175
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,916
[QT] Don't mind me--I'll
just cry in the corner.

176
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,666
You do not wanna deal

177
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,916
with my starvation hairballs!

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,125
C'mon, guys!

179
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,708
Would it kill you
to have more faith

180
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,625
in your fearless leader?

181
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,083
[DANDY] Too much faith!
Too much faith!

182
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,875
[QT] We must've accidentally
flown into a dark nebula!

183
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,333
They're super-dangerous!

184
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,791
[MEOW] Shouldn't we
go around crap like this?

185
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,833
[QT] Well, the radar's
been broken for a while now.

186
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,458
Looking out the
window usually works.

187
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,166
[DANDY] You piece of junk!

188
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,500
What is this thing?

189
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,750
[FERDINAND] Your own personal
"black box," as it were.

190
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,708
Many people are fuzzy on the
details of their own death.

191
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,250
Such devices help
bring them up to speed.

192
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you accept
your demise now?

193
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,416
As you've noticed, this
is a planet of the dead,

194
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,750
so you'll fit right in.

195
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,166
[DANDY] So, that header
onto the control panel,

196
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,958
that punched my card?

197
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,500
[FERDINAND] So to speak,
yes--though I'm not sure

198
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,625
my telling you that is
going to convince you any.

199
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,791
Sorry 'bout that.

200
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,833
Here, hunger and age

201
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,375
are nothing you
have to worry about.

202
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,000
There are no jobs.

203
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,875
You're free to spend your
time however you want.

204
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,791
[FERDINAND] Come on!
You're the man of the hour!

205
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,125
It's time to make merry
and trip the light fantastic!

206
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,083
"Make merry"?

207
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,666
Right!

208
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,541
There's nothing to lose here,
because you are already dead!

209
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,916
It's a world where
sadness doesn't exist.

210
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,041
No sadness, huh?
I'd buy that for a wulong.

211
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,333
Wait, no I wouldn't!

212
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,375
You can't have happiness
without sadness--

213
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,000
they're like cousins
or some junk!

214
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,875
I ain't giving up my good times!

215
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,666
I wanna eat and
drink stuff! Gimme that!

216
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,416
I'm going to Boobies!

217
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,875
You can take this
funeral and shove it!

218
00:16:55,291 --> 00:17:00,875
Freaky. Hey, girl!
Can you drive this thing?

219
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
'Cause, I need to get
outta here pronto!

220
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,708
Floor it, or whatever you do!

221
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,083
Which way?

222
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,791
[DANDY] Uh?

223
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,541
[DANDY] Down will go to
hell with the kinda luck

224
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,250
I've been having,
so-- Up, please!

225
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,625
Huh? We're at
the last stop already?

226
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,916
I just wanna go
back to my old life.

227
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,750
Killing time on a
rock full of ghosts

228
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,916
ain't the Dandy way, baby.

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I gotta be me!

230
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,916
You want to go back?

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,041
Yeah.

232
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,833
[POE] This is a place
between worlds. A way station.

233
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:18,916
This whole world is a place
for the dead to find repose.

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,250
Only one living being remains,

235
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,125
longing for
companionship. It's me.

236
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,250
[DANDY] That's pretty deep.

237
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,958
Are you a goddess or something?

238
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:43,166
[POE] No goddess I, but
something simpler to comprehend.

239
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
I am the Planet Limbo.

240
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,083
[POE] I am its
curiosity personified.

241
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:54,458
The Night Porters, on the
other hand, are its logic.

242
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,708
Years ago, in another time,

243
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,458
this was a vibrant,
living world.

244
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,750
But then, its inhabitants
fell to fighting,

245
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,458
and used their wondrous
creations to kill each other.

246
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,375
[POE] Of course,
the war had no victors.

247
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,833
Ghosts are all that remain.

248
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,500
[POE] The souls
of our dead thrum

249
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,833
with a certain magnetism.

250
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,750
Wandering souls are
drawn to this place,

251
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,875
lured in by their essence.

252
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,291
I was lonely for decades.

253
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,791
For centuries. For eons.

254
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:42,083
There was no one.
But then you arrived.

255
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,833
Impossible.
You're the one--!

256
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,416
It can't be. How could it?

257
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,583
Huh? What's up?

258
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,541
[POE] Look.

259
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,375
I can't send you back
to before you perished,

260
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:00,250
but maybe I can send you
to another dimension.

261
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,041
Another dimension?

262
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,083
[POE] Yes.

263
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,416
Perhaps you can escape to one

264
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,708
in which the dark nebula
didn't signal your end.

265
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,041
It's possible.

266
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,458
I'm kinda
outta my league.

267
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,750
Yes. You will live anew.

268
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,083
But it requires much energy.

269
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,333
To put you back where you
belong I must use all of Limbo.

270
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,916
Wait! But that's--!

271
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,375
Why'd you do it?

272
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,791
I had to.

273
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,541
Because I love you.

274
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,000
'Kay fair enough.

275
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,916
I mean, I do look pretty
good for a dead guy.

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,041
And you're the
prettiest planet ever.

277
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,458
[DANDY] I just
realized something.

278
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,458
Honestly, it kinda
doesn't matter where I go.

279
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Whether
I'm alive or dead.

280
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,166
I'm still pretty dandy.

281
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,208
[QT] We're coming out
of the dark nebula!

282
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,125
And not a moment too soon!

283
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,125
[MEOW] Yeah, no
freakin' kidding!

284
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,750
I thought we were
goners for sure.

285
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,958
[QT] Wait. Where's Dandy?

286
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,250
Ah. Found 'im.

287
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,875
[QT] No way.

288
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,541
[MEOW] We almost died just now,

289
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,083
and there he is, taking a nap?

290
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[QT] Should we wake him up?

291
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,833
[MEOW] Quieter if we don't.

292
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,666
[QT] Yeah, you're right.

293
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,041
[DANDY] All those far away
stars you see shining in space?

294
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,375
They could already be dead.

295
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,666
I'm something of a star in
space myself. Who knows?

296
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,500
Maybe I'm already dead, too.

297
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,958
That's why I say screw it!

298
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,000
Next time, "We're All Fools,
So Let's All Dance, Baby."

299
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,416
See ya' on the dance floor.
