1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,875
[SCARLET] Sorry, Dandy.

2
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,291
But that's an alien commonly
found in Nebula M78.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,916
Wha...? Bastard!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,541
Why didn't ya tell me
you're from Nebula M78?

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,458
[QT] What?

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,500
Y'know, it's a lot harder

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,833
to find rare aliens
than I thought.

8
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,875
[DANDY] I really thought
we had one this time.

9
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,666
[QT] Looks like we'll have to
tighten our belts for a while.

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,416
[SCARLET] Wait, I have
a proposition for you.

11
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,125
Would you like to work for me?

12
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,125
You want me to pose
as your boyfriend?

13
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,000
[MEOW] Are you really
that hard-up, lady?

14
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,291
[SCARLET] My ex is
still very attached.

15
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,166
He won't stop following me.

16
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,875
But I have a feeling
that once he sees

17
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,208
I've moved on to someone new,

18
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,500
he'll leave me alone
and move on himself.

19
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,375
Well, that and I have some paid
vacation days I need to use.

20
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,833
Why don't we plan for this week?

21
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,041
Wait a sec.

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,666
You're not even gonna
ask me if I'm free?

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,125
[SCARLET]
Oh, you're free.

24
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,416
Burn.

25
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,958
[SCARLET] You'll be
compensated for your time.

26
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,625
How does seven-hundred-and-fifty
woolongs an hour sound?

27
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
Like chump change!

28
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,958
You're gonna have
to pay a stud

29
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,208
like me a lot more
than that to--

30
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:58,916
[QT] He'll do it!

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,791
Yeah, you can have him.

32
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,375
Hey!

33
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,000
[MEOW] This schmuck's had his
fill of unpaid vacation days.

34
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,583
So feel free to
work him extra hard.

35
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,000
[QT] If he gets paid
seven-hundred-and-fifty woolongs

36
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,333
an hour, then he'll make--

37
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,000
You kinda owe us one, Dandy.

38
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,541
That last alien took us a week
to catch and we got zip for him.

39
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,041
Tell me.
Will you do it?

40
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,666
Fine, I'll be
your "boyfriend."

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,125
So what do you
want me to do?

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,458
Oh, come now,
isn't it obvious?

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,916
You're going to take
me to Planet Trendy.

44
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,125
[NARRATOR] This is Planet
Trendy, a poppin' joint

45
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,750
where you'll find
the hippest couples

46
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,375
in the universe droppin'
it like it's hot.

47
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,041
If you wanna show your bae

48
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,250
that you da man then
you best 'turn up' here.

49
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,708
Ur'body in the
place be swaggin'.

50
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,083
Don't matter whether shorty

51
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,125
like hangin' outdoors or
gettin' crunk in da club,

52
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,750
if you got the scrilla then
Planet Trendy got yo back.

53
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,041
[SCARLET]
For the next week

54
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,583
you'll be posing
as my boyfriend.

55
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,000
Although we have
a verbal agreement,

56
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,583
I decided to draw up a contract.

57
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,750
Was that necessary?

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,166
Mistress Scarlet,
referred to as Party A,

59
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,000
and Mr. Dandy, Party B, have
agreed to pose as a couple.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,750
Party B will refrain from
unsolicited physical contact

61
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,250
with Party A or the
contract will be terminated.

62
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,291
What language is that?

63
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,333
It ain't English.

64
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,541
I'll clarify.

65
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,666
Moderate physical
intimacy is allowed,

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,458
but anything more than that,

67
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,583
like trying to kiss me,
is forbidden.

68
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,833
If we're gonna be a couple,
then we should at least kiss.

69
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,541
[SCARLET]
We're posing as a couple.

70
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,916
Yeah, I know.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,291
But still, there's gotta be
a reason you chose me

72
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,791
to be your phony boyfriend.

73
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,583
I betcha deep down you've
got some feeling's for--

74
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,333
[SCARLET] If you must
know why I chose you,

75
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,000
it's because even if we were
the last two humans alive,

76
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,916
there's no way I'd ever
fall for a sleaze like you.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,333
[DANDY] Touché.

78
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,541
[DANDY] Where in
the hell are we?

79
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,166
[SCARLET] Here's your
schedule for the week.

80
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,416
I have different activities
planned each day.

81
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,458
[SCARLET] Today's date
is at a ski resort.

82
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,083
You can ski, can't you?

83
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,708
Of course, I can, baby! Bang!

84
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,083
Wait. Where's Dandy?

85
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,916
[DANDY] Yeah!

86
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,750
[DANDY] Woo-hoo!

87
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,833
[SCARLET] Here you go;
sorry about that.

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,000
How could you?

89
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,791
[DANDY] Chill out,
I was just borrowing it.

90
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,416
[SCARLET] If you don't
ask first, it's stealing! Crap.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,083
Come on, handsome!

92
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,833
Let's go and show
these slopes who's boss!

93
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,000
Uh-- kay.

94
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,375
Uh-oh. Did I lose him?

95
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,166
Hey, look what I found!
Unregistered aliens!

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,458
What in the--? Wait!

97
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,125
I'm off the clock, Dandy!

98
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,125
Any naughty kids around?

99
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,208
[DANDY] I caught a
buncha new alien species!

100
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,875
Now to get 'em to the
registration center!

101
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,125
[SCARLET] Sorry to
keep you waiting.

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,041
Whoa.

103
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,125
[SCARLET] Something wrong?

104
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,625
No, uh-- I like your
hair down like that.

105
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,708
It looks really good.

106
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,375
Hey!

107
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,583
[GIRL 23A] I'd love to but
what about your girlfriend?

108
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,333
She won't know;
she's nappin', baby!

109
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,041
[GIRL 23A] Well,
in that case, count me in!

110
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,125
[COUPLE MAN 23A] Another
couple chasing each other

111
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,083
down the beach.

112
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,666
[COUPLE WOMAN 23A] How romantic!

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,208
Where's Dandy?

114
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,041
He was just here.

115
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,458
[DANDY] I found another
unregistered alien!

116
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
I can't believe
I've caught so many!

117
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
And it's only day two!

118
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,333
[SCARLET] So we're clear,

119
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
if you catch one more alien
this week, the deal's off.

120
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,500
You shouldn't
think about work

121
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,541
while we're on a date.

122
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,166
Sorry, baby, but
when an alien hunter

123
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,583
sees an unregistered alien,

124
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,500
he's got no choice
but to go for it.

125
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,666
Everything
you've caught 'til now

126
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,125
has been worthless.

127
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,458
So why are you suddenly finding
all these valuable aliens?

128
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,708
That squid yesterday?

129
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,375
I got five-thousand
woolongs for the thing.

130
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,916
What's with the face, baby?

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,125
I promise I won't catch anymore.

132
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,958
I can't believe you brought
a giant squid on our date.

133
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,541
I mean, who does that?

134
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,166
[DANDY] What's the
"Orbital S-K"?

135
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,333
[SCARLET] We're on it now.

136
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
It's an escalator
that can take you up

137
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,458
to the orbiting satellites.

138
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,541
We'll have a great
view of Bay Island's

139
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,000
space fireworks
festival from here.

140
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,791
[DANDY] Fireworks!
They're so pretty!

141
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
[SCARLET] Here you go;
sorry about that.

142
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,083
I don't think

143
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,333
this "pretend boyfriend"
thing is working out.

144
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,000
We should call it off
before I murder you.

145
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,541
Fine with me!

146
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,125
Three whole days and no sign
of your "stalker" ex-boyfriend.

147
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,375
Makes me think you
were just imagining things.

148
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,166
Scarlet, my love.

149
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,250
[COUPLE WOMAN 23A] Those
are the biggest fireworks

150
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,083
I've ever seen!

151
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,666
Whoa. What is that?

152
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,125
It's him.

153
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,583
[SCARLET] The man who's
completely obsessed with me.

154
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,125
Big guy. You like that?

155
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,083
[sighs]

156
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,250
Huh...

157
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:16,875
[scuffing noise]

158
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,125
[SCARLET] Uh...

159
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,125
What's the matter?

160
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,458
I'm stuck.

161
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,166
[DANDY] Oh! Don't you worry.

162
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,625
Let Dandy handle
it for ya, baby.

163
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,541
[DANDY] You don't need it!

164
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,708
[SCARLET] What?

165
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,916
Climb aboard.
You gonna get on or what?

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,250
No.

167
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,291
I'd do it for any girlfriend,
even a phony one.

168
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,041
[SCARLET]
That's very nice of you.

169
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,666
[SCARLET] Thanks,
but my house is right here.

170
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,583
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

171
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,833
Night, Dandy.

172
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,416
Goodnight, Scarlet.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,583
[screaming voice]

174
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,166
What's wrong?

175
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,000
Spider!

176
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,041
[DANDY] A what?

177
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
There's a giant spider
in the bathroom!

178
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,000
Heh! Come on!

179
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,333
It can't be any worse

180
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,583
than the freaky aliens at
the registration center.

181
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,875
Why're you so worked
up over a little spi--

182
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,958
Ahhhhh!!!

183
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,208
Damn spider!

184
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,125
On the bright side,

185
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,291
that thing'll never surprise
you in the bathroom again.

186
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,166
[muffled noises]

187
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,291
[laughter]

188
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,541
[SCARLET]
"On the bright side."

189
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,833
Yeah, I guess
we showed him!

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,833
[laughter]

191
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,125
I can't believe we made
such a mess of the place.

192
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,375
Uh-huh. I'm not
too worried about it.

193
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,625
Glad I've got insurance.

194
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,958
I'll just have to stay in
a hotel for a little while.

195
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,375
Oh wow.

196
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,708
Is that a copy of
"Missing in Action"?

197
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,375
I can't say
I'm surprised.

198
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,416
Nobody can survive
a blast like Chuck.

199
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,208
Hold up.
You're a Chuck fan?

200
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,666
'Course I am.

201
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,958
In fact, he's the reason I
started practicing martial arts.

202
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,583
I love him.

203
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,916
For real?

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,666
I've got a copy of "Karate
Kommandos" on my ship.

205
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,583
But that one's super rare!

206
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,875
[DANDY] He fights samurai
and sumo wrestlers!

207
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,791
You gotta see it!

208
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,250
Oh wow,
I would love to!

209
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,416
Thanks, Dandy!

210
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,875
That's the only one
I haven't seen yet!

211
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,333
Tell me, is animated Chuck
as cool as the real one?

212
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,291
[DANDY] Hell yeah!

213
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,666
When his friends get kidnapped,

214
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,708
he rides a dolphin into
the enemy's underwater base.

215
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,541
[SCARLET] Awesome!

216
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,708
[HONEY] Long time no see, Dandy!

217
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,416
[DANDY] Hey. What's up, Honey?

218
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,125
Hold on. Who is this?

219
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,333
Is she your new girlfriend?

220
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,208
He wishes.

221
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,583
I'll have the usual.

222
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,375
[HONEY] Sure thing!
What about you?

223
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,166
[SCARLET] May
I see the menu, please?

224
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,958
[DANDY] Dayum Honey!

225
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,708
You're lookin' good
in those shorts.

226
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,750
[HONEY] Cut it out, Dandy!

227
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,625
You're embarrassing me!

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,291
[SCARLET] Bourbon, rocks.

229
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,750
You got it!

230
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,708
Are you mad at
me or somethin'?

231
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,083
[SCARLET] Not really.

232
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,583
Look, if you're mad
then just say so!

233
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,916
[SCARLET] I don't know
what you're talking about.

234
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,791
[HONEY] Alright, here ya go!

235
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,583
One bourbon on the rocks
for the lady and-- Uh. Oh.

236
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,416
Hey, Dandy.

237
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,458
There's something goin' on

238
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,625
between the two
of you, isn't there?

239
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,500
[SCARLET] Strictly business.

240
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,791
[DANDY] It'll all
be over after tomorrow.

241
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,125
[SCARLET] Yep, that's right.

242
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,125
There's only one more day to go.

243
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,958
You guys are weird.

244
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,208
[DOLPH] Scarlet!

245
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,125
What in the hell?

246
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,125
[SCARLET] Dolph!

247
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,291
[DANDY] He's not
as big as I thought.

248
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
Bastard! Get your
damn hands off her!

249
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,625
Huh?

250
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,083
Dandy!

251
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,333
What do you think
you're doing, Dolph?

252
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,625
[DOLPH] It's okay, Scarlet.

253
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,041
You don't have to pretend
to like him anymore.

254
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,125
You were trying to make
me jealous, weren't you?

255
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,333
No, I--

256
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,166
[DOLPH] Sh! You don't
have to say a word.

257
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,500
You can't help it.

258
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,666
You love me so much you

259
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,750
can barely control
your feelings for me.

260
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,875
There's no need to
be ashamed, Scarlet.

261
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,958
I know exactly how you feel,

262
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,500
because I feel the
same way about you.

263
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,708
Hands off, freak!

264
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,250
C'mon, let's go!

265
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,291
You'll pay for that!

266
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,666
You're right. He's nuts!

267
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,375
Don't worry, love.
I'll save you from him!

268
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,750
Aw, crap. She's down!

269
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,541
[DOLPH] Get away from her!

270
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,958
Hurry!

271
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,041
Tell him you don't
wanna be with him!

272
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,208
I would have a long time ago

273
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,291
if I thought he'd listen!

274
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,583
[DANDY] You know
that's what got you

275
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,833
into this mess in
the first place, right?

276
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,666
You've gotta shoot
straight with him!

277
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,583
There's only one other
way to get the point across!

278
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,458
C'mere!

279
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,541
What the--?

280
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,541
[DOLPH] Scarlet, no!

281
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,625
How could you kiss another
man right in front of me?

282
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,750
[DOLPH] Can't you see that
you're breaking my heart?

283
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,791
[DOLPH] How can
you do this to me?

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,083
[NARRATOR] Not long after that,

285
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,375
Dolph was arrested
on multiple charges

286
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,583
of stalking and
aggravated assault.

287
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,416
As he was carted off
by the Trendy police,

288
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,916
he was hit with a restraining
order, preventing him

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,125
from coming within
ten-thousand parsecs of Scarlet.

290
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,291
Are you doin' alright?

291
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,708
[SCARLET] Yeah.

292
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,375
He's a piece a work.

293
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,916
I can't believe you
actually dated that guy.

294
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,333
[SCARLET] I don't know
what my problem is.

295
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,166
I guess I just have bad luck
when it comes to men.

296
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,375
No matter what I do, I always
seem to fall for losers.

297
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,916
Well, if that's the case,

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,875
you definitely won't be fallin'
for a champ like me.

299
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,000
I know that it's a little early,

300
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,125
but we can end the contract now.

301
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,583
It's not like we need to pretend
we're a couple anymore.

302
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,958
[DANDY] Hey, Scarlet?

303
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,458
Yeah?

304
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,125
I-- well, uh--

305
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,916
[DANDY] I guess I'll see you
at the registration center.

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,541
I guess so.

307
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,125
[SCARLET] Thank you,
for your help.

308
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,416
[DANDY] Yeah, sure.

309
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,875
[SCARLET] Goodbye, Dandy.

310
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,250
[QT] Wow! That job paid even
better than I thought it would!

311
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,791
Just look
at all this money!

312
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,875
Whaddya say we take this
party over to Boobies, baby?

313
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,833
Uh, Dandy?

314
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,875
[DANDY] Hm?
Yeah. Sure, let's go.

315
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,125
[QT] Dandy.

316
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,375
I thought you were gonna
come to Boobies with us!

317
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,583
[MEOW] We're gonna head out.
Just meet us there.

318
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,791
[QT] Is he asleep?
He must be worn out.

319
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,083
Hey guys.

320
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,291
Do you know what time it is?

321
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,666
[MEOW] Uh... It's a
little past eight. Why?

322
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,166
[DANDY] I can still make it!

323
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,958
Hey, Scarlet!

324
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,291
What? You've gotta
be kiddin' me!

325
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,958
I think you'd better
check it again!

326
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,625
Next in line, please.

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,041
[QT] Come on, Dandy.
Let's get outta here.

328
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,166
[DANDY] Whatever.

329
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:28,041
[alien language]

330
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,083
Huh?

331
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,041
[CATHERINE] Dandy.

332
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,166
I can't believe it's been

333
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,708
ten years since we broke up.

334
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,000
It feels like yesterday.

335
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,458
I miss you.

336
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,500
But I'm sure we're living in
different dimensions now.

337
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,500
Dandy.
