00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,083
[CAPYBARIAN] The Pororoca
phenomenon has been known

161
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,666
to occur in the river.

162
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,166
[DANDY] Pororoca?

163
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,333
[NARRATOR] Yes. When
a river flows backwards,

164
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:52,291
it may be referred to as
the Pororoca phenomenon.

165
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,666
The gravitational pull of
a satellite acts on the

166
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,875
surface water of a planet,
causing it to flow backwards

167
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,666
and create an immense,
seemingly endless wave.

168
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,916
The Pororoca phenomenon
is not limited

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,541
to planets but may also
occur in the River of Time,

170
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,375
which flows through space.

171
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,666
To put it simply,

172
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,500
it causes the past
to repeat itself.

173
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,458
You might think of
it as a give and take

174
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,916
between a planet
and its satellite.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,166
--which is not dissimilar
to the give and take

176
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,166
between a man and a woman;

177
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,833
two bodies acting
upon one another...

178
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,541
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,541
[NARRATOR] Oh. Forget
I said that last bit.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,625
[QT] According to
the GPS coordinates,

181
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,791
Dandy should be
somewhere in this area.

182
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,166
Looks like the
whole planet's a jungle.

183
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,541
Moving around down
there won't be easy.

184
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,166
So let's teleport directly
where we need to go.

185
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,166
[QT] Yeah! That'll give us a
chance to try out the remote.

186
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,916
[BOTH] Huh?

187
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,416
[BEA] Dr. Gel, sir.

188
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
We're nearing the location

189
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,666
where the River of Time
is said to flow.

190
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,625
[GEL] Good.

191
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,833
The Spacetrotter Guidebook,

192
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,583
Frontier Edition says:

193
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,750
"You never can
tell when you'll get

194
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,625
to see the Pororoca phenomenon.

195
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,250
If you catch it, count yourself
super lucky! Like, for real!"

196
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,583
We will succeed this time.

197
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,708
I demand it!

198
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,583
That no-good space
bum will not escape

199
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,416
from our clutches again.
We will capture him!

200
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,750
Yeah!

201
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,166
[QT] We had a few
false starts there,

202
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,125
but I think we finally
found the right place.

203
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
[MEOW] Did you see
those Mantisians?

204
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,041
When they were
chasing us I thought

205
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,208
we were gonna be
space dust for sure.

206
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,000
[QT] Yeah. And what
about the Wiggians?

207
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,416
They were freaky, too.

208
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
It seemed like they
were pretty desperate

209
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,458
to find an empty
scalp to call home.

210
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,875
If that's all
they really want,

211
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
I wish they'd save the shock
treatments for bald people.

212
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,083
[QT] And there
were so many.

213
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,750
If they'd caught us, we'd
be wearing wig stacks!

214
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,458
Yeah, like the wig version
of the pancake tower!

215
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:40,208
[UKELELEMAN] Well, here goes.
Time for a ukulele lullaby.

216
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:50,250
[UKULELE plays]

217
00:12:50,333 --> 00:13:03,166
[UKULELE plays]

218
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,500
[DANDY] Ah! Finally, here it is.

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,250
Fashionably late is
better than nothing.

220
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,125
[UKELELEMAN] You really came!

221
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,041
You're Space Dandy, aren't you?

222
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,416
Welcome to my home!

223
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,458
You have no idea

224
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,250
how long I've been
waiting to meet you.

225
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,625
No matter where you go,

226
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,750
you are the life
of the party.

227
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,041
I don't know what
I would've done

228
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,458
if you didn't come.

229
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,750
Easy. You're
gettin' really upset

230
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,958
about this, aren't you?

231
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:40,666
Upset?

232
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,666
No! This is me ecstatic!

233
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,125
It's kinda hard
to tell, ya know?

234
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, anyway,
where's the girl?

235
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,166
[UKELELEMAN] What girl?

236
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,291
The sexy, rare alien
who sent me that letter.

237
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,875
She waits for me.
I should go to her.

238
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,750
[UKELELEMAN] Unfortunately,
there seems to have been

239
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,541
a grave misunderstanding.

240
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,208
I know that's just part
of your charm, though.

241
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,791
There's no need
to cry about it, man.

242
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,875
[UKELELEMAN] I'm not
crying! I'm ecstatic!

243
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,208
Though I'm starting to
get a little angry now.

244
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,375
[DANDY] Well, you got
a great poker face.

245
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,083
So. Who are
you, anyway?

246
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,083
[UKELELEMAN] A rare
alien. I am Ukeleleman.

247
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,541
[UKELELEMAN] I am of a race
that is born utterly alone.

248
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,458
I am the only living
example of my kind.

249
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:28,875
As I was born, so am I
destined to die: alone.

250
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,041
Over time I've become

251
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,041
what you might call
a smile aficionado.

252
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
Now, at last, I've found it.

253
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,500
The crowning jewel
of all smiles!

254
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,541
I can't tell
you how little

255
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,375
I care about that.

256
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,625
Now go and
get the girl.

257
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,125
It's time to get
this party started,

258
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,541
don't ya think?

259
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,916
[UKELELEMAN]
It was me.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,916
[DANDY]
What's you?

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,916
[UKELELEMAN]
I wrote that letter.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,916
I'm the one who
invited you here.

263
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,458
Not a beautiful girl?

264
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,250
[UKELELEMAN] No.

265
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,458
How 'bout an ugly one?

266
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,833
[UKELELEMAN] No.

267
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,958
Don't be like that.
We can still party!

268
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,541
But first, let me see the
best smile in the universe.

269
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,458
Hey--where--?

270
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,625
A party with just two guys?

271
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,750
I did not come all the way out
here for a sausage festival.

272
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,083
[DANDY] What are these things?

273
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,666
Alien statues? Pretty realistic.

274
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,875
And each one is different.

275
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,625
Meow? QT?

276
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,416
[UKELELEMAN] You shouldn't
have come out this way.

277
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,875
This exit isn't for guests.

278
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,791
[DANDY] These two here.
I'm pretty sure I know 'em.

279
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,708
[UKELELEMAN] Oh, those?
Recent acquisitions.

280
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,166
They didn't work out.
You know how it is.

281
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,625
Their smiles just
weren't quite right.

282
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,041
[DANDY] Not cool. 

283
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,125
[UKELELEMAN] Sorry?

284
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,000
Not cool. You turned 'em
into statues?

285
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,166
[UKELELEMAN] I told you,
I'm an aficionado.

286
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,500
This is my life's work;
collecting smiles.

287
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,958
Obviously, I had to try out
a lot of different models.

288
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,083
[UKELELEMAN] But none worked.

289
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,291
I looked and I looked,

290
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,791
but I just couldn't
find my perfect match.

291
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,125
Of course,
until I saw you.

292
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,250
I want your smiling mug
for my collection.

293
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,916
People will like me so much more

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,750
with that grin
plastered on my face.

295
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,458
So go on, Dandy,
give us a smile.

296
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,166
Want me to smile for you?

297
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,333
I can't, not now.

298
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,916
How could
I possibly smile after

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,083
what you turned my friends into?

300
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,875
I'll never be able
to smile again, baby!

301
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,041
[UKELELEMAN] Oh, really?
Well, that's problematic.

302
00:16:50,708 --> 00:17:00,666
[Ukulele plays]

303
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,250
[Ukulele plays]

304
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,750
Hell no!

305
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,250
Whoa, hold on!

306
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,750
That's the Aloha Oe!

307
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,083
[DANDY] Hey!

308
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,166
[CAPYBARIAN] Hm?
Oh, you were here before.

309
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,208
That's not yours
by any chance, is it?

310
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,500
[DANDY] Hey, what're you doing?

311
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,541
That's not food! Get off!

312
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,583
Hey, uh.

313
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,416
That Pororoca thing in
the River of Time means

314
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,000
I can travel to the past, right?

315
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
Well, that's the theory.

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,916
That planet there
is coming closer.

317
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,958
Going now's your best chance.

318
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,833
[BEA] Dr. Gel.
Dandy's down there.

319
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,791
The Aloha Oe is ascending
through the planet's atmosphere.

320
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,000
[GEL] That's him?

321
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,875
[DANDY sighs]

322
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
Knew it would work.

323
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,833
I'll drag them back out
from a point in the past,

324
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,500
and they'll be as good as new.

325
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,458
It's Dandy, sir!

326
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,041
So we haven't even
traveled to the past.

327
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,125
No matter! I
want him captured!

328
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,333
[GEL] What is that?

329
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,750
That's Maman.

330
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,291
[GEL] Maman!

331
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,916
Who do you think you are,
you hairy pervert?

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,708
Get away from me!

333
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,916
[GEL cries]

334
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,916
Come on.

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,791
Where are that pinhead
'bot and bonehead cat?

336
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,708
[UKELELEMAN]
You give me no choice.

337
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,458
You said you would never
be able to smile again.

338
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,458
So I'll search the River of Time

339
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,083
for a version of
you from the past.

340
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,666
A version of you
that is smiling.

341
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,000
Past me?

342
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,708
[UKELELEMAN] Well
would you look at that!

343
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,458
You're right over there.

344
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,958
Unfortunately,
when I pull you out

345
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,166
of the past, the present
you will disappear.

346
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,458
That's just the way it works.
Nothing personal.

347
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,583
[DANDY] Hey! You guys!

348
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,166
Hey, QT, Dandy's here!

349
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,708
[QT] Everything okay, Dandy?
You look a little faint.

350
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,416
[DANDY] Whoa! What the--?

351
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,958
That ukulele-playing bastard!

352
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,916
[DANDY] Don't mess
with me, baby!

353
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,916
[UKELELEMAN] Oh, well.
It's alright.

354
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,791
It can end like this.

355
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,375
A smile probably wouldn't
have suited me, anyway.

356
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,541
[DANDY] Actually, baby.
You're smiling right now.

357
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,250
[UKELELEMAN] I am, really?

358
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:59,500
And is--
is it a good smile?

359
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,708
Good?

360
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,291
No, that's a great smile
you've got there.

361
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:26,875
[Ukulele plays]

362
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,250
[DANDY] I recognize that melody.

363
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,416
Yeah, that's totally it.

364
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,625
[CARPACCIO] Gyo gyo-gyo!

365
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:12,041
Uh-gyo wuh-were-we
cow-woowee yooweereeyow

366
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,791

367
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,500
ooh-ooh n'gyo-gyo-gyo-gyo

368
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,833
Gyo gyo-gyo! Go-ah-we-were!
