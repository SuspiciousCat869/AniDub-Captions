00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,875
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Space Dandy,

2
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,250
I may or may not
have mentioned

3
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,916
that the Gogol Empire and
the Jaicro Empire

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,416
are at war for
control of the galaxy.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,458
But they are.
It's kind of a big deal.

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,541
And now, the Jaicro Empire

7
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,166
has just deployed a
legendary giant weapon

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,750
that is sure to turn
the tide in their favor.

9
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,541
[GEL] Their A.L.E.
is finally operable?

10
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:58,166
[PERRY] So it seems. No matter.
We shall not lose to them.

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,750
Admiral.

12
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,791
Surely you don't mean--You're
not thinking of using the CORE?

13
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,166
We can't, sir!

14
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,458
The Pyonium control of the
CORE is still not complete!

15
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,041
Please! Consider the
risks! It's too dangerous!

16
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,375
[PERRY] Too dangerous
is the goal, Doctor Gel.

17
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,833
Those Jaicro fools will not
outmaneuver the Gogol Empire!

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,500
[PERRY]
What?

19
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,500
See. I told you so.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,666
Yep, too dangerous.

21
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,125
[NARRATOR] And that
is how this enormous burst

22
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,875
of pure Pyonium energy

23
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,083
was scattered to the far
reaches of the universe.

24
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,208
[MEOW]
Is it just me,

25
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,083
or have we not caught
any aliens in forever?

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,583
[DANDY] Let's get back
at it tomorrow. Yeah?

27
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,875
[MEOW] Yeah. Tomorrow works
better for me anyway.

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,875
[QT]
Um. Hey, you guys?

29
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,708
Something weird is happening.

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,750
[QT and DANDY exclaiming]

31
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,000
[MEOW gasping]

32
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,458
[DANDY]
What did you just do?

33
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,000
[QT] I didn't do anything,
thank you very much.

34
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,916
But we are going to need
a mechanic to fix it.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,333
[DANDY] Where do we
find one of those?

36
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,000
[QT] Closest one?
On Betelgeuse, actually.

37
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,208
[meows]

38
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,541
[DANDY] Where have I
heard that name before?

39
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,333
Planet Blahblahblahjuice.

40
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,041
[QT] Planet Betelgeuse.
It's over there.

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,958
Not the normal sized one;
the little guy on the left.

42
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,916
Meow, that's your
home planet, right?

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,416
[MEOW] Yeah, listen--
I vote we hold out

44
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,916
for the next closest mechanic.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,750
What's wrong?
You don't wanna go home?

46
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,541
[MEOW]
No, absolutely not.

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,208
Well, tough! 'Cause we're goin'!

48
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,708
What part of 'absolutely
not' did you not get?

49
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,541
Aw, relax. You should know by
now the things we don't want

50
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,875
to happen most always
end up goin' down.

51
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,083
[QT]
You can see your parents.

52
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,875
And no hotel cost.
One stone, two birds.

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,916
[DANDY]
I love birds!

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,708
[MEOW]
No, and no means no!

55
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,458
Nice. Meow's House, yeow!

56
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,291
Man!

57
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,041
I've never hated you more!

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,500
What is all that racket? Mew?

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,375
It's you! You're home!

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,375
[MEOW'S MOM]
Surprise, everyone! Mew's back!

61
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
[MEOW'S MOM] Mew, if you'd
said you were coming,

62
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,500
I'd've had more food, but since
you didn't, I'm afraid I don't.

63
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,916
I'm so sorry!

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Your name is "Mew"?
Like, for real?

65
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,500
No, my full name is...

66
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,500
[indistinct meow-like sound]

67
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,041
Mew is just a nickname.

68
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,583
[MEOW'S MOM] Thank you so much
for putting up with my son.

69
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,791
I'm Mew's mother;
it's nice to meet you.

70
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,125
Oh right, Mew.
Show him your thingie.

71
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,583
The do-dad you won a prize
for when you were little.

72
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,208
I'd rather not, Ma.

73
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,666
[QT] And who are
these adorable creatures?

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,625
[MEOW] Those are
my little brothers.

75
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,833
--[QT] Please stop.
--[MALE VOICE] I'm home.

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,583
-- and mine are hurting.
-- Hey. Dad.

78
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,500
Been a long time, huh?

79
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,625
Mew? Good to see ya, boy.

80
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,750
It's a pleasure, Meow's dad.

81
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,125
My name is Dandy, but you ca--

82
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,250
[MEOW'S MOM] Oh my stars!
We're short on blankets.

83
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,375
Will you be staying
with us for very long?

84
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,125
[QT] Uh, yes, we'll be here
until our spaceship is fixed.

85
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,708
[MEOW'S DAD]
All right.

86
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,250
There's not a lot to do here,

87
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,625
but please make
yourselves at home.

88

[MEOW] Wow, my room
is just like I left it.

89
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,500
So what's the story?

90
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,375
Why did you leave
this planet, anyway?

91
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,833
Why did I leave?

92
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,583
Maybe because the
most interesting thing

93
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,833
here is the Jal-Mart.

94
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,625
I left cause...

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,416
Math. Eight points.

You are dumb!

[DANDY and QT laughing]

98
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,125
[MEOW]
Stop that!

99
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,333
When did I say you jerks
could look through my stuff?

[OLDEST SISTER]
Um, Mom?

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,583
I need money for
a reference book?

106
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,958
I gave you money yesterday.

107
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,625
That was for a train pass.

108
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,958
Well, if you need that book,
get used to walking.

109
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,708
The swimming season has begun!

Oh, thank you!

That's so sweet, Q!

Hold on! Wait for me,
wait for me!

116
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,208
So, what do we do now?

117
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,750
I dunno.

118
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,041
Guess first we oughta see how
the Aloha Oe's comin' along.

to replace won't be here

until tomorrow, so, I'm sorry.

121
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,375
I won't be able to fix it today.

122
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,375
Eh, boo. This probably means
no Boobies until tomorrow, huh?

123
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,375

No Boobies until tomorrow.

That sucks.

We've been metalworkers
for generations.

130

like an appliance or something.

Kind of vague, but okay.

so I'm supposed to take over.

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,958
[DANDY] So then,
why didn't you do that?

134
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,916
[MEOW] Because I didn't want
to live on this backwoods,

the rest of my life.

Working! I'm a server, silly.

glasses aren't cheap, y'know.

157
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,500
Get it together.

158
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,833
I'm so sorry.

159
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
That old bat.
I'll get her together!

160
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,625
Look. Isn't that Meow's dad?

161
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,166
[LIL' MAMA]
You're early today.

162
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,666
Yeah.

163
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
So is that your boy there?

164
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,375
He's been drinking
nonstop since this afternoon.

165
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,791
You're making it big out
in space, aren't ya, kid?

166
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,250
Your dad always brags
on ya when he drinks.

167
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,916
'Bout how his son's off
travelling the galaxy--

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,708
Mama, that's enough.

169
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,833
[MEOW'S DAD] Mister Dandy. So
tell me. What's that space like?

170
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,583
[DANDY]
I dunno. Big, I guess?

171
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,250
And there're these great
restaurants called Boobies.

172
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,625
Boobies, ya say?

173
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,708
Oh yeah. An' I tell ya'
the name says it all, baby.

174
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,208
If you like boobs,
it's the only place to be.

175
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,708
Dude, stop!

176
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,125
[MEOW'S DAD]
I love boobs.

177
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,583
Ew, I don't want to hear
my dad talking like that! Gross.

178
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,666
[MEOW'S MOM] Oh, good morning,
Mister Dandy.

179
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,750
[OLDEST SISTER] Um, Mom? I need
money for a reference book?

180
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,958
[MEOW'S MOM] Oh thank you!
That's so sweet, Q!

181
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,125
[QT] Don't worry about it.
I like cleaning.

182
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,250
[MEOW yawning]

183
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,750
[MEOW]
I slept awesome.

184
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,166
The swimming season has begun!

185
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,333
So, what do we do now?

186
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,875
I dunno.

187
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,291
Guess first we oughta see how
the Aloha Oe's comin' along.

188
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,458
[MECHANIC] I won't be
able to fix it today.

189
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,333
Eh, boo. So, no Boobies
until tomorrow, huh?

190
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,416
[QT]
Look. Isn't that Meow's dad?

191
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,000
[MEOW]
That's our family's factory.

192
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,583
It's good to see you, Mew.

193
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,458
[MEOW coughs]

194
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,708
[MEOW]
Katie?

195
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,125
[NARRATOR] And I'm sure
you've all caught on by now.

196
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,833
The strong magnetic fields
generated by the Pyonium blast

197
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,041
twisted the fabric of time
and space into a Möbius,

198
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,583
thus causing our heroes

199
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,000
to become trapped
in a space-time loop.

200
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,583
Basically, they're repeating the
same day over and over again.

201
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,875
Though no surprise,
Blockhead, Bonehead,

202
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,375
and Pinhead have yet
to notice this themselves.

203
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,916
You'd think Bonehead
might be the first to suspect,

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,166
this being his
home planet, but no.

205
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,916
Actually, it was Pinhead,

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,875
who on the 88th loop
finally thought to ask:

207
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,041
[QT] Is it me,
or does every day here

208
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,250
seem like the same
thing over and over?

209
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,500
I think it just feels that way

210
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,416
because this joint
is so monotonous.

211
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,750
[QT]
Makes sense.

212
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,208
[NARRATOR]
They still didn't get it.

213
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,500
Until, finally,
on the 108th loop...

214
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,791
That's weird.

215
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,625
A glass is gonna break.

216
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,958
[KATIE]
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,208
[MEOW]
Dad's here!

218
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,166
Yeah.

219
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,083
I have a feeling that
Meow's dad loves boobies.

220
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,666
Hey, I do love boobs.

221
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,708
[QT] I keep sensing
what's about to happen!

222
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,125
[DANDY] Isn't this the sixth
sense? Are we psychic now?

223
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,291
[MEOW] Even better. I think we
totally have superpowers!

224
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,000
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

225
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,625
[NARRATOR] No, you idiots do
not have super powers;

226
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,375
you're in a loop--a time loop!

227
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,125
Get it through your heads
and get on with the story!

228
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,958
--Sorry.
--Sorry.

229
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,625
[NARRATOR]
And thus,

230
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,916
our intrepid heroes
finally noticed

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,625
they were in a time loop.

232
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,583
[LIL' MAMA]
Oh, Katie.

233
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,958
Those glasses
aren't cheap, y'know?

234
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,250
Aw shut up, old lady!

235
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,916
I've heard your crap
over a hundred times, now!

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,666
[QT] Hey, you wanna
shoot me in the face

237
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,291
and see if I wake up tomorrow?

238
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,833
Only if I shoot me first.

239
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
[QT] You know, if
tomorrow never comes,

240
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,958
you won't be able to
go to Boobies ever again.

241
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,541
What?

242
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,166
[QT] That part for the Aloha Oe
won't come in until tomorrow,

243
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,750
and it's only ever today.

244
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,958
You pinhead!

245
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
You should have told
me that to begin with!

246
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:51,583
[panting]

247
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,958
Look, bro. Is that...

[indistinct meow-like sound]?

249
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,166
Heck yeah it is.

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,291
[indistinct meow-like sound]!

251
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,708
That's awesome.

[MEOW]
Oh, hey, it's you guys.

253
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,041
Some people don't change at all.

254
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,583
These are a couple of
friends from junior high.

Hey, Meow's friends.

Believe it.

00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,083
Yo, we're about to go
play some video games

260
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,250
if you wanna come,
like, hang out and stuff.

Dude. Weak!

262
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,166
If tomorrow is never gonna come,

263
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,583
then I'll just have
to go after it myself!

264
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,791
[MALE FRIEND 10A]
For real, man?

[rooster crowing]

267
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,666
There's gotta be a
reason we're stuck in today.

268
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,208
[QT]
Probably, yeah.

269
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,416
[MEOW]
I hate this!

270
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,291
Why can't we leave
this crap planet?

271
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,541
And why do we have to live the
same crap day over and over?

272
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,875
I left because
I hated being here.

273
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,375
This is like my hell.

I can't believe you
still have all this stuff.

281
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,458
Your dad took such
good care of your things.

282
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,125
He was so happy that
you wanted to be like him.

283
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,958
Another metalworker.

[MEOW'S MOM] Oh, here it is!
Look what I found.

[QT]
What is it?

00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,500
[MEOW'S MOM] It's a replica of

Isn't that right, sweetie?

I don't even remember.

Hi, Dad.

So um-- Do you mind
if I help you out a little?

297
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,708
[MEOW] I used to think
my dad was so cool.

298
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,875
I'd watch him work like this
all the time when I was a kid.

it's not that bad after all.

00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,208
It's not "what seems
like the same thing."

311
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,250
We're actually doing
the same thing.

312
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,291
[MALE FRIEND 10A]
Check it!

313
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,791
[indistinct meow-like sound]
is here!

314
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,291
[MEOW]
Whoa. Dandy?

315
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,583
Yeah, we've been playing
video games all day, yo.

316
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,541
Dandy knows what's up.

317
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,208
Dude games like whoa.

318
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,458
[QT] So, basically, I'm the only
one seriously concerned

319
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,166
about our little
time loop problem.

320
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,125
[MALE FRIEND 10A] Man,
problems ain't no problem.

321
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,166
[QT]
What?

322
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
Problems up the wazzoo?

323
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,625
Get yo ass to Wahoo!

324
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,625
Anything you need
to know, just go where?

325
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,916
Wahoo Answers, y'all.

326
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,625
[MEOW] Tomorrow will not come.
What should I do?

327
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,375
[QT] I'm still not
convinced this will work.

328
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,708
[MEOW]
Someone replied!

329
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,708
[QT]
That was fast.

330
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,000
[MEOW]
There's more than one.

331
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,125
"Gogol it, idiot!"

332
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,541
"Look it up, lazy."

333
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,541
"Try tearing the page off the
calendar, genius. LOL."

334
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,000
[QT]
Bleeping trolls.

335
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,750
Aw, come on!

336
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,333
What the heck?

337
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,291
[QT] Do you guys really
think this calendar might

338
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,666
be the reason we keep
living the same day over?

339
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,208
[MEOW]
This is so stupid!

340
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,791
That's it.

341
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,250
So Mr. Tough Calendar thinks he
can just push us around--huh?

342
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,958
Whoa! What was that?

343
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,166
[QT]
Good news.

344
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,208
We definitely found
the cause of the loop.

345
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,125
[NARRATOR] And thus, the heroic
battle for tomorrow began

346
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,166
between man and paper calendar.

347
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,208
Tomorrow!

348
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,166
[DANDY] Just look at'im gloat.
Stupid cocky ass calendar.

349
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,625
[QT]
Why am I already so tired?

350
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,833
Y'know what?

351
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,416
Maybe I should stay
here and marry Katie.

352
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,833
I'm just kidding; I got the
jokes. I kill me.

353
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,958
[KATIE]
I can't marry you.

354
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,458
What? I said I was kidding.

355
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,333
Maybe kinda awkwardly, but--

356
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,875
I'm sorry. I thought
you already knew.

357
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,500
[MEOW]
Er-- knew what?

358
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,708
I'm gay.

359
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,541
[QT]
Wait, calm down!

360
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,833
That page.

361
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,625
Why do you want
to tear it off so bad?

362
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,125
Daddy?

363
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,458
[QT] Because if we don't,
there will never be a tomorrow.

364
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,208
But if we tear off too
many pages it could send us

365
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
who knows where into the future.

366
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,500
It's about point
one millimeters thick.

367
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,000
Think you can cut it?

368
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,166
Maybe.

369
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,250
I'm a metalworker.
It's in my blood.

370
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,000
[MEOW and QT]
All right!

371
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,208
Look, we can tear off as
many pages as we want now!

372
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,041
[QT] I've never been so happy to
know there will be a tomorrow!

373
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,708
[DANDY] Awesome! Let's get
our asses to Boobies!

374
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,041
[QT] Thank you for taking care
of us for such a long time.

375
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,541
[MEOW'S MOM] Now you come back
whenever you want, you hear?

376
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,833
[DANDY]
See ya later.

377
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,083
[QT]
Dandy.

378
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,125
[DANDY]
Oh.

379
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,541
[MEOW] Dad. I'm sorry.
It's just that I--

380
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,583
Meow, get out there
and see space.

381
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,666
Go, live the life you want.

382
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,958
[MEOW]
Thanks, Dad.

383
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,750
[MEOW'S DAD] Go on.
Your friends are waiting.

384
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,625
Hold up! So you know that
part we make at our factory?

385
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,125
What is that thing?
What's it used for?

386
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,416
Huh? I dunno.

387
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,916
I suppose it's some part
of an appliance. Probably.

388
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,958
[BROTHERS] Bye-bye! You're
my hero, Mew! Bye-bye!

389
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,250
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

390
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:26,500
[NARRATOR] And so our heroes
saw tomorrow. However--

391
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,041
[MEOW] Is it me, or have we not
caught any aliens in forever?

392
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,125
[DANDY] Let's get back at
it tomorrow. Yeah?

393
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,791
[MEOW] Yeah. Tomorrow works
better for me anyway.

394
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,875
[NARRATOR] Whether or not
they're caught in a loop,

395
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,791
they're still pretty
much caught in a loop.

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,458
[BEA] Someone forgot to return
a book to the library.

397
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,500
Unfortunately,
that single act triggered

398
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,958
an unthinkable chain of events

399
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,125
that would ultimately drag
the entire galaxy into war.

400
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,833
Next time, "I'm Never
Remembering You, Baby"

401
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,833
Be sure to return
your books on time!
