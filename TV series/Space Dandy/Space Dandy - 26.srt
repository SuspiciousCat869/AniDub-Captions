1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,500
[DURAN] Puzzling.

2
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,750
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

3
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,041
Given the fact that your
DNA scan of that man

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,916
failed to turn up anything.

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,166
[DURAN]
Wait... Don't tell me...

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,041
Could it really be...?

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,375
Huh?

8
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,375
What?

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,583
Where did Dandy go?

10
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,166
No! He's gone!

11
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,500
[QT] The Gogol Empire's
taken Dandy!

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,375
[GEL] Welcome, Dandy.

13
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,583
You have no idea how anxious
I've been for this moment.

14
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,750
At last, I've found you.

15
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,791
[QT] I've found out where
they're keeping Dandy!

16
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,041
According to the GPS,

17
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,458
he's in the heart of the
Gogol Empire homeworld.

18
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,958
What? For real?

19
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,750
Isn't that an "impossible
to break into" kind of place?

20
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,416
[QT sighs]
Yeaaaah...

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,625
Your thoughts?

22
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,250
I'd rather not let him die.

23
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,416
A man like that is
as rare as it gets.

24
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,916
I agree.

25
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,208
[HONEY] Energy charge:
one hundred twenty percent!

26
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,166
We're heading
into the Gogol Empire!

27
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,666
I'm comfortable with that.

28
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,791
[QT] Roger that!

29
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,500
Then, full speed ahead!

30
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,875
So, who are you anyway?

31
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,708
[GEL] I can't say I'm terribly
surprised you don't know me.

32
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,333
You have somehow
always found a way

33
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,833
to escape my grasp
at the last moment.

34
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,416
[BEA] Doctor,
I'm picking up readings

35
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,041
of a large quantity of
Pyonium coming from Dandy.

36
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,833
Even better they're
still increasing!

37
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,250
I knew it.

38
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,666
Tell me the truth;

39
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,416
you can't pretend you don't
know anything about Pyonium.

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,833
Dandy.

41
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,333
Yeah, well, I don't.

42
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,916
This pyo-whats-a-stuff?

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,458
See, I can't even say it.

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,291
Now, if you want to
talk about booty--

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,500
[GEL] Play dumb all you want;
it honestly doesn't matter.

46
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,666
[GEL] The reason we've
pursued you for so long

47
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,041
is due to that Pyonium,

48
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,000
so we'll ascertain the truth
whether you sing or not.

49
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,416
We can simply take the matter
up with your body instead.

50
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,208
[GEL] Either way works for me.

51
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,250
And you're positive
about this?

52
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,125
[DURAN] If Dandy
winds up in their hands,

53
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,125
the entire universe
will fall directly

54
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,750
into the Gogol
Empire's clutches.

55
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,750
Should that happen,
your Excellency,

56
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,750
we'll never know victory again
and the world will be lost.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,875
Very well.

58
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,333
All stations
prepare for battle!

59
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,666
We're going to launch an assault
against the Gogol Empire

60
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,541
and save the universe!

61
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,583
[PERRY] Dr. Gel.

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,000
[GEL] Sir!

63
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,666
[PERRY] Finally you've
captured the elusive Dandy.

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,750
I must say, well done.

65
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,083
I do not deserve
such praise.

66
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,958
Who knew you'd randomly
catch Dandy's trial

67
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,833
while watching Court TV?

68
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,125
[PERRY] Extract the Pyonium

69
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,250
from the captive
as soon as possible.

70
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,083
Thanks to the development
of the Hulkider.

71
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,333
Correction: The Super Hulkider.

72
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,416
Our new weapon
is ready and waiting.

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,250
If we can get the
Pyonium to make it work,

74
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:55,375
we will be the masters
of the universe!

75
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,083
[DURAN] Theoretically, there are
a countless number of universes

76
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,958
that exist parallel to our own.

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,375
However, we have never
been able to cross over

78
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,958
to these other dimensions,

79
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,250
nor even had a glimpse
of their actual existence.

80
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,041
That being said,
we know of connections

81
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,000
that run through the dimensions
called cosmic strings.

82
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,708
These strings can be pulled out

83
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,791
into one universe
using M.E.G.A. Pyonium.

84
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,125
By gaining control
over these connections,

85
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,833
we should be able to
manipulate any possibility.

86
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,583
Some might even call
such a feat the work of God.

87
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,541
Only one man in the
universe holds that key.

88
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,333
Dandy. I must say,
I did not see that coming.

89
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,125
[JOHNNY] All hands, as soon
as we've completed warp,

90
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,625
commence the attack!

91
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,166
[alarms blaring]

92
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,625
What's going on?

93
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,708
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
A massive fleet has just

94
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,083
dropped out of warp space!

95
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,458
It's the Jaicro Empire!

96
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,958
How could they have known?

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,375
[MALE OPERATOR 11A]
They're attacking!

98
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,000
[MEOW] I'm gonna hurl!

99
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,375
[QT] I think we're in
the middle of a battle

100
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,041
between the Gogol Empire
and the Jaicro Empire!

101
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,333
What?

102
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course we dropped
into the middle of a war!

103
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,125
This is our chance!

104
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,541
[HONEY] Then let's do it!

105
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,375
Sorry, Dr. Gel.

106
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,541
I hate to break this to you,

107
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,958
but I'm afraid I have
to take Dandy now.

108
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,041
[GEL] You shot me? Why?

109
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,416
[PERRY] What? But-- What?

110
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,750
[DANDY] Come on, fellas.

111
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,291
I think we need
to talk feelings.

112
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:16,208
[GEL] Say it isn't so, Bea.
Say it isn't so.

113
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,041
It's so.

114
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,041
Hey, Dandy, I need to
put you to sleep, okay?

115
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,208
[DANDY] Like hell you do!

116
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,625
Let me out of here!

117
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,333
[SCARLET] If we don't move it,

118
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,791
we won't live long
enough to save Dandy!

119
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,666
[HONEY] Where is he now?

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,708
[QT] The GPS reading

121
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,541
is currently coming
from that tower.

122
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,833
[MEOW] Aw!

123
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,583
You mean we have to
go all the way over there?

124
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,000
Charge through them;
fire at will!

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
[PERRY] What a
disappointment, Bea.

126
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,666
You were a Jaicro spy
this whole time?

127
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,416
You bet I was,

128
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,125
but technically I'm
nobody's spy anymore.

129
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,166
[PERRY] I'm confused.

130
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,875
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

131
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,458
Oh, I've secured Dandy.

132
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,458
But circumstances have changed.

133
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,000
Tell the Jaicro
commander-in-chief that uh--

134
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm in charge now,
and I'm sick and tired

135
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,416
of being pushed
around by you guys.

136
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,583
Adios Muchachos!

137
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,541
[GENERAL 20B] Your Excellency!

138
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,500
Our connection with
the spy has been cut off!

139
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,916
Cut off? Go! Now!

140
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,791
[MEOW] Are you sure
we can't turn back?

141
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,875
If we leave him, we'll
be in even more danger.

142
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,541
How much farther
to the tower?

143
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
[QT] Let me see.

144
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,833
[SCARLET] See faster!
This ship won't last long!

145
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,125
[BEA] I'll be taking
the Pyonium for myself.

146
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,916
Whoever possesses it--

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
--will be able to
rule the whole universe!

148
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,333
Basically, I'm going to
be King of All the Things!

149
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
I'll be a god!

150
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,541
[screams]

151
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,750
[SCARLET] This isn't good!

152
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,291
[HONEY] There has to
be some way out of here!

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,916
[QT] Might as well. Bam!

154
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,875
All right!

155
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,291
Sir, they're planning
to use the Pyonium

156
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,250
to activate their
massive weapon overhead.

157
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,958
I figured as much.

158
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,958
So how do we stop them?

159
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,333
Where in the tower
is Dandy being held?

160
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,541
[QT] Well, the GPS readings
are actually coming

161
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,208
from the very top, so--

162
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,458
What?

163
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,375
Why didn't you say that
before we started down?

164
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,958
I think we're
being attacked.

165
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,666
Those are the
Gogol patrol robots.

166
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,791
Can you shake them?

167
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,416
I can try!

168
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,750
[PERRY] That treacherous
Bea. He'll pay.

169
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,750
I'll kill him for this!

170
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,375
Surprise. Here's Johnny.

171
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,791
[PERRY] Commander Johnny?

172
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,208
[JOHNNY] Long time
no see Admiral Perry.

173
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,125
[PERRY] Indeed.
How did you get up here?

174
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
How do you think?

175
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,166
So, what do you say?

176
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,166
Shall we settle things
right here, right now?

177
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,708
Oh yes, my time
has finally come!

178
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,333
From this moment on, I will
be ruler of the universe!

179
00:14:55,416 --> 00:15:00,583
[GEL] Not so fast.
I'm not dead yet, friend!

180
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,083
I've worked far
too hard to get Dandy.

181
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,958
I'll crush anyone who
tries to take him from me!

182
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,166
[HONEY] Yeah! All right!

183
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,541
[JOHNNY] What's so funny?
Don't you value your life?

184
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,583
[PERRY] Go ahead and shoot.

185
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,583
A gun is hardly going
to put an end to things.

186
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,166
[JOHNNY] What?

187
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,500
[PERRY] Once the weapon starts,
no one will be able to stop it.

188
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,333
You're insane!

189
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,291
[PERRY] Insane and winning.

190
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,416
You've known the virtual
image of a nightmare;

191
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
now meet the real thing.

192
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,791
Ah!! Dandy!

193
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,666
[QT] Are you alive?

194
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,166
Hi Dandy!

195
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, hey guys!

196
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,166
[DANDY] Thanks for saving me.

197
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,666
I probably owe you one for that.

198
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,166
[GEL] Dandy.

199
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,750
It's up to you.

200
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,708
If you don't stop that weapon,
the whole of the universe--

201
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,041
[coughs]

202
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,666
--will disintegrate
into nothing.

203
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,708
[DANDY]
QT, where's the Aloha Oe?

204
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,916
Bad news.

205
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,125
[QT] Even the Little
Aloha got all busted up.

206
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,000
Dandy.

207
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,416
I would be honored
to let you use my ship.

208
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,708
[DANDY] Listen up, everyone.

209
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,375
I'm going to do this alone.

210
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,083
Aww!

211
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,250
That's crazy talk.

212
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,875
How are you gonna get
all the way up there

213
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,541
and stop it
without any help?

214
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,666
[QT] What Meow said!

215
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,666
You don't seem to grasp

216
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,583
the significance
of us rescuing you.

217
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,208
[HONEY] Yeah, I mean, yeah!

218
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,500
We just got done saving you;
you can't go die!

219
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,250
[DANDY] I'm not gonna die!

220
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,333
[DANDY] Each one of you risked
your lives to come to my rescue.

221
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,916
And that's why I can't
let you throw away

222
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,458
your lives now; not for me.

223
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,708
Not again.

224
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,750
I got this. Don't worry
about me, babies.

225
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:35,000
[GEL] Go, Dandy. I believe.

226
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,500
[DANDY] What the hell?

227
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,625
[roaring]

228
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,458
[strained grunting]

229
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,583
[DANDY]
Auuuuuggghhh!!

230
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,291
[QT] Anyone know
what that light's about?

231
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,916
Yeah, I got nothin'.

232
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,833
It's glorious.

233
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,000
[NARRATOR] My stars, Dandy,
you are a constant source of

234
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
"I don't know what."

235
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,083
[DANDY] Thanks. Wait.

236
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,375
I feel like I've heard
your voice before.

237
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,208
[NARRATOR]
That's because you have.

238
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,583
I've been watching
over you for a while, now.

239
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,500
Once as a Chameleonian,
but mostly as a narrator.

240
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,625
[DANDY] Huh?

241
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,166
[NARRATOR] I am one
who is not subject

242
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,416
to any physical restrictions.

243
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,333
I am one who can traverse the
entirety of time and space.

244
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,958
[DANDY] Wouldn't that make
you kinda like God, though?

245
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,333
[NARRATOR] Of course.

246
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,750
If that's what you want
to call me, I won't object.

247
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,208
[DANDY] Weird.

248
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,666
[NARRATOR]
You should have forgotten

249
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,166
your memories from
parallel universes.

250
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,666
I doubt you remember
the you who was a surfer,

251
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,166
the you who was a space racer,

252
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,500
or even the you
who was a trucker.

253
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,125
[DANDY] I don't
remember anything.

254
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,833
[NARRATOR] You are someone
who can conceivably be one

255
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,375
and the same while
simultaneously existing

256
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,541
in all other universes.

257
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,000
In other words, you are
the one and only being

258
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,958
who can freely pass between
the different dimensions.

259
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,625
[DANDY] Okay. So what
do you want from me?

260
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,750
[NARRATOR] This world,
over which I have reigned

261
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,125
for roughly fourteen
point eight billion years,

262
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,458
is now in a state of collapse.

263
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,083
All universes,
including the parallel ones,

264
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,416
will be coming
to an end as well.

265
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,666
[DANDY] Whoa.

266
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,791
[NARRATOR] This is more
than a "whoa," Dandy.

267
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,833
This is because of you.

268
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,666
[DANDY] Whoa.

269
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,833
[NARRATOR] Okay.

270
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,916
After it disappears
into a singularity,

271
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,250
the world will be reborn.

272
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,041
Which means I need a successor.

273
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,666
[NARRATOR]
Dandy, you are the only one

274
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,625
who is worthy to take
on the role of God.

275
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,083
[NARRATOR] Um. What's wrong?

276
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,458
[DANDY] This being God thing,

277
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,708
does that mean I won't
have a body anymore?

278
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,791
[NARRATOR] Of course.

279
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,583
God is one who
transcends all matter.

280
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,791
[DANDY] Oh. Without a body,

281
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,583
going to Boobies
won't be any fun.

282
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,750
[NARRATOR] Pardon?

283
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,541
[DANDY] This is the
stupidest idea ever.

284
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,083
I'm out. No God for me!

285
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,833
[NARRATOR] I don't understand.

286
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,958
You're seriously turning down
the opportunity to be God?

287
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,041
Believe it!

288
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,458
See ya, voice of God guy!

289
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,833
[NARRATOR] No, wait!

290
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,500
Stop for a minute
and think, Dandy!

291
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:56,791
This decision means the
world will have no God!

292
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,833
[DANDY] Stay Dandy, baby!

293
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,458
[DANDY] Show me a "boob-man,"

294
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,500
and I'll show you a no-brain,
no-class knuckle-dragger

295
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,791
who knows nothing
of the fairer sex.

296
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,375
There are far more
important things to consider.

297
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,583
And by that I mean--

298
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,458
[QT] Is something wrong, Dandy?

299
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,791
QT. You are
still you, right?

300
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,875
[QT] Of course I'm still
me. Why wouldn't I be?

301
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,458
Ah. Guess it doesn't
really matter.

302
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:43,625
[DANDY] As I was saying,
it's all about the legs, baby!
