[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,833
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,291
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,958
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,375
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:36,958
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,041
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:44,000
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,208
[DANDY]
Boobies! Boobies! Boobies!

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,333
That's all guys
think about these days!

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
Well, they're idiots.

12
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,625
Show me a "boob man,"

13
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,500
and I'll show you a no-brain,
no-class knuckle-dragger

14
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,666
who knows nothing
of the fairer sex.

15
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,833
They don't get it;

16
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,041
you can't take the
measure of a good woman

17
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,625
just by ogling her chest!

18
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,833
There are far more
important things to consider.

19
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,958
Such as--

20
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,041
Aw, c'mon, are you
even listenin'...?!

21
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,791
I'm tryin' to drop some
knowledge here, QT!

22
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,541
[QT] Hmm... Is it...
a beautiful heart?

23
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,541
Ugh. Exactly the sort of
canned answer I'd expect

24
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,958
from a bucket of bolts.

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,291
Have you still learned
nothing after all this time?!

26
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,666
[QT] I give, I give...!
Just tell me already!

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,958
See, if you're
enlightened like I am,

28
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,833
then you know that the
real show is down below.

29
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,458
The booty, baby!

30
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,208
That's where it's at!

31
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,000
Nothing trumps
the rump, my friend--

32
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,416
anyone who can't see that
is either blind or a fool.

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
That's why I say enough with
this mass-boob-hysteria;

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,166
It's time to set things right...

35
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,791
It's time to give the ass
the respect it deserves!

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,083
[QT] Ummmm...

37
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,875
Too many women have
been wronged for too long!

38
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,416
Like poor Agnes Lum...

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,083
...objectified only for her
boobs--it's a crime, I tell ya!

40
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,666
[QT] I don't know
who that is!

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,250
Why are we even
talking about this?!

42
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,041
Can't we let the Narrator
do the prologue first?!

43
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,458
[NARRATOR] Space Century...
double-oh-fourteen...

44
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,708
Mankind has unlocked the heady
secrets of space-travel...

45
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,416
But in the vastness of space,

46
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,250
humans are but one of
a myriad of species...

47
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
There are countless others...

48
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,750
Like that one... and those...
and all of them...

49
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,583
Far too many to name...

50
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,166
No, seriously. I'm done.

51
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,750
[QT] Wow, he really phoned
that one in, didn't he...?

52
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,333
[DANDY] No kidding...
How do I get that job...?

53
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,416
[QT] Focus! We can't
waste any more time

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,541
breaking the fourth wall!

55
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,916
If we don't get to
work hunting aliens,

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,583
the story's never
going to go anywhere

57
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,000
and our viewers
will stop watching!

58
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,250
Well then, QT...

59
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,333
Punch in the coordinates.

60
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,833
[QT] The coordinates to where?

61
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,750
What, it's not obvious...?

62
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,458
To Boobies, of course!

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,125
[QT] Huh...?
You mean that restaurant

64
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,125
with the jiggly waitresses
and the not-so-hot wings?

65
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,208
You got it.

66
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,583
[QT] What for?

67
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,500
Hey, come on, it's not
just what you're thinking...

68
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,541
I wouldn't even suggest it,

69
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,875
except that it's
an alien hangout...

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,208
It's Boobies or nothing,
man--your call.

71
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeaaah...!

72
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,000
[QT] Hey, Dandy...

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,416
[DANDY] Eh?

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,458
[QT] I thought you said we
were coming here to work.

75
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,041
Whoa, Time out...

76
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,791
I'm working my ass off,
so don't bust my chops...

77
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,125
Don't you see what
perfect camouflage

78
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,666
I'm giving ya here,
little buddy?

79
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,958
You can scope out the clients

80
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,458
while I pretend to
ogle the laaadies...

81
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,583
[QT] I don't think camouflage
is supposed to drool.

82
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,333
[NARRATOR]
Such is the scene at Boobies,

83
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,083
one of many chains of
so-called "breastaurants,"

84
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,333
with locations
all over known space.

85
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,625
Breastaurants are where
zero-G meets double-D,

86
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,250
staffed as they are
by the top-heaviest girls

87
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,208
of any species sporting boobs--

88
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,666
And since the roster of ladies
is different at each location,

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,083
Dandy's made it his mission in
life to visit every single one.

90
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,791
He dreams of buying
out the chain someday,

91
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,000
and eating every meal there.

92
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,833
[QT] When it's about Boobies,
the Narrator suddenly cares...!

Thanks for waiting, fellas!

Anything else I can get you?

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,708
[DANDY]
A Gilgamesh tequila.

104
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,166
Nice pick, that's a good one.

105
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,541
So, what's your name?

106
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,750
It's Dandy...

107
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,875
But you can
call me Space Dandy.

108
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,333
So then, Mr. Space Dandy,
what do you do?

109
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,333
You wanna know?

110
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,000
[HONEY] Do I ever!

111
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,791
It's a job that
begins with "A"...

112
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,208
See if you can guess it.

113
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,125
Starts with "A"...?
That's a tricky one...

114
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,416
Asteroid belt!

115
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,208
That does start
with an "A," but no.

116
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,083
[HONEY]
So what's the answer?

117
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,625
It's a doozy...

118
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,250
I spend my days...
as an alien-hunt--

[QT] Heya, Dandy...!

121
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,875

you've got in your hands...?

122
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,375
[QT] Kinda sorta...

123
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,333
Isn't the entire point
of being a robot

124
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,375
that you can have all that
information floating around

125
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,750
on your hard drive or whatever?

126
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,541
[QT] I could if I updated
my software, but...

127
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,791
...my operating
system is too old.

[DANDY]
Oh, I get it...

129
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,666
So you're just
a little obsolete.

130
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,791
Heey...

131
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,583
It happens to the best of us...

00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,291
But faster with tech.

00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,750
What do you think your
trade-in value is... huh?

134
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,041
I was just joking--don't
tell me you're depressed.

135
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,541
[QT] Robots don't get depressed.

[QT] My battery's down
to five percent...

What about the one
by the window...?

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,666
Would that do?

[QT] Uh-huh, that's the one.

152

[DANDY] Lemme see... Hmm...

153
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,041
It looks like the Betelgeusian
in your handbook.

154

[QT] You think...?

00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,750
What about that marking
on the side of its face?

Huh, that is different...

00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,333
C'mon, is it or isn't it?

161
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,625
And now you go into sleep mode?!

162
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,375
[DANDY]
Hey, pal, you got a minute?

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,166
Huh...?

164
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,916
Uh... yeah.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,666
Don't think I've
seen ya around...

166
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,541
So where do ya call home...?

167
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,000
Tochigi Galaxy, maybe...?

168
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,333
Uh... No, uh...

169
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,291
...juuust passing through...

170
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,750
...not taking pervy
pictures or anything...

171
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,208
Ya don't say...

172
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,875
So where are you from?

173
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,458
Hey...!

174
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,958
Why, you little son-of-a--!

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,208
You're not getting away
that easy, meal ticket!!

176
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,375
[MEOW] I won't creep on the
waitresses anymore--I swear!

177
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,541
Please, just let me go!

178
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,958
[HONEY] There you are!
Drink time...!

179
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,625
And... because you
ordered Gilgamesh tequila,

180
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,166
you get this super-neat sticker!

181
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,250
It's a sticker...?

182
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,666
[BEA] Dr. Gel... our target
has been confirmed...

183
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,375
It's him; there's no
doubt about it.

184
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,375
[GEL] Excellent. Well done...

185
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,750
[GEL laughs]

186
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,375
So I've finally found you...

187
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,208
Dandy...

188
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,708
[NARRATOR] So, I probably should
have mentioned this earlier...

189
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,708
...but the Gogol Empire
and the Jaicro Empire

190
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,916
are currently locked
in a life-or-death battle

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,125
for ultimate control
of the universe...!

192
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,458
But nevermind all that...

193
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,041
Back to the Aloha Oe.

194
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,041
[MEOW] Lemme get
this straight...

195
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,583
You guys grab aliens
no one's ever seen before,

196
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,375
and when you register 'em...

197
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,916
...they give you money?

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, that sounds about right.

199
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,333
[QT]
But we only get paid

200
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,791
if the Alien Registration
Center says they're new.

201
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,208
Check it out, then...

202
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,750
I know where you
guys can score some.

203
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,208
--[DANDY] Wha--?!
--[QT] Huh...?!

204
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,458
[QT] I don't know...

205
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,333
This seems awfully convenient,
don't you think?

206
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,416
[DANDY groans]

207
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,333
[QT] Can we trust him?
He's all slinky.

208
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,166
[DANDY] Why not?
What the hell?

209
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,791
Hey... Could you
two talk about me

210
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,875
a little more quietly? Thanks.

211
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,125
[DANDY]
Hey, stranger...

212
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,208
Time for an intro.

213
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,625
So, what's your name?

214
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,583
[indistinct meow-like sound]

215
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,583
Say what?

216
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,791
[QT] Could you repeat that?

217
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,083
[indistinct meow-like sound]

218
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,166
Huuuuh...?!
What'd he say?

219
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,208
[QT] Who knows?

220
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,041
[MEOW] Geez, it's a
common name...

221
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,083
Well, in honor of you lookin'
like a cat, how about... Meow?

222
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,291
Aw, c'mon, you guys,
don't do me like that.

223
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,791
I'm a Betelgeusian.

224
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,958
Whatever--he is
totally a space cat...

225
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,041
No, I'm not! Dammit!

226
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,208
[PERRY] You are certain
that it was him...?

227
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,625
There is no doubt in my mind.

228
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,000
[PERRY]
Very well...

229
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,750
I will send the Seventh
Fleet of the Galactic Force

230
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,916
to assist you.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,208
Your generosity is boundless.

232
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,583
[PERRY]
Remember, Dr. Gel...

233
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,500
...he is the one who holds
the key to the Gogol Empire--

234
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,750
no, to the entire universe.

235
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,041
No scheme is too underhanded!

236
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,500
Catch him, no matter what!

237
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,250
[GEL] I will not
fail you, Excellency.

238
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,791
[MEOW] Ooh. Right there.
That's where the planet is.

239
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,583
[QT] That's pretty
far from here.

240
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,291
[MEOW] Or was it
in this sector...?

241
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,875
[QT] Those're like light-years
away from each other...!

242
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,541
[MEOW] Stop sweating me;
I got this.

243
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,666
[QT] Dandy,
what do we do now?

244
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,000
[DANDY] Y'know...

245
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
[QT] But factoring in
the distances involved...

246
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,833
[DANDY] Whatever
you think's best.

247
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,375
[QT] C'mon, Dandy.
Don't just pretend to listen.

248
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,125
We really need your
input on this one.

249
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,500
You listen!

250
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,166
Life comes at you fast...

251
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,125
Just like a raging current...

252
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,375
I don't fight it.

253
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,500
Going against the flow...

254
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,125
...just means you're
swimmin' in place!

255
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,958
One day you're too
tired to paddle,

256
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,708
and suddenly you drown!

257
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,708
Whole thing was pointless
and now you're dead--the end.

258
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,000
No, going with the
flow is where it's at.

259
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:21,583
And that's... the
Dandy way to live!

260
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,416
That was pretty deep, in a
stupid, rambling kind of way...

261
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,791
[QT] It was
definitely stupid...

262
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,416
[BEA] The Seventh Fleet
has arrived, Dr. Gel.

263
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,791
[GEL chuckles]

264
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
[GEL] Beware, Space Dandy...

265
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,583
The Gogol Empire
is on your tail

266
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,333
and escape will
not be an option!

267
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,916
[MEOW] The planet's
pretty far out...

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,458
Are we gonna warp
over there or what?

269
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,875
[DANDY]
No, dumbass...

270
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,708
Do I look like I'm made of
rocket fuel...? Besides...

271
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,416
Don't be cheap,
dude--fire it up.

272
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,083
[DANDY] I have it on good
authority if you warp too much,

273
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,375
your hair starts coming
out in giant clumps.

274
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,916
[MEOW] Bam!

275
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,916
Why is it shaking like that...?!

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,250
[QT] The warp drive is broken.

277
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,791
We never fixed it.

278
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
[DANDY]
No...! I'll go bald!

279
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,541
[MEOW] What happened
to going with the flow?

280
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,625
[DANDY]
Don't you judge me!

281
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,250
You're covered in hair!

282
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,416
[BEA] Sir, they're
about to warp!

283
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,583
[GEL] They spotted us!

284
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,791
We can pursue Dandy
to his destination!

285
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,166
[GEL] Don't lose him...!

286
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,916
I'll chase that man to
the far edge of infinity...

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,791
...and beyond...!

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,250
Where did we warp to... huh...?

289
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,000
[QT] Analyzing...

290
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,583
I can't read circle!

291
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,291
[QT] It says,
"I don't know."

292
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,708
You printed that?!

293
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,958
[MEOW] Hey, you guys...?

294
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:01,750
[QT and DANDY] Huh?

295
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,750
[MEOW] What is that thing?

296
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,166
Couldn't tell you, man...

297
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,041
[QT] It looks like a chain,
or a thread.

298
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,000
[DANDY] A thread, huh...?

299
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,458
[QT] What do we do now?

300
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,708
[DANDY] Let's give it a pull!

301
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,208
[QT] Just a second, Dandy...!

302
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,208
Are you sure that's a good idea?

303
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,500
Oh, wait...!
I know what that is!

304
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,875
That's a cosmic string...!

305
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,958
If we go pulling on
it all willy-nilly,

306
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,541
there's a chance that space-time
will distort even more

307
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,416
and we'll be trapped
here forever...!

308
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,041
Whatever you do,
Dandy, don't--

309
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,291
[DANDY] Got it...!

310
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,333
[QT] Really?

311
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,875
[DANDY] Yep.

312
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,833
[DANDY, QT and MEOW]
Whoooa!!

313
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,791
[GEL] What's going on?!

314
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,041
[BEA] I don't know...

315
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,416
But they're not warping...!

316
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,250
That signature doesn't match
any known energy source!

317
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,750
[GEL] Hold on...

318
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,958
Are you telling me...

319
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,625
...that this could be a sighting
of the fabled element...

320
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
...Pyonium?!

321
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,041
Okay... so where are we now...?

322
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,166
[MEOW] Ah, this is
looking familiar...

323
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,041
Yeah, I think this
is the place...

324
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,208
Let's go check it out!

325
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,666
[QT] Matter Transporter
on standby...

326
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,875
Sending... now!

327
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,875
[MEOW] Um...

328
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,916
[DANDY] Hm?

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,291
[MEOW] This is
oddly anticlimactic.

330
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,750
It's an older module.

331
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,875
It takes a while to warm up.

332
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Flying down
there'd be quicker...

333
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,583
I'm just saying.

334
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,000
[GEL]
So... Excellency...

335
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,125
[PERRY]
Go on...

336
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,250
[GEL] We... might've
lost track of him.

337
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,500
[PERRY] What?!

338
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,416
But fear not, we'll find
him again soon enough.

339
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,125
Would sometime next
week work for you?

340
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,500
[PERRY]
Of course it wouldn't!

341
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,416
You imbecile!

342
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,500
Let's... go back.

343
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,250
Ha, ha. Shows what
you know, smarty-pants...

344
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,750
They look scary
but they're no big deal.

345
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,208
Lemme show you
how chill they are.

346
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,250
I could poke this guy
all day long--whoooa!

347
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,791
[DANDY] Aww...

348
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,291
Dammit, Meow-- 
this thing is not chill!

349
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,166
No, my helmet!

350
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,958
[MEOW] There's oxygen here!

351
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,166
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?!

352
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,208
[DANDY] QT! Bring us
back! Bring us back!

353
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,958
[QT] Okie-dokie...

354
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,041
[MEOW]
I ain't judging, but...

355
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,125
...won't teleporting
outta here take too long?

356
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,875
Way too long.

357
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,333
[DANDY] Let's dance!

358
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,333
Nice!

359
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,666
Sure! Except for the part
where you missed completely.

360
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,208
[DANDY] Huh?

361
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,041
Boom! Meant to do that!

362
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,958
[DANDY] Time to go!

363
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,041
[QT] They should get
here riiiight abooout...

364
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,750
[QT screams]

365
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,791
[DANDY] Hey, QT...! Time to
play the ol' ace up my sleeve!

366
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,458
[QT] Yes, good--play it!

367
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,000
Play the whole deck!

368
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,833
Listen--there should be
a surfer doll up in the ship.

369
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,916
[QTm ] You mean this?!

370
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,166
It's a secret weapon

371
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,541
that's gonna make all
our problems disappear!

372
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,750
[QT] What're we waiting for?!

373
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm gonna use it!

374
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,041
[DANDY] Push the head!

375
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,583
[QT] Go!

376
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,083
Uh... so what happens now?

377
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,166
[DANDY] We wait...
About twenty seconds from now,

378
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,958
that little doll dude
is gonna go supernova.

379
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,416
It'll vaporize this planet;
every last alien being on it.

380
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,625
[QT] Okay, then.

381
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,500
How do we get out of
here before it explodes?

382
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,583
Huh... good point.

383
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,875
Maybe I should'a thought
this through a little more...

384
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,458
Well, my bad.

385
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,791
I knew there was a reason
I hadn't used this trick before.

386
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,333
But hey--least I die
with a full head of hair.

387
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,958
[NARRATOR]
And here, our story ends...

388
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,333
Tales of Dandy's
bravery and sacrifice

389
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:33,041
will echo through
space for all time...

390
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,083
Or not.

391
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,041
[DANDY] Now, then...!
On the next "Space Dandy," we--!

392
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,708
[QT] "Next"? Weren't we
all just vaporized?

393
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,416
[DANDY] It's a tale
full of adventure!

394
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,458
And ramen!

395
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,041
[QT] That sounds
pretty tame, Dandy!

396
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,000
[DANDY] Next time,
lookin' for ramen shops

397
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:17,875
in space,
baby!

398
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,125
[QT]
Phantom ramen?!

399
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,666
[DANDY]
See you then!
