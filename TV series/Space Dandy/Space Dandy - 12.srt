1
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,083
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,875
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,333
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,000
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,375
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,916
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,916
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,875
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,458
[DANDY] Huh? Hold the phone!
What did you say?

10
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,416
The bounty is a
measly two woolongs?

11
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,958
[MEOW] C'mon, lady! It
may look all floppy,

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,541
but catching this thing
was a huge pain in the butt!

13
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,000
[QT]
Can't we work something out?

14
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,625
It cost more than two woolongs

15
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,791
just to fly this in
for processing!

16
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,833
Now we're in the
red worse than ever!

17
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,916
[DANDY] A two-woolong bounty
is crazy-talk, sweet-cheeks--!

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,750
Quit your whining!

19
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:07,791
The Baranian you hauled in last
week netted you 128 woolongs.

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,083
The Pylorian before
that went for sixty-four.

21
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,125
And the Rakendrian?
Thirty-two woolongs.

22
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,750
Which brings us to this
bounty-hunting travesty--

23
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,375
Do you know how much it costs us

24
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,291
in processing fees just to
pay you two measly woolongs?

25
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,541
You are the worst excuses for
alien-hunters I've ever seen.

26
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,333
Stop wasting my time with trash.

27
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,166
Come back with something
rare or don't come back at all.

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes. Something good,
like a Chameleonian.

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,125
--Huh?
--Huh?

30
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,000
A Chamele-what-now?

31
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,041
[NARRATOR] Much like
their reptilian namesake,

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,333
Chameleonians are masters
of disguise--but instead

33
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,875
of just changing their colors,

34
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,541
they can shape-shift
into anything they want.

35
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,500
In fact, they're
so good at mimicry,

36
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,666
no one in the universe knows
what they actually look like.

37
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,916
Can a slacker, a space-cat,
and a goody-goody match wits

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,083
with such a slippery target?

39
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:11,750
Smart money says no, but
stranger things have happened.

40
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,708
How much do we get for
catching this thing, anyway?

41
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,375
[QT]
A hundred million woolongs.

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,041
--A hundred million?
--A hundred million?

43
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,958
[QT] What? I thought
you guys already knew.

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,708
A hundred million woolongs!

45
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,416
We're gonna be so stinkin' rich!

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,250
Yeah, all right! Let's go, baby!

47
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,833
[QT]
Go where, exactly?

48
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,375
Where do you think?

49
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
To a planet that looks like
it has chameleons, of course!

50
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,458
[DANDY]
Here.

51
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,708
[QT]
Huh?

52
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,500
[MEOW] I'm gonna start
with a nice juicy fly

53
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,625
and see what happens.

54
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,875
Oh man, I so wanna chase it.

55
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,791
[QT] Okay, and you
gave me a cricket why?

56
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,958
Chameleon bait!

57
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,500
We're on an alien
fishin' mission, baby!

58
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,500
[QT] Um, we're trying to catch a
Chameleonian, not a chameleon.

59
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
Chameleons are
totally different creatures.

60
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,750
Just, you know,
something to think about.

61
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,750
I'm thinking 'bout
that hundred million!

62
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,791
More like hundred cham-million!

63
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,666
[QT] Sometimes I wonder
why I even bother.

64
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,500
[MEOW] So hey,
what're you going to do

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,041
with your share
of the woolongs?

66
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,541
Me, I'm looking at
a whole lotta lazy-time!

67
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:24,375
I'm gonna drink beer and nap in
the sun and lick myself all day!

68
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,791
Is that it?
You're thinkin' small, man.

69
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,875
I would go out to eat at
Boobies three meals a day.

70
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,500
Which of course would
earn me a butt-load

71
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,041
of frequent-diner points,

72
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,000
and then I'd get to use 'em
on even more trips to Boobies!

73
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,333
That's your grand ambition--
to go out to eat a lot?

74
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
What about it?

75
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,041
[QT]
This is my life.

76
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,708
[DANDY]
Step off, tuna-breath.

77
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,750
Lookit!

78
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,041
[QT] I don't know how
this works! What do I do?

79
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,541
Reel it in!
Turn the little crank!

80
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,250
[MEOW] Aw, it was
just a tsuchinoko?

81
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,333
[DANDY] Those're worthless.
Toss it back already, yeah?

82
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,250
[NARRATOR] And that's
when QT suddenly realized:

83
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,291
[QT]
Fishing is actually kinda fun!

84
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,000
[QT]
My Fishing Journal, Day 1:

85
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,458
Tried out a quiet little spot
that I read about in a magazine.

86
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,458
Day 2: Bad weather.

87
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,666
Got caught in a nor'easter

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,291
that tossed our boat
around something fierce.

89
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,500
Goodness!

90
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,333
Day 3: What a
perfect day for fishing!

91
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,416
My homemade lure paid off!

92
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,958
Day 4: Jackpot! Got my
biggest one ever today!

93
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,208
[QT] I don't care if you're
deadsticking or doodling,

94
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,500
finesse fishing with
a splitshot rig sure

95
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,500
is a handy way
to hit your limit.

96
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,500
Say what?

97
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,416
Did he break his language chip?

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,333
Gotcha!

99
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,500
Yes, black tsuchinoko!
Come to QT!

100
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,458
Heya, Dandy?

101
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,250
Call me crazy, but
I think we're hitting a bit

102
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,875
of mission creep out here.

103
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,333
What were we hunting?

104
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,791
Look, you got a nibble!

105
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,708
It looks like a whopper!

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,708
[MEOW]
Chameleonian off the port side!

107
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,125
[DANDY] Yeah, that's the ticket!
Come to Dandy, woolongs!

108
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,875
Wh-? Whaddya mean?

109
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,458
[MEOW] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's not a Chameleonian?

110
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,583
This is just an
ordinary chameleon!

111
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,333
You're not getting a bounty for
this--it's not even an alien!

112
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,583
Now pick up this reptile
and get out of here!

113
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,083
[MEOW]
So, that happened.

114
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,708
[QT]
I tried warning you earlier,

115
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,750
but no, nobody listened to me.

116
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,958
Nobody ever does.

117
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,041
[DANDY]
Whatever.

118
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,333
How come you kept that thing?

119
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,458
[QT] You don't come
across a black tsuchinoko

120
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,458
this big every day, you know.

121
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,625
And I still have to upload
pictures of it to my blog.

122
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,916
Oh! Maybe it'll become a meme!

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
That's the last time
I teach a robot to fish.

124
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,958
[yawning]

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,208
Time to hit the sack.

126
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,541
[QT] Don't forget, surf
fishing starts at 4 a.m.

127
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,583
Ugh, have fun.

128
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
Yeah, I don't do 4 a.m.

129
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,500
Huh? But surf fishing
is so much fun!

130
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,583
Say cheese!

131
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,291
Hey, Meow.

132
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,541
You and I are not cool
enough to share a toothbrush.

133
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
Huh? Dude, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

134
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,750
Then how come
it's all damp, hombre?

135
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,750
Look at it, Meow. There's fish
flakes stuck in the bristles.

136
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,791
The same fish flakes that
you sprinkle on everything!

137
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Whatever! Who ate my
octopus-flavored popsicle, huh?

138
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,333
It sure as hell wasn't me!

139
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, you're not fooling
anybody, Pompadour.

140
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,333
Could you two please
not look at porn sites

141
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,333
on my cell phone?

142
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,083
I don't even want
to touch it now!

143
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,333
I don't look at porn.

144
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,708
Maybe you were looking at it.

145
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,708
That makes no sense,
I don't even have those ports!

146
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,333
It had to be one of you!
Who else is there?

147
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,666
There is another.

148
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,625
Huh?

149
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,875
A stowaway.

150
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,208
One who doesn't respect
other people's stuff.

151
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,750
--Huh?
--Huh?

152
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,250
Somebody looked at porn
sites in the dead of night,

153
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,083
chowed down on
your octopus popsicle,

154
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,500
and then brushed their
teeth using my toothbrush!

155
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,416
That's the only possible way
to explain these fish flakes!

156
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,583
This is nuts.

157
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,958
We are not alone.
Roll call! One!

158
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:11,875
Two!

159
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,833
Three!

Four!

161
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,875
Hold up.

162
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,416

163
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,041
--Huh? Huh?
--Huh? Huh?

164
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
[QT] There's definitely
someone else on board the ship!

165
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,208
Come on, let's find this poser!

166
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,416
[QT] My black tsuchinoko!
It's gone!

167
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,083
Huh, maybe our stowaway ate it.

168
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,666
Something's fishy about this.

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,416
It was here when I went to bed.

170
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,166
[DANDY]
Maybe it bailed.

171
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,583
[MEOW] But how?
The cage is still locked.

172
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,916
Yeah. How did I manage that?

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,958
--Huh?
--Huh?

174
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,708
[PERRY]
Out with it, Dr. Gel.

175
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,333
When are you going to
capture that damnable Dandy?

176
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,666
My patience with your
ineptitude grows thin.

177
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,583
[GEL chuckling]

178
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,500
[PERRY] Hmm? You're in
no position to smirk!

179
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,125
I suggest you explain yourself.

180
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,500
Of course. You see,

181
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,375
a new weapon that I
have been secretly developing

182
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,666
for several years now has at
long last reached completion.

183
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,000
[PERRY]
A weapon, you say?

184
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,166
Indeed.

185
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,416
A diabolical device
capable of ensnaring

186
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,750
its target anywhere
in time and/or space.

187
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,000
[PERRY]
Is this true?

188
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,958
With this power at my disposal,

189
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,083
Dandy's day of
reckoning is nigh.

190
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,250
[BEA]
Doctor.

191
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,916
I've finally confirmed
Dandy's location.

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,666
You shall get your quarry
soon enough, Admiral.

193
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,416
How did that geezer
get on the ship?

194
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,583
What's he doing here?

195
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,041
How the hell am
I supposed to know?

196
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,541
It's not like
I've seen him before!

197
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,875
[QT] You don't think he's
the Chameleonian, do you?

198
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,333
Say what?

199
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,416
[QT] I know it's
a huge coincidence,

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,750
but I'm starting to think
the tsuchinoko I caught

201
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,041
was really the
Chameleonian in disguise!

202
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,833
All right! We gotta
split up and find it!

203
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,958
Big-money-big-money-
big-money-big-money!

[DANDY]
Ow! Ow, my foot!

205
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,458
Hey, Dandy!

206
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,250
Any luck?

207

Nothing yet!

208
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,541
I'll check in the
engine room. See ya!

209
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,083
Hey, Dandy!

210
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,916
Hey!

Nothing yet!

I'll check in the

00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,875
Hang on a sec!

214

[DANDY] That was
one Meow too many!

215
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,041
Huh?

216
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,125
Which means-- You're that
sneaky Chameleonian, aintcha?

217
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,750
What? C'mon!
I'm a Betelgeusian, dude!

218
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
[SCARLET]
See?

219
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,875
He's a Betelgeusian, just like
he was in the last three scans.

220
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,958
[MEOW] Yeah. That's
what I told him, but oh no.

221
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:14,166
[DANDY] Damn it. So the other
one was the Chameleonian, huh?

222
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,250
I can't believe you put
me in a cage. Not cool.

Are you sure it was there?

224

Look, I don't know what kind of
con you're trying to pull here,

225
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,250
but don't come back until
you have an actual bounty!

226

Not our finest moment.

is still on the ship.

Are you sure this time?

229
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,375
Uh-huh. The ol' Dandy-sense
is getting' tingly.

230
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,500
I say we split up
and look some more!

231
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,208
Did we always have a
funky couch over there?

232
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,708
Huh?

233

Aw, son of a...!

234
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,416
That was no funky couch--it
was a freakin' Chameleonian!

a lot less back in the day.

Let me guess.

The robot is the
Chameleonian this time?

Or maybe the rope.

00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,291
But he doesn't know
jack about Dandy.

315
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,208
You are so goin' down!

316
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,375
Bring it!

317
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,916
Cool it, Dandies.

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,666
Okay, Dandy #1--finish this
thought. "I am a slave to..."

319
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,083
"...the booty!"

320
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,000
[QT]
Is that your final Dandy?

321
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,458
Yeah, sure, Final Dandy.

322
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,458
That is correct!

323
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,666
All right!

324
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,125
Okay, Dandy #2,
this next question is yours.

325
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,250
What did you have
for dinner last night?

326
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,208
How in the hell
would I remember that?

327
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,583
Is that your final Dandy?

328
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,000
Final Dandy. Yeah, sure.

329
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,416
That's correct!

330
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,375
The real Dandy wouldn't
remember this morning,

331
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,750
much less yesterday!

332
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,125
Ya hear that?
In your beautiful face!

333
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,666
Son-of-a--!

334
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,208

Favorite ninja.

Sexy female!

Correct! Your favorite vehicle.

337
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,041
[DANDY 2]
Ooh, a chick-mobile!

338
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,333
Correct! Favorite

meter breast-stroke!

[QT] Correct!
Nobody's missed one yet.

343
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,958
I know, when it comes to being a
dumb-ass, they're neck-and-neck.

344
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,458
Hey! Stop talking
smack about me, cat!

345
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,958
Yo! Give it a rest!

346
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:57,000
Nobody shouts at
my crewmates but me.

347
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,166
Huh?

348
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,375
C'mon, QT.
You're killin' me here.

349
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,333
How is it you still can't
tell I'm the genuine article?

350
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,375
Maybe it's time we got
you that upgrade, huh?

351
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,875
Dandy or not, I like
the cut of that one's jib.

352
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,750
He sure doesn't yell as much.

353
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,000
Maybe we're getting too
hung up on finding the real one,

354
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,000
you know what I mean?

355
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,625
Let's just take that one.

356
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,708
What the hell, guys?
I'm sittin' right here!

357
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
It looks like we
got our answer, baby.

358
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,833
And what does that mean?

359
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,958
It means you
should hit the road.

360
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,291
Oh give it a rest, you faker!

361
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,083
You're the faker, you faker!

362
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,666
Oh yeah? Then who're you?

363
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,291
I'm who you wish you were, pal!

364
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,875
I'm me, baby! So there!

365
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,166
I'm way more me than you!

366
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,708
You're not you,
you fraud! I'm you!

367
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,666
I'm the real me!

368
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,833
No, you're the fake me!

369
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
Who's that make you?

370
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,166
[NARRATOR]
I'm not sure who's who.

[DANDY 1]
You are so me.

372
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,166
[DANDY 2]
Right back at you.

373
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,125
[DANDY 1]
I'm you, okay?

374
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,500
[DANDY 2]
Well, I'm you, too!

375
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,041
[NARRATOR] Hell, they're
not sure who's who.

376
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:48,916
[DANDY 1]
Who are you?

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,750
[DANDY 2]
You!

378
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,500
[DANDY 1]
And who're you?

379
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,708
[DANDY 2]
I'm me!

[DANDY 1] Can we get
name-tags or something?

381
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,458
[NARRATOR] The Chameleonian,
a master of disguise.

382
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,833
It's so skilled,
no one knows its true form.

383
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:06,041
In the end, not even
the Chameleonian itself.

384
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,958
Uh-oh. I've been karate-choppin'
through life like I'm Dandy.

385
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,583
But what if I'm really
that Chameleonian thing,

386
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,500
and I forgot all
about it because I'm doing

387
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,541
such a bad-ass job of
pretending to be the actual me?

388
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:23,416
I am he. As you.
Unless you're him.

389
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,833
[NARRATOR]
Drowning in the introspection

00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,291
he couldn't even spell,

391
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,833
he grasped at answers.

392
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,875
And then, as it all
went black, he found one.

393
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,791
Who cares, baby!

394
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,208
So maybe I'm an alien.

395
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,291
Or maybe I'm the real deal.

396
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,625
Either way, I am awesome!

397
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,000
That's it. I so give up.

398
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,041
[BEA] Dr. Gel. We've
locked onto the target.

399
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,500
Awaiting your order.

400
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
Oh, how I've waited for this.

401
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,166
Engage the
Hyperdimensional Magic Hand!

402
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,833
I found 50 woolongs! Huh?

403
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,166
I have landed my prey.

Great job, Doctor!

Hello there, sexy.

Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,916
I am Gel, the doctor!

No, I am Gel, the doctor!

00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,333
You're the doctor, too?

413
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,416
Who is the doctor?

414
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,375
Exactly!

415
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
[GEL]
Who's the doctor?

00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,125
Who's the doctor? Who's the
doctor? Who's the doctor?

417
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,375
Who's the doctor?
Who's the doctor?

418
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,333
That's the question, isn't it?

419
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,416
Is it me? Is it him?

420
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,416
[BEA] Dr. Gel!
Get a hold of yourself!

421
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,166
[GEL] How long has
this been going on for?

422
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,000
Who's the doctor?

423
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:46,791
Who is he?

424
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,416
Who am I?

425
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Who's the doctor?

426
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,166
Who is he?

Who's the doctor?

428
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,333
[NARRATOR]
And with his inner monologue

429
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,083
stuck on infinite repeat,

430
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,833
Dr. Gel succumbed
to Gestaltzerfall.

431
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,708
It's a thing. Gogol it.

432
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,333
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
over at Boobies.

433
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,083
It's business as usual.
Or is it?

434
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,875
Is this the real Dandy?

435
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,541
Staring at the waitresses
could just be part of the act.

436
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,500
[NARRATOR] Maybe business
as usual, never was.

437
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:26,583
The Chameleonian changes its
form and slips into our lives,

438
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,333
and with a few rare exceptions,
no one's the wiser.

439
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,125
For all you know,
you're surrounded by them.

440
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,625
Friends, coworkers, family.

441
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,208
Anybody could be a Chameleonian.

442
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:42,541
Even me. Maybe even you.

443
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,000
[QT] Why are there so many
songs about love?

444
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,125
How much can you say
about some silly emotion?

445
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,750
[MEOW] They do get
kind of repetitive.

446
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,250
[DANDY]
That's how love works.

447
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,708
The words are the same but
every time feels like the first.

448
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:31,208
Next time: "Even Vacuum
Cleaners Fall in Love, Baby."
