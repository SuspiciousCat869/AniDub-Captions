1
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,791
[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,250
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,708
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,833
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,250
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,833
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,916
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,875
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,041
Okay, what about this one?

10
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,416
[QT]
A Stiltonian.

11
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,208
[MEOW] I dunno,
his coloring looks different.

12
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,833
[DANDY] Hmm...

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,083
[QT] "A Stiltonian's
distinguishing characteristics

14
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,833
are its fast movements
and quick reflexes."

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,541
Well, he is moving.

16
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,291
Just really, really slowly.

17
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,625
[MEOW]
Hey. Check it out!

18
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,583
His middle
section's different, too!

19
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,333
See? Right in here.

20
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,833
Yahhhh!!

21
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,666
[QT] Stiltonians are
supposed to be gentle

22
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,583
and friendly creatures
and they're not biters.

23
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,250
You thinkin' what
I'm thinkin', buddy?

24
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,416
[QT] This is definitely
not a Stiltonian.

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,291
It must be an unknown alien.

26
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,416
[DANDY]
Aw, yeah!

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,375
Time to hit up the
registration center!

28
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,916
I bet they give us
some serious scratch

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,916
for that nasty mo-fracker.

30
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,083
[NARRATOR]
Sure that they had captured

31
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,541
a previously
undiscovered alien species,

32
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,708
Space Dandy and his crew
were on top of the world.

33
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,416
However, their excitement
didn't last long.

34
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,208
[NARRATOR] Within mere hours,
a strange phenomenon

35
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,666
had begun to take hold
aboard the Aloha Oe.

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,541
[QT] Uhh... Meow,
are you feeling okay?

37
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,083
You look pale.

38
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,875
Hey, go get me some more ice.

39
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:57,166
[MEOW]
Go get ice...

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
Man, you're slow. Fine.

41
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,083
I'll do it myself.

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,666
[QT] Do you think there might
be something wrong with Meow?

43
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,583
Nah, I wouldn't worry about him.

44
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,416
He probably just caught a bug.

45
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,416
[QT] Meow, can you give me
an update on our course?

46
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,750
[MEOW]
Ah...

47
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,000
[QT]
Huh?

48
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
[MEOW]
Uh...

49
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,208
[QT] I realize Meow's
not that bright,

50
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,375
but he usually has more
to say than "Ah" and "Uh."

51
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,625
I wouldn't worry about him.

52
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,333
He probably just caught a bug.

53
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,541
[QT]
He's completely unresponsive!

54
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,208
You've gotta admit that's fishy!

55
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,916
I'm tellin' ya, he caught a bug.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,458
Didn't ya, Meow?

57
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,541
[QT] Let's get him to
a doctor, just in case.

58
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,250
[DOCTOR] I hate
to break it to you,

59
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,791
but he has no
heartbeat, no pulse,

60
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,583
and no vital signs at all.

61
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,750
[QT]
What?

62
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,375
There's no getting around it,
your friend here is dead.

63
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,583
What species was he again?

64
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,375
He was a Betelgeusian, doctor.

65
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,666
Well, I'd like
to run some tests,

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,333
so let's go ahead
and have him admitted.

67
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,291
If the patient needs
anything, please feel free

68
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,125
to push the call button
and I'll be here right away.

69
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,416
Once is enough, sir.

70
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,875
New idea, I think I wanna
be hospitalized, too.

71
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,916
[QT]
Huh?

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
This is my kinda place.

73
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,000
I've wasted so much
time at Boobies,

74
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,166
when here the chicks
are hot and smart!

75
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,541
I mean, hello, nurse!

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,208
[QT] You can't be admitted
if you're not sick.

77
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,375
C'mon, we're leaving.

78
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,041
Shows what you know--I am sick.

79
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,875
All these babes are
givin' me the fever!

80
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,166
[QT]
Don't be a perv.

81
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,541
[DANDY] Hey, let go!

82
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,875
--[QT] Get a move on!
--[DANDY] You're choking me!

83
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,625
[DANDY] Why you gotta be
such a party pooper, baby?

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,958
[GEL] Come out, come out,
wherever you are, Dandy.

85
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,166
You can run, but there's
no hiding from me.

86
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,583
[BEA] Doctor, there are some
gentlemen here to see you!

87
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, really?

88
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,583
Who are you and
what're you doing here?

89
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,083
[PERRY]
I sent them to assist you.

90
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,416
[GEL]
Admiral Perry, sir!

91
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,541
[PERRY] Since you've had
no luck on your own,

92
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,125
the Gogol Empire has hired
these reckless mercenaries

93
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,416
to help you get the job done.

94
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,333
[GEL] Yes, sir, they look
to be quite reckless indeed.

95
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,416
[BEA]
Doctor Gel.

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I have news, sir!

97
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,041
Space Dandy was spotted entering

98
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,458
the Galaxy Hospital
two hours ago!

99
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,125
[PERRY]
This is our chance!

100
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,666
With the help of
these mercenaries,

101
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,458
we should be able to
catch him once and for all!

102
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,166
I know you must be starving,

103
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,625
but I'm afraid you can't eat
until after tomorrow's tests.

104
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,833
[MEOW hisses]

105
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,500
[NURSE] Um, sir?
Wait. What are you--?

106
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,333
[MEOW growls, roars]

107
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,166
[NURSE screams]

108
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,375
[DANDY] I found myself a nurse,

109
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,083
and her boobs are
big and bouncy.

110
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,958
They go boing, boing, boing,

111
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,083
and I feel it in
my naughty bits.

112
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,250
[QT] Is it just me or does the
hospital seem different today?

113
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,458
Nah, it's just you.

114
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,041
[QT] But it's messy,
and then there's that.

115
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,291
See? A doctor doing an
internal exam, like normal.

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,583
[QT] Really? They do that
in the middle of the hallway?

117
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,458
Hey! Look who's back!

118
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,333
So, did you ladies miss me?

119
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,583
Yowza.

120
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,083
Guess you three
worked the night shift.

121
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,958
Well, if you babes need to
blow off some steam, I'm here.

122
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,291
Hah! I didn't expect
so many takers!

123
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,750
I've never had a
ménage-a-hot nurse before!

124
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,333
[QT] I'm telling you, there's
something weird going on here!

125
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,666
Whoa. Aw, crap.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,833
We're surrounded.

127
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,875
[MERCENARY A]
Hold it right there!

128
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,375
What the--?

129
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,541
[MERCENARY D]
Die, scoundrel!

130
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,916
But that shoulda killed him!

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,416
[QT] I know this
might sound crazy,

132
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,875
but I have reason to
believe they're zombies.

133
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,416
You gotta be kiddin' me!

134
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,541
[DANDY]
Let's get outta here, QT!

135
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,583
[MERCENARY C]
The target is fleeing Ward 3,

136
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,500
but we're in hot pursuit, sir.

137
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,541
Huh? Get off of me!

138
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,833
[MERCENARY C screams]

139
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,375
Report!
What happened, soldier?

140
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,291
[MERCENARY C] We're done for!
Save yourself!

141
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,833
[MERCENARY C screams]

142
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,833
Don't tell me that lunkhead
outsmarted our mercenary forces!

143
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,250
I suppose it's possible if Dandy
somehow knew we were coming.

144
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,500
Are you suggesting
this is a trap?

145
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,458
[BEA and GEL scream]

146
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,875
[DANDY] We're bustin'
you outta here, Meow!

147
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,291
[DANDY] Just
yesterday this place

148
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,750
was a babe-alicious paradise,

149
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,875
and now it's packed
with bloodthirsty zombies.

150
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,250
[QT] What's crazy is it
seemed to happen overnight.

151
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,375
What could've caused
such a massive outbreak?

152
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,875
Wait a minute!

153
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,500
What if that alien we captured
was a Stiltonian after all

154
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,250
but we weren't
able to classify him

155
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,666
because he had been
turned into a zombie?

156
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,333
That would explain
his slow reflexes

157
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,416
and why Meow was
turned into a zombie!

158
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,583

you doing, Dandy?

00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,416
Oh, quit your whinin'!
You'll be fine, okay?

163
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
You're a freakin' robot!

That's just great!
Now what're we gonna do?

00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,083
You okay?

I promise I'll never

00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,000
Adios, amigos.

00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,500
I barely made it outta there.

[SINGING VOICES]
Dandy...

184
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:10,583
[alarm beeps]

185
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,708
[NARRATOR]
A zombie's day starts early.

186
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,500
Not much has changed
in the few months

187
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,416
since that fateful
day at the hospital,

188
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,875
other than the
fact that our heroes

189
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,166
have joined the
ranks of the undead.

190
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,041
At first, Dandy and crew
had a difficult time adjusting

191
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,166
to their new zombie lifestyle.

192
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,750
They wanted nothing
more than to be able

193
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,500
to turn back to
their old selves.

194
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,041
However, they soon
realized there is no cure

195
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:41,333
for zombification and they were
forced to accept their fate.

196
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:45,291
They felt despair,
followed by...

197
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,041
...an inexplicable
craving for raw meat.

198
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,708
Despair.

199
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,041
And raw meat.

200
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,833
This endless cycle of despair

201
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,916
and raw meat led
the Aloha Oe's crew

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,083
to question the very meaning
of their undead existence.

203
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,291
Until Dandy's decaying
brain had a thought.

204
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,500
"That's it! If I wanna
bust outta this rut,

205
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,291
I should ask someone who's
already been through it!"

206
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,666
In all the commotion, the
crew had completely forgotten

207
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,541
about the strange
alien they had captured

208
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,333
just a few months earlier.

209
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
However, they now
ventured into the belly

210
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:22,208
of the Aloha Oe to question
their "zombie guru."

211
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,000
[ALIEN]
Mmm...

212
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,791
[NARRATOR] It may sound like
groaning to the untrained ear,

213
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,916
but these noises make up
an intricate language

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,250
that the undead use
to communicate.

215
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,541
Luckily, I'm fluent
in zombie-ese.

216
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,750
[ALIEN]
Mmm...

217
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,333
[NARRATOR]
Allow me to translate.

218
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,125
"Being a zombie's not that
bad once you get used to it.

219
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,666
You don't have to spend
much money on food."

220
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,125
[NARRATOR]
The alien went on to say,

221
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
"This might sound strange
coming from a zombie,

222
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,208
but try to avoid eating meat.

223
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,250
The cravings can be
overwhelming at first,

224
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,750
but they go away
after a while.

225
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,541
I prefer to eat yogurt because
it makes me feel healthier.

226
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,791
You might like being undead

227
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,625
if you change your way
of thinking! Good luck!"

228
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,583
And with that,
the alien mind muncher

229
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,125
disappeared into the distance.

230
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,250
Though zombies
appear expressionless,

231
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,916
they are capable of
conveying emotion

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,750
through their
various moans.

233
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,750
[DANDY]
Uhhh...

234
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,250
[NARRATOR]
This is joy.

235
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,333
[DANDY]
Uhhh...

236
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,791
[NARRATOR]
Here's anger.

237
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,791
[DANDY]
Uhhh...

238
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,666
[NARRATOR]
And of course, sadness.

239
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,291
You may not hear
the subtle differences,

240
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,208
but I assure you
each moan is unique.

241
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,500
Taking the advice of
their "zombie guru,"

242
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,916
Dandy and his crew began
a strict diet of yogurt.

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,666
And much to their surprise,

244
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,541
every time they ate
or drank the stuff,

245
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,708
they started to
feel a little better.

246
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,916
"What's so great
about yogurt," you ask?

247
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,250
[DANDY]
Uhhh...

248
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,208
[NARRATOR] That's right.
Lactic acid bacteria.

249
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,250
[NARRATOR] Rather than thinking
of themselves as "rotting,"

250
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,291
our heroes chose to believe
they were "fermenting."

251
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,625
And that's all it took for them

252
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,416
to change their negative
outlook to a positive one.

253
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,208
That's when Dandy realized,

254
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,708
"It's funny. There really
isn't that big of a difference

255
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,500
between being dead
and being alive, baby!"

256
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,250
They learned to enjoy
their zombie lifestyle,

257
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
but there was one problem.

258
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,916
Even if Dandy and his crew

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,583
were to discover a new
species of alien.

260
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,208
They would never be
able to capture it

261
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,291
because they moved
so slowly now.

262
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,291
Our heroes, who had once eked
out a living as alien hunters,

263
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,416
now found themselves
incapable of doing the job.

264
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,125
Despite their drastically
reduced food expenses,

265
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,000
they still needed
money for the basics,

266
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,833
such as fuel, electricity, and
the occasional trip to Boobies.

267
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,166
Dandy may have lost
his taste for hot wings,

268
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,041
but he wasn't about
to give up the breasts!

269
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,166
Suddenly, Dandy remembered
a very fortunate fling.

270
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,875
Back in the day, he had
bought a life insurance policy

271
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,750
from a scorching
hot agent in the hopes

272
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,458
of getting her in the sack.

273
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,458
[CLERK]
Excuse me?

274
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,583
Whose death are you reporting?

275
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,250
Whose?

276
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,583
But you don't appear
to be dead, sir.

277
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,083
[NARRATOR]
Perhaps not surprisingly,

278
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,708
proving you're dead
is quite difficult

279
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,125
when you're still moving.

280
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,666
But Dandy and his crew returned

281
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,791
to the galactic registrar's
office every day, until finally,

282
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,000
the clerk decided he'd
had enough of their moaning

283
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,208
and issued a death certificate.

284
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,541
With the payout from Dandy's
life insurance policy,

285
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,458
their money troubles were over.

286
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,458
They ate lactic acid bacteria.

287
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,083
And spent their days sunning
themselves to keep from rotting.

288
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,166
They went back to their
routine of brushing their teeth.

289
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,708
Checking for new bald spots.

290
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,666
And being regular
customers at Boobies.

291
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,000
Hey, Dandy!
Long time no see!

292
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,958
You had me really
worried, big guy!

293
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,375
There was a nasty rumor goin'
around that you were dead!

294
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,375
You look pale;
are you feelin' okay?

295
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,041
Well, I gotta go!

296
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,791
Fortunately, with the infinite
variety of aliens in the cosmos,

297
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,708
a zombie rarely
attracts a second glance.

298
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,666
[HONEY] Alrighty, boys,
here ya go!

299
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,625
Here's to a long life!

300
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,833
[NARRATOR] Our heroes were able
to lead fairly normal lives,

301
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,583
even though they
weren't actually living.

302
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,625
Thus the old zombie adage:

303
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,333
"In space, no one can hear
that you don't have a pulse."

304
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,666
Let's switch gears and see
what happened to Dr. Gel

305
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,875
and his mercenaries
after they were turned

306
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,708
into walking dead
that fateful day.

307
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,541
[PERRY] Do you have
any idea how much money

308
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,833
the Gogol Empire spent
on this failed operation?

309
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,666
[GEL] Ahhh...

310
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
[PERRY] I assume you're prepared
to take responsibility!

311
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,458
[GEL] Ahhh...

312
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,458
[PERRY] I swear, if you say
"Ahhh" one more time...

313
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,625
[GEL] Ahhh...

314
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,875
[PERRY] Didn't you
hear what I just said?!

315
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,166
[NARRATOR] After incurring
the wrath of Admiral Perry,

316
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,166
Dr. Gel and his undead
lackeys were lost in space.

317
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,166
Let's switch
gears one last time,

318
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,166
and see what happened to
some of the other beings

319
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,500
who were turned into zombies
at the hospital that day.

320
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,750
[non-verbal

321
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,458
[NARRATOR]
According to this gentleman,

322
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,166
he met a beautiful
nurse who had also been

323
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,166
turned into a lurker and
it was love at first sight.

324
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,958
They're now living together
and they couldn't be happier.

325
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,916
[non-verbal

[non-verbal

328
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,416
[NARRATOR] But their
happiness may be short-lived

329
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,625
as a new threat
has presented itself.

330
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,458
They're known as
"the Zombie Hunters."

331
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,541
They are skilled snipers,

332
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,125
hired by the struggling
life insurance companies.

333
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,708
Their aim is to
hunt down any zombies

334
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,833
living off their own
insurance money,

335
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,875
and shoot them
through the brain.

336
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,208
They call this, "putting
a cap in their benefits."

337
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,916
It's heartless
but perfectly legal

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,958
to kill someone
who's already dead.

339
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,416
No one is safe from
the Zombie Hunters.

340
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Not even our hero and his crew.

341
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,583
[sound of gun cocking]

342
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,375

[HUNTER]
Damn it!

349
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,541
[HUNTER]
One adult, please.

350
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,541
[chomping noise]

351
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,375
[HUNTER gasps]

352
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,500
[HUNTER screams]

353
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,750
[NARRATOR] It wasn't
long before the hunters

354
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,583
and the insurance
agents who hired them

355
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,208
were turned into
walking dead themselves.

356
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,625
With the threat gone,

357
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,208
the zombies were able to
peacefully co-exist once again.

358
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,791
Eventually, everyone in
the universe became a zombie

359
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,000
and it happened faster than
anyone could've imagined.

360
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,666
In this day and age, even
robots can become zombies.

361
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,250
Now that every
living thing has

362
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,083
become an undead
version of itself,

363
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,750
the universe is an
incredibly peaceful place.

364
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,333
There is no more
sickness, death, or war.

365
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,458
We no longer classify
ourselves as different species,

366
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,500
for we have
become one unified...

367

[DANDY]
Next time on Space Dandy...

370
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,833
Get the tissues 'cause
we're bringing you

371
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,375
a story that'll
warm your heart!

372
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,875
[QT]
We are? Seriously?

373
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,833
[MEOW] You do know heartworms
are fatal in cats, right?

374
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,041
[QT]
Ew. Warm, not worm!

375
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,916
[DANDY] Next time:
"A Merry Companion


376
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,916
Is a Wagon in Space, Baby."


377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,958
See ya then!
