Yes. Now complete with upgrades!

Is that supposed to be her name?

That's right, it's P.U.P.

"Pup" for short.

Right. Because that matters.

put into my name, but whatever.

I couldn't see anything.

wonder if I actually existed.

[ALL]
Uh...

320
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,458
Um... You were saying
the planet was--?

321
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,916
[QT]
This is just a guess,

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
but I think those two were
machine-manipulating aliens

323
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,291
called a Graviton
and a Gravitino.

324
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,541
Their planet happens
to be made of machines,

325
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,750
so they were most likely on it

326
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,208
to keep the whole thing
from falling apart.

327
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,750
So, good thing?

328
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,541
[QT] Most likely,
a gravitational collapse

329
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,416
will occur,
causing it to explode.

330
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,125
Then it will turn
into a black hole,

331
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,541
pulling everything inside of
it with no hope of escape.

332
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,375
Well. Looks like
it's time to go!

333
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,208
Yeah, it doesn't look like
we're going anywhere!

334
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,041
I always wanted to
die by extreme sucking.

335
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,625
[QT] The gravitational
collapse is imminent.

336
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,708
We might get to see
what's inside a black hole.

337
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,291
What'll happen to us?

338
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,291
[QT] No one knows for sure, but
my money is on a painful death.

339
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,708
I guess this is
the end. Bye, baby.

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,166
[DANDY] To all the girls
I've loved before...

341
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,750
Oh. You mean me?

342
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,916
[DANDY]
No, not you.

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,458
Farewell.

344
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,208
Hey, Dandy, next
time you're around,

345
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,875
let's go like
hang out or something.

346
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,208
[DANDY]
Score!

347
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,708
I can't die yet;
I've got too much

348
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,541
to live for, baby! Oh, yeah!

349
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,375
I cannot imagine
what that'd be.

350
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,416
[DANDY] Why can we never
warp when we need to?

351
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,208
[QT]
We can warp.

352
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,916
What? Who said we couldn't warp?

353
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,958
Then, why haven't
we gotten out of here?

354
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,083
[QT] Because you always
say you hate warping.

355
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,750
I hate painful death more.

356
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,541
Get us out of here!
Warp it, now!

357
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,083
[QT]
Okay, fine, we'll warp.

358
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,500
Oh, crap.

359
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,625
Yes, I agree.

360
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,875
This does not
look very promising.

361
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,333
[BEA]
Well, black holes rarely do.

362
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,000
[GEL]
Oh, give me a break.

363
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,875
That man seriously knows
how to create a black hole?

364
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,000
This is bad...

365
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
Uh! Hey, hold on a second.

366
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,125
Gimme some of those sick beats!

367
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,083
[sound of record scratching]

368
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,625
Wow, that didn't work at all.

369
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,875
I guess that's what I get
for buying this thing used.

370
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,958
So you were fine letting me
think you made it yourself?

371
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,375
Hold me close, Bea!

372
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,750
We made it, guys.

373
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,333
Ugh! You kidding me? You smell
like dead fish breath, man.

374
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,208
Take a freakin' bath!

375
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,666
Bye-bye. Come back and see us!

376
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,166
My name is Doctor Gel.

377
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,708
They don't give me
very much screen time,

378
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,708
and for some reason,
I keep dying.

379
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,750
I am officially
very dissatisfied.

380
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,791
Next time: "Plants are
Living Things, Too, Baby."

381
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:28,958
[BEA] I don't think
we're in that one.

382
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,500
[GEL] Oh, sonofa--!
