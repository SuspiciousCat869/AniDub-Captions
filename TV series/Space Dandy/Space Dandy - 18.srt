1
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,750
Yeah, buddy!

2
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,416
[QT] Nope, doesn't count.
I'll explain it again.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,375
The hook has to
be inside the mouth.

4
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,750
That's how fishing works.

5
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,416
[DANDY] Now you're being
picky for no good reason.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,791
[QT] I'm being accurate.

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,208
Besides, there's
nothing impressive

8
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,958
about catching a carp.

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,333
[DANDY] You're sucking all
the fun out of this, dude.

10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,541
[MEOW]
Guys.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,750
If we're gonna spend
all this time fishing,

12
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,875
let's try for a
more lucrative catch.

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,791
Something like this, maybe.

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,125
Huh?

15
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,583
A mysterious fish straight
out of ancient legend.

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,250
Found on the world
Kayu; the Munagi.

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,250
[DANDY] Munagi, huh?

18
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,666
[MEOW] Apparently
it's mega-rare,

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,000
appearing only once every
thirty-six hundred years.

20
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,541
Sounds a little
fishy to me.

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,125
[QT] Hey! It must be true.

22
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,666
It's on the wanted list
at the Registration Center.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,291
If we catch it, we'll net
fifty million woolongs!

24
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,708
No way!

25
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,875
Then what are we doing out
here fishing for guppies?

26
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,875
Let's go catch us
a Munagi, baby!

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,625
[NARRATOR] And so, Dandy and
company headed to Planet Kayu,

28
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,416
excited about a
profitable day of fishing.

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,416
Unfortunately, they were
immediately caught

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,208
in a bed of space kelp.

31
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,708
[DANDY] Seriously?

32
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,625
[QT]
Uh. This doesn't look good.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,375
It'll be a while
before we can move.

34
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,333
[MEOW]
Eh?

35
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,708
[DANDY]
Alrighty, then.

36
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,916
I'll have to handle
this on my own.

37
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
Whoa! Oh! Uh!

38
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,583
Hey! What in the-- ew.

39
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:27,250
Oh! Oh no! Oh no! Ohhhh!!

40
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,750
[DANDY]
Ow, ow, ow!

41
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,375
[ERSSIME] Wow!
It's a mudworlder!

42
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,625
Huh?

43
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,125
[ERSSIME] Ha!
Your headpiece is weird.

44
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,333
[chuckles]
Wanna be friends?

45
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,375
Wha--?

46
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,291
[ERSSIME] We're best
friends now, okay?

47
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,541
Yeah, sure. Whatever
you want. We're BFFs.

48
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,208
So, pal, you ever heard of
a rare fish called a Munagi?

49
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,791
[ERSSIME] Sure,
I know the Munagi!

50
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,458
Yeah? You do? Really?

51
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,500
[ERSSIME] This way! This way!

52
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,291
Whoa, hold on!
Wait for me!

53
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,041
[ERSSIME] Here we are!

54
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,166
Where?

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,875
[ERSSIME] See that house?

56
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,375
[DANDY] Oh. You live <i>there</i> ?

57
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,166
[ERSSIME] I'm home!

58
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,916
That's not her face. Hm.

59
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,833
L'delise! I brought a
friend over to visit!

60
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,541
Uh. The name's
Space Dandy.

61
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,333
It's nice to
meetcha.

62
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,041
Uhh...

63
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,583
This is L'delise.
He's a great fisherman.

64
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,041
[DANDY] That should
work out well, then.

65
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,541
Here's the deal.

66
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,875
I'm lookin' to catch this
special fish called the Munagi.

67
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,208
Do you know
anything about it?

68
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,750
Where to find it,
or what bait to use?

69
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,000
Really anything will help.

70
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,625
[L'DELISE] Go away.

71
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,875
Why? What'd I
ever do to you?

72
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,750
[ERSSIME] Dandy!
Let's get moving!

73
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,583
We've got a Munagi to catch!

74
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:49,333
Yeah! Old geezer.
That is one grouchy man.

75
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:58,750
[ERSSIME] Munagi!
Munagi! Munagi! Munagi!

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,666
Where should we look?
Where should we look?

77
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,916
[DANDY] Wait. What'd you say?

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,791
I thought you knew all
about these fancy fish.

79
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,125
I do!

80
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,583
[DANDY] We haven't
gotten a single bite.

81
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,833
Are you sure there are
fish living in this sludge?

82
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,541
It looks pretty gross.

83
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
[ERSSIME] I'll go in and--

84
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,583
Aw, man.
Hope she didn't drown.

85
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
What is that thing?

86
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,666
There's lots and lots
of fish down there.

87
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,791
Hey, now.
You got moves, baby.

88
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,583
Uh, right.

89
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,833
I'm gonna take a wild guess

90
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,541
and say this guy isn't
a Munagi, though, is he?

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,208
[ERSSIME] Bye-bye, Dandy!

92
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,041
Let's play again later, 'kay?

93
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,583
[DANDY] Yeah. We'll catch us
a Munagi tomorrow, Erssime.

94
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:42,791
[snoring]

95
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,125
It's freakin'
freezing out here!

96
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,916
A little late-night
stargazing?

97
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,708
[DANDY] Enjoy, gramps.

98
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,166
Everywhere I go nothing
but mud, mud, and more mud.

99
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,916
Are there really any of
those Munagi around here?

100
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,708
[DANDY] I know that
bird from somewhere.

101
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,250
[DANDY] Huh? Great.
Captain Crotchety.

102
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,041
Huh?! Whoa!!

103
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,583
Hm?

104
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,000
[L'DELISE] That idiot.

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,250
That was almost
the end of Dandy.

106
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,333
Thanks. You saved my bacon.

107
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,541
I didn't save you
because you deserve it.

108
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,125
[L'DELISE] Long ago,
a great many fools

109
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,083
like you came here hoping
to catch the Munagi.

110
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,958
They all met the same fate.

111
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,541
They offended
the Munagi and died.

112
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,875
I don't like you, maggot.
Stay out of my way.

113
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,750
Hey!

114
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,041
Come back here!
I'm not leaving.

115
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,375
You hear me, ya old geezer?

116
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,833
Not until
I catch me a Munagi!

117
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,041
[sneeze]

118
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,541
How are we supposed
to find a Munagi, then?

119
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,791
It won't be easy!

120
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
The legend says it
lives someplace real deep

121
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,500
beneath the surface and doesn't
ever take any bait at all!

122
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,958
Yeah, really?

123
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,083
That doesn't say much for
our chances of catching one.

124
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,666
[ERSSIME] There's more, though.

125
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,708
It doesn't happen
often, not at all!

126
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,958
But when there's a blue moon,

127
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,625
the Munagi will actually
swim up to the surface!

128
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,916
That's what the
legend says, anyway.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,583
And it goes back
for, like, ever.

130
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,000
That's the thing
about legends.

131
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,750
They can be a
little off sometimes.

132
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,500
L'delise hunted the
Munagi for a long time, too.

133
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,166
Mean geezer dude? Really?

134
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,708
[ERSSIME] He loves to fish,
and he's real good at it!

135
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,333
Erssime wants to grow up

136
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,625
and be as good a fisherman
as L'delise someday!

137
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,250
Well, don't sweat it, kid.

138
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,291
I think you'll make
a great fisherman!

139
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,500
If memory serves,
it looked something like this.

140
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,208
[VILLAGER 18A] Hey! Check
your line. You've got a bite!

141
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,833
And here we go!

142
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,083
Looks like a big one!

143
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,416
Maybe you finally caught
the legendary fish! Eh?

144
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,416
How long now until
the blue moon comes out

145
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,125
and the Munagi
make an appearance?

146
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,458
Aw, poor sap.

147
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,333
Those two totally have him
convinced, don't they?

148
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,208
Yeah. For starters, this planet
doesn't even have a moon!

149
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,583
[DANDY] But-- but what
about that old legend?

150
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,458
L'delise is the only
person on this world

151
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,541
who puts any stock
in that old story.

152
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,166
Nobody ever goes near him.

153
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,916
He's always in a bad mood,
and he's a pretty creepy guy.

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,125
Now that you mention it,
he is a weird old coot.

155
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,708
[VILLAGER 18A]
Well, see you later!

156
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,750
Hope the fish keep on
biting for you, stranger!

157
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,375
Were they just
messing with me?

158
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,875
[MEOW] So nothing but total
radio silence from Dandy, huh?

159
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,333
[QT] No, he hasn't tried
to contact us at all.

160
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,166
Granted, this happens a lot,
but I still hope he's okay.

161
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,958
Huh? Isn't this--

162
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,291
[QT] Yeah, it is.
That's not good!

163
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,375
[chuckling female voice]

164
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,958
[bubbly gasp]

165
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:43,583
[gargled screams]

166
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,125
[muffled screams]

167
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,625
Aaah! Stop!

168
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,666
I can't find L'delise!

169
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
Eh?

170
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,375
[ERSSIME] What do we do?
I'm worried.

171
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,375
Do you think he might've
gone Munagi fishing?

172
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,291
Yeah. I don't
know about that.

173
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,083
I'm not seeing that blue moon
the legend mentioned,

174
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,875
and it looks like
a storm's coming.

175
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,458
And, of course,
as an added bonus,

176
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,875
Munagi probably
aren't even real.

177
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,208
They're real! Erssime
believes L'delise!

178
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,375
Uh, yeah.

179
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,708
I'm serious! L'delise
would never tell a lie!

180
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,041
How 'bout you, Dandy?

181
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,166
I know when I'm beat.

182
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,500
All right, kid. Let's see
if we can find him.

183
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,250
[laughter]

184
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,250
Huh?

185
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,875
[DANDY] That bird again.

186
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,666
If we follow it, it might
lead us to the old man.

187
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,458
[DANDY] All right!
Let's get moving!

188
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,666
[QT] Yep, that's
the Rubini Comet.

189
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,166
It only comes around once
every thirty-six-hundred years.

190
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,916
It's getting closer,
which is not good for us.

191
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,583
I picked up
on that, thanks.

192
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,250
We should give Dandy
a heads up about it.

193
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,583
[QT] But we can't go anywhere!

194
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,708
The Aloha Oe still can't move!

195
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,583
Hey, look.

196
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,500
[QT] Huh?

197
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,375
[MEOW] 
Think we can use that?

198
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,416
[ERSSIME] L'delise!

199
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,875
Hm? Erssime!

200
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,416
[DANDY] Wait up, you crazy coot!

201
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,333
Why're you still here?

202
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,625
I thought I told you to leave.

203
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,541
Yeah, and I told <i>you</i>
I wasn't going home

204
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,166
until I caught a Munagi.

205
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,666
You see what I see?

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,083
Incredible!

207
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,250
It really is a blue moon!

208
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,416
[L'DELISE]
As the legend tells us,

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,916
when a blue moon fills the sky,

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,666
the seas shall billow and the
Munagi shall rise from the deep!

211
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,333
They should be here soon.

212
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,458
[DANDY] Huh?

213
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,541
[QT] What do you think that is?

214
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,166
[MEOW] Meow.

215
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,791
Yeah, here
they come, baby!

216
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,000
Make 'em go away!

217
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,500
It begins.

218
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,333
Okay, Munagi, this is it!

219
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,083
Let's see what you got, huh?

220
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,208
[DANDY] Ah! My rod and tackle!

221
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,458
[L'DELISE] Useless tenderfoot!

222
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,791
[DANDY] Bail faster, kid.

223
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,791
Here it comes!

224
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,458
That's amazing!

225
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,083
[ERSSIME] Look out behind you!

226
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,666
[DANDY] Whoa!

227
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,333
Did he make the catch?

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,250
L'delise!

229
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,125
Hey! Come back!

230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,250
You okay?
That was close, huh?

231
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,833
To fail after all that.

232
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:03,000
[DANDY] Auuuuuuggghh!!

233
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,875
[DANDY] You're not
goin' anywhere!

234
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,375
Be careful!

235
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,541
Let's go help him out.

236
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,458
[DANDY screams]

237
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,166
[L'DELISE] All right.
Let's see if we can pull it in.

238
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,500
We're with ya!

240
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,666
Okay, now. Ready?

budging, is it?

246
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,333
Huh?

247
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,666
[QT] Is that a Munagi?

248
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,583
You actually
found one? Sweet.

249
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,041
You guys picked a good
time to make an entrance.

250
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,750
Come on, you slackers!
Pull like you mean it.

I'm doing my part.

my battery's gonna blow!

legend is actually true!

Sorry we made fun of you.
That was our bad.

255
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,833
It's okay,
just help out now.

Heave, two, three, four!

272
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,958
Can't keep pulling.
Arms so tired.

273
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,791
[L'DELISE]
Oi.

274
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,958
Huh...?

275
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,458
Take the bow and arrow.

276
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,791
[DANDY] Huh?

277
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,833
Go on, take it! Or are
you just gonna sit there?

278
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,625
You really mean it.
Count on Dandy.

279
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,125
[ERSSIME] Good luck!
You can do it!

280
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,083
What are you waiting for?

281
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,500
[DANDY] Here we go! Uh-oh.

282
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,708
[ERSSIME]
Dandy!

283
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,416
[DANDY] Where the
hell are we going?

284
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,208
[NARRATOR] Three-thousand-six
hundred years ago,

285
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,208
the Munagi soared
through the universe

286
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,250
on the back of the
majestic Rubini Comet.

287
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,625
When the comet drew
close to Planet Kayu,

288
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,583
the great sea
creatures crossed over.

289
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,875
And now at long last, the
Rubini Comet has reappeared,

290
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,541
and the Munagi can return
to their rightful home.

291
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,500
[ERSSIME crying]

292
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,208
Dandy's dead, isn't he?

293
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,375
[QT] I wonder if
this means we're going

294
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,916
to have to go up
there after him.

295
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,750
[bubbling sound]

296
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,916
Ugh. Ow!

297
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,666
Hey! It's Dandy!

298
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,750
[DANDY] Damn overgrown
fish got away.

299
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,708
Hmph! Stupid neophyte!

300
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,166
You say something to me,
you decrepit old geezer?

301
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,458
You brats are all the same!

302
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,250
Wet-behind-the-ears,
and no good to anybody!

303
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,500
I hope you plan to retire

304
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,958
before the senility kicks in.

305
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,125
[L'DELISE] Retire, huh?

306
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,833
Why don't you come over
here and say that?

307
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,041
Aw, you guys!
You're finally getting along!

308
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,625
[DANDY] Fine, I'll say it
again: you should retire!

309
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,708
[L'DELISE] Not a
chance, tenderfoot!

310
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,625
[QT] Don't forget, the
hook has to be inside

311
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,250
the fish's mouth or
the catch doesn't count.

312
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,291
Are you kidding? All that
and we're back here now?

313
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,583
[MEOW] Guys. If we're gonna
spend all this time fishing,

314
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,500
why don't we try for
a more lucrative catch?

315
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,791
[DANDY] Shut up.

316
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,208
[QT] Just work on
your fishing skills.

317
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,541
Like I said,

318
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,875
there's nothing impressive
about catching a carp.

319
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,583
[DANDY] Say that one more time.

320
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,833
[MEOW] If it's impressive
you're looking for,

321
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,708
there's always the
legendary Mussie.

322
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,708
[DANDY] Mussie, huh? All right,
sounds good to me!

323
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,375
So, where should we
start looking for it?

324
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,083
[GENTLE] My name is Gentle,

325
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,500
and I am far too refined for
a lowbrow anime such as this.

326
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,500
[DANDY] 'Scuse me?

327
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,875
[WOMAN] So handsome.

328
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,291
[DANDY] Hey!

329
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,500
[GENTLE] Next time, "The Gallant
Space Gentleman, Baby."

330
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,458
Until then!

331
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,916
[DANDY] See ya then!
