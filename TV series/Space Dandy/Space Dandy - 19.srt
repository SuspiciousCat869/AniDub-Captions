00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,041
I wonder where
he is right now.

a dummy, Scarlet.

It's not like the
perfect man's gonna

11
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,458
come waltzing in here and
plunk a ring down on your desk.

12
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,916

[SCARLET] Tell me about it.

15
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,416
They're not too
easy on the eyes.

16
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,333
And there're
usually three of 'em.

17
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,958
Men, or eyes?

[laugh track laughter]

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,208
Even so, any guy you meet
here you should throw back.

20
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,250
Yeah, I know, Pine-Pine,

21
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,791
but where else am
I gonna meet a man, huh?

22
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,916
We're taking your lonely
asteroid to a space mixer!

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,125
You might meet someone
dandy and gentle.

24
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,291
Who knows?

25
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,625
[SCARLET] Dandy and gentle?

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,083
Where do I sign?

27
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,291
[NARRATOR] Where does
one find a dandy man

in the vast infinity of space?

This chicken wing,
it's so good,

33
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,458
I can't wrap my brain around it.

34
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,083
[QT] You know you're sucking
on your own tail, right?

35
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,625
That would explain why
it tasted all familiar.

00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:47,666
[laugh track laughter]

37
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916

time we give up

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,875
on the Cloudian and
catch something easier?

39
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,250
[NARRATOR] Dandy and crew
are looking for an alien

40
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,500
that would land
them a huge bounty.

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,750
Only problem is,
it's been six months,

42
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,791
and they've found squat.

43
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,583
Morale has gone belly-up,
and bellies have gone empty.

44
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,875
It's been a drag.

45
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,250
All we need is
L-O-V-E, love, guys.

46
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,583
[QT] Huh?

47
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,583
I've come to a
realization, baby.

48
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,208
What I lack in life,
it ain't food,

49
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,333
or wulongs, I need love to grow!

50
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,625
[QT] Uh.

51
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,833
Here's a thought.
What if I'm love itself?

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,416
[QT] Total body fat:
Less than one percent.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,208
Total water: Thirty
cubic centimeters.

54
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,708
He was less thrashed
when he was a zombie.

[laugh track laughter]

56
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,708
[QT] I think the prolonged lack

57
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,208
of food and water
is making him crazy.

58
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,000
[MEOW] He wasn't before?

59
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,416
Seize your destiny!

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,375
Love's not something you
grab with a tractor-beam!

61
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,166
It's something you
give to the world,

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,875
all naked and sexy vulnerable!

63

explode just yet.

Planet C'est La Vie
is coming up ahead.

00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,416
Oh, they're hosting a free

[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, in a
place not lacking for reason,

69
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,833
or food, or pants,
we find this man.

70
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,625
His name is Sir Gentle Nobra.

71
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,708
He's one of Dandy's
elusive Cloudians.

72
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,291
The cloud surrounding his ship
is actually a part of him.

73
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,375
It serves as a
storehouse for the data

74
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,125
he's gathered from
a lifetime of travel.

[sniffs]

76
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,166
All I want to do is
share a pot of rose tea

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,333
with the right companion.

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,041
Sitting in the
dark is no fun.

79
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,166
Oh, wow!
What do you sell here?

[laugh track laughter]

81
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,166
[GEL] No shop this,
my dear girl.

82
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,166
I am Dr. Gel, your hesitant
captor and eager host.

83
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,416
I bear you not
a shred of ill-will.

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,916
Rather, I've brought you here

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,083
to help me find a
certain ne'er-do-well.

You know him?

00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,666
Oh! You want Dandy!

90
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,416
We've been led to
believe you're well versed

91
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
in this Dandy's comings
and goings, m'lady.

92
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,041
Hmm...?

93

[GEL] "Hmm," indeed.

94
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,708
So we're going to copy
your brain's contents

00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,208
into this impressive device
under which you now sit.

[SCARLET] I dunno, Pine-Pine.

98
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,750
I'm not seeing any
quality men around here.

99
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,416
What's the theme of this
mixer supposed to be?

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,541
The theme is
"Eat like a queen!"

101
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,750
And don't let the schmucks
get their hooks into you!

you are preaching
to the big green choir!

Man, she can
really pack it away.

So whaddya think, is she
here for the grub or the love?

[DANDY] Whatta freeloader.

Now's your chance to hit
her with your love-beam,

or whatever it was
you were saying.

But, Dandy, there might be
an unregistered alien here.

Finding true love's hard enough.

out the door

00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,458
into the pink cloud,
isn't that Scarlet?

161
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,791
Yeah.

162
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,500
[QT] I wonder if that
means that's the Cloudian

163
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,416
we've been looking
for this whole time!

164
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,666
What?

165
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,958
Let 'em go.

166
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,500
There's no way we can
catch up to 'em now.

167
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,791
[QT] Yeah, we can.

168
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Only thing I wanna
catch is a nap.

169
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,000
Ditto that.

170
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,625
[laugh track laughter]

171
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
[DANDY] No Honey today, huh?

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,250
[QT] I want to
find the Cloudian.

173
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,000
Not only for the
bounty, of course,

174
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,875
but because Scarlet is with him.

175
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,958
So what?

176
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,541
[QT] If a Cloudian
searched her out,

177
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,000
her life must be pretty crummy.
I feel bad for her, that's all.

178
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,208
Yeah, I get it.

179
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,250
I mean, Scarlet's no
spring chicken anymore,

180
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,833
and all that frowning
she's always doing

181
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,500
at us ain't exactly helping the
sell-by date any, ya feel me?

182
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
Well, aren't you
a smooth talker.

183
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,083
[laugh track laughter]

184
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
[DJ] Thanks for waiting, fellas!

185
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,416
Happy Hour starts now!

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Shake it, ladies!

187
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,791
Now that it's just us adults,

188
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,500
what is a Cloudian anyway?

189
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,375
[QT] They take lonely
women up to their ships

190
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,916
and show them a good time.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,041
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

192
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,666
So you're saying
this alien's a master

193
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,625
of the ol' "love 'em
and leave 'em routine?

194
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,083
I know, can you believe
what a monster he is?

195
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:36,666
[laugh track laughter]

196
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,833
All right!

197
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,125
Let's go bag ourselves
a Cloudian, baby!

198
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,166
[QT] Dandy sure seems motivated.

199
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,625
All it took
was a little T&amp;A.

200
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,208
Huh? What happened?

201
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,333
[BEA] It's overloading, sir!

202
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,541
This defies explanation.

203
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,583
Oh, well that's your
problem right there.

204
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,458
You're gonna need an andro-
supergreat-giga drive, Doc.

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,000
Huh? Is it possible
this girl is a--?

206
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,541
Uh-huh! I'm a Cloudian!
Just half, though!

207
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,541
Tell me. Are you
one of those--?

208
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,750
[GENTLE] Go on.

209
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,750
No, on second thought,
I don't wanna know.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,625
Just say it, Scarlet.

211
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
You're a Cloudian, aren't you?

212
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,208
Quite.

213
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,500
Ah.

214
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,041
And you would that
I were otherwise?

215
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,500
[SCARLET sighs] I wasn't
born yesterday.

216
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,458
Your kind has a clear M.O.

217
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,666
Trawl through women's personal
data for the lonely ones,

218
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,250
then drop in on your cloud
and give 'em a little thrill.

219
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,291
If that's your idea
of charity, save it.

220
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,750
I'm not desperate! Really!

221
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,291
Everyone has a dry-spell, right?

222
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:18,083
If I could, I would peel
my birthright clean away.

223
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,541
Women hold me to
be a dilettante.

224
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,875
No one thinks me
capable of true love,

225
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
given my proclivities.

226
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,333
I want to stoke the embers
of your lips into a smile.

227
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,500
Verily, that is what
I want for all women.

228
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,791
[GENTLE] My heart shivers.

229
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,791
All that I want is to
bring as much happiness

230
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,666
to a woman as she's
brought to the universe.

231
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,625
Look, I-- I'm sorry.

232
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,833
It's just that I get
paid to doubt people.

233
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,916
At the end of the day,
it can be so hard to turn off.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,375
I wish-- I wish
I were a better person.

235
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,083
No, don't say that!

236
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,208
Yours is the purest
heart I've ever known.

237
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,000
[NARRATOR] You probably
picked up on this already,

238
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,625
but a Cloudian reflects
his feelings through color

239
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,125
and weather conditions
within his cloud--

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
[NARRATOR]
Oh, did I kill the mood?

241
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,041
You kids go right ahead.

242
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,625
[laugh track laughter]

243
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,333
[QT] According to the
Weather Radar LooksLikeRain,

244
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,000
there's a cloud moving
extremely quickly through space.

245
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,291
We can't be sure, but
that's probably the Cloudian.

246
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,625
There any reason
we didn't use

247
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,166
this thing in the first place?

248
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,416
[QT] Somebody wasn't putting
enough hustle into their job.

249
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,916
[heavy panting]

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,916
[QT] We should catch up
to it soon, though.

251
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,625
Ah. Don't mind if I do.

252
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,041
[DANDY] Psyche!
Totally goin' in!

253
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,375
[GENTLE] Welcome to my
humble ship, the Edinburgh.

254
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,291
Guests are a rare
treat indeed, sirrah.

255
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,166
I am the occupant,
Gentle Nobra.

256
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,583
[DANDY] The name's Dandy.
Pleased to meet ya.

257
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,083
Might I interest you
in a cup of tea?

258
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,291
The sitting room
is most agreeable.

259
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,708
[QT] He talks all fancy-like!

260
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,166
[MEOW] Man, this
place is friggin' huge.

261
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,291
Dandy? Why are you here?

262
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,708
Don't worry!

263
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,750
I see the look in your eyes,
and I'm here to save ya!

264
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,291
Save me from what?

265
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,916
Please, warm yourself.
You must be chilly.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,166
And you. Recharge all you like.

267
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,166
And brandy for a Dandy.

268
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,750
Oh. Yeah.

269
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,166
Well? What're you doing here?

270
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,291
Huh?! Oh, right!
Damn near forgot!

271
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,333
I'm taking you in, top hat!

272
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,208
[laugh track laughter]

273
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,791
Capturing me is no easy task.

274
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,833
You're as like to catch
a cloud in a butterfly net.

275
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,791
[laugh track laughter]

276
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,125
This place haunted?

277
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,791
Or do you have a laugh track
with low standards?

278
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,541
Well! Your sense
of hearing is quite keen!

279
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,000
Atmo. You, too, Sphere.
Hold your tongue.

280
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,708
Say what?

281
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,000
They're
known as Ambiancians.

282
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,166
I hired them to help
out around the ship,

283
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,250
but, drat the luck, all
they do is chime in like that.

284
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,500
[AMBIANCIANS awww]

285
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,958
Are they registered, or--?

286
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,833
[QT] How would
we transport them?

287
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,416
What're they going on about?

288
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,791
You are not kidnapping anyone!

289
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,000
Why? 'Cause it's his job?

290
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,666
Ugh! Just kick him out!

291
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,625
[GENTLE] Please, calm down.
[DANDY] I'm tryin' to save you--

292
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm sorry, you were saying?

293
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,625
[AMBIANCIANS laugh]

294
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,375
I said, I'm gonna knock
your monocled ass out, baby!

295
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,000
That rather smacks of a duel.

296
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,250
So be it. I have no
choice but to oblige you.

297
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,583
Hey! Hold on!

298
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,208
Don't fight over me!
Unless you must.

299
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,791
[beeping sound]

300
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,125
[CLOUD SHIP PA] An S.O.S.
signal has been detected.

301
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,250
What? On screen!

302
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,625
Dandy! Help! They caught me!

303
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,291
If you save me,
I'll comp your next meal!

304
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,333
Whoa--Honey!

305
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,666
Lady, is it really you?

306
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,333
Huh?

307
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,291
This is an outrage!

308
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,125
I will rescue her forthwith!

309
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,916
Are you nuts?
She said "Dandy!"

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,916
What of it?

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,625
[DANDY] Hey! Wait!

312
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,958
[SCARLET] Hold on!
What about me?

313
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
[PERRY] What?

314
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,208
[GEL] Though it
beggars belief to see her,

315
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,625
this little minx
thought up the trap

316
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,708
that is now luring Dandy to us.

317
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
Yay! He'll show up.

318
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,166
Dandy loves free
Boobies most of all!

319
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,583
What a spitfire, eh?

320
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,708
I'm supposed to work

321
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,625
the late shift up
at Boobies tonight.

322
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,708
Be a sweetie and zap me
back to my bike, would ya?

323
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,291
Yes, but of course.

324
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,750
The moment we apprehend Dandy,

325
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,875
you'll be free to go on
your merry way, my dear.

326
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,416
[PERRY] Gel.

327
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,083
Oh, Doctor Gel!
You're such a gentleman.

328
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,625
My gentle nature has
been a heavy burden.

329
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,791
I am a lover, not a fighter,
though I can hold my own.

330
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:54,416
[AMBIANCIANS laugh]

331
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,041
[PERRY] Agh. Gel!

332
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,375
Oh, Doc! I bet you're a
real beast in a fight!

333
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,500
[PERRY] Listen,
you besotted fool!

334
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,750
After stammering all

335
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,166
of the Gogol Empire's
secrets into her ear,

336
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,083
you're just going to let
her go, you nincompoop?

337
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,416
What would you have me do?

338
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,708
[PERRY] Kill her!

339
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,416
[GEL] B-But Admiral!

340
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,875
[beeping sound]

341
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,708
Dr. Gel, I think
something's coming!

342
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,250
[GEL] Really?

343
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,125
Admiral Perry, permission to
mobilize the Seventh Fleet, sir!

344
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,708
Surely it's Dandy!

345
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,916
[GENTLE] Stop pressing
things at random!

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,375
Save her with your own ship,
if you've a mind to!

347
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,250
[QT] The Aloha Oe
ran out of fuel. Sorry!

348
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,875
Where's the missile button?

349
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,000
[GENTLE] Incendiaries? You jest!

350
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,166
Really? Then what
are we gonna do?

351
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,125
Simple. We'll rely on
civilized discourse.

352
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,750
Hey! You're not done,
you lightweight!

353
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
Don't you care
what's up out there?

354
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
We're, like, in space.

355
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,666
Hmph! Whatever it is,
a man did it!

356
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,166
[AMBIANCIANS laugh]

357
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
The ship! It isn't Dandy's, sir!

358
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,583
It's way too big!

359
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,625
Come again?

360
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,708
[PERRY] Dammit, Gel! Behind you!

361
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,708
Emerald Flowsian, slam!

362
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,333
Misawa is awesome!

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,833
Later, 'gators!

364
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,250
Be still my heart.

365
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,666
[CLOUD SHIP PA]
We've been surrounded

366
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,625
by a hostile fleet, sir.

367
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,458
[DANDY] For reals?

368
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,541
Zounds! So this was a trap?

369
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,000
[QT] They weren't
exactly discreet about it.

370
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,250
Damn their eyes!

371
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,500
They dare to kidnap she
whom I hold most dear?

372
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,916
Villainy! Aye! They will suffer!

373
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,791
Burn to a crisp!

374
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,416
[DANDY] Chill out, baby!
Chill out!

375
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,916
[PERRY] All ships open fire!

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,833
[OPERATOR 19A] But, Admiral!
Dr. Gel is still onboard!

377
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,333
[PERRY] Screw him!

378
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,958
No. No, my ship!

379
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,208
And my beautiful cloud!
They're destroying them!

380
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,708
How's the "no weapons"
thing workin' out for ya?

381
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,875
[QT] I found the
emergency eject button!

382
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,333
What are you waiting for?

383
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,500
[QT] But what about
Scarlet and Meow?

384
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,250
[DANDY] Son-of-a--!

385
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,416
"I'm a rare alien
with a fancy-ass ship!"

386
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,583
Wouldn't know a trap
if it bit him in the ass!

387
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,500
Don't be mean.

388
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,083
At least Gentle
isn't afraid of love.

389
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,083
Love?

390
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,625
You're not such
a hard-ass, are ya?

391
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,958
[AMBIANCIANS laugh]

392
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,375
Wow! So cute!

393
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,291
Lady!

394
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,250
Big bro. Is it really you?

395
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,750
This guy is your big brother?

396
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,708
[NARRATOR] More or less.
They're actually half-siblings.

397
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,500
Turns out Honey's
real name is Lady Nobra.

398
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,750
She's only half Cloudian
herself, like she mentioned--

399
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,000
but we're already running
down the clock here,

400
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,208
so we'll get into
that some other time.

401
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,208
[AMBIANCIANS laugh]

402
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,250
I'm glad you're safe, Lady.

403
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,666
But stay back!

404
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
Huh?

405
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,166
With my ship's demise.

406
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,833
I lost the cloud for
which we are known.

407
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,750
This small piece
was all I could save.

408
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,666
I cannot face you
cloudless as I am, Lady.

409
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,791
The shame of it is too great.

410
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,750
But I don't care about that!

411
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,625
It's not like I have my cloud!

412
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,083
No, Lady.

413
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,333
My pride as a gentleman is
the one thing I yet possess.

414
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,666
Whenever you're done, big bro,

415
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,875
I'm gonna register
you right here and now.

416
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,583
Hey! Scan him, okay?

417
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,083
Why bother?

418
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,041
A Cloudian without his cloud
is just a regular old alien.

419
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,833
What the hell?

420
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,083
Sister, to know
that you're well,

421
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,875
how it gladdens my heart.

422
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,208
I swear I will gather
my cloud anew,

423
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,000
and reunite with you
as a proper Cloudian!

424
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,291
I'll blot out the sky

425
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,958
with its magnificence--just
you wait and see!

426
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,833
[HONEY] Oh, big brother!

[AMBIANCIANS awww]

428
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,208
I shall take my leave of you.

Farewell, Dandy.

430
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,041
See ya, Bro! And good luck!

431
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,583
I know you'll gather
your cloud again,

432
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,875
better than ever, you'll see!

433
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,875
Be good, okay? Bye-bye!

434
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,750
Do you wanna ride?

435
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,291
Do I ever!

436
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,875
[QT] I'll sit in front!

437
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,375
I got dibs on the caboose!

438
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,708
Oh, there's no more room.

Space Dandy is a documentary.

444

Following the phantom

'The Dropkix'
from their formation
