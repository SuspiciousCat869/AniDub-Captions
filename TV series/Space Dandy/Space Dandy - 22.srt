story on this place?

00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,083
[QT] My research
says it's the home

of the legendary
Dancingian Festival.

Okay, what

the Dancingians are obviously
some kind of rare alien.

spin out of control.

00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,750
For eons, the appearance
of these symbiotic life forms

159
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,333
marked the planet's seasons,
until a sudden climatic change

160
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,625
brought them to the
brink of extinction.

161
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,791
The few surviving spores
lay dormant for centuries,

162
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,458
but at last--these
long-forgotten creatures

163
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,000
are ready for a comeback.

164

[PLANET CHIEF]
Big news from Planet Grease!

165

you'll never forget!

167
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,500
Have your picture taken
with a real Dancingian!

168
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208

169
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,916
and try for the grand prize of
seven-hundred-million woolongs!

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,541
That's right, you heard me!

171
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,083
Seven-hundred-million!

172
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,000
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity so don't miss out!

Come to Planet Grease today!

174

[BEA] Dr. Gel?

175
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,041
[BEA] I have to ask,

176
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,666
why are we even trying to
catch Dandy in the first place?

177
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,125
[GEL] Aw, what's the matter,
Bea? What kind of talk is that?

178
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,000
[BEA sighs] I hate to
complain but I'm just tired

179
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,000
of getting blown up
week after week.

180
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,208
A guy like me can
only take so much.

181
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,500
I see.

182
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,958
It sounds like you could
really use a vacation.

183
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, I know!

184
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,500
Perhaps this will motivate you--

185
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,833
When we finish this job
you can take some time off!

186
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,166
[BEA] Do you mean it?

187
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,833
[GEL] I think that's just
what the doctor ordered!

188
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,791
There's no better
way to cleanse the mind.

189
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,625

dip in the hot--

[GEL]
What the blazes was that?

192
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,500
It looks like a
hit-and-run, sir!

193
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,291
Why, that miserable bastard!

194
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,958
Make sure you get his info!

195
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,708
We'll sue the pants off him!

196
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,250
[QT] Welcome to
Planet Grease, everybody!

197
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,375
Right this way!
Thank you for coming out!

198
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,875
I see we've got
some major contenders

199
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,791
for today's dance contest!

200
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,916
Make your way to the stage!

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,750
The show is starting soon!

202
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,458
[DANDY] Aw, come on, man!

203
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,958
Tights, sure, but a hula hoop?

204
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,125
[PLANET CHIEF] I studied
up on Dancingians and apparently

205
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,291
they were accompanied
by some kind of big rings.

206
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,458
I doubt they looked like that
but the audience'll never know.

00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,875
Huh?

210
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,666
[PLANET CHIEF] Wait, that's it?

211

[PLANET CHIEF'S WIFE] Mm hmm.
[MEOW and QT] Yeah.

[PLANET CHIEF]
Well, the show must go on!

Hey, Dandy.

Uh. Sorry, I mean,
Mr. Dancingian, you're on!

So that's a Dancingian?

He's so sexy!

231
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,958
[QT] He has a big ring just
like the old man said he would!

232
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,958
He's gotta be a
genuine Dancingian!

233
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,333
So handsome!

234
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,833
I don't swing that way
but I gotta agree.

might never return.

of Dandy's

00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,875
Hurry, play it backwards!

319
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:51,791
[high-pitched record
backspin noises]

320
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,875
Aw, yeah!
I think it's workin', baby!

321
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,458
Huh?

322
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,750
Hey, what're you doin'?

323
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,750
That's too far back, fleabag!

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,541
Meeeeooow!

325
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,458
Aaaaaah!!

326
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,291
She's awake!

327
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,833
Goodness, it's a miracle!

328
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,458
[PLANET CHIEF'S MOTHER]
They've returned!

329
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,166
It's just like
when I was a girl.

330
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,166
Strike that. It's even more
amazing this time around!

331
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,208
Meow!

332
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,708
I can't believe it,
the Dancingians are back!

333
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,458
What the--?

334
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,375
Hey!

335
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,000
Isn't it just
amazing, Mother?

336
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,458
He's an honest-to-goodness
Dancingian!

337
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,833
Those numbskulls
aren't anything close.

338
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,875
Huh?

339
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,208
Well, if that's the case.

340
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,333
Then who the heck are you?

341
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,708
What? Who me?

342
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,375
I am Ton Jravolta!
Oh, spacey soul!

343
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,375
[NARRATOR] As it turns out, Ton
Jravolta is not a Dancingian.

344
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,708
He's just an alien
who likes to party;

345
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,333
traveling the universe from
one dance contest to the next.

346
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,208
His ring is a transport device

347
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,125
for his top-of-the-line
sound and lighting systems.

348
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,666
This professional booty
shaker is always prepared!

349
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,458
If it's not him,
then who is it?

350
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,625
Look son, there they are!

351
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,208
The Dancingians are coming!

352
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,750
[PLANET CHIEF'S MOTHER]
Aren't they beautiful?

353
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,458
They're the gods who will lead
this land to its true form!

354
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,166
Are you kiddin' me?

355
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,083
[NARRATOR]
These are the Dancingians.

356
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,375
However, they've never known

357
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,375
that this is what they're
called and honestly,

358
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,208
there's no reason they should.

359
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,458
To a species like this,
things like names,

360
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,625
or the opinions of others,
are of no importance.

361
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,083
They live simply
for the sake of living.

362
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,041
When the time
is right, they die.

363
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
And in between-- 

364
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
[GEL] It's so beautiful.

365
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,416
You know, I don't
think I've ever

366
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,333
seen anything
quite so lovely.

367
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
It cleanses
the mind, doesn't it?

368
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,541
Something about this light
moves me, to my very soul.

369
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,666
I agree, sir. I don't
need a vacation anymore.

370
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,000
[PLANET CHIEF'S MOTHER]
Oh glorious day! Hallelujah!

371
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,666
Those Dancingians
ain't half bad!

372
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,041
They got you beat;
that's for sure.

373
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,458
Very funny!

374
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,875
We all know who
the number-one dancer

375
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,625
in this universe is
and it's me!

376
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,291
[JRAVOLTA] Aw, yeah!

377
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,958
[DANDY] Screw you, man!
I'm number one!

378
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,041
Just wait 'til you see

379
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,291
what these gyratin' hips
can do, baby!

380
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,041
[QT] Given what's
happened in the past,

381
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,041
I have a feeling this situation
is gonna escalate quickly.

382
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,750
[MEOW] So when that
old lady said the Dancingians

383
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,250
would lead this land
to its true form,

384
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,250
you don't suppose--

385
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:41,375
[upbeat disco music]

386
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,041
[JRAVOLTA] Spacey dance!

387
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,000
[DANDY] Dandy dance!

388
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,791
We better hurry

389
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,333
and get off this planet
before it's too late!

390
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,250
[QT] We'll never
make it in time!

391
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,083
Dancin'. We're dancin'!

392
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,916
You're not the greatest
'cause I am the greatest!

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
No, we're both great! Okay! Wow!

394
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:16,333
Fever!

395
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
[NARRATOR] I'll try to explain:

396
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,583
It seems the new
Dancingian life form's

397
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,708
yearning to be born reacted
to the pyonium energy

398
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,375
within Dandy--causing the
two to become fused together,

399
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,458
and generating a release
of unimaginable power.

400
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,875
Or something like that.

401
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,500
Seems we're facing
annihilation once again.

402
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,625
Dust in the solar wind, sir.

403
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,791
[NARRATOR] And so, as one
heavenly body meets its demise,

404
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,958
another of equal
brilliance is born anew.

405
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,375
Although it will take
hundreds of millions of years,

406
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,916
eventually this
world will also come

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,625
to be known as Planet Grease.

408
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,833
However, the planet
itself will never know

409
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,541
that this is what it's
called and honestly,

410
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,291
there's no reason it should.

411
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,000
[JRAVOLTA] What just happened?

412
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,166
[DANDY] No clue.

413
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,666
[JRAVOLTA]
What should we do now?

414
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,166
[DANDY] Whaddya think?
We get our groove on!

415
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,833
[JRAVOLTA] Oh! You are
one spacey soul, Dandy!

416
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,875
[DANDY] Yeah, baby!

417
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:32,208
[upbeat disco music]

418
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,791
[DANDY] Next time,
on Space Dandy!

419
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,583
It's a first in the history of
the Dandy-est guy in space--

420
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,500
a heartwarming love-story,
with feelings and everything!

421
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,625
Next time,
"Lovers Are Trendy, Baby."

422
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,291
It's gonna be a hit
with the young folks,

423
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,625
so make sure you catch it!
