Code D, like you do, but plants,

163
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,916
we cannot stay close for long
enough, so I can do nothing.

164
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,291
Well, don't worry.

165
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,125
You're smart.

166
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
You'll figure something out.

167
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,541
[DR. H] It's possible human like
you could go to energy center.

168
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,375
You would not respond
to the essence as plants do:

169
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,083
would not grow big.

170
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,791
[033H]
I go, too! I go, too!

171
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,291
I want to go with you!

172
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,833
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

173
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,250
[DR. H]
A giant bug?

174
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,750
Yeah? Let's go!

175
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,041
I can take on this
caterpillar, no problem!

176
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,333
No way! A dead battery?

177
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,375
Uh-oh!

178
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,208
[VOICE]
Stop now!

179
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,833
Doctor, this is unacceptable.

180
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,541
[DR. H]
CoCamuka!

181
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
[COCAMUKA]
I have my eyes and ears.

182
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,125
This one, my spy, reported
your intentions to me.

183
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,541
Not cool.

184
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,416
[COCAMUKA] North pole
energy center is off-limits.

185
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,333
Going there is violation of law.

186
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,333
[DR. H] Well, CoCamuka,
you found us.

187
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,833
What intend you do with us?

188
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,250
[DR. H]
I am asking most strenuously.

189
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,916
Code D is dangerous.

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,875
Must be investigated
as soon as possible.

191
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,125
[COCAMUKA] Don't get
your stamen in a knot.

192
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,666
As you know, we can
no longer live without it.

193
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,541
[COCAMUKA] These fear-mongers
are under arrest.

194
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,041
Take them away.

195
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:54,041
Man, I don't think I've
ever been this full before.

196
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,416
They sure know how
to treat a guest.

197
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,666
This place is so great.

198
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,500
[DANDY]
Damn.

199
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,500
What's that jerk's problem?

200
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,041
[DR. H]
CoCamuka is not nicest guy.

201
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,083
He is leader of this country.

202
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,208
Long ago.

203
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,583
I was part of north pole
research group.

204
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,041
Was our job to
investigate Code D.

205
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,416
I made my report to CoCamuka.

206
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,333
Code D is dangerous, I said.

207
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,125
Vegims must do something.

208
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,666
But he did not listen.

209
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,500
Instead, he buried my report,

210
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,583
and removed me from
research group permanently.

211
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,458
I think is because
I threatened his authority.

212
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,208
Nini! Nini!

213
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,875
[DR. H]
You are here!

214
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,583
You came for rescue?

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,291
[033H]
Nini! Thank you! Thank you!

216
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,708
[DR. H]
This is Nini.

217
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,125
She is in plant
entertainment industry.

218
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,916
Is also very
good friend of ours.

219
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,625
[DANDY]
This is it, huh?

220
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,458
Man, you weren't kidding
around about that stench.

221
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,250
[DR. H] We cannot go
further with you, human.

222
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,833
You must continue on your own.

223
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,625
I can go! I can go! I can!

224
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,708
[DANDY]
So, how do I go about catching

225
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,458
this Code D thing, anyway?

226
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,958
[DR. H] Locate cables used
for extracting essence,

227
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,416
and remove them.

228
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,875
[DANDY]
Gotcha!

229
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,208
[DANDY]
Ugh!

230
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
That really smells!

231
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,000
[033H]
Can do it.

232
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,583
[DANDY]
Damn.

233
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,916
[033H]
I can go no farther.

234
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,000
From here on, you are alone.

235
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,666
[DANDY]
Oh, well. Here goes.

236
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,208
[DANDY]
That's it? Big, bad Code D?

237
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,708
It doesn't look like
much more than a stone.

238
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,250
[033H whining]

239
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,208
[DR. H] At one time, we
were ordinary plants.

240
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,708
Not thinking, talking beings.

241
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,416
And then, one day it came here.

242
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,791
Code D.

243
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,583
A meteorite that
landed on Planet Planta

244
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,333
and changed everything.

245
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,416
We plants evolved.

246
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,916
We became intelligent.

247
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,041
However, I think, maybe,

248
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,541
our sudden evolution
was not such a blessing.

249
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,541
But that era is over now.

250
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,541
We return to our original forms.

251
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,625
To what we were meant to be.

252
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,291
I feel myself fading.

253
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,958
Is all right. Is not
an ending, I think.

254
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,958
Is a new beginning.

255
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,500
[033H]
Human! Human!

256
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,375
[033H]
Bye bye.

257
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,416
What happened?

258
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,875
[MEOW] So, this whole time
Code D was a meteorite?

259
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,083
Just some glorified hunk
of space dust?

260
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,458
[QT] They don't give out reward
money for finding rocks.

261
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,208
And there was nothing else
down there worth reporting?

262
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,458
Well that didn't work out.

263
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,083
Nope, no it didn't, fatty.

264
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,208
I gotta say, I'm fine if
I never see another plant.

265
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,083
Huh?

266
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,875
What the hell?

267
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,041
[MEOW]
In a town like this,

268
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,833
all covered in dust
and full of nothin',

269
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:26,333
even dreams can
be hard to come by.

270
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:29,708
Next time: "There's
Always Tomorrow, Baby."
