I've become something of
an expert at sizing them up.

So I can tell you:
you three are,

Yeah, talk about

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is that this month's issue?

148
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,333
Dandy, you know it's dangerous

149
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,375
to travel with strangers,

150
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,250
so why won't you
kick them meow-t?

what brought

155

see, Dandy is the

the whole universe.

157
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,333
At first, QT and I
were nothing more

158
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,708
than cargo he
picked up for delivery.

159
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,041
But I was sent back

160
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,666
and the address on QT's
shipping label was wrong.

161
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,708
[QT] That's when Dandy,

162
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,875
out of the kindness
of his heart,

163
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,958
took us in and made
us part of his team.

164
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,125
That's what makes him

165
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,000
the best trucker in
the whole universe!

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,000
That's such
a beautiful story.

167
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,375
Our Dandy sucks.

168
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,125
He could stand to learn
a thing or two from theirs!

169
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,416
[DANDY] What in the--?

170
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,791
Hey, check out this centerfold!

171
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,791
Her underarm
hair is in 3-D!

172
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,375
[QT] Are you
okay, Meow?

173
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,416
What happened?

174
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,250
[MEOW] QT! I was just
reading my comic book

175
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,958
when these weirdos
popped out of it!

176
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,958
[QT] Then it's possible

177
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,500
that they're comic
book characters!

178
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,500
[DANDY] Here's Dandy! Oh ah.

179
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,125
Huh?

180
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,666
[DANDY] Am I nuts or did he
just say his name's Dandy?

181
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,583
[DANDY] Hey, old man!

182
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,291
You got a star-shaped birthmark?

183
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,458
[DANDY] Huh?

184
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,666
I've gotta gather
all eight of the heroes

185
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,750
with star-shaped
birthmarks in order

186
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,916
to defeat the evil demon king!

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,083
Okay.

188
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,125
[QT] Listen Dandy.

189
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,041
I don't trust these
guys one bit.

190
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,250
They seem
kinda sketchy.

191
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
What if they're the
demon king's henchmen?

192
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

193
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,500
[DANDY] Now that
you mention it.

194
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,583
I think you're right, QT!

195
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,208
That guy definitely
looks like Demon King

196
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,875
Black Cat's second
cousin twice removed!

197
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
Huh?

198
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,041
[MEOW] Oh no!

199
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,083
Don't tell me you
scoundrels have come here

200
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,208
to steal our
Miracle Heartful Balls!

201
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,416
Your what?

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,666
[QT] I assure you,

203
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
we have no intention
of touching your balls.

204
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,791
[DANDY] Why, you!

205
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,708
You don't think you
can fool me, do you?

206
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,500
I know you're related to
the Demon King somehow!

207
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,208
No. Wait! I'm not!

208
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,208
[DANDY C] That's it!
You're goin' down!

209
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,541
[MEOW] This kid's
tryin' to kill me!

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,791
Whoa! QT!

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,458
[NARRATOR] The "stray hair"
Dandy pulled is called

212
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,000
a cosmic string,
more commonly referred to

213
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,041
as a dimensional fray.

214
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,000
This string-like
domain is a remnant

215
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,875
of a phase defect at
a certain point in space.

216
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,375
Whenever someone
pulls on a cosmic string,

217
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,125
a doorway leading to a
parallel universe is opened.

218
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,416
There are an infinite
number of universes,

219
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,833
and within them,

220
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,666
every conceivable possibility
has become a reality.

221
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,958
Allow me to give you
some examples.

222
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,875
In one universe,

223
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,708
Dandy and his crew
are mobile suit pilots.

224
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,375
However, in another universe.

225
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,166
Space Ninja Dandy--
--is at your service.

226
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,708
[MEOW] Space Ninja Art:
Earth Style Jutsu!

227
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,791
Meow-bow-wow!

228
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,625
[HONEY] Space Kunoichi.
Mistress Honey!

229
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,083
[QT laughs]

230
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,666
[QT] Ninja Art!
Substitution Jutsu! QT!

231
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,416
[NARRATOR] They're
a space ninja team.

232
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,583
And in another,
he's Space Inspector Dandy.

233
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,500
In yet another,
he's Big Dandy.

234
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,583
She-Dandy.

235
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,875
Mascot Dandy.

236
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,208
Bearbrick Dandy.

237
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,041
Triangle Dandy.

238
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,500
While some may be
quick to label

239
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,208
them "counterfeits"
or "doubles,"

240
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,708
that's not the case.

241
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,041
They are each the
genuine Dandy and crew

242
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,166
of their particular universe.

243
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,333
We're finally
back home, baby.

244
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,875
[MEOW] Is it just me,
or does somethin' feel

245
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,333
kinda off about the place?

246
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,125
[SMALL QT] Intruders detected!
Intruders detected!

247
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,708
[LARGE QT] Exterminating.

248
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,041
[MEOW] Dang it! This is
the wrong universe, too?

249
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,708
[DANDY] Cut it out, QT.

250
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,083
These men are not our enemies.

251
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,791
[BOTH QTs] Understood, Dandy.

252
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,500
[QT] Dandy?

253
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,791
He's just a kid!

254
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,083
[DANDY] Sorry about that.

255
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,416
I'll call him off.

256
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,375
He's got a defense system
installed to protect me.

257
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,250
Stand down, QT.

258
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,666
[BOTH QTs] Defense
system deactivating.

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,791
Let me guess,

260
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,083
you guys're Dandy,
Meow, and QT, right?

261
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,750
Geez. You must've
pulled a cosmic string.

262
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,291
[MEOW] 'Scuse me.
Who am I in this universe?

263
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,250
Meow, right?
You're in the box.

264
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,833
You see, our Meow
is an alien

265
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,125
called a Schrödingerian.

266
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:32,833
[MEOW] Oh.

267
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,208
Until you open the box,

268
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,375
you never know if
he'll be alive or dead.

269
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,333
They're tricky that way.

270
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,291
[DANDY] He's dead.

271
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,958
Now he's alive.

272
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,041
Dead.

273
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,041
Alive.

274
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,791
Creepy little fur ball!

275
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,083
Watch it.

276
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,333
If you don't quit teasin'
the Schrödingerian

277
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,041
like that he's
liable to bite you.

278
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:53,833
It's them again!

279
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,791
[QT] What's happening?

280
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,541
Every week
our ship is attacked

281
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,625
by the mysterious Gorillian.

282
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,750
[BOTH QTs] We are surrounded.

283
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,583
Now what? I know!

284
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,666
You guys can take us
back to your universe!

285
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,208
[QT] We've gotta hurry and
find a cosmic string to pull!

286
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,250
Bea-B-Bea!

287
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,291
Gel-Gel-Gel!

288
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,708
Oh. B-B-B-Bea!

289
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,666
Gel! Gel! Gel!

290
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,000
Bea. B-Bea

291
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,416
Gel!

292
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,666
Let's go!

293
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,291
[QT] Oh thank goodness,
we made it back safely.

294
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,375
Huh?

295
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,250
Huh?

296
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,750
Uh?

297
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,333
[HONEY] What's going on?
I don't get it.

298
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,041
[DANDY]
Hey! What do we got here?

299
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,708
Looks like we
overdid it a little.

300
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,958
[NARRATOR]
Several days have passed

301
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,041
since the Aloha Oe
was taken over

302
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,041
by the various Dandys,
Meows, and QTs.

303
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
Let's see how things are going.

304
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,916
Hey! Go back, baby!

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,416
I wasn't done readin' that page!

306
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,750
Dammit, lady me!

307
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,916
No scavenging the fridge
without my permission!

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,166
[QT] What do you guys
think you're doing?

309
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,500
Don't use my charger
without asking first!

310
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,500
[QT] Transform!

311
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,791
[QT] Are you even
listening to me?

312
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,875
[NARRATOR] As you can see,

313
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,583
our heroes are
living in utter chaos.

314
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,208
I'm so stressed out.

315
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,333
There's only one thing to do.

316
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,333
A trip to Boobies'll
take the edge off, baby!

317
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,291
Yoo-hoo! Dandy!

318
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,791
Welcome back! Oh my!

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,583
[HONEY] Wow, that's crazy!

320
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,500
Who knew you
had all these siblings?

321
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,791
