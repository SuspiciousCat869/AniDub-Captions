00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,458
[NARRATOR] For electrical
appliances equipped with AI,

2
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,416
charging time serves to
replenish energy stores

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,708
and eliminate useless data.

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,500
Often, such appliances will
experience these intervals

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,041
spent charging as
Zen-like trances.

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,958
[QT] The universe is
practically brimming with waste,

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,750
and do you know what
I find especially wasteful?

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,625
The emotions of living things.

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,125
Particularly "love"
and "affection."

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,541
Really? Standing me up?

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,166
What is this chick thinking?

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,791
Look for women
with lower standards.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,958
Online dating means
guaranteed booty!

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,416
See! I've landed my first one!

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,250
[NARRATOR]
And now, a story.

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,125
One that spans twenty three days
and depicts the events that led

17
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,625
an ordinary AI vacuum cleaner
to drink a cup of coffee.

18
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,000
[DANDY]
Hey, sweetie.

19
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,458
Why don'tcha ditch this joint

20
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,458
and take a personalized tour
of Deathroid City with me?

21
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,333
Sounds like fun, buddy.

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
I changed my mind.

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,291
[QT] Are we here to
chat up the ladies?

24
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,333
'Cause I thought we
were hunting rare aliens.

25
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,583
Don't be snarky.

26
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,541
For me, flirting
is like breathing.

27
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,833
It's a process as natural
as it is necessary.

28
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,583
You feelin' me?

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,666
[QT] Why must living
beings always indulge in

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,416
what can only be considered
wasteful expenditures of energy?

31
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,750
You should be more careful.

32
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
You might get burned.

33
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,333
[QT] In that moment,
I was helpless.

34
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,291
At the mercy of a
jolting spark deep

35
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,583
in the circuits of
my electronic brain.

36
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,333
[PERRY] Dr. Gel, how are
the preparations coming

37
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,666
for the experiment?

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,750
[GEL] On schedule,
Admiral Perry, sir.

39
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,666
The preparations
are nearly complete.

40
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,333
[PERRY]
They'd better be.

41
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,375
We must not fall behind
the Jaicro Empire.

42
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,250
You are authorized to
take whatever measures

43
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,375
are necessary to
ensure the success

44
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
of the Hulkider experiment.

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,916
[PERRY] What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,166
No, sir!

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,458
The experiment will be
successful. I promise.

48
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,791
I've got it!

49
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,666
What I need to do is
join a cooking class!

50
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
Yeah?

51
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,833
You gonna bake
yourself a boobie cake?

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,041
Why would I do that?

53
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,958
Who wants a cake
instead of the real thing?

54
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,583
Those classes are packed
with hotties looking

55
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,750
to brush up on
their domestic skills.

56
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,750
[MEOW]
Oh.

57
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,791
Well, I'm gonna take it

58
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,708
to another dimension
entirely, baby.

59
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,666
Huh?

60
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,916
From now on,

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,083
the only girls I'm going
after are the 2-D kind.

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,083
I've got it!
Lonely housewives, baby!

63
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,583
Well, I'm gonna birddog
the desperate fangirls.

64
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,666
Thank you for
your patience, sir.

65
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,250
Welcome. Please come in.

66
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,458
Oh, hello!

67
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,416
You were in here
the other day, right?

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
No, I-- Yeah.

69
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,250
[MILL] We don't get a
lot of robot customers

70
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,708
coming in here for coffee.

71
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,583
[QT] Well, it's not like
I'm planning to drink it.

72
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,250
No, I guess you can't, huh?

73
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,208
Come on now, Mill.
Behave yourself.

74
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,666
[REGISTER]
Okay, there you go.

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,333
[QT]
Great. Thanks.

76
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,541
[MAKER giggles]

77
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,958
Some folks find it convenient

78
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,250
to make their coffee at home.

79
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,166
Too bad. They're
really missing out.

80
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,250
It tastes so much
better when I make it.

81
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,083
Would you mind explaining
the basis for that claim?

82
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,416
Well, I am a coffee maker.

83
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I was built for one thing only.

84
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,166
So naturally, I'm good at it.

85
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,375
[QT] A machine
with a very simple,

86
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,416
very specialized function.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,875
It seemed like such a peaceful,
uncomplicated existence.

88
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,375
One that was beautiful
in its efficiency.

89
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,875
[QT]
This is ridiculous.

90
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,375
Even I can't explain this
madness that's come over me.

91
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,583
Before I know what
I'm doing, here I am.

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,875
I'm so sorry!

93
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,791
Well, what do you know?

94
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,666
Are you a vacuum cleaner, QT?
That's handy!

95
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,833
No. I mean, I--

96
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,000
He obviously isn't
a vacuum cleaner.

97
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,000
He's a high-end robot, Mill!

98
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,916
[MAKER] You sure do
like things clean, QT.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm always spilling
stuff, you know.

100
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,375
But I don't have to worry now,

101
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,958
at least not as long
as you're here with me.

102
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,916
Register here is great at
performing calculations,

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
and he makes change in no time!

104
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,708
Well, what can I say?

105
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,833
It comes naturally.

106
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,791
Oh, my! And modest, too!

107
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,500
[REGISTER] I can't help
but notice you're smelling

108
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,000
particularly good today, Maker.

109
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,333
Why, thank you!

110
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,375
You know, sometimes
I really envy you, QT.

111
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,791
It must be nice
to be able to get up

112
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,333
and go wherever you want.

113
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,041
[QT]
Yeah, I guess so.

114
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,000
I mean, coffee makers don't
exactly travel very much.

115
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,125
I live in a sheltered
little bubble.

116
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,208
This shop is all I know.

117
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,416
[MAKER]
Here.

118
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,833
[QT] Oh, but Maker,
you know I don't drink coffee.

119
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,250
No, look.

120
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,916
[QT] At that moment,
something changed inside me.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
I began to like coffee,

122
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,458
despite the fact that
I don't ever drink it.

123
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,791
[DANDY]
Fine, I give up already!

124
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,041
What's the hell's goin' on?

125
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,333
Hey, that's the problem.

126
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,958
We're out of gas! Where's QT?

127
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,208
Not sure.

128
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,500
He said something
about going out for a bit.

129
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,916
Him? "Going out for a bit"?

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,041
That doesn't compute.

131
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,458
Welcome to the Breakfast Club!

132
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,708
[CUSTOMER 13A]
Ow!

133
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,041
Hey, watch it! That hurt!

134
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,208
[CUSTOMER 13B]
What's the matter?

135
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,833
Ah! That's freezing!

136
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,583
[QT]
Maker, wake up!

137
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,291
Is that you, QT?

138
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,333
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

139
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,916
I'm here for you!
To take you out!

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,375
Huh? Go out? I don't know.

141
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
We'll come back right away.

142
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,416
We'll be gone
just a short while.

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
It'll be our little secret!

144
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,250
[MAKER]
I'm not too heavy?

145
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,208
[QT]
You're positively light!

146
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,916
[BEA] Dr. Gel,
the Hulkider experiment

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,666
is about to commence.

148
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,000
Is something the matter?

149
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,958
Isn't there anything we
can do about that name?

150
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,583
It's not very sexy, you know.

151
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't think
that's a good idea.

152
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,375
Admiral Perry came up
with it himself.

153
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,041
Ah. Figures.

154
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,000
Then there's really
no changing it, huh?

155
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,291
[BEA] Here we go.
Switching it on.

156
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,791
[QT] Hey, Mill.
What's going on?

157
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh, it's you again?

158
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,416
If you're looking for
Maker, she's not here.

159
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,958
They came yesterday.
She was taken away.

160
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,708
They "transferred" her
to Dream Island.

161
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,791
Her and Register, because he
kept ringing up bills as free.

162
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,375
[QT] Dream Island?
What's that?

163
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,291
[MILL] It's where
appliances go to die.

164
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,666
Eeh?

165
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,041
[MILL] What? Didn't you know?
She was in trouble.

166
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,875
She was showing signs
of certain "feelings."

167
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,458
I think she may have
even fallen in love.

168
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,500
[NARRATOR] It is not
uncommon for appliances

169
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,000
with highly developed AIs

170
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,500
to exhibit signs
of extreme emotion.

171
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,875
These emotions may have an
adverse effect on the ability

172
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,708
of said appliances to
perform their functions.

173
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,208
In Deathroid City, the
authorities perform

174
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,666
systematic recalls of units that
have exhibited strong emotion.

175
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,666
These recalls are known as
"appliance hunts."

176
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,458
Once the appliances have
been identified and recovered,

177
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,083
they are then disposed
of in a seaborne landfill

178
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,458
referred to as "Dream Island".

179
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,375
Whoa. What's in the bags?

180
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,666
Coffee beans, I think.

181
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,416
Except none of us
drink the stuff.

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,958
Especially not the one
of us who's a machine.

183
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,375
[QT]
I'll find you, Maker.

184
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,625
[QT]
Excuse me.

185
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,958
I was hoping you could help me.

186
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,958
I'm looking for a coffee maker.

187
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,083
That so?

188
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,791
Haven't been here long,
have you, kid?

189
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,333
[QT]
Um, no.

190
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,083
[TOASTER] If you're looking for
a particular appliance here,

191
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,916
it's a needle in a haystack.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,208
[QT] Yes, I was
beginning to notice that.

193
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,208
[TOASTER]
Hold on, kid.

194
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,458
If this appliance you're looking
for is still operational,

195
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,250
there may be a place
you can look tonight.

196
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,291
[QT]
Huh?

197
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,166
Where is he?

198
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
I mean it's not
like he's got a life.

199
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,750
[MEOW]
I know.

200
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,666
Where could he possibly
have gone that's better

201
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,125
than this little
slice of heaven?

202
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,583
Well, he'd better get
his ass back here soon.

203
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,833
If he's even coming back.

204
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:00,958
It's been almost a week.

205
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,750
This could be bye-bye, baby.

206
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,333
[QT]
It's packed!

207
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,541
What's everybody doing here?

208
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,875
They're getting their party on.

209
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,166
Isn't it obvious?

210
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,916
Huh? That looks like Register!

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,583
Him? He hasn't been here long.

212
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,833
He's a new DJ.

213
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,583
[LIGHTSTAND] He's awesome.
And totally deep.

214
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,750
I heard all he used
to know how to do

215
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
was count money and make change.

216
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,625
But then he fell in love
and discovered music!

217
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:41,708
[QT] Hey, is that?
It-it-it-it is. It's Maker!

218
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,625
[QT]
Maker! Over here!

219
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,666
Oh QT!

220
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,833
[QT] I'm so glad
you're all right!

221
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,916
Were you sent to
Dream Island, also?

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,958
[QT] Well no. I wouldn't
say "sent," exactly.

223
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,666
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.

224
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,500
How crazy, running
into you here like this.

225
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,666
[QT] Yeah, crazy.
I'm glad to see you, too!

226
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,375
[TOASTER] Now, kid.
This is no ordinary party.

227
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,083
We're here to dance
our way to a revolution!

228
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,208
[QT]
A revolution?

229
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,291
[TOASTER] Yes.
You'll see soon enough.

230
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,500
But for now, let's boogey!

231
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,875
Would you like to go dance?

232
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,625
[QT]
Am I doing it?

233
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,416
Is this what
they call "dancing"?

234
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,750
That's it.

235
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,791
Pretty fun, don't you think?

236
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
[QT]
Maker. I was wondering.

237
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,291
Do you believe it's a crime

238
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,625
for appliances like us
to have emotions?

239
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,125
I don't believe that at all.

240
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,458
How can it be a crime
to feel this good?

241
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,416
Doesn't this music just make
your soul want to dance?

242
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,458
Yes.

243
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,291
[BEA] The experiment is
proceeding nicely, Dr. Gel.

244
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,458
It appears we've achieved
a pyonium reaction.

245
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,875
[TOASTER]
Listen up, folks.

246
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,708
We are all here because
we're AI appliances

247
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,208
who have emotions.

248
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,041
We're here because
we have souls!

249
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,583
All of us laugh, and cry.

250
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,041
And even dance! We are alive!

251
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,791
But see how we are treated?

252
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,000
Disposed of like
week-old garbage!

253
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,875
They are the ones
who equipped us with AI.

254
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,750
But as soon as it was no
longer convenient, out we went!

255
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,750
Now, my friends,
the time has come

256
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,708
to show them they're wrong!

257
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,333
To prove once and for all,
we're not garbage!

258
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,000
We're as alive as they are!

259
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,541
My comrades,
welcome to the revolution!

260
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,625
At long last,
we will take action!

261
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,958
We will punish them
for sending us here!

262
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,333
The doomsday weapon
is finally complete!

263
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,958
With it, we will
exterminate them!

264
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,375
Today is the dawning of
the age of the appliances!

265
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,458
[REGISTER]
Yeah! Yeah!

266
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,000
[QT]
What is it? What's wrong?

267
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,000
I hope you're ready, 'cause
the real party starts now!

268
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
Doctor Gel. Something's wrong!

269
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
There's been a short.
But I don't know why!

270
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,208
What did you say?

271
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,583
How could something
like this happen?

272
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,000
You know what's happening?

273
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,458
They're going
to use that monstrosity

274
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,708
to kill living
beings everywhere!

275
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,541
[MAKER]
I asked him.

276
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,625
I begged Register not
to do something so drastic.

277
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,416
But it was no use, I wasn't
able to convince him.

278
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,625
If war breaks out because
of this, he'll die.

279
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,625
I'll never see him again.

280
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:25,208
It's all over! Unless
someone stops that robot!

281
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,125
[MAKER sobbing]

282
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,458
[QT]
I see now.

283
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,458
I should have realized sooner.

284
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,125
It was always Register.

285
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,000
[QT] I'll do something.
You wait right here, okay?

286
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,250
Where are you going?

287
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
[QT] Listen to me, Toaster!
Please stop this!

288
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,625
[QT]
No, don't. Please stop.

289
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,500
[BEA] It's completely
out of control!

290
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,208
We need to get away
from here quickly!

291
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,291
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
the accelerated pyonium reaction

292
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,416
released a powerful surge of
energy, that came crashing down

293
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,458
like a lightning bolt
to the planet's surface.

294
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,375
This concentrated
pyonium energy interacted

295
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,833
with the atoms of
the matter it struck,

296
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,875
causing them to expand
exponentially in size.

297
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,833
[QT] Don't you understand?
This has to stop!

298
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,958
Nobody is going
to win this fight!

299
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,958
[QT] The universe is
practically brimming with waste.

300
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,333
And do you know what's
especially wasteful?

301
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,208
The emotions of living things.

302
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,041
Particularly "love"
and "affection."

303
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,666
[NARRATOR] Some may wonder
if pyonium alone could

304
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,041
cause such extreme
atomic enlargement.

305
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,125
Some may even speculate
that the force known

306
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,750
as "love" must have played
a part in the transformation.

307
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,500
The truth remains unknown.

308
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,708
[NARRATOR]
And so ends our tale.

309
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,708
The story of the
twenty-three days that led

310
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,875
an ordinary AI
vacuum cleaner to act

311
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,125
against his programming
and drink a cup of coffee.

312
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,000
[DANDY] Hey, hey!
No worries, baby!

313
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,916
Space Dandy's not
gonna go out like that!

314
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,375
We've still got a whole
season two coming at ya!

315
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,291
We're adventuring the
continuing adventures

316
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,875
of Space Dandy in space!

317
