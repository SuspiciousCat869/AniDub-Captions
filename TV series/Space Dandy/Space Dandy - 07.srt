The key to staying in the race

Dandy...

318
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,208
But now's not really
one of those times.

319
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,666
Well, that's good.

320
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,375
[QT and DANDY yell]

321
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,208
[QT and DANDY groan]

322
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,000
[DANDY] Uhh... I didn't
mean to do that.

323
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,583
[ANNOUNCER]
Oh, my. What is that?

324
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,000
Niaga meth ton?

325
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,000
[QT]
Whoa-whoa-whoa...!

326
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
What'd he do?

327
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,250
[ZED]
That entire crew is insane.

328
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,000
[ANNOUNCER]
Here we are at last,

329
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,916
in front of the ninth
and final gate!

330
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,416
And it's Prince through first.

331
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,166
Followed by Dandy.

332
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,166
And it looks like--yes, yes,
it's the Boobie-mobile!

333
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,541
And then--what?
Who's that?

334
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,875
It looks like a gorilla.

335
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,916
There was a gorilla in the race?

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,083
He's catching up.

337
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes, the gorilla has
passed the Boobies!

338
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,791
Get us moving faster!
We need to reach Dandy!

339
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,666
Yes, sir. Activating
hyper-dimensional turbo.

340
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,166
All right! Good job, Bea!
We passed Dandy!

341
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,208
Um, Doctor, was passing him
actually what we wanted to do?

342
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh...

343
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,791
[GEL screams]

344
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,041
[QT]
It may be time for us

345
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,000
to accept that we're
going to lose to Prince.

346
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,083
Ditch all the baggage!

347
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,541
[QT]
What?

348
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,083
[DANDY] We need to be
as light as possible!

349
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,833
[QT]
That wasn't nice!

350
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,375
Impossible!

351
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,416
Got you now!

352
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,625
You did it.

353
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,916
You're the first
opponent I've faced

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,458
who's ever pushed me
all the way to the edge.

355
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,000
[ZED]
That wasn't nice!

356
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,166
[ANNOUNCER] The first two
racers are approaching

357
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,041
the finish line now,
and it is a dead heat!

358
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,375
Who will be the
Grand Prix winner?

359
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,583
Amazing. I have never
seen such speed!

360
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,208
[PRINCE]
I--I feel funny inside.

361
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Unbelievable!

362
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,125
They have exceeded
the sixth space velocity!

363
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,750
[PRINCE]
What is this feeling?

364
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,208
It can't be...

365
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,833
But maybe, maybe it is...

366
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,875
Maybe this is...

367
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,458
Love.

368
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,000
[beeping]

369
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,125
[NARRATOR] In that moment,
something truly extraordinary

370
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,333
happened to Prince.

371
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,666
Dandy plowed into him

372
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,250
from behind at the
seventh space velocity.

373
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,125
The bomb that had been planted,
the fluctuating electric charge,

374
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,958
the magnetic flux density,
the metric slug...

375
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,125
The addition of unknown fuel...

376
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
All of these factors
were brought together

377
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,333
in a miraculous,
unprecedented cosmic accident

378
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:38,416
and then... the steamed
dumpling burst open!

379
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,666
[PRINCE grunts]

380
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,083
[DANDY grunts]

381
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,208
Where's Dandy?

382
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,125
He's not here!

383
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,750
[NARRATOR]
Yes, Dandy is here.

384
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,458
He is in a space
faster than thought.

385
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,833
A domain that mere
mortals cannot even

386
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,416
begin to understand.

387
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,666
[NARRATOR] He accelerated
to a speed faster than light

388
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,041
and fell out of time.

389
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,125
Until, finally, he arrived
in the far distant future.

390
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,958
And when he woke on a world
that exists at a time

391
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,416
five point six
seven billion years

392
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,708
from this moment,
what he saw was...

393
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,875
Dan... dy...

394
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,250
[DANDY] The following episode
will be brought to you

395
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:11,208
by a cat who won't bathe,
a planet full of scrap metal,

396
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,375
a possessed robot,
fleas, and a dog.

397
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,291
Next time, an
unexpectedly sad story,


398
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,791
"The Lonely Pooch Planet, Baby."
See ya then.
