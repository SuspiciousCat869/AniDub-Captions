[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,666
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,125
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,791
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,916
These are the
spectacular adventures

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,875
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

7
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,833
[MEOW] Checking in at the
Alien Registration Center.

8
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,750
[FEMALE ROBOT VOICE]
Now calling 538.

9
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,916
Here we go!

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,875
[SCARLET]
Okay. Who's next?

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,875
Mister Dandy, is it?

12
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,000
All right, let's check you out.

13
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,875
[buzzer sounds]

14
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,750
[SCARLET] That's an
Androman Giroro.

15
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,250
One of about a hundred
million registered at present.

16
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,791
Huh?

17
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,291
Meaning there is nothing
rare about this species.

18
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,416
As aliens go, these
are very common, sir.

19
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,083
Whoa, hold the phone!

20
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,208
You didn't even look
closely at it, lady!

21
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,541
Okay, next up, please.

22
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,791
[DANDY]
I've got one more!

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,125
Now how does this one look?

24
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,875
[buzzer sounds]

25
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,500
This is a Betelgeusian.

26
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,583
One of about 58.6 billion
registered at present.

27
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,083
See. I told ya so.

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,833
I'm an honest-to-goodness,
bonafide Betelgeusian--

29
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,125
Damn cat!

30
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,250
You're nothin' but
a useless, pathetic,

31
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,208
freeloading feline
with a bad attitude!

32
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,750
[DANDY and MEOW yell]

33
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,708
[PERRY] So...

34
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,708
Have you located the man
we're searching for, Dr. Gel?

35
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,416
[GEL]
Soon, Admiral Perry.

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,000
We are using the latest
in search technology.

37
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,000
Thanks to Gogol
galaxy street view,

38
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,458
our investigation
is well underway.

39
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,000
I fully expect I will be

40
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,166
reporting to you of
our success shortly.

41
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,541
[PERRY] Hmm.

42
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,750
For the honor of
the Gogol Empire,

43
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,583
I hope your
assessment is correct.

44
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,208
Sir. The mission
is in good hands.

45
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,625
[DANDY] Dammit.

46
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,375
What's a guy gotta do to find
a big money alien these days?

47
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,291
This bites.

48
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,500
[QT] Be reasonable.

49
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,541
There are only about
thirty thousand cases

50
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,791
of new aliens
recorded each year.

51
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,666
Among those, no more
than ten percent

52
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,166
of the registrations
are rare enough

53
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,750
to land the responsible
hunter a hefty reward.

54
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,875
It's not an easy process.

55
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,291
[DANDY] Man, I'm hungry.
Don't we have any food?

56
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,625
Wait, we do.

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,250
I almost forgot about
my super special stash.

58
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, I knew I was
saving it for a reason.

59
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,333
Gone! Gone!

60
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,708
Gone!

61
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,500
The Guruchan Ramen
I've carefully hoarded is gone!

62
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,458
Gone, baby, gone!

63
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,666
[slurping]

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,333
[MEOW] Ahhh...

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,125
[DANDY] You!

66
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,000
What? Oh, yeah, this stuff?

67
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,625
It was just taking up space
in the kitchen, so, you know.

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,916
It wasn't all that bad.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,916
Of course
it wasn't good, either.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,041
I would rate it a solid "okay."

71
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,583
It had that fake
"instant" taste to it.

72
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,541
Know what I mean?

73
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,250
[DANDY]
Tell me, Meow.

74
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
Do you know where
you stand around here?

75
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,666
Where I stand?

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,875
Let me think.

77
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,416
Well, obviously, I'm
a very important member

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,625
of the Aloha Oe's crew, an--

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,958
No, you're a mangy,
mooching, flea-ridden stray!

80
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,708
[MEOW screams]

81
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,125
[DANDY]
That's right.

82
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,208
I took you in because
I thought you might be useful.

83
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,666
But sitting around all day,

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,291
eating and smooching your
girlie pillow is not useful.

85
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,583
Do you hear me,
you dimwitted feline?

86
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,041
Wait! Hold on!

87
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,333
Yeah, I almost forgot!

88
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,541
I have something!

89
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,208
Knowledge I've been
saving for a rainy day!

90
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,791
There's a rumor
I heard about ramen

91
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:53,041
that's supposedly made by
some kind of phantom alien!

92
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,666
Phantom ramen?

93
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,000
[MEOW] Its flavor is like
something not of this dimension.

94
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,291
One that nobody
else can imitate.

95
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,916
Because it's so unusual

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,250
they say it must be made
by an as-yet-unknown species.

97
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
And where is this ramen shop?

98
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, see, the thing is,

99
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,041
information on it is
sketchy at best,

100
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,250
so we won't really
know until we taste it.

101
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,041
But, given that I'm
a ramen connoisseur,

102
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm sure I'll be able to tell
the second I put it in my mou--

103
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,833
Now listen closely, kitty.

104
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,500
If this info is bogus, you're
in for a whole universe of hurt.

105
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,666
Got it!

106
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,750
Yoo-hoo!

107
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,916
Crispy fried dragon!

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,666
[MEOW] Yay!

109
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,916
Checking in at Boobies.

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,708
Man, boobs really
are one of the wonders

111
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,166
of the universe, aren't they?

112
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,416
[QT] But you were just going on

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,875
about how butts were
the superior feature.

114
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,541
Oh, really?
I don't remember that.

115
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,083
[QT] No, of course
you don't.

116
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,250
So why'd we come here if we're
searching for phantom ramen?

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,583
Don't be an idiot!

118
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,708
The first step in any search
is conducting interviews.

119
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,875
Excuse me, Honey?

120
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,291
How can I help you?

121
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,708
[DANDY] Ever heard of something
called phantom ramen?

122
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, yeah!

123
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,791
[ALL THREE] What?
Hold on, are you serious?

124
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,041
[HONEY]
Totally!

125
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,125
[QT] Does this seem a
little too easy to you?

126
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,916
[grunting noises]

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,333
Huh?

128
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,041
Yeah, he's right. If it's
ramen you're after, buddy,

129
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,791
you gotta go check out Ra-sta.

130
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,333
What's Ra-sta?

131
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,250
He is referring to the Space
Ramen Station, young gashopper.

132
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,666
It is a place where ramen shops
from all different regions

133
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,875
of space gather
to sell their dishes.

134
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,416
Right. Hey, that
gives me an idea.

135
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,125
Let's go there!

136
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,583
So this is it, huh?

137
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,583
[COOKS]
Welcome!

138
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,125
Checking in at
the Noodle Galaxy.

139

[CLERK]
Hey, boys. What'll it be?

140
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,750
Ah...

141
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,166
How about four large orders of
extra noodles with hen fruit?

142
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,166
Huh?

143
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,708
And all on one tab.

144
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,000
[CLERK] Right! A pair
of egg-whopper-toppers

145
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,666
with quadruple everything!

146
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,125
[COOKS] Heard!

147
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,958
[QT} They appear to be
speaking a different language.

148
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,958
[CLERK] Here ya go.

149
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,750
Every ramen aficionado knows
the key to success is the broth.

150
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,625
No, I shouldn't get
started on that,

151
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,041
or I'll be going on
about it all night.

152
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,166
[QT] So, what's the verdict?

153
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,625
Is this the phantom ramen?

154
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,333
No, no, no. It's not even
in the neighborhood.

155
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,375
[DANDY] Hmm. Surprisingly
passable, though.

156
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,041
[MEOW] Yes, I concur.

[QT] Let's check the
next place, already!

[GEL] Hmmm...

160
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,458
This can't possibly be right.

search using galaxy street view

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,458
but despite all our efforts,
there is still no trace of him.

163
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,833
[BEA] Doctor Gel.
We have finally

164
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,458
ascertained Dandy's location.

165
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,083
[GEL] We have?

166
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,250
Good! Commence pursuit at once!

167
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,833
Gogol Empire Seventh Fleet.

168
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,416
Move out!

169
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,250
[COOKS]
Welcome!

170
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,041
[MEOW] Checking in
at the Ramen Nebula.

171
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,750
So this is the raw
food movement in action.

172
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,708
[MEOW] I think it's
pretty good, actually.

173
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,333
[QT ]I hate to be the
bearer of bad news, but...

174
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,625
...we're down to
zero woolongs on-hand.

175
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,041
I don't see how we're
going to pay for this.

176
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,166
That woulda been a good
thing to know before we ate!

177
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,000
[QT] I would hate for the
authorities to get involved

178
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,708
if we walked on the tab.

179
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,375
Hey, that chick over there...

180
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,916
[QT] Is she a friend of yours?

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,375
Let's find out.

182
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,583
[QT] Dandy?

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,875
[DANDY] Hey. Well,
hello there, beautiful.

184
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,458
What a delicious surprise.

185
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,541
This must be my lucky day.

186
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,625
So, lovely.

187
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,875
What is your name?

188
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,666
What?

189
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,250
Yes! I'm speechless, too!

190
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,416
Destiny's in the air!

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
I can practically hear
Beethoven's Sixth

192
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,500
playing just for us.

193
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,333
"Destiny" was
the fifth symphony.

194
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,041
You are a shy one, aren't you?

195
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,541
That's okay, baby.

196
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,541
Spit it out. What are
you trying to say?

197
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,458
Direct, I like that in a woman.

198
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,458
I do have something
very important to ask you.

199
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,583
Babe.

200
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,333
Can ya spot me some cash?

201
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,958
Huh?

202
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,666
[SQUAD MEMBER]
Don't move.

203
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,625
One step and we'll shoot!

204
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,666
No, my ramen!

205
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,791
[SCARLET] Didn't your
mothers ever teach you

206
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,416
not to waste your food?

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,833
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

208
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,625
My name is Scarlet, by the way.

209
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,541
And don't you forget it.

210
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,625
[SCARLET]
Sorry about the mess.

211
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,625
[CLERK]
Thanks, ma'am.

212
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,125
Whatever your name is,

213
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,416
that's a grade-A butt
you've got there, baby.

214
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,666
[BEA]
Doctor.

215
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,083
It seems the battle squad we
dispatched has been wiped out.

216
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,250
[GEL]
The whole squad?

217
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,291
One man took them all out?

218
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,625
Perhaps we've underestimated
what Dandy is capable of.

219
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,750
I'm sorry, sir.

220
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,000
We'll pinpoint his
new location ASAP.

221
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,541
[GEL] Good. The pursuit
must continue!

222
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,125
[MEOW]
Checking in at Andromenda.

223
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,083
[QT] Attacked out of
the blue like that...

224
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,750
I wonder who those thugs were.

225
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,791
[DANDY]
Hmm...

226
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,958
[QT] What is it?
Do you have an idea?

227
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,083
I think I either know something

228
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,291
or I have absolutely
no clue at all.

229
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,541
[QT]
What does that mean?

230
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,250
Jeez, I can't remember
every tiny detail, okay?

231
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,916
Don't move!

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,583
[QT] How did they figure
out where we were?

233
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,458
Who knows?
Lucky guess, maybe?

234
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,791
Too tough!

235
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,000
[MEOW] Checking in
at Fullmetal Noodlist.

236

[SQUAD MEMBER]
Don't move!

237
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,125
[QT] How did they figure
out where we were?

238
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,291
Who knows?
Lucky guess, maybe?

239
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,541
Checking in at "Men" in Black.

240
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,333
[SQUAD MEMBER]
Don't move!

241
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,041
[QT] How did they figure
out where we were?

242
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,000
Who knows?
Lucky guess, maybe?

243
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,291
[BEA]
I don't understand.

244
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,208
All these attempts
and we haven't got him.

245
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,375
[GEL]
Indeed.

246
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,041
Dandy is a fearsome opponent.

247
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,208
[BEA]
What should we do, Doctor?

248
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,750
[GEL]
We have no choice.

249
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,250
We must send the
whole fleet to attack.

250
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,416
Gogol Seventh, move out!

251
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,958
Warp!

252
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:40,958
Strange, isn't it?

253
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,708
These guys just keep showing up.

254
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,208
How do they know where we are?

255
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,000
Who knows?
Lucky guess, maybe?

256
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,708
[DANDY] What are you doing
with that thing, anyway?

257
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,791
You're always messing with it.

258
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,291
Keep your feet to yourself.

259
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,791
If you wanna know what I'm
doing, you'll have to follow me.

260
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,625
Huh? Let me see that.

261
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,166
Hey!

262
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,500
[QT] He's been broadcasting our
every location with this thing.

263
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,333
You stupid, useless ball of fur!

264
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,625
[BEA] We're warping out at
the target's location now.

265
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,125
[GEL] Excellent. All hands,
prepare for combat.

266
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,791
[GEL]
Huh?

267
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,541
Well, where is he?

268
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,125
[CLERK]
Here you go.

269
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:37,125
Your extra garlic, mile-high,
double greasy veggie towers.

270
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,416
Whoa.

271
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,125
That's sure greasy, all right.

272
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,916
Mm hmm. Grease is the main
reason for eating the thing.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,125
[DANDY] Guess we
should dig in, huh?

274
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,666
[MEOW]
Absolutely.

275
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,416
Yum!

276
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,500
What is with you?

277
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,916
The stale, chewy noodles.

278
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,458
The salty, buttery broth.

279
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,333
The limp vegetables.

280
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,291
Considered as
individual components,

281
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,875
they sound disgusting.

282
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,916
But combined, they create
a heady, addictive flavor.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,916
A flavor not native
to our dimension!

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,208
This is it! This is
the phantom ramen

285
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,458
we have been searching for!

286
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,083
This slop?
Are you kidding me?

287
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,041
[QT]
You can't be serious.

288
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,916
Do not doubt me, my friends.

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,041
Have you not noticed
that this store doesn't

290
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,208
make its own ramen on site?

291
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,333
Over there!

292
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,125
Do you see?

293
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,333
[DANDY]
New idea...

294
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,958
We need to find out
what's in that thing!

295
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,958
[CLERK E] Hey, you
maniac! Get down!

296
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,958
[QT]
Dandy!

297
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:41,958
[CLERK F]
You little punk!

298
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,500
[CLERK G]
I got him!

299
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,583
Take that!

300
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,250
Whoa!

301
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,166
[MEOW]
Whoa, hold on!

302
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,541
[DANDY]
Whoa.

303
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,458
What's wrong with it?

304
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,000
[NARRATOR] Wormholes:
similar to black holes

305
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,208
in that they absorb
time and space;

306
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
however, there is a difference.

307
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,833
Wormholes are
more like shortcuts.

308
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,250
Each one generally
has a fixed exit.

309
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,583
[DANDY] Aren't you bein'
a little blasé about this?

310
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,708
Damn.

311
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,541
Where the hell are we?

312
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
[QT] Dandy!
Do you read me?

313
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,708
Go ahead, QT!

314
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,583
[QT] You're likely in
an alternate dimension.

315
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,000
Huh?

316
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,250
What d'you know?

317
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,625
It really was a flavor
from another dimension.

318
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,416
[QT] When you forced your
way through the wormhole,

319
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,250
you deepened the rift in
the space-time continuum,

320
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,625
making travel between
points more dangerous.

321
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,416
Hey, Dandy.
See that?

322
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,916
Why, what is it?

323
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,250
[DANDY]
Two ramens, please.

324
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,958
[OLD MAN]
Coming up.

325
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,375
[DANDY] Hey, Pops,
looks to me like your shop

326
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,458
is pretty well established.

327
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,500
Could you tell us how
long you've been here for?

328
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,916
Oh...

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,416
I guess it must be about
ten thousand years now.

330
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,375
Been ninety years since
I had any customers, though.

331
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,708
When people stopped coming,

332
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,500
I arranged to send the
ramen through the wormhole

333
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,250
so it could be sold elsewhere
and I could still make a living.

334
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,958
Of course, by the
time it arrives,

335
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,583
the noodles have gone stale

336
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,500
and the flavor of
the broth has changed,

337
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,791
but folks seem
to like it anyhow.

338
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, that's one mystery solved.

339
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,708
There are plenty of places
a guy can open a ramen shop.

340
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,083
Why here?

341
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,125
I'm guessing there's
a story behind that.

342
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,458
Tell me, sir.

343
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,875
Who are you?

344
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,000
It's Dandy.

345
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
But, you can
call me Space Dandy.

346
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,833
By the look of it,
I figure you for an earthling.

347
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,250
Not a bad planet, Earth.

348
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,166
I've been there before myself,
if you'll believe it.

349
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,000
Though I wouldn't
blame you if you didn't.

350
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,291
It happened so long ago,
I couldn't tell you when it was.

351
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,291
I was a reckless kid.

352
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,250
Always getting into trouble.

353
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,708
Until one day there
was an accident.

354
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,833
I took somebody's life.

355
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,250
I had to leave after that.

356
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,125
I fled my home world,
always on the run

357
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,666
from one planet to another,

358
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,041
hoping no one
would track me down.

359
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,208
Then one day long after
my heart had grown weary

360
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,625
and my soul had grown exhausted.

361
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,958
I found myself on
a world called Earth.

362
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,625
An earthling came along
and took me under his wing.

363
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,833
He introduced me to the
comforting flavor of ramen.

364
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,541
It was an experience
I would never forget.

365
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,625
And a flavor,
I would always cherish.

366
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,625
After my time on Earth ended.

367
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,083
I stopped world-hopping
and fled to this dimension.

368
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,208
I can't go back to
my home world again.

369
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,458
So I'll stay here forever,
cooking my ramen

370
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,666
for whoever cares to order it.

371
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,916
Here you go.

372
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,000
So tell me, Pops.

373
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,875
don't you get lonely
here all by yourself?

374
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,958
[OLD MAN]
You feel something long enough

375
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,166
and it becomes a state of being.

376
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,791
You don't notice
it so much then.

377
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,416
[MEOW]
So. How is it?

378
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,541
Those are some tasty tears.

379
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,625
They make for a
good broth, baby.

380
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,875
[QT]
Dandy, you have to hurry!

381
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,583
The wormhole is going to
close up again any minute now!

382
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,083
What?

383
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,791
[QT] If you're not quick,
you won't be able to get back!

384
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,083
Crap!

385
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,250
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

386
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,166
[OLD MAN]
Here you are.

387
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,166
Let's go!

388
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,666
Aw! No fair!

389
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,625
[DANDY]
Hey, Pops.

390
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,166
We do have room for one more.

391
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,666
[OLD MAN] Go on.
Take the bowl.

392
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,208
What? I can? Are you sure?

393
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,250
Oh, thank you, Pops!

394
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,208
[QT]
You've gotta move faster!

395
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,666
C'mon!

396
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,083
Wow. I can't believe we made it.

397
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,250
Uh huh.

398
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,125
My ramen didn't, though.

399
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,208
Yeah.

400
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,708
That was one good bowl of soup.

401
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,500
Don't you think?

402
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,125
Oh, that's right.

403
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,916
You didn't eat yours, did you?

404
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,166
What a shame.

405
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,291
It was truly a flavor
from another dimension.

406
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,625
Ya missed out. Too bad.

407
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,541
[QT] So, uh. What about
the phantom alien?

408
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,750
[QT] Why am I
not surprised?

409
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,750
Apparently, worthless crew
members are just something

410
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,166
I'll have to get
used to around here.

411
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,708
[DANDY] Now then,
on the next Space Dandy.

412
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,125
[QT] There's a next episode?

413
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,791
[DANDY] It's time for some
full-on anime fanservice!

414
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,958
[QT] Eh?

415
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,500
[MEOW] We need
fanservice already?

416
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,875
[DANDY]
Next time:

417
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,500
"Occasionally Even the
Deceiver is Deceived, Baby."


418
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,916
See you then!
