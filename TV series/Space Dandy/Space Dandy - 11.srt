00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,000
[NARRATOR]
Space Dandy.

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,458
He's a dandy guy... in space.

3
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,916
He combs the galaxy
like his pompadour,

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,583
on the hunt for aliens.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,958
Planet after planet he searches,

6
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:48,250
discovering bizarre new
creatures both friendly and not.

7
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,333
These are the
spectacular adventures

8
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:55,291
of Space Dandy and his
brave space crew... in space.

9
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,208
[GEL]
These time-space distortions

10
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,208
indicate the existence

11
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
of a tremendous
amount of energy.

12
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,083
Interesting. However,
if such power truly exists

13
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,333
in this universe
then that would mean--

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,750
[BEA] Dr. Gel. I really hate
to interrupt you, sir.

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,833
But you've been working so hard

16
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,416
and I thought you
could use a break.

17
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,958
Perhaps it'll bring you clarity?

18
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,416
As they say,
"All work and no play

19
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,375
leads to a
monotonous existence."

20
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,958
Sorry! Please forgive
my clumsiness, sir!

21
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,541
Ah, Pyonium.

22
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,666
Dr. Gel.

23
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,416
Admiral!

24
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Um. How can we help you?

25
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,958
[PERRY] How many
times must I remind you

26
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,291
to check in regularly?

27
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,083
These long distance
space-phone charges

28
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,458
are nothing to
sneeze at, Doctor!

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,291
Hmm?

30
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,666
He's been deep in thought
like this for days now.

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,208
With all of his bungling,

32
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,625
it's easy to forget that he's
actually a gifted scientist.

33
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,916
Well, you certainly can't
tell by looking at him.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,458
[PERRY]
Since the Doctor is indisposed,

35
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,958
I'll let you handle
this matter, Bea.

36
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,875
We are launching
a full-scale assault

37
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,916
to conquer planet Lagado.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
[BEA]
For what reason?

39
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,541
That planet is nothing more
than one giant library, sir.

40
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,375
To teach them a lesson.

41
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,500
No one harasses
the great Admiral Perry

42
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,000
about an overdue book
and gets away with it!

43
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,416
I'm going to make them pay!

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,958
I can't help but feel as
though there's something

45
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,375
vital missing from this formula.

46
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,916
[SCARLET]
For the last time,

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,208
will you just show me
what's in the box, already?

48
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,291
[DANDY]
What'd I just tell ya, babe?

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,791
You can't open it,
'cause if you do,

50
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,041
we're gonna
forget what's inside.

51
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,291
[SCARLET]
But if I don't,

52
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,875
I'll never know what it
was in the first place.

53
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,916
[DANDY] I'm tellin' ya,
once you open that box

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,375
it'll be like none'a this
ever happened! Ya dig?

55
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,458
I'm sorry. I don't understand
a word of what you just said.

56
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,375
You're killin' me. Okay,
I'll go over it one more time.

57
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,875
I busted my butt

58
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,458
to capture the super-rare
alien that's inside that box.

59
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,666
The problem is if you
look at it you'll forget it,

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,416
which is why nobody's discovered
the damn thing 'til now.

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,250
So, how did you manage
to capture this alien,

62
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,708
when everyone else forgets that
they've ever even seen it?

63
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,583
Well obviously baby,
I've forgotten that.

64
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,333
We worked really
hard for this one!

65
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,083
So, so hard!

66
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,708
[QT] Unfortunately, I have no
memory of how we captured it.

67
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,958
Yeah, that part is kinda' fuzzy.

68
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,916
[SCARLET]
Enough. I'm opening it.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,416
[DANDY]
No, you can't!

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,875
Didn't you hear what
I said, woman? I'm serious!

71
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,166
If you open that box,

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,750
we're gonna forget
everything that's happened!

73
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,250
[SCARLET] Then tell me this, if
it makes you forget everything,

74
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,458
then why do you still
remember that we'll forget?

75
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,958
Whoa.

76
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,625
Lemme think.

77
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,250
[SCARLET]
Only one way to find out.

78
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,125
We'll never know unless we open
the box and see what's inside!

79
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,583
No!

80
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,625
[DANDY]
Give it! Give it!

81
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,708
Um, Dandy?

82
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,625
Wha--? Oh. What's up Scarlet?

83
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,541
Is there something
that I can help you with?

84
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,916
Yeah, I brought this rare
alien in for you to check out.

85
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,958
[QT] It's weird; I have
this faint recollection

86
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,166
of capturing something.

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,875
Yeah, me too.

88
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,041
I got this hazy feeling

89
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,250
like we made the
discovery of the century.

90
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,750
It looks like a box to me.

91
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,166
It is kind of boxy.

92
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,250
What could possibly make
you think that it's an alien?

93
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,291
Hold up.

94
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,458
What the heck is this?

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,500
[SCARLET]
How should I know?

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,875
You're the one
who brought it here.

97
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,375
[GEL] If I take
the square root plus B

98
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,041
and deduct it from
the total that means

99
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,791
the linear attenuation
coefficient would be--

100
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,041
No, that can't be right.

101
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,750
If A is the intensity of
transmitted energy and B is--

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,208
[BEA] Don't you think
attacking the planet

103
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,541
is a tad excessive?

104
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,291
All you have to do
is return the book

105
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,416
and they'll stop harassing you.

106
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
[PERRY]
I can't. It was stolen.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,875
I never imagined
thieves would be able

108
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,708
to circumvent our
impeccable security system.

109
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,041
Thankfully, our surveillance
cameras caught them.

110
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,541
Watch closely.

111
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,666
[BEA]
They look familiar.

112
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,791
I feel like we've
dealt with them before.

113
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
[PERRY]
Now that you mention it.

114
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,166
[BEA]
I can't put my finger on it.

115
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,666
[PERRY] This whole mess
started because Dr. Gel insisted

116
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,208
I check out a book that he
needed to complete his research.

117
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,000
At this point, the overdue
fine is going to be ridiculous

118
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,000
so I figured it would just be
easier to conquer the planet.

119
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,083
By the way, what was
the title of the book?

120
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,666
[PERRY] "Secrets of the
Cosmos for Dummies".

121
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,375
[DANDY] I'm tellin' you guys,
this book ain't no joke!

122
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,500
I betcha it holds the
secret to somethin'.

123
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,458
[MEOW] Oh yeah?
Somethin' such as what?

124
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,541
[DANDY] Well, you know, like,
some kinda awesome somethin'!

125
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,708
[QT]
Hm.

126
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,166
This doesn't look
like any ancient writing

127
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,041
that I'm familiar with.

128
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,125
Hey tin-for-brains, why dontcha
just give it a quick search?

129
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,666
What's up guys?
What're you lookin' at?

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,333
[QT]
I can't "give it a quick search"

131
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,083
because I'd need an
update in order to do that,

132
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,708
and I would need
another update just

133
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,166
to be able to
perform that update,

134
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,000
but the last time I tried to
update it failed miserably

135
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,416
so I don't even remember what
I was talking about anymore.

136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,958
What's this say?

137
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,458
I can't read the damn thing

138
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,416
but I feel like it's
missin' somethin'.

139
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:32,083
Oh wow! You guys're taking
a trip to planet Lagado?

140
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,791
Hang on. You can
read that, Honey?

141
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,708
Of course I can, silly,
it's for a sightseeing tour.

142
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,833
"This complimentary
ticket covers three guests

143

144
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,166
Complimentary?

145
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,500
Y'know, now that you mention it,

146
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,791
it does look like
that's what it says, huh?

147
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,583
Yep, all-you-can-eat,
all-you-can-drink,

and all-you-can-read.

There ain't nothin' more
delicious than free food, baby!

00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,375
I'm sold!

151
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,458
Planet Lagado,
we're comin' for ya!

152
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
[HONEY]
Huh?

153
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
Dandy and his buddies
always hang out here.

154
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,416
Why does it feel like
I haven't seen them in a while?

155
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,791

158
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,666
Commencing occupation mission.

159
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,791
But I suppose before we do that,

160
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,875
we should give them
the option to surrender.

161
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,041
How dare those insolent
fools hassle the Admiral

162
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,041
about an overdue library book!

163
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,125
We're going to
make them regret it!

164
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,083
[MALE OPERATOR] I'm picking
up a ship, port side aft!

165
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,041
It's warping out!

166
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,208
A ship?

167
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,500
It's the Aloha Oe!
We've got trouble!

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,041
Dr. Gel! It's
Space Dandy and his crew!

169
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,875
So it's possible to
control luck via energy?

170
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,333
But how? I still seem
to be missing something.

171
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,500
Listen up! Fire tractor beams!

172
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,208
I want that ship
and its crew captured!

173
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,375
[MALE OPERATOR]
Yes, sir!

174
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
Why, Dandy?

175
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
You ruin everything.

176
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,875
[MEOW and QT screaming]

177
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,833
What's with the attack?
They invited us!

178
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,208
Aw, man! There's
fleet of ships out there!

179
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,916
It's possible this is a trap.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,166
Nah, these greedy bastards want
all the free grub to themselves!

181
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,875
Whatever you say, Dandy.

182
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,833
Turn us
one-hundred-eighty degrees!

183
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,833
Aloha Beam, stand by!
We're firing back!

184
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,500
[QT] Roger! Turning
one-hundred-eighty degrees!

185
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,791
[QT]
Aloha Beam standing by!

186
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,458
[QT] Energy charge at
one-hundred-and-twenty percent!

187
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,083
Firing in five seconds!

188
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,208
Four! Three! Two! One!

189
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,875
Here we go!

190
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,375
[BEA] There's no way!
He must be insane!

191
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,625
He's challenging the
entire Gogol Space Force

192
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,541
with just one ship?

193
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,583
I'll show him!
Launch missiles at once!

194
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,583
[MALE OPERATOR]
The target has vanished!

195
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,666
Did they warp?

196
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,791
[MALE OPERATOR]
No, it appears they used

197
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,333
an unknown transport device.

198
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,333
What should we do, sir?

199
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,916
Send out the
reconnaissance probe.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,166
[MALE OPERATOR]
Yes, sir!

201
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,875
[BEA] It seems you're smarter
than I thought you were, Dandy.

202
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,750
[DANDY]
Where in the hell are we?

203
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,541
[QT]
The planet Lagado.

204
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,291
[DANDY]
But how did we get here?

205
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,083
[QT] I'm not sure,
but if I had to guess,

206
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,041
I'd say we must've been
forcibly transported.

207
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,750
[MEOW] Maybe that's just how
they welcome their guests?

208
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,333
Let's do this!

209
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,791
I dunno about you guys, but I'm
ready to get my free grub on!

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,958
[DANDY]
Check it!

211
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,250
Now that's what I call service!

212
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,375
[DANDY] What's the
deal with this world?

213
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,166
[QT]
Lagado is more commonly known

214
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,000
as the Great Library Planet.

215
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,208
It holds the largest collection
of literature in the universe.

216
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,875
Visitors are allowed
to check out books

217
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,583
just like any other library.

218
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,000
Seems weird we haven't
seen a single life form.

219
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,958
So where's all the free food and
booze that we were promised?

220
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Yeah, no kiddin'.

221
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,833
I ain't interested in the
"all-you-can-read"

222
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,291
part of the deal.

223
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,208
If you found food, you
better share it with us, QT!

224
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,625
C'mon!

225
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,791
[QT]
Hands off!

226
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,958
This data is yummy!

227
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,000
It has such a delicate
yet bold flavor!

228
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,833
It's so delicious
and easily digitized

229
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,000
that my operating
system is in overdrive!

230
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,875
I've never downloaded such
organized and tasty data!

231
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,333
Hey QT, are you sure
you're not bein' hacked?

232
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,958
[QT]
Pathetic living being!

233
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,333
What do you know?

234
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,416
You meat puppets could
never understand the beauty

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,291
of this experience!

236
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,250
[DANDY] I don't see how
that paper could be tasty.

237
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,500
[QT]
Of course you don't!

238
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,625
Your sense of taste
is totally different!

239
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,291
Inputting well-organized data
gives me the same sensation

240
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,875
as eating something incredible!

241
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,416
This sucks! Gah!

242
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,291
Isn't there anything
real on this crappy planet?

243
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,125
I don't wanna see pictures of
food in books, I wanna eat it!

244
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,125
I don't wanna see boobs in
centerfolds, I wanna grab 'em!

245
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,708
Man cannot live by data alone!

246
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,958
This is gonna drive me nuts!

247
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,166
And it's all this
damn ticket's fault!

248
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,500
[VOICE]
Insolence!

249
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,750
That's a lot of spears.

250
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,166
[LIBRARY STAFFER] We're so
glad to have you back!

251
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,416
Welcome home,
Great Librarian Alethia

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,333
and Deputy Librarian Idea.

253
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,583
You don't happen to go by
one of those names, do ya?

254
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,625
[MEOW]
Uh-uh.

255
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
[MALE OPERATOR]
Lagado has yet to respond

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,333
to our request
for surrender, sir.

257
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,708
I assume that they're
too terrified to answer.

258
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,791
[MALE OPERATOR] We have images
from the reconnaissance probe!

259
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,458
Good. Let's see them.

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,916
[GEL]
That's it!

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,833
[BEA]
Doctor Gel?

262
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,333
[GEL]
I can't believe it!

263
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,166
I've finally found
the missing piece

264
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,458
that will complete the formula!

265
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,083
Indeed! It all makes
sense to me now!

266
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
I have been asked to inform
you that the Great Librarian

267
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,375
thoroughly enjoyed sharing
this adventure with you.

268
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,750
Our Excellency is thankful
for everything you've done.

269
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,166
Look, I don't mean to be rude

270
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,166
but I got no idea what
you're talkin' about.

271
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,166
[LIBRARY STAFFER] Hmm.
It was foolish of me

272
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,083
to expect such commoners
to grasp the situation.

273
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,291
The book that you see
before you is actually

274
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,416
the librarian of Lagado,
the Great Library Planet.

275
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,333
The greatest of
all banned literature,

276
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,625
also known as "Secrets
of the Cosmos for Dummies".

277
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,625
Huh? I'm not
followin' you, buddy.

278
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,250
[LIBRARY STAFFER]
The Great Librarian Alethia

279
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,041
is what you would
call a book-type alien.

280
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,041
Our Excellency travels the
galaxy studying the truths

281
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,875
of the universe and taking
in vast amounts of knowledge.

282
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,916
The Great Librarian then takes
all of the information gathered

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,083
and stores it away within the
pages of this physical form.

284
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,541
And beside Alethia is--

285
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,083
[DEPUTY LIBRARIAN]
The deputy librarian, Idea.

286
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,666
I am the one who
was put in charge

287
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,958
of the recovery operation.

288
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,166
Excellent work.
Thank you for your help.

289
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,500
Huh?

290
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,666
[QT] Oh, I see.
So Alethia's a phantom alien!

291
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,500
A Parasite-type?

292
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,166
No wonder my brain's been foggy.

293
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,583
You're tellin' me we were bein'
manipulated this whole time?

294
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,541
[LIBRARY STAFFER]
Yes, that's correct.

295
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,375
As a Parasite-type alien,

296
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,375
Our Excellency is able to use
other beings' brains to think.

297
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,375
Doing so is much easier than
thinking for oneself, after all.

298
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,916
The Great Librarian tells
me that your rescue mission

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,250
to free Our Excellency
from the Gogol Empire

300
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,791
was nothing short of amazing.

301
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,708
But I don't remember
any rescue mission.

302
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,916
[LIBRARY STAFFER]
It happened.

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Whether or not you
remember is irrelevant.

304
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,083
Okay, if that's true, then how
come I have no memory of it?

305
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,375
[LIBRARY STAFFER] Erasing and
rewriting the memories of others

306
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
is a simple task for
The Great Librarian.

307
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,666
The only shortcoming Our
Excellency has is the inability

308
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,250
to move around unassisted.

309
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,708
Other beings must be manipulated
in order to facilitate movement.

310
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,958
Okay, lemme get this straight,
you're sayin' we kicked ass

311
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,916
on a rescue mission
that we can't remember?

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,291
[DEPUTY LIBRARIAN] Yes, that's
precisely what we're saying.

313
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,291
[LIBRARY STAFFER] I have
to be honest with you,

314
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,375
Great Librarian,

315
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,791
I was terribly
disappointed to learn

316
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,000
that you had been checked
out without informing us.

317
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,208
[DEPUTY LIBRARIAN]
Yes, we all were.

318
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,500
In the future, please be sure

319
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,041
to let us know ahead
of time, Your Excellency.

320
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,000
[GIRL'S VOICE] I will.
I'm really sorry.

321
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,958
Whoa. You're just a little girl!

322
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,666
[GIRL LIBRARIAN] I know
I shouldn't go off on my own,

323
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,458
but I wanna see the universe!

324
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,000
When the checkout
request came in,

325
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,375
I went for it 'cause I thought
it might be my only chance!

326
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,750
I know it was wrong of me

327
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,166
to manipulate others,
but I couldn't help myself.

328
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,083
[MEOW]
The poor thing.

329
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,250
I know how she feels.

330
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,583
You don't know nothin'!

331
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,875
This little lady's a
dreamer just like me, Dandy!

332
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,208
[GIRL LIBRARIAN]
I wanted to see all

333
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,833
of the things I had only
ever read about in books!

334
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,291
The fire bandits!

335
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,916
The smash-and-grab thieves!

336
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,041
The demons of hell!

337
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,750
Incantation dancing!

338
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,416
The heads of the crucified
on the prison gates!

339
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,208
[QT] What kind of creepy
books have you been reading?

340
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,708
[LIBRARY STAFFER]
You had us all worried!

341
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,625
[DEPUTY LIBRARIAN] Now, now,
no need to get so upset.

342
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,125
After all, there is some
good that's come out of this.

343
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,416
The Great Librarian fulfilled
her wish to see the universe,

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,583
and she gained some wonderful
knowledge along the way.

345
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,000
[QT] "Book-type aliens have
the ability to manipulate

346
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,875
others' brains into
thinking about problems

347
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,375
they find too bothersome
to deal with themselves.

348
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,166
When they retrieve the
answer to the problem,

349
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,791
they gather the energy the
being exerted while thinking,

350
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,583
and feed off of it to survive."

351
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,166
Wow, that's really interesting.

352
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,125
[MEOW] Ya mind
dumbin' it down for us?

353
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,166
[QT] Basically, they're like
unfinished books who feed off

354
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,250
of others in order to fill
their pages with information.

355
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,041
[LIBRARY STAFFER]
Very eloquently put.

356
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,916
Unfortunately, you three
were of absolutely no help

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,583
in that regard,
but not to worry.

358
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,875
Allow me to handle this!

359
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,166
I understand!
It all makes sense now!

360
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,625
Doctor Gel?

361
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,708
[MALE OPERATOR]
Multiple weapon strikes

362
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,875
from the planet's surface!

363
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,625
We can't evade them all!

364
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,666
What the--?

365
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,125
[BEA]
What should we do?

366
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,541
Doctor, we have to evacuate!

367
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,666
[GEL] I did it, Bea. I've
figured out what this is.

368
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,833
It's the secret behind the
powerful energy Dandy possesses.

369
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,916
The Secrets of the Cosmos.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,208
The ever-changing truth!

371
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,333
It is so beautiful, and yet--

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
Let's go, Doctor!

373
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,416
Bea.

374
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,250
I've realized why it
was so difficult

375
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,625
for me to solve
this formula.

376
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,000
Would you like me to tell you?

377
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,458
Maybe later, right
now we need to evacuate!

378
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,291
[GEL]
There's no point.

379
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:02,958
Doctor?

380
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,125
It's too late.

381
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,250
I've stumbled upon
an amazing truth

382
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,333
that one cannot simply forget.

383
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,791
A knowledge of such power.

384
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,625
That it spells death for
anyone who might attain it!

385
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,500
[screaming]

386
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,666
[GIRL LIBRARIAN] It's a shame
you don't remember the time

387
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,625
we spent together, because
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

388
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,791
It was the best six months
of my entire existence.

389
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,916
You were with us that
long and we had no clue?

390
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,083
[GIRL LIBRARIAN] I know it's my
duty to erase your memories,

391
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
but it breaks my heart to think

392
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,708
that I'll lose the bond
of friendship we shared.

393
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,416
When all of this is over, you
will have no memory of me

394
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,583
or anything that
happened on our journey.

395
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,083
However, I believe I've
come up with a way to leave you

396
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,916
with a token of my affection.

397
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,208
[GIRL LIBRARIAN] From what
I gathered during my time

398
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,541
on the Aloha Oe,

399
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,500
you make your living by
searching for rare aliens.

00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,166
Please, take that box with you.

401
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,750
Consider it your reward
for a job well done.

402
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,375
But whatever you do,
you mustn't open it early.

403
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,625
[SCARLET]
For the last time,

404
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,333
will you just show me
what's in the box, already?

405
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,500
[DANDY]
You can't open it,

406
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,208
'cause we're gonna
forget what's inside.

407
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:13,083
[NARRATOR] Contained within the
box was a mysterious videotape.

408
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,500
One which manipulates
the viewer's memory.

409
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,916
It wasn't long before similar
laser discs, cassette tapes,

410
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,958
and floppy disks began
popping up all over the galaxy.

411
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,583
Eventually, they
became jumbled together,

412
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:31,708
causing a war that dragged
the entire universe into chaos.

413
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,500
Unfortunately,
there is no record

414
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,833
of it ever even happening.
