1
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:08,885
-So here's how
will be pairing up.

2
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:13,227
Sakura, you and I
will be on one team.

3
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,567
And of course, Naruto and
Sai will make up the other.

4
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:26,788
-You expect me to work with him?

5
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,244
-Captain Yamato and
I will be one unit.

6
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:38,745
OK.

7
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:46,528
But the other?

8
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,066
It's their unit
I'm worried about.

9
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,603
Naruto and Sai.

10
00:00:56,314 --> 00:01:05,566
[sakura sighs]

11
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,238
-I can't wait.

12
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,777
-There's that fake smile again.

13
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,382
I can't stand it.

14
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:14,718
Captain Yamato?

15
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,087
-Yes, Naruto?

16
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,289
What is it?

17
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:19,928
-It's just that-- why'd
you put me with that guy?

18
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,310
-Got a problem?

19
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:30,083
-Uh, no, No problem.

20
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,587
Excellent.

21
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,858
-I see.

22
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,997
Why am I not surprised?

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,704
You'll just have to keep Naruto
on a shorter leash than usual.

24
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:42,607
-Yes, of course, ma'am.

25
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:45,613
Excuse me Captain Yamato?

26
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,917
-Yes, Sakura?

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,691
-I think maybe Naruto and
I would make a better team.

28
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,929
We've been together
for a long time.

29
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,935
We know each other's
moves inside and out.

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,270
-Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:57,304 --> 00:01:58,272
You tell him, Sakura.

32
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,051
-Sakura.

33
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:04,953
-Yes?

34
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:06,156
-Listen.

35
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,997
You'ew the only medical
ninja we have on this team.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,568
Because we can't afford to
have anything happen to you,

37
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:13,637
you stay with me,

38
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:14,105
-But--

39
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:21,153
-Do you understand me?

40
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:21,721
-Yes.

41
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:32,008
-As Sai mentioned before,
we can expect the enemy

42
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,845
to be highly skilled.

43
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:37,686
Any mistakes or loss of
focus could prove fatal.

44
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,824
So save any more questions
you have for later.

45
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:42,763
Let's concentrate on
the mission right now.

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,665
-Yes, sir.

47
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,101
-OK, you got it.

48
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,762
-It is imperative
that we discover

49
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,833
where Orochimaru's hideout is.

50
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,910
And the spy who might
be able to tell us

51
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:09,551
is probably on his way to
Tenchi bridge right now.

Come on.

65
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,095
When do we make our move?

[bells ringing]

67
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,069
NARUTO: There he is.

68
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,144
Come on.

69
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:14,480
Where's the damn signal?

70
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:28,442
There's the signal!

71
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,393
Hold it, right there!

72
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,140
-No, Naruto!

73
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,643
-Here we go, Sai.

74
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:46,378
Let's do it.

75
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,029
-I don't usually do this.

76
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:58,636
But after our talk, I think
it might be a good idea.

77
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,476
So tomorrow morning, we're
going to have a battlefield

78
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,678
simulation.

79
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:03,847
-Simulation?

80
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,317
-That's right.

81
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,019
So far, all I really
know about you

82
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,825
three is what I've
read in your files.

83
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,863
I want to get a better
idea of your battle

84
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:16,005
skills, your individual
fighting styles and jutsu.

85
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,743
I want to see them myself.

86
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,816
The more we work together
and learn about each other,

87
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,753
the more it'll help
with our team work.

-You might think I'm being
unnecessarily cautious,

but that's the way I am.

Anyone have a problem with that?

-Dammit.

-Oh, don't tell me
that's all you've got.

-How about that?

00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,939
Was that good enough?

99
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:39,941
Gah!

off me right now!

Hey, I captured him first.

104
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,536
You don't get points
for capturing me.

105

Get me out of here!

What are you doing?

00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,185
That's not Captain
Yamato you've got.

00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,038
OK, that does it.

112
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,942
Hey, Sai!

113
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,379
Get back here and untie
this stupid snake!

114
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,984
-You got me fair and square.

115
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,954
Good job, Sai.

116

[thinking] He's
better than I thought,

117
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,297
it's hard to believe that a
shinobi with his skill level

118
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,906
was assigned to team
Kakashi as a mere alternate,

119
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,409
-One more thing.

120
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,415
Team Kakashi will be getting
a new face in its ranks

121
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,588
from the foundation, the
Black Ops training division.

122
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:53,991
-Really?

The foundation?

124
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:57,666
-However--

125
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,101
-Yes, m'lady?

126
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,039
-Keep a very close eye on him.

127
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,511
Study his every move.

128
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:06,182
-It's beginning to look
like Lady Tsunade's concerns

129
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,588
about him weren't groundless.

130
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:10,258

00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,327

--[thinking] To be strong
enough to snap that snake,

-You think?

140
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,433
Do you know what comrade means?

141
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:02,463
What the-- hey, I
asked you if you even

142
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:05,135
know what the word comrade is.

143
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:09,277
-Why yes, of course I know it.

144
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,446
You write it like this.

145
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,726
-That's not what I
meant and you know it.

-Hey, calm down, Naruto.

147
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,267
-You really shouldn't
go around blaming others

00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:22,571
for your own shortcomings.

149

-Say what?

150
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,956
This guy's fast.

151
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:33,994
-Aww, don't tell me
that's all you've got.

152
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:38,436
-If you hadn't fallen for
the captain's obvious trick,

153
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:42,879
he never would have found out
I was hiding somewhere else.

154
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,517
And perhaps I might have
been able to capture him

155
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,222
with even less
trouble than I had.

156
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:48,957
-Oh yeah?

157
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,093
What do you mean by that?

158
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:53,099
-Why even bother
masquerading as me

159
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:56,105
if you're going to reveal
yourself almost immediately

160
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,508
by using one of your own jutsu?

161
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,119
-Because of your
mistake, the captain

162
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,856
was able to see
through our strategy

163
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,662
and use a substitution jutsu
to escape into the forest.

164
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,646
-Well then.

165
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,484
If you knew it was
a substitution,

166
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:21,958
why didn't you break
your jutsu right away?

167
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:24,062
-It's impractical to
fight while covering

00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,335
for someone who's lost his cool.

169
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:30,642
I simply considered what would
best ensure mission success

170
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:31,711
and acted accordingly.

171
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,860
-I'll tell you
something right now.

172
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:44,103
I don't accept you as a comrade,
or as a member of Team Kakashi.

173
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,874
Not now, not ever.

174
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:49,113
[sai sighs]

175
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,515
-I'm beginning to
get the feeling

176
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:53,421
that this entire thing
may not work out at all.

177
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:58,264
I wonder what Sasuke
would have done?

178
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,168
Would he have wanted
to fight an enemy

179
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:02,674
and cover for you
at the same time?

180
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:06,682
I mean, after all, you consider
him to be a comrade, right?

181
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,362
-Uh oh.

182
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:15,866
Naruto is going to blow his
top again if he keeps this up.

183
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:24,451
-Though how you can call someone
who betrayed his own village

184
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:28,058
a comrade is beyond me.

185
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,721
-Naruto.

186
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,570
-Oh, no.

187
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:54,745
-If it means saving a comrade,
I'll do whatever it takes.

188
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,910
Even if that means
teaming with you.

189
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,828
-Naruto.

190
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:26,477
-Tell me, Why does he feel
so strongly about Sasuke?

191
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:35,228
-It's because Sasuke's more
than the teammate to Naruto.

192
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:38,033
He's like a brother.

193
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,977
You have a brother of
your own, don't you Sai?

194
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,715
You must be able to
understand how he feels.

195
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:46,283
-I don't.

196
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,685
Not at all.

197
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,969
Remember our conversation
about titling my drawings?

198
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:59,844
The truth is, I couldn't
really title any of my drawings

199
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,979
even if I wanted to.

200
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,891
Nothing comes to mind.

201
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,966
I've never really felt anything.

202
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,138
I you you, I just don't
have any feelings at all.

203
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,389
-But you don't
really mean you can't

204
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:25,162
feel any emotion about anything?

205
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:26,531
-Yes, exactly.

206
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:27,767
I meant what I said.

207
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,115
-You say that, but if
you have a brother,

208
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,686
try and imagine what it
would feel like to lose him.

209
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,925
Surely you should
be able to do that.

210
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,193
-Hmm?

211
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:58,931
Oh, yes, that.

212
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:02,805
Well, you see, my
brother is already dead.

213
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,937
-Then all the more reason to--

214
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,443
-I suppose I should have
looked like that, shouldn't I?

215
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,241
-What are you trying to say?

216
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:41,082
-Well, it's just that, I simply
didn't know what kind of look

217
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:44,957
a person makes when
his brother dies.

218
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,130
-What kind of look a person--?

219
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:50,969
What a jerk.

220
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,108
-All right, that's enough
talking now, come on everyone,

221
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,412
gather your things.

222
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:56,580
It's time to move out.

223
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,261
-Sai, you were lucky.

224
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,131
I had every intention
of pounding you

225
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:08,939
into the ground a moment ago.

226
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:12,880
I warned you I wouldn't
hold anything back

227
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,650
if you badmouthed Sasuke again.

228
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:23,869
The only reason I didn't
is-- well, like Naruto said,

229
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,209
if it means saving Sasuke,
we do whatever it takes.

230
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:31,318
Even teaming up with
someone like you.

231
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:37,062
No matter how much I may want
to, I can't afford to hurt you.

232
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,636
Not if you can help
us save Sasuke.

233
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,642
-Sakura, about you and Naruto?

234
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,154
I don't know how to
say this, but you're

235
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:53,262
being considerate
of his feelings.

236
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,901
I don't really understand
how such feelings come about,

237
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,840
though there was something
about this in the book.

238
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:02,246
-Let's go, What
are we waiting for?

239
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,351
If we don't get there
by noon tomorrow,

240
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,854
this will all have
been for nothing.

241
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,272
-It's right up ahead, let's
make sure we're all ready,

242
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,541
then we'll head for the bridge.

-How long are we going to
have to wait for this spy

252
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,848
to get here?

253
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,250
-As long as it takes.

254
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,455
Remember, the enemy is
highly skilled and dangerous.

255
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,359
Caution is the best policy.

256
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,730
-But if we're too cautious,
we might give ourselves away,

257
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,469
thus losing the opportunity
of capturing him

258
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,905
quickly and effectively.

00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:17,242
SAKURA: That's true.

SAI: Shh.

261
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:18,711
I think he's coming.

262
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:20,448
NARUTO: It's about time.

263
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:20,949
Hey, wait.

264
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:22,018
Is that--

265
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,022
SAKURA: No way, it can't be.

266
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:26,126
He's the Akatsuke spy?

267
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:38,952
NARUTO: Next time,
"The Tenchi Bridge."

Investigation Team!

270
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,899
-This question comes from
Tazuna from the land of waves.

271
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,572
-I just don't get the
whole ninja ranking system.

272
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:51,645
Can you please explain
it to a layman like me?

273
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:52,747
-Good one.

274
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,884
-This takes me back
to the good old days.

275
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:57,423
-All right, Going down the
ranks of ninja from the top,

276
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,562
the jounin are the elite,
the best of the best.

277
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:01,999
There aren't many
of them, and each

278
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,237
possesses incredible abilities.

279
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:07,443
Next come the specialist
jounin, each uniquely gifted

280
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:08,645
in his or her field.

281
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,082
They're assigned
special missions

282
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,852
depending on their abilities.

283
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,190
Ibiki-sensei is an
expert in interrogation,

284
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,929
and Ebisu-sensi is good
at training, I guess.

285
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,866
Below them are the chunin.

286
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:21,772
Our main job is to act as
team leaders for the genin.

287
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:24,745
-That's I should be there
if there was any justice.

288
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:25,923
-Lastly, the genin.

289
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,591
-And finally, you're
getting to me.

290
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,593
-They don't really need
much explaining, Anyway,

291
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:30,795
we're just about out of time.

292
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:33,030
-What do you mean we don't
need much explaining?

293
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,398
-Thanks for the
question, Tazuna.

294
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,866
See you next time, everyone.

295
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,735
-Hey, wait!
