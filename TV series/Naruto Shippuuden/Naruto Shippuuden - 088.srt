1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,090
-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,190
-Another trio of clones.

3
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,000
-What is that?

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,000
He's--

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,000
-Listen.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,220
That sound.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,140
So-- so much chakra.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,140
-Interesting.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,130
Now what?

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,020
What is that jutsu?

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,020
I can't let it hit me--
or I'll be finished.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,130
-Wind Style, Rasenshuriken!

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,100
OK, here we go.

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,210
Let's finish this!

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,090
-Right!

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,150
-Well, I'm going in with him!

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,020
-No!

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,130
Stay away from it!

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,020
You'll just get caught, too!

20
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,200
-So this is the power of
the Nine Tails Jinchuriki.

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,110
The jutsu certainly
befits the beast.

22
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,050
-What?

23
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,498
No!

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,070
-What?

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,160
-Did-- did he bat him?

26
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,160
-It failed.

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,160
[theme music]

28
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,010
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): That
boy is full of surprises.

29
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,060
Well, all right, then.

30
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,060
-Yamato.

31
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,508
-Right.

32
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
-Your heart belongs to me.

33
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,478
Huh?

34
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,040
-Oh, man.

35
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,190
-You seemed a little
different for a moment there.

36
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,000
But I guess you're still the
same old Naruto, after all.

37
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,200
-When you said Rasenshuriken,
I figured for sure you'd

38
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,120
boomerang it, or something.

39
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,210
Never thought you'd try
to smack him head on.

40
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,200
-Oh, shut up!

41
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,050
It's awesome when it hits, OK?

42
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,150
-The name is misleading.

43
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,010
Rasenshuriken is meant to
be a frontal attack, thus

44
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,120
the need for an
accompanying diversion.

45
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,100
In this case, the shadow clones.

46
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,150
KAKASHI: The problem is this
new jutsu burns too quickly.

47
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,070
It only lasts a few seconds.

48
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,507
YAMATO: Yeah.

49
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,100
Exactly.

50
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,220
-We'll never be able to
hit him that quickly.

51
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,210
He's way too fast.

52
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,100
-It appears the boy's
jutsu is useless, so long

53
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,120
as I keep my distance.

54
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,120
So I just have to
avoid close combat,

55
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,120
don't let myself be
distracted by the clones,

56
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,090
and keep my eye on the original.

57
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,130
All right.

58
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
That should be simple enough.

59
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,230
-OK.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,070
Let me try this again.

61
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,070
Now that I know what I'm doing.

62
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,190
-Come on, he's an Akatsuki.

63
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,050
If you repeat the same move,
he's just gonna dodge it again.

64
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,100
-Yeah, it won't work.

65
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,180
He knows what to expect now.

66
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,170
Let's work together.

67
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,200
-That's true.

68
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,190
Right now we're
five against one.

69
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,010
There's no need for us to
cross any shaky bridges.

70
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,210
-So, what now?

71
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,599
-Kakashi-sensei.

72
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,210
Do you remember what you
told me during training?

73
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,090
-Hm?

74
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,090
-You said I'm the
only shinobi who

75
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,000
will surpass the Fourth Hokage.

76
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,020
And you meant what you said.

77
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,468
-Naruto--

78
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,060
-Look, I know
teamwork's important,

79
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,100
but right now I need
to cross this bridge,

80
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,130
and cross it alone.

81
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,150
No matter how dangerous a
bridge it turns out to be.

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,140
If I can't work my
way to the other side,

83
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,090
I'll just be a kid forever.

84
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:25,080
So please, please, don't
take away my chance to prove

85
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,090
what I can do.

86
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,100
-What do you say, Yamato?

87
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,160
-Well, Kakashi, I
must admit, I've

88
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,080
yet to see just how
much Naruto has changed.

89
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,030
KAKASHI: Well,
there we are, then.

90
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,120
-Shikamaru.

91
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,160
[boom]

92
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,120
-Huh?

93
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,170
-Pakkun, what was that?

94
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,080
-They're close.

95
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,160
[boom]

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,220
[laughter]

97
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,100
-How dare you.

98
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,220
Look at this!

99
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,030
Just look at the
state you put me in.

100
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:31,070
[laughter] Jashin will
have his vengeance!

101
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,100
He'll punish you for this!

102
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,160
Just you wait!

103
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,230
You will suffer the most
terrible judgement ever imposed

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
by the way of Jashin!

105
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,090
-You and your god
don't frighten me.

106
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,220
You see, you and I believe
in different things.

107
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,100
You wanna know
what I believe in?

108
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,190
The Will of Fire.

109
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,140
Right now, the god you
should be worried about

110
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,090
isn't your stupid
Jashin, or anyone else.

111
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,140
It's me.

112
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,220
Because I'm the one who's
about to pass judgment.

113
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,080
-You fool!

114
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,040
Don't say I didn't warn you!

115
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,010
The day of retribution will
come, and the way of Jashin

116
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,110
will punish you!

117
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,180
yes!

118
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,030
[laughter] And then I'll be
the one passing judgement!

119
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,030
My teeth!

120
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,150
That's all I'll need!

121
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,100
You'll see!

122
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,020
And I'll tear you to pieces!

123
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,000
-Hm?

124
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,120
Huh?

125
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,070
-We found you.

126
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,060
-Reinforcements, huh?

127
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,050
You're just a little late.

128
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,140
-But, hold on.

129
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,020
You're saying you've really
defeated him by yourself?

130
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,180
-I had no idea you
were that good.

131
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:55,000
-I guess I-- I had
a feeling that this

132
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,120
was something important
I had to do on my own.

133
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,160
-Yeah, of course.

134
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,180
-So what's going
on with the others?

135
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,150
-No idea.

136
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,020
We made a beeline here.

137
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,100
SAI: We should get back to them.

138
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,100
They may need us.

139
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,020
-Shikamaru!

140
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,230
Hey there, are you all right?

141
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,220
Let me heal you.

142
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,040
Naw, forget it.

143
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,120
It's no big deal who.

144
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,150
-But you--

145
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,120
-It would be a drag if I was
the one who slowed us down,

146
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,210
when we've got
friends in danger.

147
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,150
Let's get going.

148
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,020
-Right.

149
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,080
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Hang on, guys.

150
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
We're coming.

151
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,000
-Naruto, do it.

152
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,448
-Right.

153
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,050
-So, he's gonna
try again, is he?

154
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Well then, I'd better shift
to a long range attack style.

155
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,110
-What on earth--

156
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,070
-That's not just
a transformation.

157
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,160
That's a huge amount of chakra.

158
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,160
-He's preparing
for Naruto's jutsu.

159
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,170
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

160
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,020
-Here we go.

161
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,020
-OK, now!

162
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,220
-What a leap!

163
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,210
-I can ignore the shadow clones.

164
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,200
They're only a distraction.

165
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,200
Aim for the head, and
the rest will fall.

166
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:24,080
Once I diffuse his
jutsu, I'm home free.

167
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,080
-Just as I thought!

168
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,230
He's ready for it!

169
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,160
-I knew he'd use a
long range attack.

170
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,458
-Naruto!

171
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,528
-Huh.

172
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,050
It is done.

173
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,000
What?

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,060
Just a shadow clone?

175
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,210
[shout]

176
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,200
-I see.

177
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,000
He hid himself in the crowd.

178
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
-I gotcha!

179
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,100
[scream]

180
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,130
-Watch out!

181
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
The shockwave's coming!

182
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,010
[scream]

183
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,180
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): The
number of separate attacks

184
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,230
was almost infinite.

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,110
Even my Sharingan
couldn't follow them all.

186
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,230
What a magnificent jutsu.

187
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,080
-Whoa.

188
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,538
-Awesome.

189
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,210
-Naruto.

190
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,100
Well, well.

191
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,140
You-- you finally--

192
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,090
-I did it.

193
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
That was sweet.

194
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,130
[theme music]

195
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,230
-Shizune, did you
notice anything?

196
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,180
-Are you talking about Naruto?

197
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,180
TSUANDE: Yes.

198
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,130
What do you suppose it could be?

199
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,090
SHIZUNE: I've never
seen anything like it.

200
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,190
TSUNADE: Hm.

201
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,090
Well, what's going on with the
body that Kakashi brought back?

202
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,060
SHIZUNE: I've ordered an autopsy
to be performed immediately.

203
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,110
TSUNADE: Good.

204
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,170
Tell whoever's in charge
to make it a top priority.

205
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,030
NARUTO: Next time,
The Price of Power.
