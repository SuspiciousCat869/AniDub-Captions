00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,384
All right!

6
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,820
-No good!

7
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:06,352
-What?

8
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,487
But why not?

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,122
{\an1}-Look, how many times do
I need to explain this?

10
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:12,826
{\an1}You just summoned a
tadpole not a frog.

11
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:13,593
-No way.

12
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,526
Look closer.

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,528
{\an1}It totally has lags.

14
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,330
{\an1}-No means no, Naruto.

15
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,665
{\an1}Just do it again.

16
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:20,532
-Damn it.

17
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,934
Isn't there some
kind of easier way

18
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,635
{\an1}we can do this summoning thing?

19
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,338
{\an1}-You foolish kid, there are
no shortcuts in the ninja way.

20
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,240
{\an1}-Sure, easy for you
to say, but I've

21
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:30,875
{\an1}been working my chakra
this whole time.

22
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,810
{\an1}Do you know how tiring that is?

23
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,515
-Ah.

24
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:41,283
{\an1}He still has a long way to go.

25
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,820
{\an1}I thought for sure that
the fourth Hokage's legacy

00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:46,988
{\an1}would get him through
the final rounds.

of the feudal lords and ninja

{\an1}who have come from near and
far to watch the competition

00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:08,909
play out.

{\an1}-Gaara, the success
of this mission

36
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:36,165
{\an1}depends on your performance.

37
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,667
-Fine.

38
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,884
{\an1}-Of course, the Uchiha kid
and Shukaku son are still in,

39
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:59,554
{\an1}but I can't believe Naruto
is still in the running.

40
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:04,458
{\an1}-Yeah, there's a lot of people
I don't recognize this time.

41
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:09,296
{\an1}-They're probably all the
feudal lord's staff members.

42
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,665
-Ah.

43
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,467
{\an1}-Who do you think
we should go with?

44
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,703
{\an1}-Why don't we pick the long shot
and go with this Naruto Uzumaki

45
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:18,804
kid.

46
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,339
{\an1}-You don't often see
someone with odds as bad

47
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,708
{\an1}as his in the final rounds,
and according to rumor,

48
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:24,075
{\an1}he only got in by accident.

49
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:27,145
{\an1}-And look, his first
opponent is Neji Hyuga.

50
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,514
-Well, the Hyuga
have the Byakugan.

51
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,415
he won't lose.

52
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,683
Nope.

53
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:35,252
{\an1}-Which means that our safe
choice is the last Uchiha.

54
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,988
{\an1}-Sasuke Uchiha, huh?

55
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,023
{\an1}His opponent from the
Sand is really creepy.

56
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:43,392
-Ah, these guys.

-Yeah, me too.

00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:03,344
-You got it.

61
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:07,715
Eat up.

62
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:13,252
{\an1}-Thank you for the food.

63
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,922
{\an1}-You sure you're OK?

64
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,356
You better take
it easy or you'll

65
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,257
{\an1}end up right back in
the hospital again.

66
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:24,463
{\an1}-Naruto made it to the
final rounds, but not me.

67
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,530
Pa is nice.

68
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,866
{\an1}He never says anything
about it, but I'm

69
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,534
sure that inside
he's disappointed.

70
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:36,707
{\an1}At least I'm a winner when
it comes to chowing down.

71
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:37,875
Another, please.

72
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,677
-Coming up.

73
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,279
-I'll do my best
for you too, Choji.

74
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:46,116
{\an1}Old man, thanks a lot.

75
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,384
-Bye, Naruto.

76
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,518
{\an1}OLD MAN: Here you go.

77
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:52,254
{\an1}-Guess I win that
eating contest.

78
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,188
Uh, wait!

79
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,657
{\an1}Who's gonna pay for all this?

80
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,924
Ah.

81
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,825
{\an1}-Here's the check.

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,130
{\an1}-I can't waste any time.

83
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,563
{\an1}Now that my strength
has returned,

84
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,866
{\an1}I have to start training for
the final rounds for real.

85
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,502
{\an1}Big brother, Naruto,
I challenge you.

86
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,872
{\an1}-Sorry, Konohamaru,
the final rounds

87
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,639
{\an1}are coming up really
soon, and I just

88
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,975
{\an1}don't have any time to be
playing with you right now.

89
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,844
{\an1}-When I developed
this cool new jutsu.

90
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,812
-Really?

91
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,579
{\an1}A cool new jutsu, huh?

92
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,084
OK, show me.

93
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:26,585
-Here we go.

94
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,185
-What's that?

95
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:27,920
A stick jutsu?

96
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,458
-Sexy jutsu.

97
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:36,393
{\an1}Hot body pole dance.

98
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,261
-Whoa.

99
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:42,566
{\an1}-So then, too hot for you?

100
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,534
-Ahh.

101
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,035
{\an1}What was that for?

102
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,870
{\an1}That new sexy jutsu was perfect.

103
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,105
I know it was.

104
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,175
{\an1}-Konohamaru, the path
to the sexy jutsu

105
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,709
{\an1}is long and treacherous.

106
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:54,276
{\an1}Yes, that variation is great.

107
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:57,113
{\an1}But I figured it out
a long, long time ago.

108
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,981
{\an1}-Oh man, and I was so
confident about it, too.

109
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,417
{\an1}-Now, get ready 'cuz
I'm gonna show you

110
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,351
{\an1}the new sexy jutsu
that I developed.

111
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:06,088
{\an1}-I'm ready big brother Naruto.

112
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,091
Huh?

113
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,599
-It's Gaara.

114
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:23,002
{\an1}Konohamaru, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:26,305
{\an1}I really have to get ready
for the final rounds.

116
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:29,608
{\an1}-But Naruto, what's
the big rush anyway?

117
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,810
{\an1}Didn't Jiriaya Sensei
teach you some new jutsu

118
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:34,012
{\an1}that you can use in
the final rounds?

119
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,547
{\an1}-Did Pervy Sage--

120
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,117
{\an1}-I thought for sure that
the fourth Hokage's legacy

121
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,886
{\an1}would get him through
the final rounds.

122
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,720
-Yes!

123
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,955
That's it!

124
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,323
{\an1}Thanks, Konohamaru.

125
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:47,557
-Anytime.

126
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,358
{\an1}Boy, what has gotten into him?

127
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,862
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): If I can
find the fourth Hokage's legacy

128
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,796
that Pervy Sage
was talking about,

129
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,698
the final rounds
will be a cinch.

130
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:02,337
{\an1}-Hm, and that's why?

131
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,672
{\an1}That's the reason
you came to see me?

132
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,709
{\an1}-Yeah, well, uh, I figured
that if anybody would know

133
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,343
{\an1}it would be you, sir.

134
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,712
{\an1}-The fourth Hokage's legacy.

135
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:16,517
{\an1}Well, if there is such a thing,
I'd certainly like to see it.

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,986
{\an1}-Ah, come on, you
must know what it is.

137
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,587
{\an1}You can trust me with
it, pretty please.

138
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,489
I know, if you
tell me, then I'll

139
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:27,359
{\an1}show you my new sexy jutsu.

140
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:29,128
{\an1}-If you have time
for such things

141
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,563
{\an1}you should be focusing
more on the final rounds!

142
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:32,898
-Ahh!

143
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,634
{\an1}No fair, you stingy old geezer!

144
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,673
{\an1}Ah, I have to find
someone who might know.

145
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,942
{\an1}But Kakashi Sensei is
training with Sasuke,

146
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,279
and I don't know
where they went.

147
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,181
{\an1}All right, well, I'll
just have to check out

148
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:52,482
{\an1}every place I can think of then.

149
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,850
-Oh, I get it.

150
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,085
{\an1}Is this some kind of mystery
game you're supposed to solve?

151
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,586
{\an1}-No, it's not like that.

152
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,788
{\an1}-Then it must be a
code breaking game.

153
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,957
{\an1}I used to play those a
lot when I was a kid.

154
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,626
{\an1}I bet Shikamaru's the
one who set this up.

155
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,395
{\an1}And if so, then it's
pointless to ask me.

156
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,832
{\an1}You probably already have the
answer and just don't know it.

157
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:14,068
{\an1}Never mind I'll just have
to go and ask somebody else.

158
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,875
{\an1}-That sugar glaze
looks so yummy.

159
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,743
{\an1}The anticipation's too much.

160
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:24,244
Hm.

161
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,552
-The gobblings
are way too sweet.

162
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:37,256
{\an1}Oh, say, Anko Sensei, what's
the fourth Hokage's legacy?

163
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:39,158
-You took some
dumplings from my plate,

164
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:43,228
{\an1}so I could only assume you want
to die before the final rounds.

165
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:46,463
{\an1}-No, I just want to know what
the fourth Hokage's legacy is.

166
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,031
{\an1}-Give me my dumplings!

167
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:48,866
-Ah.

168
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,067
Wait!

169
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,735
{\an1}I just wanted to find the
fourth Hokage's legacy.

170
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:54,071
-I don't care!

171
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:54,972
-That's it.

172
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,505
I'm outta here!

173
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,141
-My dumplings!

174
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,175
Oh man.

175
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,910
{\an1}I can't believe I
almost got skewered

176
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,845
{\an1}all over a stick of dumplings.

177
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,781
{\an1}I mean, I like dumplings,
but I don't want to be one.

178
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,683
{\an1}This is all really weird though.

179
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,085
{\an1}Why doesn't anybody know?

180
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:19,093
{\an1}-Well, if it isn't Naruto.

181
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,661
everything OK?

182
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:22,096
{\an1}-Bushier Brows Sensei?

183
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,063
What's going on?

184
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,131
{\an1}What are you doing here?

185
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,733
{\an1}-I'm on a pilgrimage
to 100 shrines

186
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,569
{\an1}to help with Lee's recovery.

187
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:30,937
{\an1}-Of course, you are.

188
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,372
{\an1}-What's the matter?

189
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:35,375
{\an1}Is there something
bothered you, Naruto?

190
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,876
{\an1}-Maybe you would know
Bushier Brows Sensei.

191
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,710
-Naturally.

192
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,880
{\an1}Go on, you can ask me anything.

193
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:44,216
{\an1}-Well, I've been looking for
the fourth Hokage's legacy.

194
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,417
{\an1}Do you know what it is?

195
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,351
-No way.

196
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:50,453
{\an1}The fourth Hokage's legacy?

197
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,588
-Just great.

198
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:54,292
{\an1}My belly's full but
my wallet's empty.

199
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,329
Who's that?

200
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,363
{\an1}-Are you serious?

201
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:02,032
{\an1}Do you really know
something about it?

202
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,300
-Why, yes.

203
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,600
Of course, I do.

204
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,268
{\an1}The legacy is the
ultimate secret

205
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,938
left behind by
the fourth Hokage.

206
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:09,805
{\an1}Well, what is it?

207
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:10,339
What is is?

208
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:11,040
What is it.

209
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,175
{\an1}You just gotta tell me.

210
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,108
-Hm.

211
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,844
{\an1}Boy, I really wish
I could, Naruto.

212
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:19,280
{\an1}But the village classified
it as top secret.

213
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:21,581
{\an1}-Don't say you can't
tell me, please?

214
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,918
{\an1}-I respect your determination
to learn the secret,

215
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,288
{\an1}but I'm a Jonin so I
cannot divulge the secrets

216
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,790
{\an1}of the village is someone
simply asked me to.

217
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,062
{\an1}Oh, what a coincidence.

218
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,797
{\an1}What are the odds of a pamphlet
about the fourth Hokage's

219
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,732
{\an1}legacy being right there?

220
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,670
{\an1}-A pamphlet on the
fourth Hokage's Legacy?

221
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,706
{\an1}-What's this fourth
Hokage's legacy?

222
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,510
{\an1}-Wait, I can't read it.

223
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:55,813
-Ah.

224
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:59,615
{\an1}OK, well, it says
Honegami Grounds.

225
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,318
{\an1}It's where the fourth Hokage's
legacy is kept hidden.

226
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:04,320
{\an1}But it's also said
that a menacing goblin

227
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:05,554
lives there too.

228
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:07,323
-A goblin?

229
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,326
{\an1}-Only a handful of people,
including the fourth Hokage,

230
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,828
{\an1}ever returned from that
place, so don't you

231
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:15,730
{\an1}even think about going
there, even by mistake.

232
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,899
{\an1}-Uh, you know Guy Sensei,
you're kinda scaring me.

233
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:22,803
{\an1}-Even if an incredibly
powerful, super ultimate secret

234
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,239
{\an1}is waiting there, it's
simply too dangerous.

235
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:26,506
Just forget it.

236
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,209
{\an1}-No way am I going to give up.

237
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:30,176
{\an1}I'm going to find it and
win the final rounds.

238
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,112
{\an1}You just watch me.

239
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:35,015
{\an1}--[laughing] Now that's
what youth is for.

240
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,049
{\an1}Go do your best, Naruto.

241
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:40,019
{\an1}Do it for Lee while
he's recovering.

242
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,420
-Interesting.

243
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,288
{\an1}I gotta tell Shikamaru.

244
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:45,257
{\an1}All right, let's do this.

245
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,658
{\an1}Honey Honey Grounds,
here I come.

246
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,159
-Naruto!

247
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:52,463
{\an1}-Oh, hey, Sakura.

248
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:55,066
{\an1}-You get back to the
hospital right now, mister.

249
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,833
{\an1}You need to rest up
for the final rounds

250
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,235
{\an1}tomorrow, remember?

251
00:12:58,268 --> 00:12:59,903
{\an1}-Sakura, please, let me go.

252
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,671
{\an1}I have a really good
reason for doing this, OK?

253
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:03,173
-Huh?

254
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,543
-Shikamaru, you
do have some kind

255
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,945
{\an1}of plan for the final
rounds, don't you?

256
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,213
-Yeah, I guess.

257
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,048
-You guess?

258
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,815
{\an1}How can you be so nonchalant?

259
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:16,385
{\an1}-Because we only have to
battle one more person,

260
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,021
{\an1}and I don't really feel
up to avenging Choji.

261
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:22,689
-Hm.

262
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:26,960
{\an1}-Hey, I just heard
something you have to hear.

263
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:27,495
-Huh?

264
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:28,429
-Oh yeah?

265
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:36,602
{\an1}-I don't get it, why are you
coming along again, Sakura?

266
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,937
{\an1}-Just let me see that.

267
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,407
{\an1}-There might be a fierce, scary,
ugly monster there, you know.

268
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,875
{\an1}-There's no way I'd let
you go to a place like that

269
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:44,576
all by yourself.

270
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:45,545
{\an1}You're barely recovered.

271
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:48,146
{\an1}I am on Team 7 too, right?

272
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,681
{\an1}-You're the best, Sakura.

273
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:53,084
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): If I give
this fourth Hokage's legacy

274
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:57,088
{\an1}to Sasuke as a gift,
he'll like me for sure.

275
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:57,922
Ah.

276
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:00,657
{\an1}It's like a fairytale come true.

277
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,625
{\an1}-How far are these
Gummy Gummy Grounds?

278
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,595
-They're just a
little ways up ahead.

279
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,864
-Those guys.

280
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,567
{\an1}It's the final rounds
and they're leaving?

281
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,168
{\an1}Could their mission
really be that important?

282
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:15,838
-15 of us Hidden
Rain ninja came here,

283
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,007
{\an1}and not a single one of us
made it through to round two.

284
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,210
{\an1}-We just can't return to the
village in disgrace like this.

285
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,011
{\an1}-All right, let's go.

286
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,514
{\an1}We'll take the prize they're
after and bring it home.

287
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,786
{\an1}-This is Honey Gummy Grounds?

288
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:36,889
{\an1}-Boy, this place feels
awfully dangerous.

289
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:38,158
{\an1}-Hey, don't worry.

290
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,659
{\an1}I'm going to be Hokage one
day, so whatever happens,

291
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,161
I'll handle it.

292
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,830
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
That's why I'm worried.

293
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:45,763
{\an1}-All right, let's go.

294
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:46,698
-No, wait!

295
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,567
Naruto.

296
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,100
-Ahhhh!

297
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,773
{\an1}-Ah, I knew something
like this would happen.

298
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,344
{\an1}Wow, this is sad and
painful to watch.

299
00:14:59,377 --> 00:14:59,843
-Huh?

300
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:04,881
-Ino.

301
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:05,815
-What?

302
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,417
{\an1}How'd you guys get
past the fence?

303
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:09,586
-Over there.

304
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,086
-Oh.

305
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:15,291
{\an1}-What are you even doing here?

306
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:18,628
{\an1}Like we'd ever let Team 7 keep
the fourth Hokage's legacy

307
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,028
{\an1}all to themselves.

308
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,930
{\an1}-I have no idea what you mean.

309
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,465
{\an1}-Don't act like you don't know.

310
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:24,765
{\an1}We heard all about it.

311
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,834
{\an1}-Damn her sharp ears.

312
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:27,602
-Huh?

313
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,570
Whatever.

314
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,304
Shikamaru and
Naruto will face off

315
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,805
{\an1}in the final rounds of the exam.

316
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,008
{\an1}That means it's kind of like
round two for us as well.

317
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,210
{\an1}get ready to lose,
Billboard Brow.

318
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:40,947
{\an1}-Bring it on, and I'll make sure
to crush you this time Ino Pig.

319
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,182
-Listen up.

320
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:44,417
{\an1}You're going to be in tears
when this is all over.

321
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,386
{\an1}-Don't bother buying any hats
'cuz your head's gonna roll.

322
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,820
{\an1}-Oh, yeah, Billboard Brow?

323
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:49,922
-Yeah, Ino Pig.

324
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:56,260
{\an1}-If there's a secret technique
that will win the Chunin exam,

325
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:58,596
{\an1}Shikamaru should have
a shot at it too.

326
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:59,130
-All right.

327
00:15:59,163 --> 00:15:59,997
It's a race.

328
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:02,066
{\an1}And we won't lose to Team 10.

329
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:02,933
{\an1}Let's go, Sakura.

330
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,106
{\an1}-I bit you welcome, my young
adventurous challengers.

331
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:13,976
ALL: Guy Sensei?

332
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,812
{\an1}-I am the mighty sage who
oversees these perilous

333
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,314
{\an1}Honegami Grounds.

334
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:19,615
-No way!

335
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,783
{\an1}You're really a real sage?

336
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,352
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): How could
he possibly fall for that.

337
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:25,887
INO (VOICEOVER):
His wig is lopsided.

338
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,488
{\an1}SHIKAMURA (VOICEOVER):
Guy Sensei.

339
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:30,592
{\an1}-This place is an
enclosed training ground

340
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,192
{\an1}forbidden to outsiders.

341
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:35,195
{\an1}If you can get through it faster
than the fourth Hokage's record

342
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,664
{\an1}time, then you will
obtain the secret.

343
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:38,966
-What?

344
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,701
{\an1}We have to beat the record
that the fourth Hokage set?

345
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,570
-Come on, that's
asking too much.

346
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,738
{\an1}-But wise old sage, isn't
there an easier way for us

347
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,207
to do this?

348
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,643
{\an1}-This is more difficult
than an S ranked mission,

349
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,511
{\an1}and you must be willing
to risk your life

350
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:57,048
{\an1}or it will be impossible
for you to succeed.

351
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,016
Damn it!

352
00:16:58,049 --> 00:16:59,618
Why would the
Tiger scroll, which

353
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,720
{\an1}contains things to get
passed all the obstacles

354
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:02,953
be right here?

355
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,556
{\an1}-And it's all mine.

356
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,991
{\an1}-Shadow position jutsu.

357
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,627
{\an1}-Naruto, stay back.

358
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,529
{\an1}-Face it, you wouldn't
understand it anyway.

359
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:13,830
-Got it.

360
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,898
-See ya.

361
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,066
-Urr.

362
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,766
Hurry, Naruto.

363
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,334
Come on.

364
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,234
Let's get going.

365
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:20,168
-Right.

366
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:22,137
{\an1}Would you get it together?

367
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,838
-Ow.

368
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,840
All right.

369
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:29,411
-Now, go, young
challengers, and good luck.

370
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:32,613
{\an1}-OK, the first obstacle
should be up ahead just a bit.

371
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,654
{\an1}-This has got to be
it, don't you think?

372
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,788
{\an1}-They sure underestimated us.

373
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,157
{\an1}NARUTO: Hey Hold up!

374
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,592
{\an1}-Come on, let's go.

375
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:51,130
{\an1}-It says giant tightrope.

376
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,431
{\an1}Hey, hang on a minute, guys.

377
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:53,999
{\an1}-I'm not stopping.

378
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,134
{\an1}-You're not getting away, Ino.

379
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,836
{\an1}-Ew, without Sasuke,
Team 7s no competition.

380
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,907
{\an1}-What's going on?

381
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,143
{\an1}-This isn't good.

382
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:06,109
-I can't move.

383
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,781
{\an1}-Shikamaru, what's
the deal here?

384
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,350
{\an1}-It says giant spider tightrope.

385
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:13,849
ALL: Ahhh!

386
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,622
{\an1}SAKURA: It's coming this way.

387
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,023
CHOJI: And we're
stuck to this thing.

388
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,224
{\an1}-What are we going to do?

389
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:24,560
{\an1}-I'm not letting some
big old spider get me.

390
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,665
{\an1}INO: Ah, now it's
coming towards us.

391
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,933
{\an1}-Naruto, sheath your kunai.

392
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:33,768
-No way!

393
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,002
{\an1}You've got to be kidding.

394
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:37,538
{\an1}-Put it away fast or you'll
end up as spider food.

395
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:38,605
{\an1}-All right, already.

396
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:46,412
{\an1}-Wow, it's as if he can't
even see us anymore.

397
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:47,947
{\an1}-What is going on?

398
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,216
{\an1}-The Tiger scroll
says, close the blade

399
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:52,385
{\an1}and then you shall
calm the heart.

400
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,852
{\an1}-And what does that mean?

401
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:57,022
{\an1}-I think the tremors on
the web alerted the spider

402
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,091
{\an1}that some prey had been caught.

403
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:01,326
{\an1}By staying still we
can fool the spider

404
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,928
{\an1}into thinking it was just
a fallen leaf or something.

405
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,863
{\an1}-But our feet are
still glued to the web,

406
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,398
{\an1}so we can't really move.

407
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:08,599
{\an1}-Yeah, we're stuck.

408
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,734
-Listen.

409
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,901
{\an1}There are two distinct
types of spider silk.

410
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,739
{\an1}The web thread is sticky
and used for capturing prey.

411
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:18,341
{\an1}And the warp thread isn't sticky
and it's used for crossing.

412
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,176
{\an1}Walk on the warp tread
and you won't get stuck.

413
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,847
{\an1}-That means this one
would be OK, right?

414
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,147
Hey, look.

415
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,849
It works.

416
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,484
{\an1}-All right, let me try.

417
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,689
I can walk.

418
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,423
{\an1}-Thanks a lot, Shikamaru.

419
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,225
-Yeah, thanks.

420
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:39,527
{\an1}Hold on, this isn'y
going to work after all.

421
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,728
Let's see.

422
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,963
{\an1}Move from warp thread
to warp thread.

423
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:44,030
-You idiot!

424
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:44,998
{\an1}What are you doing?

425
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,700
-Taking care of
this thing in case

426
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,102
{\an1}it attacks before we're
all the way across.

427
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,605
{\an1}Shadow clone jutsu.

428
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,473
{\an1}Na-ru-to U-zu-maki barrage.

429
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,011
-A summoning?

430
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:03,014
{\an1}So someone purposely brought
that giant spider here.

431
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:06,484
-We did it.

432
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:08,753
{\an1}-Hey, help me out
here, would you, guys?

433
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,487
{\an1}-What's he doing now?

434
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:10,988
-Ugh.

435
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:16,593
-Shikamaru.

436
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:19,730
{\an1}-Just watch out for the
web thread, all right?

437
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,765
{\an1}-Thanks, you saved me.

438
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,833
{\an1}-It looks like this
Tiger scroll has

439
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,701
{\an1}hints on how to get
through every single one

440
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:28,538
{\an1}of the obstacles that
we'll encounter in here.

441
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,539
{\an1}-What exactly does it say?

442
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:33,642
{\an1}-Close the blade, and then
you shall calm the heart.

443
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:35,210
{\an1}Offer a wild flower.

444
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,746
{\an1}Be very nimble and
show determination.

445
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,414
{\an1}Go beyond hatred for
the one who approaches

446
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,016
{\an1}the path will not open.

447
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:45,920
{\an1}The location of infinity
falls to the anointed one.

448
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:46,953
-Huh?

449
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,155
{\an1}-But what does all that mean?

450
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,391
{\an1}-Is it like a poem or something?

451
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,992
{\an1}-The first two lines were hints
about crossing the giant spider

452
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:57,931
{\an1}web, but as for the
others, I have no idea.

453
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,732
{\an1}-Well, I know that the giant
spider was summoned here,

454
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:03,100
{\an1}meaning it was an
intentional trap.

455
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:06,204
{\an1}-That must mean they're going
to be even more traps from here

456
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:06,772
on out.

457
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,406
-I guess, yeah.

458
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,240
-Oh man.

459
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:10,408
What a pain.

460
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:13,210
{\an1}-You're the one that
wanted to come, hot head.

461
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,445
-Sitting around
thinking is pointless.

462

-Naruto!

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:17,782
{\an1}-There he goes again.

464
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:20,584
{\an1}-We just have to go find

[theme music]

467
00:22:57,236 --> 00:23:00,506
{\an1}SAKURA: Ah, we almost died
because Naruto is so reckless.

468
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,473
-No kidding.

469
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,409
{\an1}What's he going to
go to top himself.

00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,412
INO: Why?

00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:08,581
{\an1}What are you up to, Shikamaru?

{\an1}SHIKAMURA: There's
something I have to do.

Just go on.

476
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,918
{\an1}I thought you were
in a big hurry?

477
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:16,286
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time
on Naruto Shippuden,

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,660
