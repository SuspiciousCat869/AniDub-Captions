-No human could do that.

00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,502
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Sai.

4
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:41,871
What are you up to?

5
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,378
-Copy that.

6
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:47,714
Continue observation only.

7
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,641
-Hey!

8
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,241
Sakura!

00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:22,271
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
That creature is Naruto?

11
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,782
-Naruto!

12
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:49,784
-Oh no.

13
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:01,571
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): Even my
snake sword can't pierce him.

14
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:04,309
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): This must be
what Master Jiraiya was talking

15
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,679
about when he said a smaller
version of the Nine Tails.

-This isn't so much a battle
between ninja anymore.

18
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,934
It's some kind of epic
battle between two monsters.

19
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,480
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

20
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,383
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's pointless to keep

21
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,354
using my snake sword
when it has no effect.

22
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,567
SAI (VOICEOVER): What's
going on out there?

23
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,436
Is Naruto even still alive?

24
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,400
-Well, well.

25
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,802
Look at that.

26
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:50,387
I can't believe he'd go
this far, becoming that just

27
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,289
to save Sasuke.

28
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:57,699
-Don't you worry one bit.

29
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,669
I'm gonna bring Sasuke back!

30
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:02,941
I promise that on
my life, Sakura.

31
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05,445
I haven't given up.

32
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,514
Listen.

33
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,417
I swear I'm still
gonna keep my promise.

34

If I say I'm gonna do
it, that means I will, K?

Don't forget.

36
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:18,967
My way of the shinobi means I
always stand behind what I say.

37
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,639
-Now the boy is gone and
only the monster remains.

38
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,454
What a pitiful child.

39
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:30,922
-Sakura, come back!

40
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,531
You have to stay away from him!

-Naruto!

42
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,380
Naruto, stop!

43
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,915
It's OK.

44
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,751
I can rescue Sasuke!

45
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:52,123
I'm begging you to
stop this right now!

46
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:52,859
Please!

47
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,126
Naruto, please stop!

48
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:03,524
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): No.

49
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:40,505
SAI (VOICEOVER):
What is he up to now?

50
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:20,772
Now's my chance.

51
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:44,712
-Seems like the time
has finally come.

52
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:48,686
As I predicted, this
body is starting

53
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,922
to show signs of rejection.

54
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:53,694
Unfortunately,
play time is over.

55
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:02,575
Patience.

56
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:05,547
I must be patient.

57
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,047
After all.

58
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,018
I still have Sasuke.

59
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,071
-Aw, what a shame.

60
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,146
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Damn!

61
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,515
It was too late.

62
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:52,559
-Don't hurt them.

63
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,328
-You misunderstand.

64
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:59,137
I no longer intend
to hurt any of you.

65
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,843
In fact, it's
quite the opposite.

66
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:03,745
-What are you saying?

67
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,808
-I'm saying you and I
share a common enemy.

68
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:34,797
The Akatsuki are in the
way, and if we let you live,

69
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,602
I'm hoping you can get rid of at
least one more Akatsuki member

70
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:39,871
for us.

71
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:41,207
So there you have it.

72
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,691
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

73
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,591
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Her
wo0unds are taking longer

74
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:14,129
to heal than I thought,
but I can't stick

75
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,132
around playing
volunteer much longer.

76
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,713
Lord Orochimaru must
be near his limit.

77
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:30,089
-OK.

78
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:31,358
I've helped you.

79
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:34,063
In exchange, get as many
Akatsuki as you can.

80
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:41,340
And as for that teammate
of yours over there,

81
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,312
well, I trust you
can take care of it.

KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
It's time for me to go.

00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,044
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
I've gotta do it now.

84

-I'm an envoy from Danzo.

85
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,949
I'm not your enemy.

86
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,820
And on his behalf, I'd
like a word with you.

-Danzo, huh?

That senile geezer's
still alive?

00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:11,400
And still up to his old tricks?

94
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:15,807
So, what do you
want to talk about?

95
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:20,114
-I come bearing a message from
Danzo to be delivered to you.

96
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:20,849
He says--

97
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,819
OROCHIMARU: Hold it.

98
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,124
When you speak to me, I
suggest you choose your words

99
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:26,615
carefully.

100
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,196
Or else, you'll die.

101
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:38,201
-But sir, I am only
allowed to really exactly

102
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,070
as Danzo has instructed me.

103
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:44,077
If the message meets with your
displeasure, by all means,

104
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,013
do what you will.

107
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:03,711
Will you teach me the
jutsu you just used?

108
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,247
YAMATO: I'm sorry.

109

SAKURA: Why?

110
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,619
YAMATO: I'm the only one in the
Leaf who can use that jutsu,

111
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:11,056
and only because I carry
the first Hokage's DNA.

112
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,492
SAKURA: It's always like this.

113
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:15,264
The only stuff I can ever do for
Naruto are these little things.

114
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:17,233
YAMATO: It doesn't matter
whether the things you

115
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,569
do for him are great or small.

116
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:21,474
What matters is how much
you care about Naruto.

117
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,576
SAKURA: Huh?

118
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:23,711
YAMATO: I've seen it, Sakura.

119
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:25,714
I know just how much you--

120
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:28,386

Secret of the Battle.

Subject file, Sai.

124

Sai is the mysterious rookie
who was assigned to Team Kakashi

125
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:53,293
to replace Sasuke,
who left the village.

126
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:56,065
He's a talented artist
and has the power

127
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:59,103
to make his pictures come to
life with his Ninja Art, Super

Beast Scroll Jutsu.

129
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:04,379
He has no emotion, and due
to his lack of awareness

130
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,248
in social situations,
he frequently

131
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:09,087
makes insensitive remarks.

132
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,124
Apparently, Sai comes
from the organization

133
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,760
known as the Foundation.

134
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:15,163
The Foundation is a
separate training division

135
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,366
within the ANBU.

136
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,803
It was created by Danzo,
head of the Hawk faction,

137
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,740
who clashed with
the Third Hokage

138
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,711
over who should become
the leader of the Leaf.

139
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,111
At this point,
everything we know

140
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:29,047
suggests that Sai is
actually on a secret mission

141
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:31,183
he received from Danzo.

142
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:35,253
However, as long as
I'm still breathing,

143
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:38,190
I'll never let him
get away with it.
