1
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,030
{\an1}-I'm not done yet.

2
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:52,797
-Over here!

3
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,788
{\an1}NAGATO: Fate had led
us right to them.

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,827
{\an1}JIRAIYA: What do you want?

5
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:26,669
{\an1}NAGATO: We finally found him.

6
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,303
Jiraiya-sensei.

7
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:30,838
-Huh?

8
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,849
-Damn, enemies.

9
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,253
YAHIKO: Run now.
get out of here!

10
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,221
{\an1}KONAN: Nagato, go!

11
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:54,533
{\an1}NAGATO: But I couldn't
truly accept a Hidden Leaf

12
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,101
{\an1}ninja as a teacher.

13
00:01:57,134 --> 00:02:01,506
{\an1}I'm sure that you know what
that's like, don't you?

14
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:10,016
[theme music]

15
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,798
Please, will you
teach us ninjutsu?

16
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:58,001
{\an1}You're all ninja from the
Hidden Leaf, aren't you?

17
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,303
{\an1}KONAN: Thank you all.

18
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,472
This is for you.

19
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,108
{\an1}-These kids-- shall I kill them?

20
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:10,548
{\an1}We've seen so many war orphans.

21
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:11,916
{\an1}It's always so pitiful.

22
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,885
{\an1}They'd be better off if
we simply put them out

23
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,554
{\an1}of their misery right now.

24
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,723
{\an1}-Enough, Orochimaru.

25
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,459
{\an1}You go on ahead with
Tsunade for now.

26
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,130
{\an1}I'm gonna stay here and look
after these three for a while.

27
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,931
-What?

28
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,936
{\an1}-It's the least I can do
after what they've suffered.

29
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,575
{\an1}NAGATO: My parents were killed
by ninja of the Hidden Leaf.

30
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,943
{\an1}ALL: Thank you for the food!

31
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,346
-Instant grilled
fish, thanks to--

32
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,282
{\an1}NAGATO: But I started to
realize that Jiraiya-sensei

33
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,117
{\an1}might be different.

34
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,788
{\an1}-Hey, I think I've gotten
the hang of fishing, sensei.

35
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,889
JIRAIYA: Oh!

36
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,825
{\an1}You're becoming more
promising all the time.

37
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:56,800
{\an1}-The four of us began living
under the same roof together.

38
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,303
{\an1}Soon after, a certain
incident took place.

39
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:01,505
-Incident?

40
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,040
[slap]

41
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,108
-Yahiko!

42
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:08,078
{\an1}NAGATO: A renegade
shinobi attacked us.

43
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:10,948
When Yahiko was
almost killed, that's

44
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,585
{\an1}when I struck out and
killed that ninja, instead.

45
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,964
{\an1}I did it without even realizing.

46
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:32,539
{\an1}-You all right, Yahiko?

47
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,239
Talk to me.

48
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,415
{\an1}NAGATO: It seems I had a
special power inside me.

49
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,221
The visual jutsu
known as the Rinnegan.

50
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:51,527
{\an1}After that, Jiraiya-sensei was
no longer hesitant to train us,

51
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,264
{\an1}and began to teach us ninjutsu.

52
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:57,366
He said that he
just wanted us to be

53
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,870
{\an1}able to protect ourselves.

54
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:02,706
But in terms of
me specifically, I

55
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,708
{\an1}feel he wanted to
help me control

56
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:07,177
{\an1}the power of the Rinnegan.

57
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,546
{\an1}But I feared my own power.

58
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,148
Hate had caused
me to go berserk.

59
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,921
{\an1}I didn't know who might get
hurt if it happened again.

60
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,356
{\an1}I convinced myself
that what I had done

61
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,261
{\an1}was wrong, and became
consumed with guilt.

62
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:25,899
{\an1}But sensei pulled me from
the depths of despair.

63
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,867
{\an1}-Is it that incident?

64
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:38,211
{\an1}-That day, when that
ninja hurt Yahiko,

65
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:41,882
{\an1}I was just so angry at him.

66
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,151
Everything went
blank in my head.

67
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:46,353
{\an1}I didn't know what I was doing.

68
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:50,659
{\an1}And before I realized
it, the guy was dead.

69
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,861
{\an1}After that, I just
became so frightened.

70
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:06,075
{\an1}That hatred, it made me go
completely blind with rage,

71
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,979
{\an1}and I killed somebody
because of it.

72
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,847
{\an1}I know that it was wrong.

73
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,782
It was wrong!

74
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:14,618
-Nagato.

75
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,020
I don't know.

76
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:19,490
{\an1}I can't really say whether what
you did was right or was wrong.

77
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:23,561
{\an1}But, thanks to your actions,
Yahiko is still alive now.

78
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:26,564
{\an1}You saved your friend's life.

79
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:31,770
{\an1}I believe that's always
the right thing to do.

80
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,672
{\an1}No one can fault you
for helping a friend.

81
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:40,046
{\an1}NAGATO: Before I realized
it, I'd accepted Sensei.

82
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,953
{\an1}-Once you've been hurt, you
learn what it is to hate.

83
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,188
{\an1}But if you hurt another,
you become hated

84
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:51,425
and you shoulder
a sense of guilt.

85
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,063
{\an1}-However, it's because
one understands

86
00:07:55,097 --> 00:08:00,402
{\an1}pain such as that that one
becomes generous toward others.

87
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:04,640
{\an1}Experiencing pain helps
us to grow up, to mature.

88
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,976
{\an1}And growing up means
that one becomes

89
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,480
{\an1}able to think for one's self
and make one's own decisions.

90
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:13,216
To know and to
reflect upon pain,

91
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,886
{\an1}and then to come up
with one's own answer.

92
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,130
{\an1}Jiraiya-sensei seemed
to be asking himself

93
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:32,570
{\an1}the same question, but he hadn't
figured out a solution either.

94
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:37,510
{\an1}Just like you haven't been
able to provide any answers.

95
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:41,247
{\an1}Back then, I was able to come
up with an answer right away.

96
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:47,654
{\an1}-All I wanna do is protect
those two, no matter what kind

97
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,391
{\an1}of pain I may be forced
to endure for them.

98
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,659
-I understand.

99
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:56,764
{\an1}-Tell me, sensei, what are
you always thinking about?

100
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,701
{\an1}What has you so preoccupied?

101
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,971
{\an1}-There's so much war and
hatred in this world.

102
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,140
{\an1}Sometimes it seems like
they're the only things that

103
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:07,476
really exists.

104
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,646
{\an1}I wanna do something about it.

105
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,184
{\an1}And I'd really like to know
what the answer to finding

106
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,417
true peace is.

107
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:23,493
NAGATO: After we
trained for three years,

108
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:26,329
both my body and
soul grew stronger,

109
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:29,233
{\an1}and I felt as if I had matured.

110
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,869
{\an1}But Jiraiya-sensei's
words always

111
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:36,575
{\an1}kept echoing back to me
from somewhere deep inside.

112
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:41,047
{\an1}He told me that he wondered if
the solution to bringing peace

113
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,415
to the world lay
with my Rinnegan.

114
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:50,323
{\an1}-Once, a really long time ago,
people did nothing but battle.

115
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,761
{\an1}It was all just one,
big unending war.

116
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,097
{\an1}That era was even worse
than what we have now.

117
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:01,268
{\an1}Then, there came a day when
a mysterious monk appeared.

118
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,605
{\an1}The first to discover the
inner workings of chakra.

119
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,276
{\an1}And he tried to lead
the world toward peace.

120
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,645
{\an1}It is said he traveled
across the world,

121
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:13,983
teaching ninshu,
the shinobi creed.

122
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:19,189
{\an1}Time passed, and ninshu came
to be known as ninjutsu.

123
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:22,625
{\an1}Ninjutsu wasn't originally
about fighting power.

124
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:26,730
{\an1}It's a teaching intended to
guide people towards peace.

125
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:30,767
{\an1}That monk was known as
the Sage of the Six Paths.

126
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,370
{\an1}He was considered the
savior of the world.

127
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:36,474
And like you, he
possessed the Rinnegan.

128
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,848
{\an1}I am he who shall
bring peace and order.

129
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,118
{\an1}Those were said to
be the sage's words.

130
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:49,021
{\an1}I think he believed there would
come a time when people truly

131
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:53,293
{\an1}would understand one
another and live in harmony.

132
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:57,230
{\an1}Perhaps, Nagato, you're
actually the reincarnation

133
00:10:57,263 --> 00:11:00,567
{\an1}of the Sage of the Six Paths.

134
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,136
{\an1}I have the feeling
that your eyes

135
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,337
may realize the
hopes of that sage.

136
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:10,145
{\an1}NAGATO: Sensei entrusted
me with his quest,

137
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,446
{\an1}conferring his wish
for peace on me,

138
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,316
{\an1}and then left the three of us.

139
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,655
{\an1}We started gathering comrades.

140
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,593
{\an1}With Yahiko as our
leader, our organization

141
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:27,129
{\an1}quickly gained fame.

142
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:29,398
People approved
of our philosophy

143
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:32,135
{\an1}of trying to construct a
peace that was minimally

144
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,539
{\an1}based on military might.

145
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,609
{\an1}However, the world was caught
up in a war between the three

146
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,178
great nations.

147
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,615
{\an1}The Stone, Leaf, and Sand.

148
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,451
{\an1}Hanzo, the leader
of the Hidden Rain,

149
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:50,588
{\an1}heard rumors of our
organization and approached us.

150
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:55,027
{\an1}He could no longer
ignore our existence.

151
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,796
{\an1}He proposed to make us
a nexus in the effort

152
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,633
{\an1}to launch peace negotiations
between the three

153
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,968
great nations.

154
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:05,405
{\an1}Our power would be used to
illicit mutual agreement

155
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,307
{\an1}from all the parties.

156
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:13,614
We decided to
accept his proposal.

157
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:18,753
{\an1}But that decision would
lead us only to misfortune.

158
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:22,190
{\an1}We were naive children.

159
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:24,626
-Misfortune?

160
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,362
What happened to
you guys after that?

161
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,771
{\an1}-What happened is, Yahiko died.

162
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:35,271
-He died?

163
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:43,180
{\an1}-It was all merely a trap
that Hanzo had laid for us.

164
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,982
He was paranoid
that we were going

165
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:49,254
{\an1}to steal his power
over the Hidden Rain,

166
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,723
{\an1}and for that petty fear, Yahiko.

167
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,796
{\an1}The next day at the
rendezvous point

168
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,266
{\an1}where the negotiations
were to occur,

169
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,103
{\an1}Hanzo's subordinates and the
Hidden Leaf's ANBU Black Ops

170
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,604
{\an1}were already there.

171
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:07,840
{\an1}Hanzo had allied with
a man from the Hidden

172
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:11,812
Leaf named Danzo
to eradicate us.

173
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:15,615
{\an1}Danzo wanted to usurp
the seat of Hokage,

174
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:21,155
{\an1}while Hanzo wanted to protect
his own position of power.

175
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,626
{\an1}-Your organization has
become a nuisance to me.

176
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,700
{\an1}Yahiko, you're the
leader, so you must die.

177
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,703
Resist and I'll
kill her instead.

178
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,811
You.

179
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:42,979
Redhead.

180
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:46,317
{\an1}Use that to kill Yahiko.

181
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,454
{\an1}If you do, I'll spare
you and the girl.

182
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:51,489
-Don't, Nagato!

183
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:52,256
Forget about me.

184
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,859
{\an1}Just get away, both of you!

185
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:55,494
YAHIKO: Nagato.

186
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:00,799
Just kill me.

187
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:07,073
{\an1}-All I wanna do is
protect the two of them,

188
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,709
{\an1}no matter what kind of
pain I'm forced to endure.

189
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,150
-Nagato!

190
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:17,117
-Don't do it!

191
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:18,584
-Hurry up.

192
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:20,087
{\an1}Do you want this woman to die?

193
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:51,556
-Konan.

194
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,027
Yahi--

00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,413
{\an1}-You and Konan must
survive, no matter what.

196
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:21,988
{\an1}You are the savior
of this world.

197
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,725
{\an1}I know you can do it.

-Yahiko!

199

{\an1}-I have big dreams, and I'm
gonna make them come true.

200
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:49,085
-Kill him.

201

fighting doesn't stop,

202
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:58,595
{\an1}then I'll become a
god and make it stop!

{\an1}You escaped even while being
hit by my Fire Style Jutsu.

{\an1}You're no ordinary
brat, are you?

212
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:03,200
Those eyes.

-What?

What is that?

{\an1}I thought that I had grown up,

{\an1}It was the same as

I was wrong.

{\an1}I realized then that the
answer I had given Jiraiya

00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:55,389
{\an1}was worth nothing.

{\an1}I owed Yahiko my life.

{\an1}He gave me my dream.

237

{\an1}He was an irresistible
friend for whom

00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,738
{\an1}I would've given everything.

{\an1}Perhaps it's possible that in
that moment when Jiraiya chose
