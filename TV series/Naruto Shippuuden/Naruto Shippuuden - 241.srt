1
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:14,563
Kakashi.

2
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,368
The Kazekage thinks you should
be appointed as a troop
commander during the war.

3
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:20,107
Why me?

4
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,818
For one, because you took
part in the battle of
Kannabi Bridge during the
Third Great Ninja War.

5
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:31,229
It's very sad to say, but
there aren't many veterans
left from that war in any
of the five great nations.

6
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:34,368
This is also a direct
order from me.

7
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,041
Then I guess I can't
refuse, Lady Hokage.

8
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,345
However, I do
have one request.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,515
What is it?

10
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:43,086
One person can't
wage a war alone.

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,562
I need a good shinobi
to act as my right-hand
man and assist me.

12
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:52,071
Right. Well, is there
anyone that you can
trust implicitly?

13
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:55,410
A man who's presently on a
mission escorting Naruto.

14
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,147
You mean...?

15
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:58,818
Huh?

16
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,278
Turtle, turtle...

17
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:17,421
This is...

18
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,628
<i>...The ninja tortoise</i>
<i>Guy uses in emergencies!</i>

19
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,705
[retching]

20
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,780
Whew! Guess I'm past the
first stage, I hope.

21
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:32,351
Gyah.

22
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,921
Finally feeling
better now, Guy?

23
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,827
Huh? Ah, no,
not to worry!

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,666
These waves are
nothing to me!

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,535
[hurf]

26
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,008
He's been seasick the
whole trip and he still
puts on a tough act.

27
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,578
Who does he think
he's fooling?!

28
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,350
Anyway, since all
of us are here now,

29
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,959
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>We'll enter the Land of</i>
<i>Lightning's territory,</i>

30
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>after replenishing</i>
<i>our supplies on this</i>
<i>isolated island.</i>

31
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:00,107
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>We've turned the final corner.</i>
<i>Our goal's in sight.</i>

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,516
We can't be complacent.
The enemy will seek out
any chance to attack us.

33
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:06,219
[Guy]
But...

34
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:11,062
Since we're so close now,
we can call for backup from the
Allied Shinobi Forces, right?

35
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:14,803
You may be right, but
those reinforcements
could be disguised
enemies.

36
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:15,672
What?!

37
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:19,045
That's right.
We can't let
our guard down.

38
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:23,153
Even if it's someone we
know well, like Lady
Tsunade or Kakashi.

39
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,990
Tch, come on!

40
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:29,131
Surely we can identify
their chakra. We are
jonin, after all!

41
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:35,377
But I've heard a rumor there's a
transformation jutsu that can
copy and disguise chakra.

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,515
What?! Are you being serious?!

43
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,590
Hey!

44
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,763
Aaah! Eternal rival!

45
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,767
Ha ha ha ha!

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,802
[impact]

47
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:48,871
Ohh...

48
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,814
[shivers]

49
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,152
Well, knock on wood!

50
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:01,630
Also, I have to
emphasize that no one
can tell Naruto the real
purpose of this mission.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,734
I mean you, Guy!

52
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,103
Right. I got it!

53
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:09,946
This mission's a cover!
Hah! We're really here
to protect Naruto.

54
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,517
[yawn]

55
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:18,329
Uh, oh! Oh, man,
I'd better hurry!
[Guy being muffled]

56
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,367
[zip]

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,108
Mmhmf! mmmlmf! Mfflffmm!

00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:31,289
Hm?

62
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,195
What are you guys doing out
here this late at night?

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,898
Oh, I'm, uh...

64
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,704
I'm getting
a massage!

65
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,273
A massage?

66
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:44,148
That's right! We're
totally not keeping
a secret from yo--

67
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,317
Mmff!

68
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,555
Hey, wait a second here,
you guys aren't...

69
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:48,724
[gasp]

70
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:51,062
... hiding something really
delicious to eat from me?

71
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:53,299
Are you?! Huh!? Huh?!

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,468
[relieved sigh]

73
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,511
Don't worry, Naruto,
if we find something
delicious, we'll be
sure to share with you!

74
00:03:59,245 --> 00:03:59,880
Good night.

75
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,390
The three of us were just
discussing the schedule for
the remainder of our journey.

76
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,463
Oh, and, Guy?
Remember what we
talked about, okay?

77
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,503
Right! I got it!
And I'll take
first watch!

78
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,839
Hmm.

79
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:15,511
Something funny is
going on around here.

80
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:03,627
"Kakashi, My Eternal Rival"

81
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:07,434
you know, I can keep
watch by myself. Why
don't you get some sleep?

82
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:12,645
No, thanks.
I've had nothing to
do all day except sleep.
So now, I'm wide awake.

83
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,653
I wonder sometimes
what everyone in the
village is up to.

84
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:20,995
It's been such a long time
since I've seen Kakashi Sensei.

85
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,934
Huh? Ah!
Kakashi!

86
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:28,911
The man that they call,
the eternal rival of
the Leaf's Might Guy!

87
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:33,119
This is a good opportunity
to tell you about our
younger days together.

88
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,257
You really don't
have to tell me.

89
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,127
I remember it like
it was yesterday!

90
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,269
It was right around the
time that we became genin
that our rivalry began.

91
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,739
<i>Seriously!</i>
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to tell me!</i>

92
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:56,165
Move, you're in my light.

93
00:06:56,198 --> 00:07:01,275
Heh! People call me Might Guy,
the Blue Beast of the
Hidden Leaf Village!

94
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,580
You're one of the super
elite here, right?

95
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:06,787
You're Sakumo's son, known as
the White Fang of the Leaf!

96
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:08,657
What about it?

97
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:14,134
See, I have this bad habit:
whenever I see a guy with
tons of talent, I just
have to challenge him!

98
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:18,711
How about it? Let's go
lay our youth on the line
in hot-blooded battle!

99
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,815
Why, if I
don't have to?

100
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,990
You were born an elite,
whereas I made myself elite
through sheer effort!

101
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:28,631
It's a classic story!
We could have an
amazing rivalry!

102
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,102
Huh?

103
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,643
Your sense of humor
leaves me speechless.

104
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,112
Hey!

105
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,715
What about my challenge?

106
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:39,118
No, thanks.

107
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:45,196
Heh hah! But that
just makes me even
more determined!

108
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,739
'Cause once I've made up
my mind, I never back
down! That's my rule!

109
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,474
He hee!

110
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,948
I won't quit!
Just fight me!

111
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,331
[pee sound]

112
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,300
Yah!

113
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,805
Fiiight meee!

114
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:24,943
[gasp]

115
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,786
It's like
an acorn.

116
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,455
Dghgg!

117
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,493
Please,
fight me,
Kakashi!

118
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:35,564
I don't want to!

119
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:38,937
[relaxed sigh]

120
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,549
Fight me!

121
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,120
Seriously?

122
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:56,740
In the end, Kakashi
succumbed to the intensity
of my youthful determination
and agreed to fight me.

123
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,546
Hearing this makes
me feel bad for
Kakashi Sensei.

124
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:04,021
And that's the way we forged
the unbreakable bonds of our
eternal rivalry!

125
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,526
But, what kind of
fights did you guys
have, anyway?

126
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,903
We both gave it our all in
honest, intense battle, of
course! That's the only way!

127
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:16,546
<i>Although I must admit,</i>
<i>I'm reluctant to tell</i>
<i>him about some of them.</i>

128
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:21,890
Ulp!

129
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,138
Bow and arrow,
sickle and chain,
and now shuriken.

130
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:33,781
I've beaten you
in all of them.
You finally satisfied?

131
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:37,053
Not yet! So,
I challenge you
to spar with me!

132
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,936
There's no way I'll lose
to you in taijutsu!

133
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,207
Seems you finally have
something to brag about.

134
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,791
You're a true prodigy,
with skills inherited
from the White Fang!

135
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,795
But you're too
quick to run away!

136
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,603
What strength!

137
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,678
Leaf Hurricane!

138
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:06,847
Ah!

139
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,122
Ha! You're mine!

140
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:16,499
Ha ha ha ha!

141
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,138
I guess I overdid it
a little bit, huh?

142
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,678
Gaah! Substitution?!

143
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:25,416
Ghhhk!

144
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,989
Guuhh...

145
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,928
Heh. Have you
had enough yet?

146
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,803
From now on,
know your place.

147
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:36,907
[smack]

148
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,742
Huh?

149
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,182
Let go, trash!

150
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:46,526
No way. Not yet.
You can't go;
I'm not done challenging you.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,396
And I am not trash!

152
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,470
I've beaten you in
every challenge.

153
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,809
[sniffly sobs]

154
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,980
[exasperated sigh]

155
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:00,353
All right, then, what do
you want to try next?

156
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:03,392
Ah! Hah!

157
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,069
Here I come!

158
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,106
Bring it on!

159
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:14,448
Rock, Paper...Scissors! Go! Go!

160
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:20,059
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

161
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,798
<i>I can't tell him about</i>
<i>challenges like that one.</i>

162
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,903
<i>I'd never hear the end of it.</i>

163
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,973
[yawn]

164
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,280
You know, I think I'll try
to go to sleep, after all.

165
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:34,021
Oh, are you sure? I was just
about to get to the good part!

166
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:34,889
<i>[door shuts]</i>

167
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,593
Aw.

168
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:40,266
[yawn] Boy, I'm starting
to get sleepy too.

169
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:54,294
[snoring]

170
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,872
[Kakashi]
Hey! Guy! You there?

171
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,014
<i>Guy!</i>

172
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:05,985
Huh?

173
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,926
Did someone call my name?

174
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,030
<i>Over here, Guy!</i>

175
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:13,499
Hm?

176
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,248
Oh! It's you, Kakashi!

177
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,956
Hold on... What're you doing
way out here on the water?

178
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:26,893
Hnn!

179
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,464
Ow! No, it's not a dream.

180
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,400
Could it be?

181
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,807
But I've heard of a rumor that
there's a transformation jutsu,

182
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,815
that's able to both copy
and disguise chakra.

183
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:41,288
<i>Could this be what Yamato</i>
<i>was talking about?</i>

184
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:44,127
<i>Well, I won't allow</i>
<i>myself to be fooled!</i>

185
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:47,300
<i>I can't let the enemy</i>
<i>get close to Naruto!</i>

186
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,373
<i>What nerve to disguise</i>
<i>himself as my eternal rival!</i>

187
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:53,479
<i>I'll strip his faÃ§ade</i>
<i>off with my bare hands!</i>

188
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,383
All right!
Be right there!

189
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:03,867
Hey! You all right?
What happened out here?

190
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,478
Oh, so that's his
little game, is it?

191
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:14,354
Making it sound like
we sent some kind of
distress signal, and
he's come to help out.

192
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:18,362
Well, I won't be fooled as
easily as that, you imposter!

193
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:21,135
Sorry, what do you mean,
"Are you all right"?

194
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,207
Oh, well, you sent an
S. O. S. message, didn't you?

195
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,011
Mehhh!

196
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,418
Ha! What a fool, telling such
a bald-faced lie like that!

197
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:33,125
But attacking him out
of the blue would be
too impetuous.

198
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,733
I'll have to wait
for absolute proof
that he's a fake.

199
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,837
But how am I gonna
get that proof?

200
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:44,014
Is there anything that's
happened between Kakashi and
me an enemy wouldn't know?

201
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:45,483
Uhm...

202
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,320
Hmmm...

203
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,024
Ah!

204
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,963
I've got it! Of course!
That's perfect!

205
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,635
Oh, and by the way!

206
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,842
What are the stats in our
rivalry battles these days?

207
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,781
You know, our
win-loss record?

208
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:05,323
What? Guy, I don't think
that this is the time to
discuss something like that!

209
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,628
I knew it! He may
appear identical,

210
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:12,404
but he couldn't have delved
that deeply into our private
affairs to impersonate Kakashi.

211
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:17,313
I see. So what you're
saying is that you
really don't remember!

212
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:20,420
Well sure,
I remember,
it's just...

213
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:21,990
What? You can tell me?

214
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,860
Yeah. Of course.

215
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:25,463
[gulp]

216
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:29,739
The way it stands now,
I'm winning, 51-50.
Right?

217
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:33,446
Ah ha! That phony's just
given himself away!

218
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,686
But never mind that.
What was the reason
for the S. O. S.?

219
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,193
The reason is the
danger standing right
in front of me!

220
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:44,034
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

221
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,342
What are you doing?!

222
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:53,285
Of course you'd take on
Kakashi's speed along
with his appearance!

223
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,254
Hyah!

224
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:02,805
You can't escape my taijutsu,
no matter how much you try to
run.

225
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:06,713
You didn't call me here
just to continue our
rivalry, did you?

226
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:09,017
You are a pretty
good imitation.

227
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,788
But if you want to prove
you're the real thing,

228
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:15,163
then copy my taijutsu,
just like "Copy Ninja"
Kakashi would!

229
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,511
How do I know you're
the real Guy?

230
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,214
What? Are you
kidding me?!

231
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:29,257
The real Guy would know that
even with the Sharingan,
I can't copy everything!

232
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:34,267
That's just like an imposter:
to accuse me of being the fake
to throw me off the trail!

233
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:42,317
What's all the commotion
about out there?

234
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,858
Looks like Guy.
Must be him, I didn't
see him anywhere onboard.

235
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:49,498
This doesn't seem like
something trivial.
Let's go help him out!

236
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,199
Yeah!

237
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,579
What can I say to make
you believe that I'm me?

238
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,151
So you're just going to keep
denying the truth, huh?

239
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,253
Guy!

240
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:03,660
Oh, good; you two
are just in time!

241
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,664
Oh! It's Kakashi!

242
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:06,966
Hey, how's
it going?

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,039
Don't let him fool
you that easily!
He's tricky!

244
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,010
He's a fake posing
as Kakashi!

245
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,212
What?
What?

246
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,285
But just take a look
at him, he seems like
the real Kakashi!

247
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:19,057
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>Yeah. You are</i>
<i>Kakashi, right?</i>

248
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,063
Yes! But Guy won't let
me off the hook, here!

249
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:25,369
Don't be fooled!
It's just like
you said, Yamato!

250
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:29,277
He's even transformed
his chakra into an exact
copy of Kakashi's!

251
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,048
I have all the proof
that I'll ever need!

252
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:34,087
So the three of us should
move in and take him down!

253
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,657
Huh?

254
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,995
Hey! What are
you doing?!

255
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,736
Did you ever consider
that you might be
trapped inside an
enemy's genjutsu?

256
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,278
Or maybe that you're
still just not feeling
well from being seasick
for days on end.

257
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,817
Right? He's not
acting normal,
is he?

258
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,527
So you'd rather side with this
impostor than listen to me,
your friend and comrade?!

259
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,062
Ohhhh!

260
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:58,002
Of course! I see clearly now!

261
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,072
<i>All of you are fakes!</i>

262
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,141
[all]
D'agggghh!

263
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:03,045
He's really acting strange.

264
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:06,084
I'll just use my Wood
Style to restrain him.

265
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,489
Forget it. I won't let you.

266
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:13,132
Eight Inner Gates!
Sixth Gate of Joy, open!

267
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,506
This is bad! He's serious!
Dive as deep as you can!

268
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,411
Yoooooooo!

269
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,716
Asakujaku!

270
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:33,974
[panting]

271
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:37,848
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Just what proof do you have</i>
<i>that I'm an impostor, anyway?</i>

272
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:41,856
Irrefutable proof! From our
battles as eternal rivals!

273
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:46,164
There's no way the real
Kakashi would ever get our
win-loss record wrong!

274
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,239
But it's 51-50 in my favor,
I'm certain. There's no mistake.

275
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:56,184
Or maybe, you're just bitter
that I took the lead after I
defeated you in our last match.

276
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:57,521
What?

277
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:01,261
[crack]

278
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:14,622
So you must have been
spying on that battle then!

279
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,195
[sigh] I don't know
how else to say it:
I'm really me!

280
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:19,598
Ah ha ha ha ha!

281
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,403
You just can't stop
giving yourself away!

282
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:25,376
That match tied us!
Kakashi and I are
even at 50!

283
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:27,313
No, you're wrong.

284
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,516
Huh?

285
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,186
There was the sushi eating
contest after that.

286
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,090
Where I won right?

287
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,463
I'm so stuffed...

288
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,707
I... I forgot about that one!

289
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,343
D'ooogh!

290
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,149
You must've been
watching that
battle too!

291
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:46,953
Will you cut it out, Guy?

292
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,455
Yeah you almost
killed us!

293
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,833
Guy, if you really want,
I'll reveal your secret, the
one that only I would know.

294
00:18:53,867 --> 00:19:00,112
Interesting ploy, phony.
If you know of a secret
such as that, then I'd
like to hear it, too!

295
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:04,955
[Yamato]
What? Guy has such a fine
physique, but it's the
size of an acorn? Really?!

296
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:09,331
[Aoba]
That small? Maybe we
should call him the
"Little Beast" instead.

297
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:13,205
<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>It's not like that anymore!</i>
<i>I was just a kid!</i>

298
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:20,620
[Guy]
Sorry. I really was
convinced the enemy was
trying to infiltrate us.

299
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:23,593
But what are you doing
here anyway, Kakashi?

300
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:31,074
I already told you. You sent
your Ninja Tortoise to the Leaf
carrying an S. O. S. So I rushed
over here as fast as I could.

301
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:32,143
Huh?!
Huh?!

302
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:35,249
So back then, when
we thought something
whizzed past us.

303
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,955
Guy was sending out
his Ninja Tortoise!

304
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,892
What are you
talking about?

305
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:40,761
Ohh!

306
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:43,232
[heaving]

307
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:45,504
Ow!

308
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:48,475
Turtle!

309
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,477
Help me...

310
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,547
Turtle!

311
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,189
<i>Turtle!</i>

312
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:59,330
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Uh? Did you see that?</i>
<i>Did something just</i>
<i>fly past us?</i>

313
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,536
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>Yeah. I think so.</i>

314
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,240
Sorry about that,
you guys.

315
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:07,013
Then this
entire thing
was all your
doing, Guy?!

316
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:10,954
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
So, how are things
back in the village?

317
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,457
He's changing
the subject!

318
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:17,166
Well, things have gotten
a bit complicated.

319
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,636
Oh? What's wrong?

320
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,475
I'll contact you
again once it's
all decided.

321
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,278
Oh, okay.

322
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:29,157
Did you want to
check on Naruto
before you go?

323
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,729
I don't need to.
He has you with him.

324
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,735
Yeah. He sure does.

325
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:37,975
Guy!

326
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:38,810
Yeah?

327
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:44,421
If anything should ever
happen to me, you'd rush over
right away, wouldn't you?

328
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,830
You're damn right.
Never doubt that.

329
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,494
[yawn]

330
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:07,634
I could have sworn that
I heard Kakashi Sensei.

331
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:08,636
Huh?

332
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,274
You are hiding something
from me, aren't you?!

333
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,445
<i>And it's something</i>
<i>delicious, I bet!</i>

334
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,481
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>We're not!</i>

335
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,453
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Liars! Then why are you</i>
<i>huddled together like that?</i>

336
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,290
<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>We're gazing at stars!</i>

337
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:20,660
<i>[Aoba]</i>
<i>And acorns...</i>

338
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,334
<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>Heh, stars are a lot bigger</i>
<i>than they seem from afar!</i>

339
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:02,430
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Hey! Why are the Stone</i>
<i>and Mist fighting here?</i>

340
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:06,639
<i>[Kurotsuchi]</i>
<i>That's what I want to know!</i>
<i>These guys just attacked us</i>
<i>right out of the blue!</i>

341
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:10,880
<i>[Ganryu]</i>
<i>Move it, Leaf ninja!</i>
<i>If you interfere,</i>
<i>I'll kill you, too!</i>

342
00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:14,888
<i>[Chojuro]</i>
<i>This ends now, Ganryu!</i>
<i>It violates Lady</i>
<i>Mizukage's will.</i>

343
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:18,663
<i>Per her orders,</i>
<i>I'm going to</i>
<i>have to stop you!</i>

344
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:22,704
<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Naruto's Vow.</i>

345
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:24,775
<i>[Chojuro]</i>
<i>I mean, if I can.</i>
