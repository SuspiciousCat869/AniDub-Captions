What did you just do,

39
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:48,074
{\an5}(Hagoromo)
At the time, Ninshu did not yet
have a practical application for
fighting.

40
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:52,646
{\an1}My original intent for it was
to help bring souls together.

41
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,585
{\an1}We needed healthy bodies to
sustain wholesome spirits.

42
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:03,058
{\an1}But I didn't feel the need for
any martial arts training that
went beyond that goal.

43
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:11,535
{\an4}However... due to the
innovations that Indra
introduced... the course of
Ninshu was changed drastically.

{\an1}Elder brother! What'd
you just do, huh?!

47
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:28,087
{\an4}A while ago when I was infusing
chakra to release power, I
noticed that the formation of my
hands created differences.

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,526
{\an1}I think that you can invoke
different powers by how you
shape and combine your hands.

49
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,395
Wow, really?

50
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:37,832
{\an1}I call it a "sign,"

51
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,634
{\an1}and the manifestation of
the power is a "jutsu".

52
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:43,137
Sign and jutsu?

53
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,441
How cool! That's
awesome, Elder Brother!

54
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:54,250
{\an5}(Hagoromo)
I inherited powers from my
mother, Kaguya.  So I don't have
to weave signs to invoke jutsu.

55
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:59,556
{\an1}But that wasn't the case for my
pupils with whom I'd shared my
chakra.

56
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,262
{\an1}When Indra was merely ten years
old, he was inventing jutsu even
I couldn't do.

57
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:09,901
{\an1}He was one worthy of being
called the "Genius of Ninshu."

58
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:22,783
{\an1}The invention of invoking jutsu
by using hand signs changed the
foundation of people's lives.

59
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:29,791
{\an1}Eventually... it came to pass
that anyone who trained hard
enough was able to use jutsu.

60
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:34,095
{\an1}But... I was a foolish father.

61
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:38,802
{\an1}I didn't notice the powers of
darkness targeting Indra...

62
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:43,940
{\an1}...and I didn't see that they
were already beginning to make

{\an1}Yeah, I'm all right,
Elder Brother.

67
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,729
{\an1}When releasing chakra, you have
to be very careful.  Or you'll
get hurt badly.

68
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:07,434
{\an1}Plus, we possess more chakra
than most other people do.

00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:20,348
{\an1}Your invention has transformed
Ninshu an incredible amount.

71
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:25,755
{\an1}I know... Although, I don't know
if that's a good thing or not...

72
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,858
Why is that?

73
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,728
{\an1}Training used to be a much
more spiritual experience,

74
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,866
{\an1}but now it's become focused
on just honing the jutsu
themselves.

75
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,137
{\an4}In time, they could become
weapons, and that, in turn,
would create chaos throughout
the world.

frightening, my son.

{\an1}I didn't realize you'd
thought so deeply about it.

Yeah, well...

79

But then again, what
will be will be.

{\an1}No one can stop the
flow of time.

signs, then eventually, someone
else would have.

82
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:05,700
{\an4}If chakra is to become a weapon,
then we must simply train the
soul even harder to control that
chakra.

101
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:36,571
{\an4}Well, it appears that Master
Indra has gained great command
over the powers that you passed
on to him.

that be really

to bring it down, right?

{\an1}Yeah, so let's go!

130
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:13,783
{\an1}Look, what do you want?  Why do
you keep following me around?

131
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:19,923
{\an1}You will grow strong.  You have
the desire, potential, and
talent for Ninshu.

132
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:24,628
{\an1}However... You're still not
aware of your true power.

133
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:26,730
{\an1}My "true power...?"

134
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:30,502
{\an1}An even greater power lies
dormant inside you.

135
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:36,341
{\an1}But there is one condition
for awakening that power.
[chuckle]

136
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:41,047
{\an1}Listen, just who are you?  How
do you know all of this, anyway?

137
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:47,420
{\an1}It doesn't matter. But if you
do manage to awaken your true
power...

138
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:51,459
{\an1}...my wish will come
true one day...

139
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:59,735
{\an1}But never mind that.  We were
talking about awakening your
power, weren't we?

140
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:02,471
{\an1}Do you want to know how?

141
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:05,975
{\an1}It has nothing to do with
training, you know.

142
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,877
Hm.

143
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,648
{\an1}You must lose love...

144
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:13,185
{\an1}And what does that mean?

145
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:19,024
