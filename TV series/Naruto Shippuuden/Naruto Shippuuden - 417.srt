1
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,696
-Rin! Go!
-But, I-!

2
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,932
{\an1}You'll be in my way!

3
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,001
Earth Style!

4
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:04,105
Mud Wall!

5
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:11,548
They're gone!

6
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,584
[scream]

7
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,020
He was inside?!

8
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,363
Rin!

9
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,400
{\an1}I'll start treating him!

10
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:30,303
{\an1}What happened here?!

11
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,004
Minato Sensei!

12
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:33,273
Obito...

13
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:35,576
{\an1}Huh? Kakashi? Rin?

14
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,545
{\an1}How did I get here?!

15
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,048
{\an1}I'll explain later.
First, Kakashi...

16
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:41,916
{\an1}What's the situation?

17
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,989
{\an1}We escorted them to this point
safely, but, then, the other two

18
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,224
were traitors...

19
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,559
Two?

20
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:53,297
{\an1}Please, listen. I don't think
that I'm gonna make it.

21
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,972
{\an1}The contents of the
secret missive.

22
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,045
{\an1}We can't. We're not supposed
to see its contents.

23
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:08,449
It's okay.

24
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:12,086
{\an1}Please, just confirm that
it's the real one.

25
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:16,258
[gasp]

26
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,165
It's blank.
What's that mean?!

27
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,803
{\an1}My superior told me that there'd
be two secret missives,

28
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:30,807
{\an1}one for me to carry and
one for another teammate.

29
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,914
{\an1}But only one of the scrolls
would be the real one.

30
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,149
Why do that?!

31
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,286
{\an1}Because we'd received
intel that there

32
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,255
{\an1}might be a traitor hidden
somewhere among us.

33
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,558
So, then who has
the real one?

34
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:48,062
{\an1}If the traitor had it, he
wouldn't have attacked me.

35
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,431
Which means...

36
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:50,798
[gasp]

37
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,906
Him...

38
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,576
Kakashi, where's
the other guy?

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,512
{\an1}On the way, well, he...

40
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,815
{\an1}Please get the missive!

41
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,060
He's gone...

42
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:18,899
{\an1}Damn it, did they hear?

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,635
Kakashi.

44
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,672
{\an1}You didn't leave someone
behind to die, did you?

45
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:26,408
{\an1}All I did was prioritize
the mission.

46
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,844
{\an1}I just followed the rules.

47
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,245
Rules?!

48
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,751
{\an1}Those who don't follow the
rules are scum.

49
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:36,220
{\an1}But look what happened
because of the rules!

50
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,089
{\an1}If you hadn't turned your
back on your comrade,

51
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:39,758
{\an1}we wouldn't be in
this situation!

52
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,991
Stop, Obito!

53
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,463
{\an1}We couldn't have known
that this would happen.

54
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,066
{\an1}Kakashi's not to blame.

55
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,102
{\an1}Damn it! I'm leaving!

56
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,271
{\an1}Where're you going?!

57
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:53,808
{\an1}Isn't it obvious?! I'm
gonna go save that guy!

58
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,076
{\an1}But he's back where the
enemy attacked us!

59
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,546
{\an1}It isn't safe. He's right.

60
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,050
{\an1}I'm not about to fail at my
very first real mission!

61
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,054
{\an1}We haven't failed. We
couldn't foresee this!

62
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,092
{\an1}You know, for an honor
student, you're pretty

63
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,661
{\an1}dumb sometimes, Kakashi.

64
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:11,662
What?!

65
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,898
{\an1}Just think about it! The
four guys that we were

66
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,402
{\an1}supposed to guard
have all disappeared.

67
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,838
{\an1}So who's there to back us up
when we say that this wasn't

68
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:20,305
{\an1}part of some plan?

69
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,745
{\an1}If the village that
requested us for this

70
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,481
{\an1}mission pretends they don't
know about any traitors,

71
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,785
{\an1}Minato Sensei's gonna
take the blame!

72
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:32,521
{\an1}You don't have to worry
about me. Obito,

73
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:34,956
{\an1}our mission's finished.

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,492
{\an1}Listen, Sensei...

75
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:39,028
{\an1}You can drag me back to the
village as many times as you

76
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:43,066
{\an1}want, but I am still never gonna
give up searching for that guy.

77
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,936
{\an1}I don't turn my back on a
comrade!

78
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,273
Obito!

79
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,707
Damn it.

80
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,846
{\an1}I guess there's no point
in trying to stop you...

81
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,817
{\an1}So I'll go with you back
to where he fell.

82
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,519
{\an1}Kakashi, downstream.
And Obito, beyond that.

83
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,122
{\an1}Rin, you go search
with Kakashi.

84
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,524
Right!

85
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:05,928
{\an1}Good. Now, make sure
you send up a signal

86
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,429
{\an1}the minute you find him.

87
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,858
There he is!

88
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,530
We found him.

89
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,071
{\an1}Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

90
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,314
{\an1}<i>There are too many of them!</i>

91
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,027
{\an1}Lighting Style! Chidori!

92
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,701
You all right?!

93
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,038
{\an1}Rin, take care of him!

94
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,207
{\an1}Okay, I'm on it! Let's go.

95
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,377
Hold on!

96
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,979
The scroll!

97
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,521
Retreat!

98
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,626
{\an1}Obito! Rin! Guard him!

99
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,628
{\an1}And what about you?!

100
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:32,530
{\an1}I'm getting the scroll back!

101
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,533
{\an1}No, don't! There's too many!

102
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,701
{\an1}Quit complaining.

103
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,406
{\an1}Saving him may be your Ninja
Way, but my Ninja Way is

104
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,541
{\an1}completing my mission!

105
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:42,576
Kakashi!

106
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,645
{\an1}Obito, we gotta contact
Minato Sensei!

107
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,813
Right!

108
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:50,852
Obito!

109
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,023
[gasp]

110
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,431
{\an1}Bastard. You think you can
take us all on by yourself?

111
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,499
{\an1}I will complete my mission!

112
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:05,870
Kill him.

113
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,807
{\an1}Obito! You found him?

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,776
{\an1}Kakashi went after the
enemy to get the scroll!

115
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,144
He what?!

116
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,349
[gasp] I hope...

117
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:16,951
{\an1}...I make it in time!

118
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,428
{\an1}[chuckle] Come on!

119
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,570
{\an1}Quickly! Don't let
him get away!

120
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:44,282
{\an1}Rasen-Flash, Super-Circle
Dance Howl, Stage Three!

121
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:52,927
Minato Sensei.

122
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:59,902
{\an1}So, let me ask you
something. Were you able to

123
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,338
{\an1}uphold the principles
you believe in?

124
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:07,511
{\an1}This completes the mission
we were hired for.

125
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,151
Yes...

126
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,954
{\an1}I thank you. I owe you
all for saving my life.

127
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,995
{\an1}Well, Yellow Flash of the
Leaf. Hope we meet again.

128
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,597
All right, then.
Well, let's go.

129
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:33,176
{\an1}Sensei, missions really are
difficult, aren't they?

130
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,012
{\an1}You're right. Things don't
always go the way the way

131
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,547
{\an1}you think they will.

132
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,483
{\an1}But I'm glad the secret
missive was delivered safely.

133
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,251
Yeah...

134
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,322
We successfully
completed our mission!

135
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,891
Probably.

136
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,062
Why "probably?"
What does that mean?

137
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,230
{\an1}Back there, he said,

138
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:56,103
{\an1}"I thank you. I owe you all
for saving my life."

139
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,505
{\an1}If the mission were truly
successful, he'd be more

140
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:01,308
{\an1}concerned about the secret
missive than his life.

141
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,511
{\an1}I still don't understand
what you mean!

142
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,447
{\an1}The missive that he
had was a fake, too.

143
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,649
What?!

144
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:10,686
{\an1}We were probably just hired
as decoys. And another team

145
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,489
{\an1}delivered the real missive.

146
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:15,425
{\an1}That would explain why they
requested Minato Sensei for

147
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,194
{\an1}a C-rank mission.

148
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:20,297
{\an1}With a shinobi of Minato
Sensei's caliber as the

149
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:22,167
escort, it would
appear that we were

150
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,669
{\an1}actually guarding
the real thing.

151
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,372
When did you
figure that out?

152
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,110
{\an1}I thought it was a
possibility when we

153
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:32,311
{\an1}discovered that the first
missive was a fake.

154
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,047
{\an1}And you risked your life to
go after something that

155
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,184
{\an1}could've been nothing
but a phony?!

156
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:39,320
{\an1}That was the mission.
That's my way.

157
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,595
{\an1}I thought that I understood
at least a little about you.

158
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,366
{\an1}But I didn't understand
a thing...

159
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:55,373
{\an1}Then, finally, I understood
on our last mission.

160
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:08,088
{\an1}You know, Kakashi's father
is genius ninja Sakumo

161
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,325
{\an1}Hatake, feared as the "White
Fang of the Leaf".

162
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:14,563
{\an1}White Fang of the Leaf. You
know, come to think of it,

163
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,232
{\an1}I've heard of him before.

164
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:19,635
{\an1}But Kakashi never mentioned
a single word about that...

165
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,511
{\an1}The White Fang. A great man
that everyone looked up to,

166
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:28,780
{\an1}especially Kakashi.

167
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:32,885
{\an1}At least they did
until that incident.

168
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,587
Incident?

169
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,724
{\an1}Honestly, I'm not entirely
sure it's my place to tell

170
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,326
you the story.

171
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,862
{\an1}But, since you're Kakashi's
teammate, I believe that you

172
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,764
{\an1}should know about it.

173
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,201
{\an1}So, what happened, then?

174
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:49,638
{\an1}Kakashi's father, Sakumo,
took his own life after he

175
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,708
was vilified by
everyone around him.

176
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,277
What?!

177
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,349
{\an1}Five years ago, he led a
dangerous, top-secret

178
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:01,219
mission deep
behind enemy lines.

179
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,722
{\an1}It went bad, and he had one
of two choices: either

180
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:07,492
{\an1}save the mission or his
comrades.

181
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,396
{\an1}Of course, according to the
law of the village, you

182
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,165
{\an1}cannot abandon a mission.

183
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,702
{\an1}But to save the life of his
comrades, Kakashi's father

184
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,006
{\an1}put the mission on hold.

185
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,476
{\an1}However, a great deal of
damage resulted in the end.

186
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,178
{\an1}Both the Land of Fire and
his peers

187
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:24,980
{\an1}blamed him for everything.

188
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:27,850
{\an1}On top of all of that, even
the people he rescued turned

189
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:29,719
against him and
slandered him.

190
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:32,455
{\an1}The ordeal took its toll on
Sakumo, physically and

191
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:35,826
{\an1}mentally. Until, finally,
he took his own life.

192
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,539
{\an1}Since that day, Kakashi
refuses to utter a word

193
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,208
{\an1}about his father.

194
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:51,712
{\an1}He's devoted himself to the
laws and regulations of the
village.

195
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:01,190
{\an1}Obito, please try to
understand, even just a

196
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:05,494
{\an1}little. Kakashi really
does mean well.

197
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:16,542
{\an1}Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

198
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,430
[sharp yell]

199
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,530
[gasp]

200
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,971
We'll be taking
this one with us.

201
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:42,906
Wait!

202
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,811
No!

203
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,680
{\an1}Obito! Don't go after them!

204
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:54,488
What?!

205
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,592
{\an1}The two of us have to
complete the mission alone.

206
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,495
{\an1}Are you crazy?! Do you
have any idea what

207
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,363
{\an1}you're saying, Kakashi?!

208
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:03,831
Yes...

209
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,268
{\an1}We are shinobi...

210
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,705
{\an1}We must carry out our
mission even at the expense

211
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:12,443
of our comrades.
That's the law.

212
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,012
{\an1}How can you be so willing to
abandon someone who's been

213
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:16,680
through life and
death with you,

214
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,517
{\an1}just for another one
of your guesses?!

215
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,399
{\an1}You don't understand, Obito!

216
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:35,970
{\an1}You don't know what happens
to people who break the rules!

217
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,211
{\an1}I believe that the White
Fang was a true hero.

218
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,852
{\an1}You're right. In the Ninja
World, those who break the

219
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:52,190
{\an1}rules and laws are
regarded as scum.

220
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:56,195
{\an1}But, those who'd abandon
one of their friends...

221
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,399
{\an1}...are far worse than scum.

222
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,219
I found them!

223
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,303
{\an1}Kakashi?! Why did you?!

224
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:35,575
{\an1}I know that Silver hair and
that White Light Blade!

225
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:39,112
{\an1}Could it be?! The Silver
Fang of the Leaf?!

226
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:42,416
{\an1}This is a memento
from my father.

227
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,420
{\an1}Oh, I see. You're just the
White Fang's brat.

228
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:47,789
{\an1}Then there's nothing
to be nervous about.

229
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,795
Where is he?!

230
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,030
{\an1}Obito, behind you!

231
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:59,870
Ow! My eye!

232
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:02,474
Kakashi!

233
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,285
{\an1}A Shinobi shouldn't cry.
I'm not dead yet.

234
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:14,254
Stay focused.

235
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,823
{\an1}<i>I'm nothing but talk.</i>

236
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:19,861
{\an1}<i>Somebody always has to</i>
<i>come along and save me.</i>

237
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,497
<i>But...</i>

238
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,135
{\an1}<i>Those who would abandon one</i>
<i>of their friends are far</i>

239
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,803
<i>worse than scum.</i>

240
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:31,342
{\an1}<i>Those things I said, I'm</i>
<i>going to make sure they're</i>

241
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,010
{\an1}<i>more than just words.</i>

242
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:36,948
Die!

243
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:45,458
{\an1}But how?! There's no way
that you could've seen me!

244
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,395
{\an1}Obito! How did-?!

245
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,439
{\an1}Those eyes! What are-?

246
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,565
{\an1}This time, I'm gonna take point.
You'll be my backup, Kakashi.

247
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:22,703
{\an1}It's been a while since we
were a two-man squad.

248
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,272
{\an1}Don't stumble, Obito.

249
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,274
{\an1}Are you prepared?

250
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:29,344
{\an1}Yeah, I'm glad my final
op is with you.

251
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:32,180
Obito...

252
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:33,815
Kakashi.

253
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:38,555
{\an1}Obito, I'll have you return
to me everything I'd loaned

254
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:42,226
{\an1}you, especially my left eye.

255
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:43,762
{\an1}Are you worried?

256
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:47,365
{\an1}Madara, you once said only
with both together could the

257
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,369
Sharingan's true
power be unleashed.

258
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,738
And, so...

259
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:55,475
{\an1}You're wrong. Those are
Rinnegan, not just Sharingan.

260
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,877
You're wrong.

261
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,111
Hm?

262
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,249
{\an1}I'm talking about these eyes.

263
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,355
{\an1}Finally, we're all together!

264
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,956
{\an1}You're late again, Obito!

265
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,662
{\an1}A lot happened on my way
here, okay?! I mean, I got lost.

266
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:14,130
{\an1}How come every route you
take always seems to be the

267
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,267
{\an1}roundabout one, huh?

268
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,703
{\an1}Walk a straight line!

269
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:19,404
{\an1}I told you, a whole lot
of stuff happened

270
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:20,939
{\an1}to me along the way!

271
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,776
{\an1}A shinobi absolutely has
to follow the rules!

272
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,578
{\an1}Your carelessness is gonna
end up putting your

273
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:27,146
{\an1}comrades in serious danger!

274
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,916
{\an1}Then I'll just protect all
of you, okay?! Instead of

275
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:31,652
{\an1}following the rules!

276
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:32,821
Yeah, says you!

277
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,323
{\an1}My eyes speak louder than
words! Once my Sharingan are

278
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:37,192
{\an1}awakened, they won't be
silent!

279
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,795
{\an1}Your Sharingan won't amount
to anything! Besides,

280
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,098
{\an1}they're not awakened yet,
so just shut up, already!

281
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:45,569
{\an1}What?! You shut up, mister
hide-my-mouth-behind-a-mask!

282
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,938
{\an1}Obviously, you must babble
way too much yourself--

283
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,042
{\an1}They're not falling into
line at all, are they?

284
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,779
{\an1}That's for sure. But you
know, Sensei...

285
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:54,680
Huh?

286
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,315
{\an1}I challenge you, Kakashi!

287
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,151
{\an1}Not you again, Beast Face!
Just go away, already!

288
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:01,121
{\an1}[sigh] These are my
classmates?!

289
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:04,358
{\an1}<i>To bring Naruto back,</i>
<i>they need the Rinnegan</i>

290
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,293
{\an1}<i>and the Nine Tails.</i>

291
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,130
{\an1}<i>Obito has both, so as long</i>
<i>as I don't let him teleport</i>

292
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,433
{\an1}<i>to his time-space.</i>

293
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:14,771
{\an1}<i>And, I've already discovered</i>
<i>that my attacks are faster</i>

294
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,140
{\an1}<i>than their Kamui's</i>
<i>transfer speed.</i>

295
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,546
{\an1}<i>I bet that one of them will</i>
<i>try to distract me while the</i>

296
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,649
{\an1}<i>other one performs</i>
<i>the Kamui.</i>

297
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:29,154
{\an1}Either Obito will teleport
himself or he'll have

298
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,357
{\an1}Kakashi teleport him instead.

299
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,328
{\an1}This time, I'm gonna take point.

300
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,799
{\an1}You'll be my backup, Kakashi.

301
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:43,004
{\an1}<i>Whichever way they decide to</i>
<i>go, I'll be able to stop Obito</i>
<i>again.</i>

302
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,375
{\an1}Maybe use Limbo to speed
things up.

303
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:50,312
{\an1}No, I shouldn't use that
while Obito still has my

304
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,815
Rinnegan.

305
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:54,752
{\an1}Then, I'll just attack the
both of them simultaneously!

306
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,125
{\an1}But you know, Sensei...

307
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:02,127
[shocked gasp]

308
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,095
{\an1}You just let me handle this!

309
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,200
{\an1}I'll make them fall in line!
Let's go! Both of you!

310
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,737
[laughter]

311
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:13,207
Kamui!

312
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,611
Huh?

313
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:22,551
{\an1}<i>They performed Kamui</i>
<i>at the same time!</i>

314
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:25,689
{\an1}And doing so doubled the
speed of the jutsu!

315
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:28,692
Obito?!

316
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,460
Don't worry.

317
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,764
{\an1}I'm here to help Naruto.

318
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:35,701
{\an1}How can I trust you?

319
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,002
{\an1}Since I was young, I've
never been able to walk a

320
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,072
straight path.

321
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,709
{\an1}But I've finally gotten to
where I needed to go.

322
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:01,665
{\an1}You actually had perfect
timing, for once.

323
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:04,903
{\an1}I wanna thank you, Guy,
for saving Kakashi.

324
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:06,671
{\an1}You all right, Kakashi?!

325
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,143
{\an1}I've seen you before.

326
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,245
Hm?

327
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,581
Who is that?!

328
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,605
{\an1}You may be reinforcements,
but you're nothing more than

329
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:01,608
{\an1}pebbles. You won't make any
difference, now.

330
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,110
{\an1}That guy's Madara?!

331
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:06,547
{\an1}Only Sage Jutsu works against
him. Well, that as well as

332
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,817
{\an1}physical attacks,
such as Taijutsu.

333
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,220
{\an1}So, I guess, now, it's showtime
for the wild Blue Beast.

334
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:16,392
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Blue Beast

335
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,696
{\an1}vs Six Paths Madara"

336
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:23,168
{\an1}Eight Inner Gates! Seventh
Gate of Shock! Open!
