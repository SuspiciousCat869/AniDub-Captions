1
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:10,345
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): Asuma.

2
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:54,305
-No!

3
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,083
Asuma!

4
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:03,425
[theme music]

5
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,205
-Whoa!

6
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,275
Asuma!

7
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,385
-All done here.

8
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,255
How 'bout you?

9
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,395
-Just give me a minute.

10
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,395
-Damn you.

11
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,395
Damn you!

12
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:35,415
-You son of a-- you're
gonna pay for that!

13
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,245
-Heh.

14
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,295
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

15
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,355
It's no good.

16
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,265
I'm powerless.

17
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,225
Huh?

18
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,395
Feathers?

19
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,375
-Huh?

20
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:14,255
What's this?

21
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:21,335
Do you really think you can
beat me with a flock of crows?

22
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:22,435
What do you think I am?

23
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:29,335
-A pitiful attempt
at a diversion.

24
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,365
A black sword.

25
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,325
-Shikamaru.

26
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,435
We're here to help.

27
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:49,335
-Ino.

28
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,315
-Takes Shikamaru somewhere safe.

29
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:54,245
-Right.

30
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,325
-Don't let your
guard down, Choji.

31
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,205
-Got it.

32
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,285
-Reinforcements.

33
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:22,215
[coughing]

34
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,345
-Hey, are you all right?

35
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:24,315
-Yeah.

36
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,355
But forget about me.

37
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,285
What about--

38
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,982
-Asuma-sensei!

39
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,265
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's faint,

40
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,425
but his heart's still beating.

41
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:51,405
-Choji, you've got to rush
him to the Leaf hospital.

42
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,325
Ino, go with them and
use your medical jutsu

43
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,285
to buy as much time as you can.

44
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,295
Get going.

45
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,325
-We're on it.

46
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,275
-Yeah.

47
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,365
-Huh?

48
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,395
-I'm not giving up my bounty.

49
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:05,375
-Is that right?

50
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,395
-Take Asuma and get
out of here now.

51
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,415
We'll keep these two busy.

52
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,375
-You can fight it all you want.

53
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,225
You're still going to end up
as part of my sacred ritual.

54
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,275
And that's why-- hm?

55
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,355
Come on.

56
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,435
I only need a little
more time, sir.

57
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,255
We're just about to get
to the good part, here.

58
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,275
-We're sealing the Two Tails.

59
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,415
Return at once.

60
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,385
This is top priority.

61
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,225
-Please, sire, just
a few more minutes.

62
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,335
Is that really so much to ask?

63
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:10,255
KAKUZU: Enough, Hidan.

64
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:11,375
-Huh?

65
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:15,385
EBISU (VOICEOVER): Are they
communicating with somebody?

66
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:19,215
-We'll be back in no time--
so prepare yourselves.

67
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,395
-Huh.

68
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,395
What troublesome
fellows they are.

69
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:46,375
-Let's go, Hidan.

70
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,375
-That blasted leader of ours.

71
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,395
One of these days, I'll
put a curse on him.

72
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,295
GENMA (VOICEOVER):
They're retreating.

73
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,235
What kind of strategy is that?

74
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:57,395
-Sensei!

75
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,947
-Asuma-sensei!

76
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,375
-Ino! Choji!

77
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,425
Let's take Asuma
and go right now.

78
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,375
-Oh, no you don't.

79
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:07,285
You stay right where you
are until we get back.

80
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,395
You hear?

81
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:11,275
Besides, he's gonna die, anyway.

82
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,415
-Don't worry, we'll be
back before you know it.

83
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:23,415
-Choji! Ino!

84
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:24,395
Hurry up!

85
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,205
INO: I'll start
medical ninjutsu.

86
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,285
CHOJI: Right!

87
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,375
-No.

88
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,285
Don't.

89
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:30,365
-Huh?

90
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,415
-Listen, don't even
bother trying to heal me.

91
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:35,425
I wouldn't make it, anyway.

92
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,305
I-- I can feel it.

93
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:45,245
And I bet you three-- you
can feel it too, can't you?

94
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:46,275
-You shut up, OK?

95
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,415
Just keep quiet.

96
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,295
Ino!

97
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,434
-Right.

98
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,235
-Ino?

99
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,305
INO (VOICEOVER): Here.

100
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,315
And here, too?

101
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,425
Four vital spots.

102
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,325
It's too late.

103
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:39,255
-I think that I finally
understand now what

104
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,325
the Third Hokage meant.

105
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:49,245
I was always slow
figuring things out.

106
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:56,365
I've got-- [cough]
Ino, Choji, Shikamaru,

107
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,245
I've got something I
want to tell you three.

108
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,275
-Stop it, Sensei.

109
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,405
Just stop talking, will you?

110
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,325
-Choji.

111
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,325
You too, Ino.

112
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:20,395
Listen closely to Asuma-sensei's
words-- his last words to us.

113
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,295
-Ino.

114
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,373
-Yes?

115
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:33,405
-You're bossy, but you can also
be a compassionate caregiver.

116
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:43,365
Choji and Shikamaru, they're
both so awkward and clumsy.

117
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,305
Watch over them.

118
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,295
-Yes, sir.

119
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,265
-And make sure that you
don't ever lose to Sakura.

120
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,355
Not in ninjutsu, or in romance.

121
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:58,235
-I won't.

122
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:10,255
-And Choji, you're a thoughtful,
loyal friend and a kind soul.

123
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,225
In time, you'll become
a stronger shinobi

124
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:18,265
than anyone else, so be
more confident in yourself.

125
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,265
-Got it.

126
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,425
-And another thing.

127
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:24,375
You might consider
losing a few pounds.

128
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,305
-I don't know if it's
possible, but I'll try to.

129
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:36,275
-And finally, Shikamaru.

130
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,315
With your razor
sharp intellect, you

131
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:42,355
have the instincts
of a great shinobi.

132
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:46,425
You are truly worthy of becoming
Hokage, though you'll probably

133
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,275
try avoiding it.

134
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:51,435
[cough] Since you'd find
the job such a drag.

135
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:02,385
All those games of Shogi, and
not once could I beat you.

136
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:06,385
Which reminds me, remember
when we talked about the king?

137
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:17,215
-If I were picking pieces
to represent Leaf shinobi,

138
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,275
you know what?

139
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:21,365
I'd say you were
most like the knight.

140
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,295
-OK.

141
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:23,762
Which one are you?

142
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,113
-Me? Oh, I'm nothing.

143
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:27,553
I'm just--

144
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,215
-The sacrificial pawn, huh?

145
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:37,235
-Then do you know
which one the king is?

146
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,325
-Huh?

147
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:41,345
Uh-- well, the Hokage, right?

148
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,355
-Yeah.

149
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:45,325
That's what I used
to think, too.

150
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:47,355
But it's not the case.

151
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:51,285
-Then who is it?

152
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,315
-You'll know the answer
when the time comes.

153
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,295
Now I'm going to tell
you who the king is.

154
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:05,255
Lean closer.

155
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:24,375
-But Asuma-- so then
that's why you--

156
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,315
-I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.

157
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,225
I know I said I
quit, but I guess

158
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,225
it doesn't matter anymore now.

159
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,425
Could you get me
one last cigarette?

160
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,205
They're in my pouch.

161
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:01,425
[coughing]

162
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,345
-Oh.

163
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:04,265
I'm sorry about that.

164
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,345
I'm Asuma Sarutobi,
and starting now,

165
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm the leader of Squad 10.

166
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,355
I warn you, I'm
strict, so be prepared.

167
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,365
Now, don't start crying already.

168
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,355
So far all I've done is
barely even threaten you.

169
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,275
-It's the smoke.

170
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,275
It's stinging our eyes.

171
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:26,275
[crying]

172
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,375
WAITER: More rice over
here, and four more servings

173
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:34,315
of beef ribs!

174
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:40,435
Thank you for waiting.

175
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:41,315
-Woo-hoo!

176
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,215
-Slow down, Choji.

177
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:53,315
I wonder if you've ever heard
of humility or self restraint.

178
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:57,245
-Glad I'm not
picking up the bill.

179
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,325
-It's not that I'm stingy.

180
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,345
It's not a question of money.

181
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:04,205
I'm only saying this because
I'm worried about ya.

182
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,375
-Hm?

183
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,365
-If you keep creating this
way, you'll end up getting fa--

184
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,345
-You don't want
to use the f word.

185
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:17,225
-Fat?

186
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:18,225
Fat what?

187
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,255
What was he about
to say, Shikamaru?

188
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,335
-Oh, just said fa-- famished.

189
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:26,315
If you're famished, go on
and order the deluxe meal.

190
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:27,245
-Ah!

191
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,285
You said that, Sensei?

192
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,395
You mean it, really?

193
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,245
Wow, that is so cool!

194
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,325
Waiter, a deluxe meal over here!

195
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,375
Make that two!

196
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,315
And with extra rice, please!

197
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,295
Oh, man, I am stuffed.

198
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,215
[crying]

199
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,285
-Here Get go.

200
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,335
-Perfect. thanks.

201
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,295
-Who are they for?

202
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:04,215
-Oh, uh, no one in particular.

203
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,235
Well, uh, see you later.

204
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:09,285
-Say hi to
Kurenai-sensei for me.

205
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,275
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): How?

206
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:11,375
How did she know?

207
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:14,375
[laughter]

208
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:18,375
[crying]

209
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:25,205
-Shogi?

210
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,385
But it's a such a drag.

211
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:30,345
ASUMA: You see, Shogi is a game
of countless variations, all

212
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:33,265
determined by how you
utilize the characteristics

213
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,375
of the individual pieces.

214
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,425
It's a perfect game
for someone like you,

215
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,245
who's always trying to
out think the other guy.

216
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,365
This book will give you
all the basic rules.

217
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,235
The rest you'll
learn as you play.

218
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,335
-What a pain.

219
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:48,325
Give me 10 minutes,
and I'll have it down.

220
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:55,425
-You-- you beat me.

221
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,265
-You know, you don't
have to go easy on me.

222
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,385
Really.

223
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,265
ASUMA: You're the only one who
was promoted from this term's

224
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,275
Chunin selection exams.

225
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,425
I don't mind telling you, as
team leader I'm very proud

226
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,215
of you.

227
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:12,365
Ino and Choji, it'll
be your turn next time.

228
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:20,385
Congratulations, Choji, Ino.

229
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:21,375
Well done.

230
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:24,225
Since Shikamaru
passed last time,

231
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,405
that means all the
members of Squad 10

232
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:28,205
are now officially Chunin.

233
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,225
And it also means
that I will no longer

234
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,275
be in charge of you guys.

235
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:36,265
From here on out, you're
leaders in your own right.

236
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:39,395
Each of you will be
given a new team to lead.

237
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:43,395
These earrings are my gift to
you, to celebrate your success.

238
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:46,395
Whatever the future
holds, never forget

239
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,225
you were members of Squad 10.

240
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:21,305
-Sensei!

241
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:30,305
[crying]

242
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:06,235
-It was an end
worthy of a shinobi.

243
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,305
-I still hate those
damn cigarettes.

244
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:55,395
I can still feel his
smoke in my eyes.

245
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:33,255
[theme music]

246
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,375
-I see.

247
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:03,205
-What about Kurenai?

248
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:12,205
Notify everyone else regarding
the funeral services.

249
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,285
I will inform Kurenai that--

250
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:14,285
SHIKAMARU: No.

251
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,335
I'll do it.

252
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:18,235
I'll tell her.

253
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,275
I have a message for
her from Captain Asuma.

254
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:26,225
NARUTO: Next time, Sad News.
