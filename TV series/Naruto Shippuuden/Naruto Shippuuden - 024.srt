00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,122
Is that all you got?

[theme music]

10
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,766
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Uh?

11
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,102
That noise, what's going on?

12
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,875
Sounds like it came from back
in Sakura and Lady Chiyo's

13
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,412
direction, but I can't be sure.

14
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,248
And we're out of
transmission range now.

15
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,183
I've got to hurry.

16
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,390
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): We're
not getting anywhere

17
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,959
chasing after him like this.

18
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,928
Step it up, KakashiSensei.

19
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,296
Let's go.

20
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,098
We're going to lose sight of
him if we don't get a move on.

21
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,366
It's OK.

22
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,534
You're the whole
reason he's here.

23
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,104
Don't forget that.

24
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,041
He won't get so far ahead
as to lose us completely.

25
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,910
Fine then, just tell me how
to take this guy down, already.

26
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,612
We're running out of time.

27
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,014
Don't worry Naruto.

28
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,082
I've got a couple of
strategies in mind,

29
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,352
but I need a little more time
to work out all the angles.

30
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,687
I can't hang back anymore.

31
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,788
Don't you get it?

32
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,657
I've got to get to Gaara
before it's too late.

00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,059
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): Hmph.

34
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,928
I don't know what their plan is,
but at least the Junchuriki's

35
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,264
a total simpleton.

36
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:09,368
I just got to keep
them too busy to think.

37
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,539
I wonder if they
can match my speed?

38
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:14,440
Huh?

39
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:19,278
Hey you jerk, get back here!

40
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:19,979
Naruto, wait!

41
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,386
There's no getting
through to him now.

42
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,221
I have no choice.

43
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,358
Only one option left.

What in the world
was that noise?

48
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,028
Did you all hear it?

00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,734
Yeah, I herd it
over here as well.

[rumble]

55
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,000
That sounds like it's coming
from over at the enemy's

56
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,501
hideout.

57
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:24,330

Listen, did you
all hear that too?

60
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,140
What in the world is going on?

61
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,778
Can you see anything, Neji?

62
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,579
I'll try.

63
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,382
But my hands are full.

64
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,884
It's going to be difficult
for me to make specifics.

65
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:01,634
The enemy's hideout, it's
collapsing at an alarming rate.

66
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:12,711
Did you say collapsing?

67
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,947
What is happening over there?

68
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,216
Did Sakura and Lady Chiyo win?

69
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,587
Or did the Akatsuki
get the better of them?

70
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,588
Don't know.

71
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,124
I can't make anything out yet.

72
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,092
It's a mess.

73
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,560
[yell]

74
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,276
NEJI: It seems to be
a fairly even battle.

75
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,984
So they're holding
they're own, huh?

76
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,352
That is Sakura for you.

77
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:59,091
I must not lose
to my foe either.

78
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,092
[yell]

79
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,845
That's pretty
impressive strength

80
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:21,113
for such a little girl.

81
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,591
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): She's picked
up on Sasori's attack patterns

82
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,503
in such a short amount of time.

83
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:40,099
I don't think the girl even
needs any help from me.

84
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:45,371
I'd never have thought
she had such ability.

85
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,982
Impressive indeed.

86
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,085
That's pretty
impressive strength

87
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,420
for such a little girl.

88
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,165
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): She's
picked up on Sasori's stories

89
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,096
attack patterns in such
a short amount of time.

90
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,328
I don't think the girl even
needs any help from me.

91
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,131
I'd never have thought
she had such ability.

92
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:30,902
Impressive indeed.

00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,992
[heavy breathing]

94
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,674
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): That Tsunade
sure has a one helluva student.

95
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,716
Listen Sakura,
for medical ninja

96
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:20,519
one's combat ability
is secondary.

97
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:22,320
Have you any idea why?

98
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:23,488
Yes ma'am.

99
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,991
Medical ninja are in the
unit to offer support.

100
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:28,627
We're there to tend to
our comrades in battle,

101
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,229
so it's our healing ability
that's the most crucial.

102
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,930
No it's not!

103
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:33,265
[gasp]

104
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:36,735
The most important thing
for you to master is evasion.

105
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,937
Just dodging them?

106
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,074
A medical ninja must never
be hit by an enemy attack.

107
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,910
Why is that m'lady?

108
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:45,844
[sigh]

109
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:57,155
Who'll heal the unit if
the medical ninja dies?

110
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,691
Now I'm going to
come at you hard.

111
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,928
Your job is to avoid whatever
attack I through at you.

112
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:04,062
This is for real.

113
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,030
You think you're ready?

114
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:30,655
[gasp]

115
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,127
[yell]

116
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,507
TSUNADE: Now I'm going
to come at you hard.

117
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,278
Your job is to avoid whatever
attack I throw at you.

118
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,879
This is for real.

119
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:55,981
You think you're ready?

120
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:56,948
Yyes, m'lady.

121
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:09,194
[gasp] [scream]

122
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,162
Do not close your eyes!

123
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:22,107
Why would you close your eyes
in the face of the enemy?

124
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,088
You're to watch their every
move, before their attack,

125
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,190
during their attack,
and after it.

126
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:42,494
You mustn't let slightest
minutiae escape you.

127
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,296
If you're any kind of
shinobi then you've

128
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,432
probably learned this
already, but every person

129
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:51,236
has a dominant hand and leg,
as well as underlying habits.

130
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,372
And in that movement,
patterns are revealed.

131
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,575
At Chunin or Jonin
level, though, a shinobi

132
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,045
has worked to reduce those
habits to better hide

133
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:02,147
their intentions
from the enemy's eye.

134
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,183
But it's never
eliminated completely.

135
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,485
There are still moments
when one can find out

136
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,754
the enemy's weak spot.

137
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:11,790
The enemy's weak spot?

138
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:15,026
TSUNADE: You must discover these
flaws as quickly as possible.

139
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,829
It will improve your ability
to dodge their attacks.

140
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:25,236
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
His fingers always move

141
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,872
just before he attacks.

142
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:29,474
That's obvious though.

143
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,343
He's controlling his
puppet with the chakra

144
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:32,844
strings on his fingers.

145
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:36,481
It's the weaknesses of
every puppet master.

146
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:36,981
Heh.

147
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,420
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
But I am starting

148
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,456
to read the direction
of his attacks

149
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:47,359
in the pattern of his
finger and arm movements.

150
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,694
SASORI (VOICEOVER): She's
watching me like a hawk.

151
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:51,696
This is taking too long.

152
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,566
I'm going to have to
expend some chakra here.

153
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,034
Better use my ace.

154
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,712
Iron Sand unleash.

155
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:20,558
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Its range is enormous.

156
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:21,059
No.

157
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,520
[grunts]

158
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:06,471
Sakura!

159
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,512
Sakura, are you all right?

160
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,100
CHIYO (FLASHBACK):
Listen to me Sakura,

161
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,636
you must somehow
get close enough

162
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,574
to use your monster strength
to smash that puppet.

163
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:49,247
But to do that,
you will first have

164
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,719
to avoid every attack that his
hidden weapons launch at you.

165
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:56,955
You must dodge
every one perfectly.

166
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,761
You can't risk even
the slightest scratch.

167
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:06,197
Because of the poison, right?

168
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:10,335
Exactly As you know, the
smallest cut can be fatal.

169
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:20,144
Oh, the poison.

170
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:22,080
What do you say, Granny?

171
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,816
There is more to
than you thought.

172
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:27,485
So he soaked the Iron
Sand in poison as well.

173
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:31,823
Oh!

174
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,230
[chuckle] The poison's
starting to work.

175
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:46,704
Soon her body will go numb
and she won't be able to move.

176
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,012
Left alone, she may
last three days.

177
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,713
But I'll finish her now!

178
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:01,953
Oh.

179
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,392
It's over, little girl.

180
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,478
Sakura!

181
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:33,214
[theme music]

182
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,103
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What can
you do with three minutes?

183
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:03,738
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can
cook up some instant ramen.

184
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:04,972
LEE (VOICEOVER):
That is nothing,

185
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,340
I can do that with
onions on top.

186
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,609
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yeah, and
down a bunch of snacks, too?

187
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,177
LEE (VOICEOVER): That, and
have time to brush my teeth.

188
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,512
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Big deal, if I

189
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:13,381
sleep with my clothes
on, I can be up and out

190
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:14,615
the door with ramen in my hand.

191
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:16,083
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wait, you leave

192
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,418
without even washing your face?

193
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:18,285
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Everyday.

194
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,220
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Say what?

195
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:20,521
LEE (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, hygiene is

196
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,256
a crucial part of
daily etiquette.

197
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,257
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

198
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,992
No one ever told me.

199
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:29,597
Next time, Three Minutes
Between Life and Death.

NEJI: The Leaf Village Guide
to Clans, Tomei Edition.

202
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,848
In this volume, we examine the
cooperative ninjutsu and battle

203
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:50,684
techniques of three
clans in particular.

204
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:54,422
First, there's the Yamanaka
Clan's skill in mind control.

205
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:56,957
With a mind transfer and
mind destruction jutsu.

206
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:59,293
TENTEN: It can be dangerous
if you get hit with it,

207
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:01,796
but it's pretty easy to dodge.

208
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:05,199
NEJI: That's where the
Nara Clan's jutsu comes in.

209
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:06,967
TENTEN: Freezing the
enemy in their tracks

210
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,970
with the shadow possession
and shadow paralysis justsu.

211
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:13,641
But supporttype techniques lack
that final punch, don't they?

212
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:16,977
NEJI: The Akimichi Clan
handles the direct attacks.

213
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,579
TENTEN: Delivering
powerhouse moves

214
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,815
through the expansion jutsu.

215
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:22,516
And you don't want
to be frozen in place

216
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,919
when they bust that out.

217
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:28,756
NEJI: Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru
Nara, Choji Akimichi.

218
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:33,828
TENTEN: And Inoichi Yamanaka,
Shikaku Nara, Choza Akimichi.

219
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:36,564
NEJI: Two generations of
the InoShikaCho trio.

220
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:40,101
A proud tradition
of the Hidden Leaf.
