{\an1}<i>(Sakura) Sasuke?!</i>

{\an1}Why are you popping up here,

13
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,574
{\an1}She was in the Time-Space
plane...

14
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,511
{\an1}Sakura, what's going on there?

15
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,448
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) [gasp] Kakashi</i>
<i>Sensei, your left eye!</i>

16

{\an1}It happened in a flash...

17
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,388
{\an1}But it appears that Madara has
stolen my Sharingan.

18
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:54,558
{\an1}Let me see, Sensei!

19
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,791
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) Thanks.</i>

20
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:04,469
{\an4}<i>(Kakashi) But, never mind me.</i>
<i>What about Obito? I'm sure</i>
<i>Madara used the Kamui to</i>
<i>teleport himself there!</i>

21
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,805
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) Huh? I blinked, and I</i>
<i>was back out here...</i>

22
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:09,774
{\an1}Then that means...

23
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:15,214
{\an1}I want you to destroy my left
eye, the one with the Rinnegan.

24
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:18,117
{\an1}<i>(Obito) I can't move much at all</i>
<i>now...</i>

25
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:25,626
{\an4}<i>If I let down my guard,</i>
<i>even just a bit, Black Zetsu</i>
<i>will take over my body, Rinnegan</i>
<i>and all.</i>

26
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:30,464
{\an1}<i>He'll use my right eye's Visual</i>
<i>Prowess to go back outside,...</i>

27
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:34,702
{\an1}...and then the Rinnegan will
fall into Madara's hands.

28
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:39,208
{\an1}If he gets both eyes, terrible
things will happen.

29
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:44,112
{\an4}What do you mean, "terrible
things"? How much worse can all
this get? Hasn't he done enough
already?!

30
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:47,783
{\an1}<i>(Obito) I wasn't able to implant</i>
<i>both Rinnegan myself.</i>

31
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:53,223
{\an1}The chakra and Visual Prowess of
just this one eye are so
strong,

32
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,958
{\an1}...I nearly lost myself.

33
00:03:55,858 --> 00:04:00,030
{\an1}I'm not even its original
owner, yet I accomplished this
much.

34
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:06,671
{\an1}If both Rinnegan are restored to
their true owner, I fear no one
can stand against him.

35
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,106
<i>(Sakura) But-!</i>

36
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:14,547
{\an1}Full powers unleashed in
Visual Prowess only when both
eyes are together.

37
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,586
{\an1}Quickly! There's not much time.
Please destroy this left eye!

38
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:20,953
[gasp]

39
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:22,989
{\an1}What is it, Sakura?!

40
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:28,195
{\an1}We're in serious trouble now!
Obito had reached his limit and
couldn't move...

41
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,832
{\an1}Which means that Madara will get
Obito's Rinnegan!

42
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,942
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) The Cursed</i>

{\an1}<i>How did you manage to remove it?</i>
<i>You shouldn't have been able to</i>

44
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:50,320
{\an1}I had Kakashi stab me, that
destroyed it.

45

{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) This is all I can do</i>

46

47
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,777
{\an1}...I had to gamble my life on
it...But I wasn't going to keep
doing what you wanted!

48

[chuckling]

49
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,584
{\an1}No, actually, you did exactly
what I'd intended you to do.
Even exceeded my hopes.

50
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,789
{\an1}<i>(Obito) Huh? What's so funny?</i>

51
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,459
{\an1}A Curse Seal Tag that was meant
to turn you into a puppet...

52
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:32,132
{\an4}One that would restrict your
movements should you try to
remove it from inside the body
that it's implanted in.

53
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,969
{\an1}<i>Looks like you knew about it,</i>

{\an1}<i>About those Cursed Tags I</i>

55
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:42,278
{\an1}<i>Naturally you couldn't have</i>
<i>killed yourselves, either,</i>

56
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:45,281
{\an1}<i>...since you both were my</i>

57
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,084
{\an1}"The two...of you"?

58
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:54,858
{\an4}Call it fate or karma,
but it's ironic that both of
you ended up getting rid of them
in the exact same way.

59
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:56,527

{\an4}<i>(Six Paths Madara) That's right.</i>

63

<i>deliberately had me see-! </i>

66
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,999
{\an1}I targeted a time when Minato
was on another mission,

67
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:36,838
{\an1}...and then I simply
manipulated the Mist Shinobi
into kidnapping Rin,

68
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:39,508
{\an1}leaving Kakashi so he'd be sure
to come after her.

69
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,113
{\an1}<i>Its other purpose was so I could</i>

70
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:49,753
{\an4}You really thought White Zetsu
stirring you up and your being
able to get out from
underground, right then,

71
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,489
{\an1}...was simply some sort of
coincidence?

72
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:03,001
{\an1}Hey! Listen! I was outside just
now! Your friends Rin and Stupid
Kakashi are in trouble!

73
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:04,602
{\an1}What?! What's going on?!

74
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,774
{\an1}They're alone and completely
surrounded by Hidden Mist
Shinobi!

75
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,482
{\an1}What's the status of Rin and
Kakashi?

76
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,786
{\an1}<i>(Swirly) Well, according to</i>

80

{\an1}Why me?! Tell me why you chose
me?!

96

...to be Hokage!

135
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:01,901
{\an4}<i>Then the village will stop</i>

136
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:08,808
{\an4}<i>(Sasuke) My name's Sasuke</i>
<i>Uchiha...I hate a lot of things.</i>
<i>And I don't particularly like</i>
<i>anything.</i>

137
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:15,215
{\an1}My dream...isn't really a dream
at all because I'm going to make
it a reality.

138
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,590
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) I'm going to restore my</i>

139
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:24,592
{\an1}I'm Sakura Haruno.

140

{\an1}What I like, uh,...I mean, the
person I like is...

141
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,298
My hobby is...

142
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,435
{\an1}And I guess that my dream for
the future is...

143
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,738
[squeal]

144
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,080
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) You've already</i>
<i>surpassed the Hokare, Naruto.</i>

145
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:50,087
{\an1}<i>You've been acknowledged by all</i>
<i>and become a hero. But being</i>
<i>Hokage is still your dream.</i>

146
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:55,894
{\an1}<i>And Sakura, I bet your feelings</i>
<i>for Sasuke have changed from</i>
<i>what they were back then.</i>

147
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,398
{\an1}<i>You still love him but on a</i>
<i>totally different level.</i>

148
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:03,903
{\an1}<i>He tried to kill you, yet you</i>
<i>still care for him. </i>

149
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:09,909
{\an4}<i>You won't cut him off, no matter</i>
<i>what. And you think it's your</i>
<i>duty to save him from the</i>
<i>darkness.</i>

150
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,047
{\an1}<i>That's how kind you are.</i>

151
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:18,052
{\an1}<i>Sasuke...Your dream was to kill</i>
<i>Itachi.</i>

152
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:23,390
{\an1}<i>Now that he's gone, what do you</i>
<i>desire? What are you heading</i>
<i>toward?</i>

153
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:31,734
{\an4}<i>I was your teacher,...but it</i>
<i>turned out that I didn't</i>
<i>understand you at all. Even</i>
<i>now...</i>

154
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,738
{\an1}Sasuke...What is your current
dream?

155
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:37,907
Huh?

156
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:45,849
{\an1}What's the meaning behind saying
that you'll become Hokage?

157
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:58,898
{\an1}I feel that it might be
fate...that the former Team
Seven has reunited like this.

158
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:04,737
{\an1}If you don't wanna tell us what
you're thinking right now,
Sasuke,...that's fine.

159
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:12,380
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) But,...that we were</i>

<i>irrefutable fact,...isn't it?</i>

160
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:17,218
{\an1}In front! He's coming!

161
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:20,888
{\an1}<i>You haven't forgotten the</i>

162
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,555
Nope.

163
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:22,523
Hm.

164
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:24,393
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Of course not! The</i>

165
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,427
{\an1}...is teamwork! Right?

166
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,253
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) Then,...</i>

167
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:54,159
{\an1}...you all dying together could
also be considered teamwork,
right?

168
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,136
{\an1}Madara,...you have both
Rinnegan, huh?

169
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,075
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) And his lower body's</i>

{\an1}<i>(Black Zetsu) Sorry, but...Obito</i>

172
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:27,062
{\an1}<i>It seems that he was hoping to</i>
<i>have his mistakes rectified and</i>
<i>be redeemed.</i>

173
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:34,871
{\an4}<i>He was praying in his heart,</i>
<i>like a child,...that he could</i>
<i>just leave the future to you</i>

174
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:41,212
{\an1}<i>How convenient that would have</i>

<i>Like a spoiled brat.</i>

175

Hm.
