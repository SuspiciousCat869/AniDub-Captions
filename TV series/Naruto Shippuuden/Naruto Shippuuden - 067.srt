[groaning sounds]

2
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:44,423
-Then you're really going to
kill everyone in the village?

3
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,625
-Yes.

4
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:49,666
Everyone, and that way, we
restore the Land of Fire

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,303
to its glory.

6
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:54,276
-But I thought-- I thought
that your cause was the same

7
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:58,384
as my father's, to remove a
king who is a rival to our own.

8
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,488
Tell me why all these
other innocent people

9
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:01,890
must die as well.

10
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,561
-None of them is innocent.

11
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,233
As long as there remains
even a single Leaf Villagr

12
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,938
loyal to their king,
the Land of Fire

13
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,143
will never be united as one.

14
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,278
Don't you see?

15
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,950
Your father was
struck down by Asuma,

16
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,820
because Asuma was
loyal to the Hokage.

17
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,165
The king is not the problem.

18
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,870
The problem is those
who believe in the king.

19
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,974
As long as they're
around, a king

20
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,913
can be replaced over and over.

21
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:33,988
That's the one thing your
father failed to understand.

22
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:35,591
-The one thing?

23
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:39,266
-It's not the king that
must die, it's the pawn.

24
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,843
The king will
cease to exist only

25
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,950
when everyone in the
village ceases to exist.

26
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:52,592
And then the land of Fire
will at last be unified.

27
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,229
The limelight jutsu.

28
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:57,102
When the four sources of
lightning come together,

29
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,573
everything begins anew.

30
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:04,015
That is the time when all our
aspirations will be fulfilled.

31
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,849
Fuka, Fuen, Fudo, defend them.

32
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:24,222
Guard the steps of those we
have brought back to life.

33
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:31,838
Kitane, Nauma, To
and Sato, as soon

34
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:33,909
as everything is in
readiness for the limelight,

35
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:37,282
we'll abandon this village.

36
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:38,952
That goes for you too, Sora.

37
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:55,752

[groaning sounds]

40
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,362
-That huge mound of
earth seems to be

41
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:58,865
the source of these things.

42
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,469
-Yes, you're right.

43
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,941
My guess is they've summoned
the earth from all the villages

44
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,545
they've attacked along with
the villagers buried in it.

45
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,516
-And once they bring
the villagers back

46
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,420
to life with their
reanimation jutsu,

47
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:11,691
they've got themselves
an instant army.

48
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:21,777
-They're getting on my nerves.

49
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,885
-How many did they kill anyway?

50
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,187
-Expansion jutsu arm.

51
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,572
This could go on forever.

52
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,676
-They just keep
coming and coming.

53
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,551
-At this rate, the village
will be buried under them.

54
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:45,458
-The enemy's army of reanimated
shinobi continues to grow.

55
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:48,364
The reinforcements have
arrived, but even so, it's

56
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,870
all we can do to keep them
from over running the market

57
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,306
district.

58
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,976
-I see.

59
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,349
-Request permission to join
the forces on the front line.

60
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,253
I'll never come up
with a defense plan

61
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:02,459
by staying here and trying
to work it out in my head.

62
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,662
It's not my style.

63
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,733
You know what I mean?

64
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,069
-Very well.

65
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:10,008
-Don't worry, I'll
come up with something.

66
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,712
-I'm counting on it.

67
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:12,212
-Right.

68
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:28,411
-You look so cute hanging there.

69
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,549
What a brave boy you are.

70
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:35,292
I might even spare you, if you
let me have that body of yours.

71
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,762
-I'm not going to
give you anything

72
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,701
but a beating if you don't
get lost, you old hag.

73
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,803
-What a shame.

74
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,049
You little brat.

75
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:52,593
Furido was very emphatic that I
was supposed to keep you alive.

76
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:56,768
Oh well, everybody
makes mistakes.

77
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:59,206
Lightning style

-Shadow clone jutsu!

79
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,125
-Just as stubborn as I expected.

80
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,565
-Listen lady, I can't afford to
be wasting time here with you.

81
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,805
-Well, all right, shall
we finish it then?

82
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,210
-Now, you die.

83
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:37,015
-Wood style domed wall.

84
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,986
-Stop hiding, you coward!

85
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,661
Oh, that's right.

86
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,869
I forgot.

87
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:05,706
You're an earth style user too.

88
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:13,288
Well, let's find out
who's better at it.

89
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:21,238
I

90
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,807
-Earth style falling
earth spears.

91
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,262
-Tricky, but what good is
it against a body that's

92
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,330
harder than rock?

93
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,917
-What is this?

94
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,931
Whatever, I gotta
get out of here.

95
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:09,935
[screaming]

96
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:15,847
-No!

97
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:25,299
-Can't you just
forget about this?

98
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,169
-No.

99
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:30,309
You know I can't.

100
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,948
-I always liked you.

101
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:34,517
-And I, you.

102
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:38,191
And yet, here we are.

103
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:42,299
I never imagined that I
would have to kill you.

104
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:50,349
All right, lightning
style lightning bind.

105
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,169
This way, at least
I can let you live.

106
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:01,605
Now, I must go.

107
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,978
I've waste too much
time on you already.

108
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:05,480
-Kitane!

109
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:08,920
No way--

110
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,898
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Kitane!

111
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:23,316
-Soon they will all be
in a proper alignment,

112
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,954
and then you will witness
the activation of limelight.

113
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,663
-No.

114
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,532
-Hm?

115
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,903
-No, Furido.

116
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:35,673
I won't let you kill them.

117
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:36,675
I won't let you.

118
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,747
No, Furido, I won't
let you kill them.

119
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,519
I won't let you.

120
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:03,696
I hate Asuma, but this--
this is different.

121
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,402
-Just the same, just
like your father.

122
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:25,273
-To him-- you--

123
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,281
-Sora, how very
pathetic you are.

124
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,018
This is what
happens when someone

125
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:34,758
who's been shunned all his life
is shown a little kindness.

126
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,428
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

127
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:47,717
-It was the same
with your father.

128
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:51,225
It's that weakness that
needs to be crushed.

129
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:52,427
-Ahh!

130
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,533
-It's what ruined
the Land of Fire.

131
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,470
That soul killing
weakness is what

132
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,775
has allowed this
village to survive.

133
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,712
Don't you see?

134
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:03,951
Do you want to die
just like your father?

135
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:20,216
-Sakura?

136
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,796
Hey, Sakura.

137
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,132
-Naruto?

138
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,234
-You OK?

139
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,007
Don't worry,
everything's all right.

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,649
-What happened to-- the walls
were covered with moths.

141
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,756
They attacked me.

142
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:43,529
-Poor, Sakura, it sounds like
you had a real nightmare.

143
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,484
But don't worry, everything's
gonna be find now.

144
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,948
I know just the thing to
put your mind at ease!

145
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:56,321
-No!

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,438
-Sakura, why are
you running away?

147
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:11,318
-Yeah, come on, Sakura.

148
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,455
It's me.

149
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:13,557
-I don't get it, what
are you so scared of?

150
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,559
-Don't you recognize me?

151
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,894
-There's no need to run away.

152
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,396
-Stop it.

153
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,230
Stop it.

154
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,867
Stop it, Naruto, leave me alone.

155
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,107
INO (VOICEOVER): We've got more
wounded than we can handle.

156
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:40,744
This isn't working.

157
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,314
We've got to find
a better solution.

158
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,896
-So what's the situation, Ino?

159
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,397
-Shikamaru.

160
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,912
--[laughing] She passed out
from the illusion caused

161
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:59,649
by my poisoned moths.

162
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:03,256
I wonder what sort of
dreams she's been having.

163
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,492
I can't imagine.

164
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,496
Little girls have the
most vivid nightmares.

165
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:09,769
Release!

166
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,246
Goodbye, little girl.

167
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:43,637
A substitution.

168
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,442
-See you later, you sick jerk.

169
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:46,944
-Ahh!

170
00:14:55,962 --> 00:15:00,037
-But how-- how did
you escape my jutsu?

171
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,708
-The second I heard
your voice I knew.

172
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:05,347
I had a pretty good idea
of what kind of trick

173
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,718
you'd try and pull.

174
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,290
Like in the labyrinth, remember?

175
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:12,594
That giant poisonous spider.

176
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,200
Only now it was poisonous moths.

177
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:18,606
I simulated another attack
like that and prepared myself.

178
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:25,788
-You gave yourself an antidote?

179
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:26,890
-You're evasive.

180
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:30,530
You never face your
enemy head on in battle.

181
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,771
Once I knew that, I knew
just how to deal with you.

182
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:48,868
[bark]

183
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,070
-What the--

184
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,074
-The defense barrier.

185
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,044
-Yeah, it's breaking up.

186
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,782
-That means that
one of our units

187
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:15,621
must have defeated whoever
was casting the jutsu.

188
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:18,226
-Terrific, but that doesn't
change our situation

189
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,598
as long as these things
keep coming at us.

190
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,537
-Since that other unit, whoever
they are, did their job,

191
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,475
the least we can do is
take care of our end.

192
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:27,044
-That's the spirit, Choji.

193
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:29,315
-Huh?

194
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,150
Shikamaru.

195
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:31,152
-This is a diversion.

196
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:33,323
They're real objective
is elsewhere.

197
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:36,463
That's why we've got to wrap
things up here as quickly as we

198
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,801
can, then go link up
with the other units.

199
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,172
-Yeah, yeah, we know
that, so why don't you

200
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,677
quit standing there yapping
and come up with a strategy

201
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,381
already.

202
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,652
-You an be a real
drag, you know?

203
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,958
Choji, you must still have
some chakra left, right?

204
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,362
-Sure, plenty.

205
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,633
I'm ready to go any time.

206
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,270
-And how about the rest of you?

207
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,807
-My power of youth
reservoir is full.

208
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,114
-And I won't be outdone
by a bunch of children.

209
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,653
-I was just hoping for a
chance to really go wild.

211

-Yeah, we're good to go too.

212
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,598
-Yeah, sure.

213
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,735
-All right, then, let's do it.

214
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:21,587
-Now, now, it's too
early for beddy bye, boy.

215
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,624
Earth style mud silhouette.

216
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,404
Water style mouth
of the serpent.

217
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:37,552
The earth gains momentum from
the water creating a mud slide.

218
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,743
-Are you going to
stand and fight,

219
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:10,651
or are you just going to
keep running around forever?

220
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:13,323
-Oh, I was doing more
than just running around.

221
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:14,526
-What?

222
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,065
-I was waiting, waiting
for the conditions

223
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:21,773
to be perfect before
launching my counterattack.

224
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,880
Water style tearing torrent.

225
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,882
-Water style?

226
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,689
I guess I should have been
on the alert for water style

227
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,627
from a wood style user.

228
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,500
But I hope you weren't counting
on me to be beaten so easily.

229
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,549
-You prepared the ground
very nicely for me.

230
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:02,054
This type of sandy
soil, when broken down,

231
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,727
absorbs water easily
and liquefies.

232
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,631
-Damn you.

233
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:09,837
You were planning this
from the very beginning.

234
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,074
-This way, I don't
have to take part

235
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:15,381
in a battle of earth styles.

236
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:18,120
Wood style tree
bind eternal burial.

237
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:26,804
-What?

238
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:27,706
What is this?

239
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:34,620
-Now, your earth
style will become

240
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,991
part of the Leaf Village's soil.

241
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:37,492
-No!

242
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,023
-Go, Choji, now!

243
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,227
-Expansion jutsu.

244
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,263
Feel my power!

245
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,172
-Next up?

246
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:02,676
-Here I go!

247
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,014
Leafs of youth hurricane.

248
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:08,855

[theme music]

MALE SPEAKER: As storm
clouds blot out the stars

253
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,549
and thunder splits
the air, the Leaf

254
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:05,155
totters on the edge
of destruction.

255
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:08,697
Comrades scramble to avert
the impending catastrophe.

256
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:12,968
Meanwhile, amidst the chaos,
yet another crisis lurks.

257
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:16,205
The secret of Sora's origin
will at last be revealed,

258
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:19,008
and Sora can only
listen in horror

259
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,212
as Furido unveils the full
reach of his terrible plan.

Next time, "Moment
of awakening."
