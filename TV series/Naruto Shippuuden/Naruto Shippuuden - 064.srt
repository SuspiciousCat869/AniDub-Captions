Come on.

end up back here
in the hospital.

-All the same, it seems
to me, butting heads

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,636
is the way you and Sora have
chosen to try and understand

00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,026
Just a moment, my lady.

55
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:30,764
I've seen this person once
before, when I was in the ANBU.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,700
He went missing while
he was on a mission.

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,137
His name is Totsji.

-So you're saying
this man was the spy

that Lord Donzo sent
to the Hidden Rain.

-You thought you'd sniff
around on your own, did you?

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,218
I have no idea what you were
looking for in Hidden Rain,

62
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,322
but you are going to tell
me what you found out.

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,460
Was the Hidden Rain responsible
for those earlier attacks?

know that much.

while you pursue

68
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,274
your policy of moderation,
your complacency

69
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,043
is destroying this village.

70
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,746
-I take it, then,
you refuse to talk.

71
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,381
Very well, then.

72
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,249
In that case--

73
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,252
-Don't bother.

74
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,053
You're just wasting
your time if you

75
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,490
think you can get him to talk.

76
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,159
-There's more than one
way to go about this.

77
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,280
-You summoned me, my lady.

00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,286
-I'm counting on you , Ibiki.

79
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,687
-Leave it to me.

80
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,157
Give me 10 minutes and I'll
have him singing like a bird.

81
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,030
-Huh?

82
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,599
-Tsunade, where
is your patience?

83
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,137
A hokage is supposed to be
above this sort of thing,

84
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,407
going so far as to
drag Ibiki into it.

85
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,242
Really, such tactics.

86
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,143
They're unacceptable.

87
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,481
-There, there, now.

88
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,116
I'm sorry about all of this.

-Poor Danzo.

90
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,992
Tatsugi wasn't only
spying for you, you see.

91
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,996
All that time he was sending
information to us, as well.

[chuckle]

-He is no traitorous spy.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,203
He's a loyal
citizen of the Leaf.

95
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,575
-According to Tatsugi's
reports, the Hidden Rain

96
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,545
was not involved in the
attacks on the border villages.

97
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,448
More significantly, it appears
that the mission assigned

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,150
to him by Donzo was
to track and monitor

99
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,320
the movements of those four
grave robbers, the ones who

100
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,057
violated the hidden tombs near
the Temple of Fire recently.

101
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,492
-Well, what did he find out?

102
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,562
-It is just as you all
feared, I'm afraid.

103
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,630
What those four were
really after all

104
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,201
along was that boy, Sora,
from the Fire Temple.

105
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,974
-Tsunade, you know
about the incident

106
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,378
the boy caused in the past at
the Fire Temple, don't you?

107
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,746
-Yes.

108
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,715
-I don't know how it
came to be, but there's

109
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,619
no doubt the boy possesses
a great power of some kind.

110
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,223
Power equal to, if not greater
than that of the Guardian

111
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,392
Shinobi 12, whose
tombs were ransacked.

112
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,631
-And you welcomed
him with open arms.

113
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,733
You brought this strange
and dangerous power

114
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,503
into our own village.

115
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,139
Since you are supposed to
be the village's guardian,

116
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,141
you must act quickly.

117
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,610
You must decide
what is to be done.

118
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,178
-Yes, I understand.

119
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,181
But we can't just send him
back to the Fire Temple.

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,683
Perhaps if we kept him
under lock and key.

121
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,285
-No, no.

122
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,687
The seedling must be
torn out by the roots

123
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,291
before it can spread and
threaten the village.

124
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,406
-Elimination?

125
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,035
-I wanted to show
you your true power.

126
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,703
SORA (VOICEOVER): Why?

127
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,706
Why must my power
make me an outcast?

128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,675
Not this time.

129
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,678
Not this time.

130
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,280
Old man Asuma.

131
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,197
-Tsunade, you are the hokage.

132
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,432
The decision is yours.

133
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,435
You must decide what is
best for the Leaf Village.

134
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,527
-I won't--

135
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,182
SORA: Let go!

136
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,384
Let go of me, you masked monkey.

137
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,720
-Quiet down.

138
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,322
-Sora.

139
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,725
-We caught him hiding
in the rafters.

140
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,327
-I heard everything.

141
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,628
Elimination, huh?

142
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,198
Is this power I have really that
much of a threat to you people?

143
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,169
You're no different than those
fools at the Fire Temple.

144
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,471
-You carry the seeds
of disaster in you.

145
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,572
-Donzo!

146
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,275
-You're all cowards and
fools, everyone of you.

147
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,376
Comrades, huh?

148
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,578
To hell with Team Kakashi.

149
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,080
-Sora.

150
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,749
-Well, I guess that's what I get
for trusting in people again.

151
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,051
This is what I get for
believing in all of you.

152
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,052
-Quiet, Sora.

153
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,287
That's enough.

154
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,192
-Asuma, there's something
I need you to tell me, now.

155
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,727
Was it you?

156
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,096
Are you the one who
killed my father?

157
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,633
-The one who killed your
father is none other

158
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:12,272
than ex-guardian
shinobi Asuma Sarutobi.

159
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,474
-Who murdered my father?

160
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,208
Was it you?

161
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,047
-It was me.

to kill my father?

You had no right.

you little idiot.

You stabbed my
father in the back.

And I will have my revenge.

He mustn't get out.

No matter what.

207
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,486
All the gates have

him with the destruction

Hoo.

211
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,542
-Too much.

212
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,744
But not even he
is powerful enough

213
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,548
to destroy the sealed
Iron Walls beyond.

214
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,120
-What?

215
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,081
-The same dream,
just like before.

216
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:39,098
-The real problem is
there are two great kings.

217
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,669
The Land of Fires feudal Lord
and the hokage of the Leaf.

218
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,539
There will always be
distrust and confusion,

219
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,442
as long as there are two
kings of equal strength.

220
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,711
Two can never decide
as quickly as one

221
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,580
how to react to a crisis.

222
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,084
Kazuma's ultimate
goal was very simple.

223
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,720
To unite all the factions
of The Land of Fire,

224
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,422
and make them one.

225
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:07,994
But his efforts to bring the two
kings together came to nothing.

226
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,062
In fact, that was
the very thing that

227
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,732
ended up tricking
him in the end.

228
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,434
The people of this
village, like most people,

229
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,170
always stick with
their own king.

230
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,139
That's what Asuma did.

231
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:24,176
He preferred his own hokage.

232
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,647
He doesn't understand what
makes this village shine.

233
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,985
It's only catching the reflected
light of the true king.

234
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,421
It's the Land of Fire
that makes it shine.

235
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,995
Ultimately, The Land of Fire
was Kazuma's only cause.

236
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,597
And it was for
that cause that he

237
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,501
had entrusted you
with your powers.

238
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,305
-My only cause is
avenging my father.

239
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,040
-And that's all right.

240
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,209
But try and look beyond
your personal objectives,

241
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,447
and see the greater revenge
that Kazuma envisioned.

242
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,251
Join me, Sora, in
fulfilling Kazuma's dream.

243
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,554
Join me and I'll see you
get as many opportunities

244
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,123
as you like to deal with Asuma.

245
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,600
-The other king, the hokage.

246
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,635
-Sora!

247
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,303
Sora.

248
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,038
-Man, this guy.

249
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,740
What a pain in the neck he is.

250
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,480
So I guess that's as far
as the scent goes, huh?

-Boy, your recuperative powers
never cease to amaze me, Naruto.

We've had everybody
looking for him everywhere.

253
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,466
He might have left the village.

254
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,734
-No way.

feeling Sora's still

some rest tonight.

full of-- full of rage.

No doubt about it.

you attacking her?
