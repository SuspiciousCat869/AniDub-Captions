-Where in the world could
he have gone off to?

It's like he just disappeared--

-Hold it!

00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,434
Slow down, Sora!

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,409
Oh, no.

-Lady Sunned, there's someth--

-Sakura.

12
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,393
Sorry, I can't talk now.

13
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,597
I've called an emergency meeting
of all the team captains.

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,532
-What happened here, my lady?

15
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,044
-Sora tried to kill me.

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:17,511
-No.

17
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,383
-Has there ever been a power
outage this big before?

18
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,153
-This might not be
your ordinary blackout.

19
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:26,720
-Yeah.

20
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,188
Something's not right.

21
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,590
-Mmm.

22
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,424
-Oh!

23
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,658
-What are you talking about?

24
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,160
Everything's fine.

25
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,096
We have the Hokage looking
after us, don't we?

26
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,532
You don't think the
Hokage can handle this?

27
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,234
Stop whining and calm down.

28
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,069
-Yeah.

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,370
Yeah, you're right.

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,304
-That's right.

31
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,639
As long as the
Hokage is with us.

32
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,420
[background chatter]

33
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,223
-Well, it's not the
main circuit breaker.

34
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,659
That means we stand by
on Area Three, right?

35
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,660
-Right.

36
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,262
Just like it says
in the field manual.

37
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,164
Meanwhile, the
off-duty team leader

38
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,733
should be meeting
with the Hokage.

39
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,301
-Well, then.

40
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,102
-Huh?

41
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,471
-Grr!

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,974
-Woah.

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,111
That is too delicious.

45
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,245
There we go.

46
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,581
I'm all fueled up
and ready for action.

47
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,183
You coming, Shikamaru?

48
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,379
-Yeah.

49
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,489
-No you don't!

50
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,591
-What the heck's going on?

51
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,060
-All the power is out.

52
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,128
-Oh, man.

53
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,264
I really don't
like the dark much.

54
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,699
-Something strange is going on.

55
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,367
It could mean trouble.

56
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,301
-What?

57
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,970
-Close and secure the main gate!

58
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,717
-The signal system
is secure, my lady.

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,619
You'll be able to
communicate instructions

60
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,688
if an attack should come.

61
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,588
-Excellent work.

62
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,995
(VOICEOVER) So now it comes.

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,297
Just when I've dispatched
so many of our Shinobi the

64
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,167
to Hidden Rain border.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,269
-As you're probably
aware, the entire village

66
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,071
is without electricity.

67
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,640
There's always the possibility
that this power outage

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,341
occurred by accident.

69
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,178
However, since we've been
unable to make contact

70
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,647
with the main power
station, the safest course

71
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,384
is for us to assume that this is
an act of deliberate sabotage.

72
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,721
Therefore, I'm placing the
village on Level Two emergency

73
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,122
security alert.

74
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,725
-Huh?

75
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,260
-Company Three, fan out
and cover the east, west,

76
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,295
and north gates.

77
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,530
Company Two, go
to the main gate.

78
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,499
Company One will go
to the power station

79
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,601
and find out what's going on.

You'll remain here.

Keep your eyes open, everyone.

was interrupted.

attacked, Lady Tsunade?

Go after them.

Hard as it is for you
to believe, it happened.

00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,927
around us.

173
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,362
-A defensive barrier?

174
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,464
-Wha-- what's that?

175
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,734
-He means a defense barrier.

176
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,102
-Huh?

177
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:44,736
-Ugh.

178
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,604
Don't you see?

179
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,739
It's a barrier used for defense.

180
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,576
Like a wall for defending
against enemy attacks,

181
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,112
or to keep an enemy
outside from getting in.

182
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,983
-But the enemy is outside,
so why would they put it up?

183
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,819
It's like defending
against themselves.

184
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,020
It's weird.

185
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,754
-No.

186
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:03,555
Maybe not.

187
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,890
-Huh?

188
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,761
-Maybe it's not intended to keep
them out, but-- to keep us in.

189
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,996
-That's right.

190
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,764
For some reason, they
want that barrier

191
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,466
to keep us trapped
here in the village.

192
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,006
-Now what do they have in mind?

193
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,449
-We are four individuals,
made one by a common resolve

194
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:33,785
to pursue the cause
of the Land of Fire.

195
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,623
It is this indomitable resolve
that has brought us here.

196
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,359
Lend us your ears for
but a brief moment,

197
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,628
for there is not much to say.

198
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,397
We have only one purpose.

199
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,033
The greater glory
of the Land of Fire

200
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,534
with the Feudal Lord Supreme.

201
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,675
-The existence of the
Hokage in this village

202
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,544
poses a lasting threat
to the supremacy

203
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,481
of the Land of
Fire's Feudal Lord.

204
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,883
There can only be one true King.

205
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,458
Don't you understand?

206
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,561
There is no longer any reason
for this Hokage of yours

207
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,496
to exist!

208
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,363
-Why, you--

209
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:21,400
-We didn't expect your approval.

210
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,104
Nevertheless, you will help
us achieve our purpose.

211
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,020
Even after you die.

212
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,227
-But I remember
learning that there's

213
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,264
no way to get in or out
of a defense barrier.

214
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,099
-Yes, quite right.

215
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,002
The enemy must be employing
some kind of special jutsu

216
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:46,037
to penetrate the barrier.

217
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:47,439
The situation is this.

218
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:50,408
We are trapped inside, while
the enemy can come and go

219
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,910
as they please.

220
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:54,913
Now that they've been allowed
to infiltrate the village,

221
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,949
we go to Stage Two, as
outlined in the Sneak Attack

222
00:13:57,982 --> 00:13:59,184
Countermeasures manual.

223
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:01,186
-You name it, we're
ready to fight right now.

224
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:01,786
-Right!

225
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,787
-Yeah!

226
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,122
-Not yet.

227
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:07,358
-Before we can counterattack,
we must evacuate the civilians.

228
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,761
Your job is to round up
everyone in the village

229
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:13,364
and guide them calmly and
swiftly to a safe place.

230
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:14,365
Are you up to it?

231
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,101
This is your first
A-Rank mission.

232
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,272
-You bet we're up to it.

233
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:23,141
-Go.

234
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:25,410
I'm counting on you.

235
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,114
Meanwhile, I'll do what I
can to stall for time here.

236
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,249
-It's going to take
more than words.

237
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,785
-We won't let you
touch the Hokage.

238
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:37,989
-(VOICEOVER) If we can just hold
until reinforcements get here.

239
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,924
-Hmm.

240
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,825
Fudo.

241
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:41,226
-Yeah.

242
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,133
-Earth Style.

243
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:48,800
Impermanence!

244
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:57,075
-What?

245
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:57,509
Get back!

246
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,052
-Lady Tsunade.

247
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,387
I'm ready.

248
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:11,055
-Now that the
battle's been joined,

249
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,390
there's going to
be desperate need

250
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:14,959
for medical ninja
such as yourself.

251
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,361
Go.

252
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:17,862
-Right.

253
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:19,330
-(VOICEOVER) It
hasn't gone perfectly,

254
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:22,934
but we've done just
about all we can.

255
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:26,204
Why, then, do I
still feel so uneasy?

256
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,842
[grunt]

257
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,278
-It's just one
thing after another.

258
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:34,812
These guys are too much.

259
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,213
Huh?

260
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,725
-Earth Style.

261
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:50,495
Ultimate Revival Jutsu.

262
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:53,064
Soil Bodies.

263
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:55,166
Rise, fallen Shinobi.

264
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,768
Rise and live again!

265
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:02,407
[groan]

266
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:05,376
[laughter]

267
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,748
-You are about to die facing
our army of dead Shinobi!

268
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:12,984
-You don't know
anything about me.

269
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,886
-You're right about that.

270
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,387
Who are those guys?

271
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:19,224
What have you done?

272
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,359
-The Leaf tried to eliminate me.

273
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:24,295
What do you expect?

274
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,832
-Grandma Tsunade would
have never done that!

275
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:30,001
-Yes, they did!

276
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,503
I just tried to get
them before they got me!

277
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,205
-I finally found you.

278
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:38,943
-Asuma-sensei!

279
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,282
-It's the backstabber Asuma!

280
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:46,718
-Huh?

281
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:47,118
-Sora.

282
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,290
Why did you attack the Hokage?

283
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,726
She is not the one you're after.

284
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,128
[laughter]

285
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:02,100
-The one you want
revenge on is me.

286
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,936
-Let go!

287
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:08,072
I'm only doing the exact
same thing you did.

288
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:11,743
You chose to side with your
king by killing my father.

289
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:12,744
-King?

290
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,213
-I'll return the
favor by killing her.

291
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:17,048
-What are you talking about?

292
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,449
You're not making sense.

293
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:19,817
-No.

294
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,985
It's true.

295
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,121
-What?

296
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:24,922
-Sora.

297
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:28,393
You called Lady Tsunade
"king" just now.

298
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,829
-(VOICEOVER) The Land of
Fire doesn't need two Kings.

299
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:34,299
The Leaf is just
a military asset.

300
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,367
The Hokage is superfluous.

301
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,870
We already have a
man at the helm.

302
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,772
The Feudal Lord.

303
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:43,408
-According to Toschi's
reports, the Hidden Rain

304
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:46,110
was not involved in the
attacks on the border villages.

305
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:48,980
More significantly, it appears
that the mission assigned

306
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,482
to him by Danzo was
to track and monitor

307
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:53,985
the movements of those
four grave robbers.

308
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:57,255
The ones who violated the hidden
tombs near the Temple of Fire

309
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,356
recently.

310
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:01,459
-It is just as you all
feared, I'm afraid.

311
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:03,494
What those four were
really after all

312
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:08,132
along was that boy, Sora,
from the fire temple.

313
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:10,435
-(VOICEOVER) Now I understand.

314
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,036
But that means--

315
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,878
[gasp]

316
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,213
-This is bad.

317
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,148
-What is it, Asuma-sensei?

318
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:27,185
-If my guess is
right, the village

319
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:29,420
is in even greater
danger than we feared.

320
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:36,361
[groans]

321
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:42,867
-No pushing!

322
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,269
Everyone stay calm,
and keep moving!

323
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,744
-The enemy's objective is
more than just conquest.

324
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:54,746
It's mass slaughter.

325
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,714
-Say what?

326
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:57,382
-Nonsense.

327
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,316
What makes you think that--

328
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,952
-It must be.

329
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,087
-Why did the grave
robbers steal the bodies

330
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,224
of the four Lightning
Style Shinobi?

331
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:07,925
It's because they
sought the power

332
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,128
of those particular Shinobi.

333
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:13,831
They wanted the power of
Lightning Style Jutsu.

334
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:16,134
They've hit upon the means
of harnessing that power,

335
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,503
and using it to wipe out the
village and everyone in it.

336
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,975
-Wipe out the village?

337
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:24,809
-Sora.

338
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,444
Is this really true?

339
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:29,247
They'll destroy
the whole village?

340
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:30,815
Thousands of villagers.

341
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,250
You want their
lives on your head?

342
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:37,355
-I don't know.

343
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,056
I don't know anything!

344
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,991
-Sora!

345
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,759
-I must join the others.

346
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:42,894
-Huh?

347
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,363
-I have to stop this
before the worst happens.

348
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:48,966
Naruto, you'll have
to deal with Sora.

349
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,367
-Got it.

350
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,072
-(VOICEOVER) Finally,
it all makes sense.

351
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,874
What Sora said.

352
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,310
His use of the word "king."

353
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,746
There's no doubt about it now.

354
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,849
The one who attempted that
coup in the Land of Fire

355
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,751
is the same one
who's behind this.

356
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:22,419
-Charging process, complete.

357
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,482

358
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,338
-What did you say?

359
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:02,606
-These guys attacking us.

360
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,341
They're Shinobi from
the Land of Fire?

361
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:05,509
-Yeah.

362
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,244
Those markings mean they
belong to the Kohaku clan

363
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:08,845
from that village on the border.

364
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,614
-But I thought most
of the Kohaku clan

365
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,249
were supposed to
have been destroyed

366
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:13,617
in that attack on their village.

367
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,986
-Maybe they've been raised
from the dead through some kind

368
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,587
of reanimation jutsu.

369
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,855
-That's horrible.

370
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,557
It's unforgivable.

371
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,461
To take all these people's lives
just to turn them into weapons?

372
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:25,595
-Next Time.

373
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,464
Revived Souls.
