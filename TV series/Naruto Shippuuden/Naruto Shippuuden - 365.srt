{\an1}<i>What is this chakra?!</i>

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,176
{\an1}<i>Interesting, they all</i>

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,446
{\an1}<i>though none of them</i>

{\an1}<i>This chakra is...</i>

00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,988
{\an1}Let's just go. Hurry up and
lead the way, Orochimaru.

{\an1}No, it's Naruto's chakra!

11

{\an1}Nice work transforming

{\an1}I've got the hang of it now.
So, help me out, Kurama!

14
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,464
{\an1}That Nara shinobi. He sure
analyzed my chakra exchange

16

{\an1}Sorry for the wait. You
can use a small number

Are these calories?

{\an1}Let me share a little
something with you all.

{\an1}It's those connections that
made me what I am today!

can be powerful curses, too!

105
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,020
{\an1}Listen, Naruto. I
know that I was the one

106
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,288
{\an1}who once told you
that "I will never

107
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,657
{\an1}let my comrades die."

108
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:31,731
{\an1}Those words are also an
admonition aimed at myself.

109
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,201
{\an1}I haven't been able
to save many a comrade.

110
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:39,139
{\an1}Which is why I keep telling
myself this time I will

111
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,041
protect them.

112
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:44,644
{\an1}But then I end up having
to face the fact that I

113
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:46,380
{\an1}couldn't once more.

114
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,216
{\an1}I'll be confronting
those wounds for

115
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,185
{\an1}the rest of my life.

116
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,121
{\an1}But that's why we're
ninja. We're "those who

117
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,690
{\an1}endure." Isn't that right?

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,027
They'll never
let you forget,

119
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:04,198
{\an1}but it's those wounds
that prove your comrades

120

{\an1}live on inside here.

create inside a dream so you

{\an1}can't get hurt aren't real.

123
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,710
And that means
you're just erasing

{\an1}your real friends!

curse or not.

you'll never defeat me.

{\an1}That's simply the way it is.

{\an1}Look elsewhere for a rival.

136
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,022
{\an1}So you saw me lose
back there, huh?

137
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:06,260
{\an1}You know... I used to
believe that you couldn't

138
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,596
{\an1}change the fate that
was handed to you.

139

{\an1}One day, we'll fight
for real and see

140
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,734
{\an1}which is greater.

{\an1}Wait, Neji, don't
you mean so long as

144
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,118
{\an1}your eyes are white?

145
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,854
{\an1}Huh? Oh, yes, I guess.

146
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:35,990
{\an1}Well, in any case, it
means you'll always

link with my chakra right

171
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:58,974
{\an1}now is Naruto, since he has
Kushina's blood and has

172
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,244
{\an1}been with me for years
as my Jinchuriki.

173
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,680
{\an1}And he's matured to the
point where he's skillful

174
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:08,718
{\an1}enough to sense and
transmute my chakra

shinobi and give it to them.

you both, a while ago now.

link and he can transmit is

{\an1}on a different scale!

way outside the village.

can we please
get out of here?!

{\an1}Yes, lets go to the place
where all the secrets sleep.

This place has
changed a lot, too.

wanted to destroy the Leaf.

How so?

and the village have

{\an1}changed, this place still
remainshis homeland.

his decision and resolve by

{\an1}immersing himself
in sentimentality

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,562
{\an1}and retracing the past.

Huh, I see.

241
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,435
So you're over
it already, then?

{\an1}That "immersion in
sentimentality to confirm

your resolve to
destroy the Leaf" thing?

of it, all of us were your

{\an1}isn't that right?

247
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:09,185
{\an1}And right now, we're here
inside the Leaf Village,

248
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:12,356
{\an1}with all the strong folk
away fighting in the war.

one little thing.

remove the entry stone?

{\an1}What's important is
what's beneath. Let's go.

260
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,003
{\an1}Well then, I'll get started.

261

{\an1}Death Seal to possess
oneself and guide it forth.

{\an1}Kabuto, his intel was
transferred into me, as well.

303
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,985
{\an1}He'd thoroughly investigated
the six of you that'd been

304
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,987
{\an1}attached to Sasuke.

305
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,991
{\an1}I possess the DNA of those
four too, since I love

306
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,326
collecting and
storing knowledge.

307
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:40,733
{\an1}Suigetsu, Jugo. Take
care of the remaining two.

308
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,435
Okey dokey, Lord
Orochimaru! You got it!

309
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,109
{\an1}Reanimation Jutsu!

310
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,447
[screaming]

311
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,087
Now here goes!

312
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,730
Yes! They who
are all-knowing.

313
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,641
{\an1}The previous Hokage!

314
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:01,407
{\an1}<i>That's the First Hokage? The</i>
<i>real Hashirama who's been</i>

315
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,510
{\an1}<i>touted as a God of Shinobi?</i>

316
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:06,813
{\an1}<i>No way! You solved how to</i>
<i>undo that Sealing Jutsu?</i>

317
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,283
{\an1}<i>Lord First, it appears</i>
<i>we've been recalled into</i>

318
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,484
{\an1}<i>the world of the living.</i>

319
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:12,886
{\an1}<i>Huh? Who the hell are you?</i>

320
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,222
<i>Oh, uh, the</i>
<i>Fourth Hokage, sir.</i>

321
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:20,227
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The</i>
<i>All-Knowing."</i>

322
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,097
{\an1}<i>Oh ho! The Fourth</i>
<i>Hokage, you say?!</i>
