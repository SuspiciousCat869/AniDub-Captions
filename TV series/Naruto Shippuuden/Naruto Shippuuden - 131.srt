Against this foe,

there shall be no
playing it by ear.

We'll be going full
strength from the get-go.

You don't mean--

-Yes, indeed.

I'm summoning the
two great sages.

But it's still going
to take me a little

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,233
while before I'm able to
summon the both of them here.

11
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:39,666
And until that time, I
can't release my hands.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Till then, I'm counting on
you to buy me some time.

Aw, what a bother.

17
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:07,100
Now where do you suppose he ever
found a creature such as that?

18
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,966
Since he's made
himself invisible,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,233
we've got to use
barrier battle arts.

GAMAKEN: He's sure a
tough one to battle.

-As I recall, this
barrier ninjutsu

across its boundary.

to an attack-heavy critter,

I hope you're OK, Mr. Gamaken.

But do you think you can do this
a little bit smoother from here

38
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,566

summoning jutsu?

In any case, we better
get out of here.

We'll kill them one at a time.

-If they simply keep dividing no

pupils of Six Paths?

163
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,386
-Your eyes must be
degrading with age.

164
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,852
-No, it's not your eyes.

165
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:09,986
He's hidden himself inside
a summoning creature

166
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,252
that can make
itself transparent.

167
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,952
-It's got to be one of them
there chameleon species.

168
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,452
-I erected a probe barrier
so I can detect him.

169
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,152
-That will only
maintain a stalemate.

170
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:23,986
Let's drag him out using
creature detection jutsu!

171
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,686
FUKASAKU: Ma, don't
get so excited.

172
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:29,019
You know the only thing
that that's going to do

173
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,319
is give you more wrinkles.

174
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,186
SHIMA: You shut your trap, Pa.

175
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,052
FUKASAKU: But Jiraiya,
boy, why did you

176
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,952
have to fight such an
ornery fellow, anyway?

177
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:40,786
And why go so far as to summon
us to help you fight him?

178
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:43,652
-This opponent happens to
be a former student of mine.

179
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,419
-I never heard one word
of this, Jiraiya, boy.

180
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,252
So, is he the one, then?

181
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,852
-Yes.

182
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,852
[music playing]

183
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:03,652
You summoned me?

184
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,919
-Oh, how nice.

185
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,586
So you've finally come.

186
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,686
-He's dreamt of
you, Jiraiya, boy.

187
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:13,552
And as you are no doubt aware,
his dream was not just a dream.

188
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:16,919
It was a prophecy of the future,
which he will now tell you.

189
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:19,152
So listen carefully.

190
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,419
-Yes.

191
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,452
-I shall now tell you.

192
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:24,519
I will relate my dream.

193
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,419
You, who are singularly pervy,
shall become a great ninja.

194
00:18:28,452 --> 00:18:30,286
And once you do,
you shall acquire

195
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,886
an apprentice of your very own.

196
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,186
That apprentice
will become a ninja

197
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:40,252
who will bring about a great
change in the ninja world.

198
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,719
That is what I
foresaw in my dream.

199
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,052
-A great change?

200
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:46,786
-Either great stability
or great destruction,

201
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,786
the likes of which this
world has never seen.

202
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,452
But which of these
two I cannot say.

203
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,919
-The child of prophecy.

204
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,486
Then why are you
battling him, Jiraiya?

205
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,619
-Well, from what I've
seen of him so far,

206
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,219
it appears he didn't grow
up in the right direction.

207
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,519
And back when I heard that
he and the other two of them

208
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:09,752
had died, I assumed
he couldn't have

209
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:11,819
been the one from the prophecy.

210
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,119
FUKASAKU: Well, in
that case, if he's not

211
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,452
virtuous it's your
duty to kill him.

212
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:18,186
SHIMA: Besides, that
prophecy's probably

213
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:21,686
nothing more than a senile
old geezer's rantings.

214
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,352
All right.

215
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:23,552
Let's do it!

216
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:31,819
Aha, found him!

217
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:36,786
-It's so fast.

218
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,086
-I got you!

219
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,352
There we go.

220
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:52,986
Now you, Pa.

221
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:53,486
-Yo.

222
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,652
-So that's the Rinnegan, huh?

223
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,386
It certainly does look like the
one mentioned in the legend,

224
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:17,286
doesn't it?

225
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:24,486
FUKASAKU: What nasty eyes.

226
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,419
I can't believe he's
the child of prophecy.

227
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:29,419
GREAT TOAD SAGE (VOICEOVER):
You will be the one

228
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:31,552
to guide this
revolutionary change.

229
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:34,019
And eventually,
there will come a day

230
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:37,186
when you will be forced to
make a critical selection.

231
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:38,619
-To make a selection?

232
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:39,652
-Yes.

233
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,752
And whatever choice
you end up making

234
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:46,752
will direct the way that
this change is going to go.

235
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,819
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Great Lord Elder,

236
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:54,386
I wonder if this is that moment
of selection you talked about.

237
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,186
-Summoning jutsu.

238
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:07,586
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): This
time he summoned humans.

239
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:14,986
-You turned out to be a
harbinger of destruction.

240
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,019
And so, as your teacher, it's
my duty to take you down.

241
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:33,920
[music playing]

242
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,512
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Those three--

243
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:06,079
they may look different, but
they all have the same eyes.

244
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:08,346
Even if one of them
is Nagato, I can't

245
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:10,346
believe that there'd be
that many people milling

246
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:11,979
about with a Rinnegan.

247
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:14,812
So just what in the
world is going on here?

248
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,046
There has to be
some kind of trick.

249
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,112
And who or what is this Pain?

250
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:23,646
Next time-- "In Attendance,
the Six Paths of Pain."

251
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,979
Pay close attention.

252
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:28,479
You're not going to want to
miss a second of my battle.
