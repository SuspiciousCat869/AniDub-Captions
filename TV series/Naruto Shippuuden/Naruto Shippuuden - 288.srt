{\an4}<i>Did you hear? Sai of the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf sealed away</i>
<i>one of the Seven Ninja</i>
<i>Swordsmen!</i>

2
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:31,358
{\an7}<i>Looks like you did well,</i>
<i>Sai. I just hope we can</i>
<i>keep morale up for the</i>
<i>whole regiment.</i>

3
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,770
{\an5}<i>Sir, the information on</i>
<i>the Ninja Swordsmen we</i>
<i>requested from HQ has</i>
<i>arrived.</i>

4
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:52,685
{\an4}While the enemy has stopped
all activity, we should take
this opportunity to gather
as much intel as we can.

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,627
{\an1}It's just as I suspected.
They're all quite
fearsome fighters.

6
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,800
{\an7}<i>We need to be very</i>
<i>careful with these</i>
<i>two.</i>

7
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,738
{\an7}<i>We'll be at a</i>
<i>disadvantage in</i>
<i>a group battle.</i>

8
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:08,905
{\an1}Huh?

9
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:19,654
{\an1}<i>Help!</i>

10
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:21,022
{\an1}<i>Help me!</i>

11
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,272
{\an1}<i>What's wrong?</i>

12
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:41,315
{\an1}Ah! It's these strings!
They're controlling my
body! Ahh-ahh!

13
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:46,454
{\an7}<i>Strings?</i>

14
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:47,423
{\an1}Ahhh!

15
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:51,126

{\an1}(sinister laughing)

19
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:28,074
{\an4}He's crucifying them
alive. And taking
pleasure in their
suffering.

20
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,848
{\an1}(painful screams)

21
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,530
{\an1}Stop!

22
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,840
{\an1}Stop it!

23
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,148
{\an1}<i>Is this some kind</i>

24
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,551
(shocked gasp)

25
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:02,887
{\an1}<i>Ran!</i>

{\an1}<i>You are unforgivable!</i>

27

{\an4}<i>I feel sympathy and pain</i>

{\an1}<i>their will. But you...</i>

29
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,236
{\an1}<i>You revel in killing.</i>

30
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,909
{\an1}I hate to think we're
both called shinobi.

31
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:22,578
Hnnh! Stop being so
full of yourself.

32
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:30,121
{\an1}Who gave you permission to
wield the Executioner's
Blade!

33
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,001
{\an1}That blade belongs
to the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist!

34
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,605
(painful grunt)

{\an1}<i>An outsider wielding</i>
<i>the Executioner's Blade?!</i>

37
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,714
{\an1}I don't like
it one bit.

38
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,921
{\an1}Back off!
He's mine!

39
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,217
{\an7}<i>Even though they</i>

{\an7}<i>...when they make</i>
<i>their brutal attacks!</i>

42
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:29,798
{\an1}I'm gonna kill you
and take back the
Executioner's Blade!

43
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,634
{\an1}No, I will.

44
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,738
{\an1}Stay back! I'll
kill you if you
get in my way!

45
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:35,639
(giggle)

46
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm already dead!

47
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:38,743
(annoyed sigh)

48
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,851
{\an7}<i>Going up against these</i>

49
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,657
{\an8}<i>It looks like you're</i>
<i>backed up against</i>

50
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,701

{\an1}<i>...Leaf Hurricanes!</i>

52

53
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,961
{\an1}So sorry I'm
late, Kakashi!

54
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,365
Guy, thanks.

55
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,641
{\an4}Huh? You're the one who
wanted us all to regroup
because it was too dangerous
to work separately in small

56
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,846
{\an1}platoons! So why are you
doing this by yourself?

57
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,317
{\an4}<i>And what's more! You're</i>
<i>up against two of the</i>
<i>Seven Ninja Swordsmen</i>
<i>of the Mist!</i>

58
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,088
I wanted to protect
everyone, but I got
in over my head.

59
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:27,060
{\an7}I figured as much. Anyway,
we should get her away
from here, fast.

60
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,928
Yeah, thanks.

61
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:33,567
{\an5}You know, it's really
kind of creepy to see
you being as grateful
as this. But, still...

62
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:38,040
<i>I guess you feel that</i>
<i>way because you opponents</i>
<i>are just that strong!</i>

63
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,642
{\an1}(sinister chuckling)

64
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:45,650
<i>Where am I?</i>

65
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,718
(gasp)

66
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,956
That man! He killed
all my comrades!

67
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,997
{\an4}<i>I know. I'm sorry. Listen,</i>
<i>we'll take care of the</i>
<i>enemy. You go regroup with</i>
<i>the main regiment.</i>

68
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,100
But, the two of you!

69
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,138
{\an5}We'll be fine. While
we're fighting them,
you're only going to
get in the way.

70
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,114
<i>Be careful.</i>

71
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:20,196
{\an4}Now then, how dare you
treat our comrades like
they're mere toys for
you to play with!

72
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,735
{\an5}Careful, Guy. That's
Kushimaru Kuriarare, who
wields the Long Blade
"Nuibari", the Sewing

73
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:31,475
{\an5}Needle, and Jinpachi
Munashi, who wields the
Explosive Blade, "Shibuki",
the Splatter. One killed his

74
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,014
master and the other
his brother, along with
countless other cruel acts.

75
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,351
Yeah, and if you get
in my way, I'll kill
you, too!

76
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,854
(chuckling)

77
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,228
{\an5}I guess you could call
them the cold-blooded
combo. We've got to
stay focused.

78
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:51,068
{\an4}That's no problem at all!
You may call them the
cold-blooded combo, but
we're the comrade combo!

79
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,436
{\an1}Oh...'kay.

80
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:56,876
{\an1}And enemy's a match
for the Hidden Leaf's
invincible comrade combo!

81
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:00,614
{\an1}(determined grunt)

82
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:06,288
{\an7}<i>They're full of openings</i>

<i>underestimated my speed!</i>

84
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:13,563
{\an7}<i>He takes big swings</i>

00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:27,382
{\an7}<i>His Long Blade!</i>

87
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,295
{\an1}Guy, watch out!

88
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,229
{\an3}Huh?

89
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:46,105
{\an1}Ninja Art Long Blade!
Stitching Spider!

90
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:49,977

{\an1}(struggling grunts)

92
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,449
{\an1}No! This thing won't break!

93
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,485
Ahhhghh!

94
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,423
{\an1}Explosive Blade Jutsu!

95
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:01,525
{\an1}<i>Multiple Explosions</i>
<i>of Death!</i>

96
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,161
{\an1}Guy!

97
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,831
{\an1}Forget about me! Go
on, get out of here!

98
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,629
{\an1}It looks like you saved
me again, Kakashi.

99
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,631
{\an1}Earth Style!
Multi Mud Wall!

100
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:47,084
{\an5}I was far too naive.
I'd read all the data on
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist, but I never

101
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:50,889
expected them to take
advantage of being
reanimated so effectively.

102
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,459
{\an1}<i>Kakashi, did they...</i>

103
00:10:53,658 --> 00:11:00,567
{\an5}Yeah, they got my eye.
I think it's only
temporary, but still,
this is bad.

104
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:22,963
{\an4}Two of the reanimated
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of
the Mist are our enemies,
and we're both in bad shape.

105
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,666
{\an1}It certainly doesn't
look too good for us.

106
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,135
<i>Guy...</i>

107
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:31,442
{\an7}It's okay. I've survived
a lot of tough situations
like this one before.

108
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,011
{\an7}And there's something
I think of every time.

109
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,720
{\an1}<i>Three kunai knives and</i>
<i>one paper bomb. That's</i>
<i>all we have left.</i>

110
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:46,961
{\an5}And not only that, but
the Hidden Stone's elite
have us completely
surrounded outside.

111
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:50,533
{\an1}<i>Yeah, they're sure to</i>
<i>attack us first thing</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

112
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:56,273
{\an4}But, guys! There's no
need for us to worry!
Even if we're short on
Ninja Tools, I still

113
00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:00,645
{\an4}have my two fists!
All we have to do is
break through the
enemy lines!

114
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,218
{\an4}<i>Guy, give it a rest.</i>
Your overconfidence is
what got us stuck here
in the first place!

115
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:10,225
{\an4}Did you forget already?!
Haven't you learned?!
Don't do anything on
your own!

116
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,495
Why are you being
such a wet blanket?!

117
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:17,033
{\an5}I say that we just make
it our next rival challenge
to see which one of us is
able to break through the

118
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,335
enemy lines before
the other one!

119
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,637
{\an1}Shinobi who defy
orders are scum!

120
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,878
{\an4}I am your captain! If
you can't follow my
orders, it's time for you
to quit being a shinobi!

121
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,668
{\an1}I-I just don't want
that to ever happen
again.

122
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:48,574
Kakashi...
Are you okay?

123
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,023
{\an7}<i>That's right!</i>
<i>Follow me!</i>

124
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:05,496
{\an7}<i>Don't worry, guys.</i>
<i>I'll be a decoy.</i>

125
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:10,302
{\an7}<i>If I draw the enemy</i>
<i>off, you'll have a</i>
<i>greater chance of</i>
<i>escaping.</i>

126
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:18,045
{\an4}I'm Might Guy, the Noble
Blue Beast of the Hidden
Leaf! I don't die that
easily!

127
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:21,182
(painful grunt)

128
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,186
{\an1}I'm not finished yet!

129
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:26,256
{\an1}Agh!

130
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,261
{\an7}<i>No, not yet! I need</i>
<i>to buy more time until</i>
<i>dawn!</i>

{\an1}(sinister chuckling)

132
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:43,311
{\an4}<i>Sorry, Kakashi. I let</i>

<i>right. Maybe I'm not</i>
<i>suited to be a shinobi.</i>

133
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,113
{\an1}<i>Kakashi!</i>

134
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:47,950
{\an1}We'll talk later! Let's
just get out of here
for now!

135
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:08,076
I'm all out of chakra.
I can't use any more
big techniques.

136
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,819
{\an1}Why did you
come, Kakashi?

137
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,256
Because you defied
my orders.

138
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,626
{\an1}I'm not worthy of
being a shinobi,
am I?

139
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,460
{\an3}No...

140
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:27,669
{\an5}In the Shinobi World,
orders are absolute.
But you defied orders
to save the life of

141
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:34,176
{\an5}your friends. And, well,
if I couldn't tell the
difference, I'd be a
failure as a captain.

142
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,211
{\an1}You mean...

143
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,786
{\an4}Besides which, I think
that your plan actually
could have succeeded. I
mean, we've been able to

144
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:46,125
{\an4}draw the enemy away,
after all. Rin should
have regrouped with the
main squad by now.

145
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,860
{\an1}So all that's left...

146
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,732
{\an7}<i>I have to take</i>
<i>care of him.</i>

147
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,946
{\an1}This is not good, Guy!

148
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:14,895
Stone Shinobi use jutsu
formulas that cover
a wide area.

149
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:25,777
{\an1}Wait! I thought you
told me that you ran
out of chakra!

150
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,280
(powerful yell)

151
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,252
Chidori!

152
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:07,329
{\an7}<i>He cut through lightning</i>
<i>with Chidori? But I</i>
<i>thought that he was all</i>
<i>out of chakra!</i>

153
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,301
{\an1}<i>You all right, Kakashi?</i>

154
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:18,143
{\an5}It's strange. I thought
I was all out of chakra,
but then... when I thought
about saving my friends,

155
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,079
it came out of nowhere.

156
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,582
(shocked gasps)

157
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:30,828
{\an4}I'll tell you what,
why don't you rest
up a bit. I'll handle
these guys.

158
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:34,431
But you can't run on
those legs, let alone
fight.

159
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:38,771
{\an4}If I can't use my
legs, I'll use my
arms. If I can't use
those, I'll use my

160
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:39,805
{\an1}hands or mouth!

161
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,877
{\an1}I'll struggle all the
way right until the bitter
end to save my friends.

162
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:47,114
{\an1}Just like you did
now to save me!

163
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,084
{\an1}Friends, huh?

164
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:59,230
{\an1}You can't see right now,
so don't try to push
yourself, Kakashi!

165
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:04,804
{\an4}<i>If I can't see. I'll</i>
<i>sense things with sound.</i>
<i>Or I'll use smell, or</i>
<i>even my skin!</i>

166
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:08,776
{\an5}<i>I'll struggle all the</i>
<i>way right until the</i>
<i>bitter end to save</i>
<i>my friends!</i>

167
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,580
{\an7}So you remember that
time, too, huh? All
right, then, let's go!

168
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,582
{\an3}Yeah!

169
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,569
C'mon! Bring it on!

170
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:30,871
(annoyed grunt)

171
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:39,883
{\an1}(swinging grunts)

172
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,718
{\an1}(attacking grunts)

173
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:43,855
(throwing grunt)

174
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,590
{\an1}Hm?

175
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,093
(attack yell)

176
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:02,946
{\an1}All right, let's do this!

177
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,149
{\an1}Don't underestimate me!

178
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:06,985
{\an1}Ahhhghh!

179
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:16,330
{\an4}<i>Hnnh! Well, it seems that</i>
<i>repeating our rival</i>
<i>challenge wasn't actually</i>
<i>a waste of time, after all.</i>

180
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,564
{\an3}Hm?

181
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,635
Even if I can't see
you, I know exactly
where you are!

182
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:25,507
{\an4}<i>And by matching your</i>
<i>movements, I can tell</i>
<i>where the enemy is!</i>
<i>It's like I can see.</i>

183
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:36,188
{\an1}Move it!

184
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:39,158
You move! Or better
yet, disappear!

185
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,529
{\an1}That's it! I've had it!
I'm going to take care
of you first!

186
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,669
You don't think of
your comrades as
comrades.

187
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,538
So in reality, you
two were never a
match for us.

188
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:51,173
Just shut up!

189
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:52,309
(forceful grunt)

190
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,882
{\an1}Substitution Jutsu?

191
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:58,182
(shocked gasp)

192
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:02,990
{\an1}(attacking grunt)

193
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:08,363
{\an1}<i>You idiot! Now</i>
<i>I can't dodge!</i>

194
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,100
(painful grunt)

195
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:13,302
(painful grunt)

196
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,240
{\an1}Did we do it?

197
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,476
{\an1}Ugh! Damn it!

198
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:22,548
{\an7}I'm completely done with
this stupid fight! Now
you're really going to
get it!

199
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:24,383
{\an1}Watch out, Kakashi!
Get back!

200
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:28,255
{\an5}I'm going to use my
Explosive Blade to
blow up this whole
area!

201
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:32,127
<i>Hey! We may be</i>
<i>immortal, but if you</i>
<i>do that, we'll die!</i>

202
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,931
{\an1}Maybe, but we won't
know until we try it!

203
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:37,267
{\an1}<i>Shadow Paralysis</i>
<i>Jutsu!</i>

204
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,302
{\an1}What! Hey, I
can't move!

205
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:44,844
{\an1}Captain Kakashi!

206
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,220
{\an1}Don't worry! I've
brought the Sealing
Team with me!

207
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,427
{\an1}Hm. So you're able to
see once again, huh,
Kakashi?

208
00:19:58,461 --> 00:19:59,629
Yeah...

209
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,735
{\an1}<i>Get these two</i>
<i>sealed away</i>
<i>quickly!</i>

210
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,369
Yes, sir!

211
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,411
{\an1}I just knew it! I knew
you'd be able to avenge
their horrible deeds!

212
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,154
Retreat!

213
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,691
(shocked gasps)

214
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,526
Huh?

215
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:35,308
{\an1}You made it just in
time, Guy and Kakashi!

216
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,920
{\an4}When a shinobi takes the
power that's at his
command and uses it for
his friends' sake rather

217
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:47,658
{\an1}than for himself, his
power becomes multiplied
beyond belief.

218
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:51,462
{\an1}That's the lesson that
I learned on that day
long ago.

219
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,138
{\an4}<i>I'm able to produce</i>
<i>unfathomable power when</i>
<i>it comes to my friends.</i>
<i>It's strange...</i>

220
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:01,075
Yeah...that's right.

221
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:05,714
I think that this war
is helping everyone
realize that very thing.

222
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:10,188
{\an4}All right, come on!
We'd better go look
for the other platoons
now.

223
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:11,856
{\an1}<i>I agree.</i>

224
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:14,025
{\an1}We'll need everyone's help!

225
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,261
Yeah!

226
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:00,028
{\an1}<i>Ameyuri Ringo...</i>

227
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,733
{\an5}<i>One of the Seven Ninja</i>
<i>Swordsmen. She wields the</i>
<i>Lightning Blade, "Kiba",</i>
<i>the Fang.</i>

228
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,970
{\an1}<i>Who is this Ameyuri</i>
<i>Ringo, anyway?</i>

229
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:11,142
{\an4}<i>Stop hiding! Isn't there</i>
<i>anyone here at all who</i>
<i>can send shockwaves</i>
<i>through my heart?!</i>

230
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:15,581
<i>Ah ha! At last, someone</i>
<i>who isn't afraid to</i>
<i>face me!</i>

231
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:20,822
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Lightning</i>
<i>Blade: Ameyuri Ringo!"</i>

232
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:23,325
{\an1}<i>And I won't let</i>
<i>you get away!</i>
