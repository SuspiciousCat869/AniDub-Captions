-Sasuke!

trouble finding Sasuke, huh?

After all, it is a
rather large hideout.

00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,322
It could take them a long time.

12
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:09,892
You know, what they really need
is a detailed map of the place,

13
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:14,296
but the only map is
the one inside my head.

-I know what you're driving at.

you to show me the way.

-Hmm.

Look, my mission is to keep you
here and stand guard over you.

18
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,544
If you think I'm going to let
you back inside your hideout,

19
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:31,614
then you must be
out of your mind.

the last room on this level.

one and search there.

Remember, the others
are searching too.

There's no need to
push yourself so hard.

00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,990
-Shut up.

31
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:23,859
This is no time to be resting.

-Easy, Sakura.

37
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,385
Don't get too impatient now.

38
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,321
We're deep in Orochimaru's lair.

39
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,291
There could be a trap
around every corner.

40
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:03,559
You got to be more careful.

41
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,260
We don't want him
to learn we're here.

-What about Naruto?

-Nothing yet.

47
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:17,819
But we will find Sasuke.

48
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,821
It's only a matter of time.

49
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,658
But until then, Sakura,
you must be careful.

you and Sakura take this way,

170
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,745
and I'll take the other?

171
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:03,558
-What's this?

172
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,265
-Hmm.

173
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,333
He finished it.

174
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,502
He finally remembered.

175
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:14,636
He told me.

176
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,738
It was a picture of
their dream, the one

177
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,675
he wanted to show his brother.

178
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:22,678
-Look how both of
them are smiling.

179
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,246
-I know.

180
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:27,182
I saw him smile for the
first time when he drew it.

181
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,418
I mean, a real smile,
from the heart.

182
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:33,055
-Huh?

183
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:45,534
[gasp]

184
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,069
-What's this doing here?

185
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:52,407
-What is it?

186
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,590
-Look.

187
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:10,692
This was in Sai's pack.

188
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:13,161
This is an ANBU Black
Ops list of targets

189
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,298
that obviously Sai's been
assigned to assassinate.

190
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:19,167
In other words,
it's a bingo book.

191
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,269
-An assassination list?

192
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,473
-Why have those faces
been crossed off?

193
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:27,275
-It can only mean
that those are targets

194
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,677
that have already
been assassinated.

195
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:36,785
-What's Sai doing with
something like that?

196
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:40,355
[gasp]

197
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,769
-Look at this.

198
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:56,738
-But-- hold on, that's--

199
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,773
-Wait a minute.

200
00:19:57,806 --> 00:19:59,141
I don't understand.

201
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,810
What is Sasuke
doing on Sai's list?

202
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,741
[theme music - in japanese]

203
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,697
NARUTO: Sasuke on Sai's list?

204
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,165
I don't get it!

205
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:06,568
SAKURA: So all this
time, Sai's real mission

206
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,136
was to assassinate Sasuke!

207
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:08,611
NARUTO: No.

208
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:09,879
It can't be.

209
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,448
Sai promised me he was
going to save Sasuke.

210
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,183
YAMATO: I hate to say
it, but it appears

211
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,651
that that was all
nothing but an act.

212
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:17,787
NARUTO: But he-- What was that?

213
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,789
SAKURA: Could it
mean Sai found him?

214
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:20,656
NARUTO: No.

215
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,325
YAMATO: I sense he's not far.

216
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:22,766
Hurry.

217
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,368
Let's move.

218
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:25,669
-Next time.

219
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:26,903
Reunion.

220
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:30,474
[theme music - in japanese]

221
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:45,389
-Our subject today is
the ANBU Black Ops,

222
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:47,224
of which I used to be a member.

223
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:51,161
Its official title is the ANBU
Black Ops Special Tactical

224
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:51,895
Unit.

225
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:53,630
Its operatives are
carefully chosen

226
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,532
from among the village Shinobi.

227
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,801
Unlike other units,
the ANBU Black Ops

228
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,238
are under the direct
command of the Hokage.

229
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,707
Due to the highly sensitive
nature of their missions,

230
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,376
the identities of these
operatives are kept secret

231
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,645
and they always wear masks.

232
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,347
The information they
share is guarded

233
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,449
by the strictest security.

234
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:15,485
Well, at least it's
supposed to be.

235
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,654
Did you know the
Great Kakashi-sensei

236
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,723
was an ANBU Black Op as well?

237
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,659
Here's some rare early film
footage taken during his time

238
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,361
with the unit.

239
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:25,796
Of course, I'm not
allowed to show you

240
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:29,299
most of the things that went
on, but-- well, as you can see,

241
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:33,570
Kakashi always had a
knack with ninja hounds.

242
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:36,773
Don't tell Kakashi I
showed that to you.

243
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,376
Just keep it between us.
