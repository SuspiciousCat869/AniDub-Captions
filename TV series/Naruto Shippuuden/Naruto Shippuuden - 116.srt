00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,266
-Can I ask you
something, Sasuke?

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,333
-What is it?

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,166
-Why are you dragging
a team together?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,500
-Because I have a goal, and
having a team will let me

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,033
reach that goal faster.

8
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,700
Ever since I joined
up with Orochimaru,

9
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,166
I've been preparing for
when this would happen.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,466
I have been carefully selecting
the most powerful shinobi

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,266
who catch my eye.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,766
-Hm, OK.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,166
But I'm still not sure why
you would choose Karin.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,966
You could do better.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,466
I mean, unlike me, she was
one of Orochimaru's followers.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,433
She's the warden of
the whole South Hideout

17
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:54,266
where Orochimaru kept this
test subjects locked up.

[wind blowing]

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,733
Though she claimed
that she was only

20
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:11,200
following Orochimaru's
orders, she personally

21
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,466
experimented on me many times.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,433
But most of all, I don't like
that personality of hers.

23
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:19,233
-There may be plenty
of other shinobi

24
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,266
who are just as strong,
yet far easier to handle.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,633
However, she has
a special ability,

26
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,600
one that no one else
I know of possesses.

27
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,633
-That's true.

28
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,300
I guess she's got
that going for her.

But also, there's
that foul stench.

They should at least build
a fence, or something.

-She has this place
under complete control.

There's no need
for anything else.

I don't like it.

It's making me start to wonder
if word of Orochimaru's death

has reached her already.

Well, what if it's all true?

to the others who

-Why is he here, and why now?

It's been ages since we last
saw him here with Orochimaru.

-Oh, that's it.

Why isn't Orochimaru with him?

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,333
And why is Sasuke here
with some stranger?

00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,500
I think the rumor we heard
is actually true, after all.

Orochimaru is finally dead.

-Of course, Sasuke must have
really killed Orochimaru.

And now he's come here to grant
us all our freedom at last.

that can only mean one thing.

come here, Sasuke?

he wants to talk to you.

But we don't want to stand
and talk, so take us to a room

this out here in the hall,

so just take us
inside, right now.

Don't think I don't
know that you're just

it off, Karin.

would I go with you?

There's still a lot
of prisoners here.

00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:08,406
-Speaking of which,
they were awfully quiet

114

when we walked by them.

115
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,440
They must know that
Orochimaru is dead.

116
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,173
That news had to have
reached here by now.

117
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,073
I've noticed that the
number of prisoners

118
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:22,140
is slightly smaller than it
was the last time I was here.

119
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:25,206
When we came in, I also
saw signs of recent digging

120
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,440
in the grounds near the front
of the entrance to this hideout.

121
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:31,840
Karin, I know that you possess
a razor-sharp intellect,

122
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:34,906
and that you're an expert
at controlling information.

123
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,540
-Of course, rumors
of Orochimaru's death

124
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,340
started circulating
among the prisoners.

125
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:41,973
So to keep them from staging
a riot and trying to escape,

126
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,106
you put some sort
of plan in place.

127
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,573

-Yeah.

-You've planted a spy
among the inmates,

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,106
so if anyone starts
asking about Orochimaru--

Karin, it's your
cautious nature that

138
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,106
has kept the peace in
this prison for so long.

139
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,140
In fact, it's what's
kept you alive.

-Hey, you don't have to
put it that way, you know.

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,973
-Well, there's no doubt
that Orochimaru trained you.

You're scary.

143
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:42,206
I bet you sensed our
presence long before we even

144
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,840
arrived at your door.

145
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:47,306
And you probably thought up
half a dozen ways to kill us.

146
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,906
-I would have, if
it were just you.

147
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,340
-Aw, you'd never take
down Sasuke, right?

148
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,106
-I didn't say that, idiot.

149
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,106
Sasuke's my colleague.

150
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,440
It's different.

151
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:58,473
Besides, I wanted to see if
the rumors were really true.

I wanted to find out if
he had killed Orochimaru.

that so casually?

here and take over.

through to maintain order.

-No, a woman-- a
woman might be nice.

329
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:10,594
But then again,
yeah, maybe a man.

330
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,094
Yeah, a man will be good.

331
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:20,027
No, a woman-- got to be a woman.

332
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,961
A woman?

333
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:25,094
No, a man's better.

SEIGETSU: Uh, more walking?

337
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:05,494
I'm at the end of my rope.

338
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,494
-We're talking about
the North Hideout.

339
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,127
If you're this weak
now, you'll probably

340
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,794
be killed the instant
you get there.

341
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,094
-Is that right?

342
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:14,427
I didn't know that place was
going to be so dangerous.

343
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,527
KARIN: Yeah, the North Hideout
isn't your ordinary hideout.

344
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,060
SEIGETSU: What's that mean?

345
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,394
KARIN: It's for human
experimentation,

346
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,860
and it houses all the
uncontrollable monsters

347
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:27,427
that the experiments
produce there.

of the Northern Hideout."

-Time for Naruto
Uzumaki's Swirling Radio.

351
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:39,094
Say hello to our guest.

352
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,360
-Hi, I'm Kakashi Hatake.

353
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,327
-Well, let's get
right to the point.

354
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,427
Can you please stop
ad-libbing during rehearsals?

355
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,594
It's really annoying.

356
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,127
-What are you talking about?

357
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,627
I just do that to keep
everyone relaxed and happy.

358
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,727
-Well, you sure
seem to enjoy it.

359
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,527
-Oh, that's just an act.

360
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,660
-Sure, whatever.

361
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:57,327
Thanks.

362
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,394
Just got a postcard.

363
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,727
It's from listener
Super B Scroll.

364
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,794
He writes, I've been thinking of
a nickname for Kakashi Sensei.

365
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:05,894
I think Pervy Hedgehog fits.

366
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,027
What do you think?

367
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
-There goes my dignity.

368
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:10,860
-Moving on to a note
from another listener,

369
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:12,294
Sparkling Maiden.

370
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,794
She writes, frankly, why
aren't you married yet?

371
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,260
And how come you're
always way late

372
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,727
when your team is
supposed to meet.

373
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,094
That's so rude.

374
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:21,327
And stop reading your indecent
books in front of everyone.

375
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
That's sexual
harassment, you know.

-Kakashi Sensei,
what's the matter?

379
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,127
Will you come back
again, Kakashi Sensei?

380
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,494
-No, never again.
