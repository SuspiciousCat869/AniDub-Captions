1
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:24,466
What's up with
Minato Sensei?!

2
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,871
He tells us to
assemble and then he's late!

3
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:27,873
[sigh]

4
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,074
{\an1}Give me a break!

5
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,410
{\an1}You're one to talk!

6
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:31,446
Hey?!

7
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,648
You heard me!

8
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:33,951
{\an1}Come on you two, stop it!

9
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,319
{\an1}Hey, you wanna go?!

10
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:36,188
[scoff]

11
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,357
Hey, hold up!

12
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,927
{\an1}Did you just scoff
at me, Kakashi?!

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,396
{\an1}So what if I did?

14
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:41,732
{\an1}Sorry to keep you waiting.

15
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,334
{\an1}You're all here, I see.

16
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,977
Minato Sensei!

17
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,547
Do we have
a new mission?!

18
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,017
{\an1}No, sorry, not today.

19
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,593
What are those?

20
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,664
Applications.

21
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:02,037
{\an1}I've recommended you three
for promotion to Chunin.

22
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:13,725
Minato Sensei,
you're the best!

23
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:14,961
Hey...

24
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,963
Listen!

25
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,800
{\an1}Just hold on a minute!

26
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,071
{\an1}You'll have to get through
the Chunin Exams first.

27
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:21,807
Aww...

28
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,647
{\an1}The Exams are divided into
three separate parts, and

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,052
each one of them
is quite difficult.

30
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,456
{\an1}Are you kidding me?

31
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,560
[giggle]

32
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:34,464
{\an1}You'll never pass 'cause
you aren't capable of making

33
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,300
{\an1}it to a rendezvous on time.

34
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,469
{\an1}What did you say?!

35
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,006
{\an1}Hey, you guys, calm down!

36
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,541
So, anyway...

37
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,779
{\an1}You've worked together
well and earned

38
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,983
{\an1}the right to take
the Chunin Exam.

39
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,820
That's why I
recommended you for it.

40
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:50,360
{\an1}However, it isn't
compulsory to participate.

41
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,633
{\an1}It's entirely up to you if
you take the exam or not.

42
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,269
[chuckle]

43
00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:59,176
Let's do it!

44
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:09,096
{\an1}[nervous groans] The hell!

45
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,700
{\an1}I thought for the Chunin
Exams were for stuff like

46
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:15,641
{\an1}ninjutsu and taijutsu,
not some lame written test!

47
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,812
I'm the worst at
stuff like this!

48
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,364
{\an1}Finished already?!

49
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,734
Yes.

50
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,215
{\an1}Damn that Kakashi!

51
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,621
Aw, man!

52
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:42,457
{\an1}I'm totally done for.

53
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:48,568
[gasp]

54
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:03,264
I'm always
watching you...

55
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,214
Rin...

56
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,997
There it is!

57
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,199
I did it!

58
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,235
[giggle]

59
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:47,346
Damn Kakashi!

60
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,982
Well...

61
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,118
Huh?

62
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,486
{\an1}What'd you expect?

63
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,461
Shut up!

64
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:56,830
That was just a
written test!

65
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,133
Just wait!

66
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,134
You'll see!

67
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,169
{\an1}I'll find my name!

68
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,907
I know I passed!

69
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:23,446
I guess not...

70
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,448
[gasp]

71
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,483
Obito!

72
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,485
Look!

73
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,520
There!

74
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,044
I did it!

75
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:41,547
{\an1}Lucked into an open slot.

76
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,084
{\an1}That's so like you.

77
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,252
What was that?!

78
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,455
{\an1}Come on, you two.

79
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,656
{\an1}Don't start this again!

80
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,461
There's no time
to celebrate!

81
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,933
{\an1}If you passed, find
your assigned class.

82
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,537
{\an1}We'll explain the
next part of the exam.

83
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,282
Part Two will
begin in three days.

84
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:02,152
It'll test your
physical skills.

85
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:04,356
{\an1}You'll need to use
everything you've learned

86
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,898
{\an1}about taijutsu and ninjutsu
or you won't pass this exam!

87
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:10,734
All right!

88
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:11,904
I got this!

89
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:13,640
{\an1}Also, this test will pit
your team against

90
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,310
{\an1}several other teams.

91
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:16,513
[gasps]

92
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,249
It's not an
individual test?!

93
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:19,718
Kakashi!

94
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,789
{\an1}You'd better not drag
us down, you understand?

95
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,459
[sigh]

96
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,995
{\an1}Right back at ya.

97
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,864
{\an1}You're usually the one
doing the dragging.

98
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,435
What?!

99
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,004
{\an1}Enough, you guys!

100
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:31,274
Just stop it!

101
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:43,229
{\an1}Above all, don't be
late this time, all right?

102
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,264
Yeah!

103
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,333
I know that!

104
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,580
{\an1}Kakashi Hatake's also
participating, right?

105
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:11,582
Yes.

106
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,951
{\an1}He's part of the next team.

107
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,187
Ah.

108
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,557
{\an1}I look forward to it.

109
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,039
All right!

110
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,741
Five minutes
left, Team Minato.

111
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,111
You positive
he'll make it?!

112
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,280
Yes!

113
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:48,116
{\an1}I'm sure he's gonna be
here any minute now.

114
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,357
{\an1}You realize that if
time runs out, you'll be

115
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,293
{\an1}automatically disqualified.

116
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:55,164
[sighs]

117
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:56,065
I knew it!

118
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,002
{\an1}Didn't I tell you
this would happen?!

119
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:59,706
{\an1}You're too easy on him, Rin.

120
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,744
{\an1}That's why he'll never break
this habit of being late!

121
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,815
{\an1}He'll be here soon.

122
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,652
{\an1}I bet that something must've
happened to hold him up a

123
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,955
{\an1}just little bit, that's all.

124
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,492
{\an1}He'll make it in time!

125
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,861
I know he will!

126
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,132
Hmph, I
wouldn't be so sure.

127
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,153
Oh, thank you!

128
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:26,555
{\an1}Here, have some candy.

129
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,298
It's three p.m.

130
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,201
{\an1}It's time to begin now.

131
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,306
{\an1}We're going to fail
this all because of him!

132
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,012
I know he'll...

133
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,683
Sorry I'm late!

134
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,461
You see?!

135
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,633
{\an1}I told you Obito would
make it no matter what!

136
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,502
Hurry, before
we're disqualified!

137
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,438
C'mon!

138
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:57,480
Close one...

139
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,886
{\an1}Now we'll start part
two, the team competition.

140
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,956
{\an1}Preliminary qualifiers...

141
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,460
Begin!

142
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:06,997
[attacking yell]

143
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:09,302
[gasp]

144
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,104
Fire Style!

145
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,373
Fireball!

00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,609
[choking]

147
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,312
{\an1}I'll make you pay me
back in full for the

148
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,849
{\an1}last time that we fought!

149
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,418
{\an1}The last time we fought?

150
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,787
What?!

151
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,491
{\an1}Don't tell me you
don't remember?!

152
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:57,927
{\an1}Just who are you?

153
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,831
{\an1}And what have I done
to earn your wrath?

154
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:00,899
Why you!

155
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,602
{\an1}Don't treat me like a fool!

156
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,071
Do your best!

157
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,307
Obito!

158
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,284
All right!

159
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,386
Just watch me!

160
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:13,756
Begin!

161
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:15,626
Huh?!

162
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,836
{\an1}The winner is Might Guy!

163
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:23,508
{\an1}What was he doing?

164
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,202
Do your best!

165
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,441
Go!

166
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,044
Kakashi!

167
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,636
Stop!

168
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:57,940
The winner is...

169
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,341
Kakashi Hatake!

170
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,145
He did it!

171
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,213
[chuckle]

172
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:11,331
{\an1}You passed the Chunin
Exams on your first try?!

173
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,034
{\an1}Kakashi, you're amazing!

174
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,404
Right, Obito?

175
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,180
Obito?

176
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:38,882
[sigh]

177
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,392
So this is
where you've been!

178
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,169
{\an1}Oh, uh, it's you.

179
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,381
{\an1}It's only natural
that Kakashi would pass.

180
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,852
{\an1}But we can do it,
too, I know we can!

181
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:02,192
{\an1}We'll just practice
hard for next year!

182
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,864
{\an1}But it's hard to get
motivated after

183
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,500
{\an1}watching Kakashi.

184
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:08,905
{\an1}What are you saying?!

185
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:10,007
Huh?!

186
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,351
You're gonna be
Hokage, right?

187
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,794
{\an1}Obito, I'll always
be watching you.

188
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,169
Okay!

189
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,270
Obito?

190
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:03,574
[chuckle]

191
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,010
I did it!

192
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,714
{\an1}I'm a Chunin now!

193
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,819
Wow, nice job!

194
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:19,137
{\an1}Meet me later at the park
underneath the cherry tree.

195
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:25,782
Today for sure!

196
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,719
{\an1}I'm going to tell Rin
how I feel about her!

197
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,061
I know!

198
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:32,996
I'm late!

199
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:33,930
Sorry...

200
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:35,066
No, it's okay!

201
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,001
Everyone!

202
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,770
Everyone?!

203
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:40,009
Why are?!

204
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,379
Why are all of
these people here?!

205
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,751
{\an1}I asked them to come
here so we could all

206
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,621
discuss the
gift, of course!

207
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,024
Huh?

208
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,126
{\an1}What do you mean?

209
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,262
{\an1}What gift is that?!

210
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:52,833
{\an1}Well, Kakashi's being
promoted to Jonin, right?

211
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:53,567
So!

212
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,638
{\an1}I figured we should give
him some kind of present to

213
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,174
celebrate!

214
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,712
{\an1}"Mission to get gifts
for Kakashi's promotion?"

215
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,749
{\an1}Kakashi's a Jonin?

216
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:02,717
That's right.

217
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,221
Didn't you know
about it, Obito?

218
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,959
{\an1}I think it's something
that we should all be

219
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,130
{\an1}proud of as his classmates.

220
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:10,866
Uh, yeah...

221
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,683
{\an1}So what do you think Kakashi
would appreciate getting?

222
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,322
{\an1}Well since we're talking
about Kakashi, it

223
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,623
{\an1}should be something useful.

224
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,414
{\an1}Now it's time for us to
do some combat training.

225
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,551
It might just be
training, but if you don't

226
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,254
{\an1}stay alert, it can be fatal.

227
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,523
Got it?

228
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:42,425
Yes!

229
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:19,362
Uh... Well...
I guess that's that, huh?

230
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,005
{\an1}Show me your left hand!

231
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,375
Oh...

232
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:28,678
{\an1}Uh, it's nothing,
Rin, I swear, really!

233
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,449
{\an1}It's just a scrape.

234
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,753
A little spit'll
take care of it...

235
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:33,788
Enough!

236
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,157
Show me!

237
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,509
I just messed
up a little bit.

238
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,412
Got some dust
in my eyes and...

239
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,094
[laughter]

240
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,132
{\an1}Well, a guy's gotta have
a scar or two to get some

241
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:59,836
{\an1}cred, like a badge of honor,
you know what I'm saying?

242
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,475
{\an1}I was just thinking how I
needed a little something

243
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,145
cool like that!

244
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:07,217
So really this
wound's kinda- Oww!

245
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:15,534
{\an1}Don't act tough and
hide your wounds!

246
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,937
I am always
watching, you know.

247
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,145
{\an1}You promised me you'd
become Hokage, Obito.

248
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:26,085
{\an1}Listen, I want to
stop this war, too.

249
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,960
{\an1}Just like you, I truly
want to save the world!

250
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:34,202
{\an1}And that's why I've decided
I'm gonna stick by your side

251
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,736
{\an1}and watch over you.

252
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,582
{\an1}You told me that saving you
was pretty much the same as

253
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,419
saving the whole
world, remember?

254
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:51,500
Mm-hm!

255
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,939
{\an1}Well then, since I'm keeping
an eye on you, you can't

256
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,311
hide anything
from me anymore.

257
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:02,887
{\an1}Go for it, Obito!

258
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,393
{\an1}Become Hokage and
show me just how

259
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,397
{\an1}you're gonna save
the whole world.

260
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,135
{\an1}And that's another
promise for you to keep!

261
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,073
Let's go!

262
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,809
[giggle]

263
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,299
Obito...

264
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,637
You told Kakashi
Sensei you'd discard

265
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,574
{\an1}all your memories and
all your feelings

266
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,577
{\an1}about your comrades.

267
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,715
{\an1}But when you became Ten
Tails' Jinchuriki and were

268
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,286
about to be
taken over by it...

269
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,903
{\an1}[discomforted yell]

270
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,811
{\an1}Didn't you try back then to
suppress Ten Tails because

271
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,648
{\an1}you didn't want that?

272
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,620
[screaming]

273
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,636
{\an1}The reason why you won
against Ten Tails and could

274
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,708
{\an1}manipulate it was because
you stood firm on not

275
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:46,282
{\an1}throwing away the past
and stayed yourself, right?

276
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,824
{\an1}You just couldn't discard
all the memories of my Dad,

277
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,595
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei, or
this Rin, could you?

278
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:58,839
{\an1}That's how you were able to
stay Obito even after you

279
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,108
became Ten
Tails' Jinchuriki.

280
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:05,217
Am I wrong?

281
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,503
{\an1}But dragging everyone onto
your path and continuing

282
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:19,410
{\an1}down it with all of them
just cannot be allowed!

283
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:23,049
I'm bringing you
back as Obito Uchiha,

284
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,954
{\an1}a shinobi of the Leaf.

285
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:28,293
{\an1}And you're going to
atone for your sins.

286
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,605
You tried to run
away from everything.

287
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:40,383
{\an1}The only thing that awaits
you is your worst nightmare,

288
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,986
{\an1}which you know very well!

289
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,897
Solitude!

290
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,970
{\an1}So why keep living
in reality, huh?

291
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:54,609
{\an1}Now come join us, Naruto!

292
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:58,951
{\an1}I bet I know what this Rin
person would say this if she

293
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,255
{\an1}were still alive...

294
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:03,492
{\an1}Don't act tough and
hide your wounds.

295
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,262
{\an1}You know that I'm
always watching.

296
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,974
{\an1}Because you're no one
else but you, damn it!

297
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:14,880
Stop running!

298
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:18,755
{\an1}Come join us, Obito!

299
