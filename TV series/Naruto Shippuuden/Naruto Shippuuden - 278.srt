1
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:42,451
Huh?

2
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,463
Hey! Hey Neji, are
you all right?!

3
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,165
(struggling breath)

4
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:51,837
Yes, I'll be fine.

5
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,647
Just take it easy. I
can use my nose to
sniff out enemies,
too. We aren't relying

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,283
on your eyes alone.

7
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,059
<i>Let me take over</i>
<i>for a while. You</i>
<i>go see the Medical</i>
<i>Corps.</i>

8
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:07,936
There's a medical tent
that's located in the
rear center of every
single company.

9
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,472
Coordinates...

10
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:13,714
(worried whine)

11
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:24,435
So, what do you know
of the Akatsuki?

12
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:28,076
I thought I knew more
than you did, but...

13
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:34,690
It seems that ultimately,
we were both shinobi
being used for others
purposes.

14
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:42,137
<i>They only kept us</i>
<i>around because of</i>
<i>our Visual Prowess.</i>

15
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:49,318
It's the same as now.
The caster of this
jutsu is using us.

16
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:58,571
Pain, with the Rinnegan,
the Six Paths' power that
you possess, and with my
Mangekyo Sharingan as well,

17
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:02,879
we could do anything.

18
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:10,127
The user of this jutsu
intends to take advantage
of my genjutsu power when
the time is right.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,678
Itachi, you have always
been wrapped in darkness,
even back when you were
in the Akatsuki.

20
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:23,861
You two Jonin Medics
over there! Please,
lend me a hand! We
have to resuscitate

21
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:25,598
this man quickly!

22
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:25,965
<i>Now!</i>

23
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:26,667
Right!

24
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,573
Oink...
Oink! Oink!

25
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:32,512
But, are you really
sure you can carry
all this?

26
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:32,979
Oink!

27
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>Okay! Okay!</i>

28
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:44,536
Just stop right
there! By order of
Headquarters, we
Sensory-type shinobi

29
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,209
must verify your
chakra signature
before you can enter!

30
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:51,282
<i>No one passes without</i>
<i>confirmation!</i>

31
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:53,521
Yes, I know that.

32
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,892
Hurry up and
check me out.

33
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:59,231
I'll bandage it.

34
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,371
There. Okay,
you're all set.

35
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,643
Great, thank you!

36
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,513
You take care!

37
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,757
Okay, please send the
next one in now-

38
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,763
Hey, Neji!

39
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:28,389
There you go! I've
taken care of your
external wounds.

40
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,528
Thank you.

41
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,437
<i>But I think you could</i>
<i>use a break. You need</i>
<i>to sleep and to rest</i>
<i>your eyes.</i>

42
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,407
<i>You shouldn't</i>
<i>overuse them.</i>

43
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:43,353
That's easier said
than done. My job
right now is to
discern things faster

44
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:47,494
than anyone else
can and then notify
Headquarters in order
to improve our chances

45
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,104
in battle. To achieve
that goal, I have to
put my eyes to work.

46
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:56,445
Yeah, I know. But
while you're here,
try to rest.

47
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,018
Thank you.

48
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:18,991
All right, we have to
begin our rounds now.
The next tents will
be F5 through G3.

49
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:27,675
Is something the
matter? If you're
still in pain...

50
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:29,779
(shocked gasp)

51
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,534
(heavy breathing)

52
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:45,511
Listen! Toyosa,
Takemaru, and Hino
were all found dead
inside their tent!

53
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,314
<i>They were murdered!</i>

54
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:48,784
This can't be!

55
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:53,126
What's going on?

56
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,334
<i>We've been infiltrated.</i>
<i>It's the only explanation.</i>

57
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:01,475
And it appears that
they're specifically
targeting our Jonin
Medics.

58
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,089
But how did they get
in? Everyone's chakra
gets thoroughly verified
prior to them being

59
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:09,926
allowed to enter
the camp.

60
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,270
A simple Transformation
Jutsu would be noticed.
And only Allied Shinobi
who've been positively

61
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,107
ID'd are let in.

62
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,050
Which must mean that
a shinobi on the inside
is somehow being
controlled by a jutsu.

63
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,455
It must be powerful.

64
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,795
What's happened here?

65
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,498
Neji...

66
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:37,515
Yes, I see...

67
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:42,725
If only Allied Forces
shinobi are here, it will
be hard to distinguish
who's responsible.

68
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,330
We don't know who
the suspect is.

69
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:50,675
Even someone standing
here right now, could
secretly be the killer.

70
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,616
This is sure to breed
suspicion among our
shinobi.

71
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,753
And that's the
enemy's aim.

72
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:58,857
<i>We Medical Ninja</i>
<i>are critical.</i>

73
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,530
Without us, our
battle strategy
can't succeed.

74
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:05,871
We're fighting those
under the Reanimation
Jutsu. There's just
no way to confront

75
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,744
them without medics
as backup to heal
the injured.

76
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:15,791
If we let this paralyze
us now, we'll lose the
battle that starts at
dawn.

77
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:21,636
Then I'll make sure to
find who's responsible
with my very own eyes.

78
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:30,588
In the meantime,

79
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,130
we can't neglect
our treatment of the
wounded. We'll continue
to treat them.

80
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:40,574
We'll just need to
watch our backs.
Especially the Jonin
Medics.

81
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:06,192
It's almost time.
We're going to have
to start going back on
rounds any minute now.

82
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,062
Yeah, I know.

83
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,917
So, uh, listen, tell
me something. Where
did you and I...

84
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,821
<i>...first meet?</i>

85
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:21,590
Huh?

86
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:28,971
Look, it's not that
I'm suspicious of you
or anything like that!
I mean, of course I'm

87
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,077
not! But, I, uh...
It's just... Well,
I...

88
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,047
You are suspicious!

89
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:34,816
(gasps)

90
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,638
Oh, it's only you,
Neji. Please don't
scare us like that!

91
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:48,577
Whatever. Where is
Sakura right now,
anyway?

92
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,447
Why? Did something
happen?

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,622
I just saw someone
suspicious skulking
around here. I was
tailing him through

94
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:57,127
the camp, but
then I lost him.

95
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,435
Thinking back, I
seem to recall that
he's been hanging
around Sakura.

96
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,540
Sakura's in tent
number three right
now.

97
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:07,915
The guy you followed
can you please tell us
what he looked like?

98
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,288
Let's see...

99
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,175
Well, actually...

100
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,812
(gasps)

101
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,444
He looks exactly
like me.

102
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:44,154
Oh! It's you. You
came back. Are your
wounds bothering you?

103
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,223
(nervous gasp)

104
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,292
No, I...

105
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,764
I feel just
fine now.

106
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:55,476
But, the thing is.
Well ever since you
treated me, I, uh...

107
00:10:55,511 --> 00:11:00,086
To be honest, I
haven't been able
to stop thinking
about you.

108
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,933
What is this?

109
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,171
<i>It's... a</i>
<i>love letter.</i>

110
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:10,641
Uhh...

111
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:14,481
Next time, when I
go back into battle,
there isn't any
guarantee that I'm

112
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,151
going to return
alive...

113
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,788
So...

114
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,360
Thanks for this.

115
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:25,169
But, I... I have
someone else
already, though,
you see.

116
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,073
Hmm... Sure,
of course.

117
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,795
I suppose that
he's a Leaf, too.

118
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:42,838
Well, a rejected man
like me has no right
to pry into who you
love. Even a shinobi

119
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:45,076
like me knows that's
really rude.

120
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,320
All right then,
I guess I should
go now.

121
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:52,324
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

122
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:57,935
Good luck, I hope
everything works
out for you. If you
love him...

123
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:02,043
...then he must be
a good man.

124
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,386
(sigh)

125
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,866
What do you think is
happening? Why are
they going through
such pains to keep us

126
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,338
separate from
the enemy?

127
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:53,179
<i>Are they not going</i>
<i>to use your genjutsu</i>
<i>after all?</i>

128
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:56,853
Right now it's
nighttime with
both sides at a
stalemate.

129
00:12:56,886 --> 00:13:01,997
But I'm certain that
soon enough, Madara
will use us to break
the silence.

130
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,836
He's got something
up his sleeve.

131
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:10,848
But this Reanimation
Jutsu has been brought
into play by Madara's
new ally.

132
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:14,856
It doesn't figure
into Madara's
original plans.

133
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,093
Is that what's
going on?

134
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,329
Probably.

135
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,564
You doing
all right?

136
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,133
Yes, Neji.

137
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:42,143
It's easy to get
discouraged. We don't
even know who it is
that we're supposed to

138
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:45,183
fighting right now.
It's troubling.

139
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:50,828
I know. We have
to be careful.

140
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,330
Yes...

141
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,873
Are you sure that you
don't need me to take
you to the Medical
Corps? It sure seems

142
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:58,476
like you could
use it!

143
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,683
You're getting on
my nerves Kiba!
I told you, I'm
going to be fine!

144
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:06,726
You totally overused
your Byakugan and
could barely stand up!
You don't need to try

145
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,764
and show off in
front of you
subordinates!

146
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,534
Just shut up, Kiba!

147
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:14,441
What the hell? You can't
tell the difference
between a dog and a man?

148
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:18,115
Your visual prowess
is supposed to be
your specialty!

149
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:25,964
Hinata, don't
overextend
yourself.

150
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:31,442
You don't need to.
My Parasitic Insects
have spread out to look
for the enemy, as well.

151
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:37,555
Thanks, Shino. I
really appreciate
your concern.

152
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,894
However, I need to
push myself now.

153
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,549
Because this war is
a fight to protect
Naruto! We cannot
lose, no matter what!

154
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:58,897
By the way, Sakura,
where is Captain
Shizune right now?

155
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,237
Huh? Why? Have you
figured out what's
going on?

156
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,579
Maybe, a little
bit. But I think
we should report
anything, no matter

157
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:10,721
how trivial. Until
we finally locate
the suspect.

158
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:17,768
Hm. I think she's in
tent B-2. She's still
busy treating Tonton
right now.

159
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:20,974
One leg is very
badly sprained.

160
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:24,181
Well, better it's
a leg than a hand,
I suppose.

161
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,619
Will Tonton be able
to rejoin the battle?

162
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:31,361
Probably. Tonton can
still weave signs,
since the hand
remains uninjured.

163
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:36,973
I see. That's good.
Can I ask you a
favor, Sakura?

164
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:42,450
Would you mind taking
a look at my arm again?
It's still bothering me.

165
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,452
Sure!

166
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,456
Take a seat
over here.

167
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,984
Ahh!

168
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,906
But, how did
you know?!

169
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:13,345
'Cause pigs don't
have hands! Ya
big fake!

170
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,582
(aggravated grunt)

171
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:20,226
Probably. Tonton can
still weave signs,
since the hand remains
uninjured.

172
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,401
Are you telling me
that Tonton is just
a pig?!

173
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,440
<i>She tricked me!</i>

174
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:31,516
Yeah, that's right!
And that makes you
the murderer!

175
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,354
(painful screaming)

176
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:40,166
Spill it! How were
you able to recreate
Neji's chakra?!

177
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,742
You better tell me
what kind of jutsu it
is if you don't want
me to hit you again!

178
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:49,886
This Transformation
Jutsu isn't anything
you can possibly
handle! Do you truly

179
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,760
believe that I am
the only clone who's
managed to infiltrate
your ranks?

180
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,463
(gasp)

181
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:59,805
This is what was in
Captain Yamato's
reports.

182
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,149
A note regarding
Parasitic Clones.
It was thought the
Raikage and Killer

183
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:11,128
Bee took down Kisame
Hoshigaki. But it now
appears he switched
places with a parasitic

184
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:17,073
clone or some type of
Transformation Jutsu.
This transformation
replicates the target's

185
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:23,620
chakra, so it's difficult
to detect. At the Five
Kage Summit, Zetsu of
the Akatsuki suddenly

186
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:28,362
emerged from people's
bodies. He had absorbed
their chakra.

187
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:32,571
So this guy transformed
into Neji, of course!

188
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:38,349
I get it. You use
the chakra that you
absorb from someone,
then copy them and

189
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:40,721
and their chakra!
Is that right?!

190
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,000
(struggling grunt)

191
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,705
There are just too
many of them!

192
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,477
<i>And they absorb</i>
<i>chakra, too.</i>

193
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:58,523
She's quite a
smart girl.

194
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:02,297
Uh, maybe, but then
again, maybe not.

195
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:09,110
You maybe able to
camouflage yourself
well, but you're not very
good at lying, are you?

196
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,983
What's going on?
We heard some
commotion in here!

197
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,421
Wha-What's this?!
Who's he?!

198
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:19,464
I have to contact
HQ immediately!
You two secure him.

199
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:23,105
You were transporting
too heavy a load, Tonton.

200
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,544
(embarrassed snorts)

201
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:27,982
What happened?!

202
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,351
Sakura has an
emergency!

203
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,689
We have to let
Lady Shizune know!

204
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,006
<i>Finish up, already!</i>
<i>Remember, we're both</i>
<i>gonna be up next for</i>
<i>guard duty.</i>

205
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,216
I totally had to go
more than you did. Look
at my ripples in the
water compared to yours.

206
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,719
Ripples? Are you
kidding me?

207
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:52,898
Tetsu, you really
'oughta go to, you
know. It's a long
shift.

208
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:57,841
Tetsu, don't stand
behind me when I pee!
Give a guy a little
privacy, would ya?

209
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:03,787
Well then, how
about instead, I
make you bleed?

210
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,460
Tetsu?! What the-

211
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:16,813
Another one!

212
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,054
We have reports from
all regiments! Our
comrades are falling
victim to multiple

213
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:22,390
surprise attacks!

214
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:25,363
It's chaos! We don't
know who the enemy is!

215
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:30,640
What could be going
on?! It's doubtful
that they'd launch
a night raid. Sensory

216
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:33,513
ninja watch each
camp, and we've
increased patrols.

217
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,851
So why can't we
detect the enemy?!

218
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,592
Is it some kind of
poison? What's the
condition of the
corpses?

219
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:45,136
All of them received
external wounds! So,
they're physical
attacks!

220
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,379
Someone from the outside
must be using some sort of
control genjutsu, on them.

221
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:51,682
(gasp)

222
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:53,385
Itachi...

223
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:57,861
Itachi Uchiha's the
only one that I know
of that my Sensory Unit
couldn't detect, but

224
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:03,005
could still use
genjutsu to manipulate
someone like that.

225
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,681
But controlling this
many people at once in
multiple locations is
impossible!

226
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,451
Even for Itachi!

227
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:13,258
Wait, hold on! There's
word from the Medical
Corps!

228
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:19,437
It seems that the
enemy is- White Zetsu
has been impersonating
various Allied Forces

229
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:22,811
shinobi! He's able
to mirror our chakra
imprints!

230
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,617
That explains it.

231
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,357
<i>If one of our shinobi</i>
<i>had his chakra absorbed</i>
<i>during the daytime</i>
<i>battle...</i>

232
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,929
White Zetsu can fully
transform into him!

233
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:37,908
Well, Shikaku? What
should we do? There's
no way that we can tell
friend from foe, now.

234
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:42,383
How do we prepare to
fight when dawn comes?
If we don't discover a
way to tell the difference

235
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:47,561
fast, we will lose
time, plus all our
men will be endangered!
In the end they could

236
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:50,166
wind up killing each
other by mistake!

237
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:55,911
So this was White
Zetsu's ability all
along, huh? The battle
during the daytime was

238
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:58,449
to set up these
secret nighttime
assaults.

239
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,021
<i>That was the enemy's</i>
<i>true motive.</i>

240
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:11,676
I need to think. Be
calm. I can solve this
if I calmly analyze the
situation!

241
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:15,216
Sort and evaluate.
Review all of the
intel I have on this
war. What's useful?

242
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:24,434
What's our counter plan?
Be cool, be calm, but
do it quickly. Calm,
cool, but quick.

243
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:05,035
Don't let them touch
you. That's because if
they do, they'll absorb
our chakra!

244
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,643
<i>Easier said than done!</i>
<i>How can we take them</i>
<i>down without touching</i>
<i>them?</i>

245
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:13,285
I just sent out a
messenger owl. So the
sealing corps should
arrive in just a little

246
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,688
while to seal up
this mine.

247
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:17,159
<i>And what, we're just</i>
<i>supposed to wait</i>
<i>until then?</i>

248
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:22,236
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: White</i>
<i>Zetsu's Trap.</i>

249
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,675
How many of them
are there?!
