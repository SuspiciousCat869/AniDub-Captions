ITACHI: You have gotten strong.

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,069
-The exact same words as
before, and the crows, as well.

4
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,103
Starting with your favorite
genjutsu farce, huh?

5
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,336
-So what do you want to know?

6
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,636
It won't be the last thing, but
I'll hear what you have to say.

7
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,636
-Let me try this again.

[music playing]

9
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:46,069
Back when you slaughtered
our entire clan,

10
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:50,603
you mentioned the existence
of another-- the other Uchiha

11
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,403
that you didn't kill.

12
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:55,936
He must've been a
co-conspirator because even

13
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,936
you couldn't have taken down
the Leaf Police Force alone.

14
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,603
-So, you figured it out.

15
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,336
-Who is it?

16
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:15,869
-Madara Uchiha.

17
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,569
-With that vision of
yours and a chakra

18
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:23,303
more ominous than my own,
you are the spitting image

19
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,869
of Madara Uchiha
from the elder days.

20
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,636
-Never heard of him.

21
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,536
Am I supposed to care?

22
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,969
Madara Uchiha.

23
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,603
SASUKE: One of the
founders of the Hidden Leaf

24
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:44,703
Village, the man who first
awakened the Mangekyo

25
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,703
Sharingan.

26
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:48,803
-A founder?

27
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:51,669
But Madara should
be long dead by now.

28
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,636
Are you just playing with me?

29
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,203
-Madara is still alive.

30
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:00,403
Whether you choose to believe
that is entirely up to you.

31
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:03,669
-Are you out of your mind?

32
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:06,569
-Each of us lives
dependent and bound

33
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:10,703
by our individual knowledge
and our awareness.

34
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:15,203
All that is what
we call reality.

35
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:19,503
However, both knowledge and
awareness are equivocal.

36
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:22,703
One's reality might
be another's illusion.

37
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:26,169
We all live inside
our own fantasies.

38
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,736
Don't you think
that's true, Sasuke?

39
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,269
-Just what are
you trying to say?

40
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:36,203
-That thinking Madara is dead is
merely an arbitrary assumption

41
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:39,969
that you've made, in exactly
the same way that you once

42
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:43,469
assumed that I was your kind
and gentle older brother.

43

ITACHI (VOICEOVER): I have
acted like the older brother

44
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:58,269
you desired for one
reason-- because I wanted

45
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:01,269
to discover how
powerful you were.

SASUKE: What
happened that night?

48
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,136
I was so young.

49
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,769
I thought it was all
merely an illusion.

50
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,103
I desperately wanted to
believe that I was only

51
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,603
trapped in a horrible genjutsu.

52
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,403
But there was no mistake!

53
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:25,669
I was trapped in reality!

54
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,503
My eyes are not the
same as they once were.

55
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:37,669
My Sharingan can see
through genjutsu.

56
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:41,103
-You speak with such
confidence, as you always do.

57
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:44,836
Well, for now, I'm willing
to take your word for it.

58
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,536
SASUKE: I'm done playing
along with your parlor tricks.

59
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,469
-Confidence is fine.

60
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,969
But Sasuke, it
appears that you still

61
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:06,669
do not possess the
same eyes as I do.

62
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:09,636
And one day, when you
possess the same eyes,

63
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,669
come and face me.

64
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,769
So you just couldn't do it.

65
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,203
Couldn't kill your best friend.

66
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:22,003
And you dared to come here to
face me with such weak resolve?

67
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,069
-All right.

68
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:24,936
Then just hurry it
up and try to kill me

69
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,369
with your Mangekyo Sharingan.

70
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,303
Or am I too strong
now for you to dare

71
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:31,436
to test your capabilities
against mine?

72
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:35,803

[music playing]

79

The moment they awaken, they
progress toward darkness.

And the more they're used,
the faster they're sealed.

-What does that mean?

82

-The Mangekyo eventually
lose their light.

83
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,136
-Blindness.

84
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,169
So that's the price
of obtaining the power

85

to control the
Nine-Tails, is it?

SASUKE: Exactly who
and what is Madara?

-The first man ever to tame
the Nine-Tails with his eyes,

an immortal man who is both
my comrade and my mentor,

00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:46,855
and the exceptional
man who is the only one

to uncover the other secret
of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

That is Madara Uchiha.

-Did you say the other secret
of the Mangekyo Sharingan?

97
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,888
What other visual
power does it possess?

98
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:14,355
Can it do more than just
tame the Nine-Tails?

99
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,322
-Yes.

100
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,122
Another secret.

101
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:20,322
The most important one of all.

102
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,522
-Most important one?

103
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:23,088
Tell me.

104
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:29,422
What is it?

105
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,755
Answer me!

106
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,788
-Let me tell you a
little about the past,

107
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:38,822
particularly the
history of the Uchiha.

108
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:42,822
Back then, Madara had a
younger sibling, a brother.

109
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,055
From the time they
were children,

110
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,488
the two tested and
honed their skills

111
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:07,055
by competing with each other.

112
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,555
Eventually, they both
awakened their Sharingan,

113
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,288
and they made names
for themselves

114
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:16,888
both inside and outside
the Uchiha clan.

115
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,355
The two continued
to push each other,

116
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:22,688
seeking to sharpen and
advance their visual prowess.

117
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:23,655
And then--

118

[screaming]

119
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,455
the brothers killed
off those most precious

120
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:43,688
to them and in doing so
finally awakened the Mangekyo

121
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,655
Sharingan.

122
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:49,955
[music playing]

123
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:53,922
It had never before been
seen among the Uchiha clan.

124
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:57,388
The brothers used their visual
prowess to unite the clan,

125
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:01,255
and Madara was named
its new leader.

126
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:06,788
However, Madara began suffering
strange physical symptoms.

127
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:09,955
As I just told you,
this eye is special.

128
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:11,688
The more you use
it, the quicker it

129
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:16,855
becomes sealed, with the end
result being total darkness.

130
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:20,055
That is the fate of
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

131
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:23,455
In exchange for obtaining
incredible visual prowess,

132
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:29,522
that power shuts itself down,
cutting off the light forever.

133
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:31,922
In order to try to
reclaim the light,

134
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,788
Madara tried all the
methods he could find.

135
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:37,222
But nothing was effective.

136
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:42,022
He became lost in despair
and, haunted by the Mangekyo

137
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:45,055
Sharingan, desperately
seeking the light--

138
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,122
-Forgive me.

139
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:15,628
[screaming]

140
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:18,528
He stole both eyes from
his younger brother.

141
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,928
And so Madara
obtained new light.

142
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,428
And after that, never
again would the light

143
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:38,528
fade from his eyes-- an
eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.

144
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,528
It is said that by
finding a new host,

145
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:45,328
his younger brother's eyes
obtained eternal light.

146
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:47,628
And another change emerged.

147
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:53,095
A distinctly new, unique visual
jutsu was born from those eyes.

148
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,661
However, this
exchange can only take

149
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:58,395
place between clan
members, and not

150
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:02,161
everyone attains new powers
from this method, either.

151
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:06,295
These truths were only
gradually discovered over time,

152
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,261
after countless sacrifices.

153
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,161
That is the other secret
of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

154
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,328
Madara used his newfound
powers to take control

155
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:21,595
of one ninja clan after another.

156
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:23,528
Ultimately, he
formed an alliance

157
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,495
with the most powerful clan,
the Senju clan of the forest,

158
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:31,395
and established a
new organization.

159
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,295
Later, he clashed
with the leader

160
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:36,261
of the Senju clan, the
future First Hokage,

161
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:39,095
over the course the
village would take.

162
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,628
He may have lost the
battle over leadership,

163
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:47,395
but Madara still lives on with
his visual prowess intact.

164
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:50,095
He's been hiding himself
among the shadows,

165
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:53,461
creating a new
organization-- the Akatsuki.

166
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,828
16 years ago, when the
Nine-Tails attacked the Hidden

167
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,961
Leaf Village, it
was Madara's doing.

168
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:03,261
But like Madara's bid for
power, the Fourth Hokage

169
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:04,528
stopped that, too.

170
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:14,561
In short, Madara is a
bitter, defeated loser now.

171
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,395
He's not worthy or
capable of grasping

172
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,295
Uchiha's true greatness.

173
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:21,228
I am the one.

174
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:26,461
I shall surpass Madara and
achieve real greatness!

175
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:32,561
And now I can finally obtain
power that exceeds Madara's.

176
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:38,261
Sasuke, you are the one who
will become my new light!

177
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,428
You have my spare eyes!

178
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,761
Activating the Mangekyo
Sharingan always

179
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,428
required an Uchiha to
take down a friend.

180
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,028
Parents and siblings
killed each other

181
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,495
to obtain eternal
visual prowess.

182
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:59,028
We're both from a
tainted bloodline

183
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:02,261
that's advanced its strength
this way throughout the ages.

184
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,895
And from the day you
were born into our clan,

185
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,328
you have been
unavoidably entwined

186
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,295
with this blood-soaked fate.

187
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,795
Now, come, my little brother!

188
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:15,995
I shall kill you to obtain
my true transformation

189
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:19,228
and finally be free
from our clan's fate!

190
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,295
I shall break loose from
all the restrictions

191
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,128
and free myself from all the
constraints that bind me!

192
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,895
But with us it's different
because you and I

193
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:29,128
are flesh and blood.

194
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,328
I'm always going to be
there for you, even if it's

195
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:35,528
only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.

196
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,495
We are each other's spares!

197
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:39,928
Now I've made you hate me.

198
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,828
Now you have the
desire to defeat me,

199
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,161
which is exactly why I'm
going to allow you to live.

200
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:50,028
Everything I've done is
for me, for my benefit.

201
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:53,661
This is the true bond between
the brothers of the Uchiha!

202
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:21,095
ITACHI (VOICEOVER): It seems you
are able to see my inner self.

203
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,461
-It was all just for this.

204
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:27,928
My name is Sasuke Uchiha.

205
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,295
I hate a lot of things,
and I don't particularly

206
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,061
like anything.

207
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,328
What I have is not
a dream because I

208
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,361
will make it a reality.

209
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:45,128
I'm going to restore my clan
and destroy a certain someone.

210
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:50,528
[music playing]

211
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,728
I've finally arrived.

212
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,528
The moment to achieve
my goal is here at last.

213
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:04,628
ITACHI: You said that you
see me dead at your feet.

214
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:07,895
But you cannot possibly win
against me and my Mangekyo

215
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,761
Sharingan.

216
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:12,761
Unfortunately, your goal
will end as mere fantasy

217
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:16,128
and vanish like a dream upon
waking because you do not

218
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,028
possess my visual prowess.

219
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,161
[music playing]

220
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,095
You are still too weak.

221
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:40,028
You don't have enough hate.

222
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,095
And you know something?

223
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,861
You never will.

224
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,828

225
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:53,495
SASUKE: No matter how much
you use those eyes of yours,

226
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:57,295
I'll use my hatred to
turn fantasy into reality.

227
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,995
And your reality is death.

228
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:07,128
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Even during all

229
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,328
that, he was able to weave
signs for a shadow clone?

230
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:13,295
[music playing]

231
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:06,061
-You ran the chidori through it.

232
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:09,528
[music playing]

233
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:58,528
Forgive me, Sasuke.

234
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:16,228
This is my reality.

235
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,128
Give me your light.

236
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,628
[screaming]

[music playing]

238
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,486
WHITE ZETSU (VOICEOVER): That
ended quicker than I expected.

239
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,253
Itachi has won this.

240
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:05,653
Sasuke is completely paralyzed.

241
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:08,653
Itachi can do whatever
he wants to him now.

242
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:11,253
BLACK ZETSU (VOICEOVER):
Do you really think so?

243
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,720
WHITE ZETSU
(VOICEOVER): Of course.

244
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:14,686
There's no way an
ordinary Sharingan can

245
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,820
win against the
Mangekyo Sharingan.

246
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,720
Next time on Naruto
Shippuden-- "Amaterasu!"

247
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:24,820
We'd better not take our
eyes off of this one.
