1
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,744
{\an1}This is so annoying.

2
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,348
{\an1}Orochimaru gets away when he
was almost within our grasp,

3
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,186
{\an1}and the Akatsuki's movements
are as suspicious as ever.

4
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,022
{\an1}There's been no good news
at all, lately! Isn't there

5
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,057
{\an1}anything fun going
on in the world?

6
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,129
{\an1}Well, your tea's ready
now, at least.

7
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,598
{\an1}Oh, that's right, I forgot
to tell you: Konohamaru came

8
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,534
{\an1}into the hospital yesterday.

9
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,702
{\an1}Yeah? And what's so
fun about that?

10
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,175
{\an1}He had to come in because
his hands had become

11
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,578
{\an1}terribly bruised from
his own chakra.

12
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,813
{\an1}It seems that Naruto is
teaching him how

13
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,148
{\an1}to do the Rasengan.

14
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:28,717
Oh?

15
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,987
{\an1}How interesting...

16
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,956
{\an1}What's your pick?

17
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,191
Uh?

18
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:37,394
{\an1}Your bet! Will he
master it or not?

19
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:38,295
Lady Tsunade!

20
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,864
{\an1}Oh, come on, loosen up!

21
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:41,466
{\an1}It's just a little fun!

22
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,138
{\an1}Hold it with a, "guh" and...

23
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:47,772
Boom!

24
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,544
{\an1}Yeah! Yeah, you did it!

25
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,080
{\an1}Yeah! [chuckle] Yeah!

26
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:55,948
I did it! Yeah!

27
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,684
{\an1}That was totally awesome,
Konohamaru.

28
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,021
{\an1}Well, I can't just sit
around here doing nothing!

29
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,191
{\an1}We gotta go find Big Brother
Naruto and tell him!

30
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,360
{\an1}Uh, actually, speaking
of Naruto...

31
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,897
{\an1}We haven't seen him
around at all lately.

32
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,600
{\an1}But I heard that he'd
returned to the village just

33
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,102
{\an1}a little while ago.

34
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,837
{\an1}I heard rumors...

35
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:19,476
{\an1}People are saying his last
mission didn't go very well.

36
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,877
What? Really?

37
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,179
If it's true...

38
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:25,216
{\an1}Maybe we shouldn't bother
him right now, Konohamaru.

39
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,719
{\an1}Hey, where are you going?

40
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,054
No worries!

41
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,925
{\an1}I know Big Brother Naruto,
and, trust me, he isn't

42
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,326
{\an1}gonna be like that.

43
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,433
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei, have you
seen Naruto anywhere?

44
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,101
{\an1}Yeah, he's over there.

45
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,275
Oh! Hey, Guys!

46
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:51,912
{\an1}I guess you were right. He's
way happier than I thought.

47
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,281
{\an1}See? I told you so!

48
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,788
{\an1}Sorry I didn't come around
to see you guys. Lots of

49
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:01,691
stuff happened
since last time.

50
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,326
{\an1}Yeah, we heard about it.

51
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,828
{\an1}You weren't able to catch
the spy, huh?

52
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,132
{\an1}Yeah. But as it turns out,
there was something even

53
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,569
{\an1}bigger that was lying
in wait for us.

54
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:14,339
{\an1}Wait, do you mean,
Orochimaru?!

55
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:15,240
[shocked gasp]

56
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:16,407
[chuckle]

57
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,810
We found one of
his hideouts, and

58
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,679
{\an1}we also found Sasuke.

59
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:22,982
But...

60
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,920
{\an1}I wasn't strong enough
to bring him back.

61
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,660
{\an1}So now, I have no choice
but to get stronger!

62
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,763
{\an1}Is that why you're training
so hard right now?

63
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:37,898
Yeah!

64
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:40,702
{\an1}And I'm just about to move
on to the next step, too.

65
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,005
{\an1}Next time, with my
Wind Chakra...

66
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,110
{\an1}I'll be able to beat Sasuke!

67
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,778
So awesome!

68
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,749
{\an1}How cool, Big bro Naruto!

69
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,118
{\an1}And that is exactly
why you're my rival!

70
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,555
{\an1}So, how's your training,
Konohamaru?

71
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,691
[chuckle]

72
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,626
{\an1}Just check this out!

73
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,265
Here I go!

74
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:10,369
{\an1}Hold it in, "guh"
it and then...

75
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:11,803
Boom!

76
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,545
{\an1}What in the world's going
on, Kakashi Sensei?!

77
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:20,447
{\an1}Uh, I don't know..

78
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,885
{\an1}So how was that, huh?!

79
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,921
{\an1}Uh, it was good...

80
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,225
{\an1}Hey, what's the deal?! I can
hear doubt in your voice!

81
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,561
{\an1}I know that I did
it properly!

82
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,563
{\an1}You did it just fine, but...

83
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:38,601
{\an1}Why are you bothering to use
a Sexy Jutsu for this, anyway?

84
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:41,171
{\an1}I'm doing what you taught me
and maintaining the highest

85
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,006
{\an1}level of sexiness I can.

86
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,241
What else?!

87
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,609
Sexiness?

88
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,447
{\an1}The sensation of rotating
chakra can only be learned

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,516
{\an1}by feeling it in your body.

90
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,186
{\an1}And I already talked to you
about the importance of

91
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,222
{\an1}perseverance and stuff
like that, right?

92
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,124
{\an1}I didn't understand one bit.

93
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,961
{\an1}Just explain it in simple
terms! Ugh, I feel like I

94
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,931
{\an1}spent all this time polishing
this skill for nothing!

95
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,734
Take it easy!

96
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,268
{\an1}It all turned out okay,
right?

97
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,374
{\an1}Ugh! Never mind! Look,
can I just move on to

98
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,007
{\an1}the next step, already?

99
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,712
{\an1}Hm. You've now made
it to the final leg

100
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,012
{\an1}of this training!

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,948
{\an1}All right, for the third step...

102
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,219
You'll use this.

103
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:24,621
{\an1}Wait just a minute!

104
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:27,089
{\an1}What's wrong now?!
Just listen, okay?!

105
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:30,394
{\an1}It's just, I can't do
Shadow Clones.

106
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:35,433
{\an1}Damn it! Well, all right, then.

107
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,435
{\an1}We'll do Shadow Clones first.

108
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:40,339
{\an1}Now pay close attention.
I'll show you how it's done.

109
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:43,742
{\an1}You haveta go " Hooah!"
with your body.

110
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,112
Just like that!

111
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,182
{\an1}Okay? Think you got it?

112
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,319
{\an1}Not again! Another non
explanation, explanation...

113
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,356
{\an1}You have to master this in
order to continue the

114
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,057
{\an1}training for the Rasengan.

115
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,260
{\an1}Do your best, Konohamaru!
See ya!

116
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:03,131
{\an1}I wouldn't take it easy if I
were you, Big Brother!

117
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,299
{\an1}What's that mean?

118
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:06,968
{\an1}The two of us are rivals,
and now we're both working

119
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,772
really hard on
mastering a new jutsu.

120
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,875
{\an1}I wonder which one
of us will be able to

121
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,677
{\an1}master theirs first?

122
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,447
{\an1}So I challenge you!

123
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:22,019
{\an1}Sounds like fun. I
accept your challenge!

124
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,788
{\an1}Let's see who's first!

125
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,524
{\an1}Okay, then! Great!

126
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:28,293
{\an1}Let's go, Moegi, Udon!

127
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,837
{\an1}All right! I'm not gonna
lose to Big Brother!

128
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,971
{\an1}Go for it, Konohamaru!

129
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:48,617
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

130
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,021
Didn't work.

131
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,125
{\an1}<i>What I need is more chakra.</i>

132
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,363
[power yell]

133
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,166
Right!

134
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:06,303
{\an1}Come on, let's try again!

135
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:07,438
All right!

136
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,239
Hmph!

137
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,876
[power yell]

138
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,484
[power yell]

139
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:25,759
Aw, come on!

140
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:27,895
[power yell]

141
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,269
{\an1}What's happening?!

142
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,006
{\an1}[scream] Octopus tentacles?

143
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,411
Hup!

144
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:51,254
{\an1}What do you say we
call it a day?

145
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:55,026
{\an1}No way, not yet! I just
need a little break.

146
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:57,528
Konohamaru!

147
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:05,070
{\an1}Poor Konohamaru...

148
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,174
He fell asleep!

149
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:12,746
Coming!

150
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,149
Oh! What's up?

151
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,385
{\an1}Big Sis Sakura. We heard
that you were making food

152
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:20,254
{\an1}pills for Big Brother
Naruto, and we

153
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,623
{\an1}wanted to come by.

154
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:22,490
Please!

155
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,161
{\an1}Can you please teach
us the recipe?

156
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,164
[chuckle]

157
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:30,566
Sure!

158
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,602
-Great!
-All right!

159
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,840
{\an1}I was just making
some, in fact.

160
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,875
If you help, you
can have some.

161
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,310
-Cool!
-Yeah!

162
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:42,513
Okay, just start
mashing everything up!

163
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,347
Okay!

164
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,754
{\an1}I hear Konohamaru's
been busy training hard.

165
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,323
{\an1}That's right! He's
determined to beat Big

166
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,292
Brother Naruto!

167
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,196
{\an1}He's been working so hard.
Almost a little too hard!

168
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,935
{\an1}Then he'll probably stay out
there. Naruto's not going

169
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,003
home, either.

170
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,013
{\an1}It's great that you
wanna help him.

171
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,748
Yeah...

172
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:14,650
But...

173
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:16,184
Hm?

174
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:17,452
It's just...

175
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,557
{\an1}I'm really proud of Konohamaru,
but I feel uneasy, too.

176
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,227
{\an1}Maybe more like anxious.

177
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,331
{\an1}By chasing after Naruto,
Konohamaru has been getting

178
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,633
{\an1}farther away from
the two of us.

179
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,438
{\an1}Are you guys afraid of
being left behind?

180
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,305
Huh?

181
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:38,010
{\an1}I was like that at your age.
I wanted to catch up, too.

182
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:41,781
{\an1}And so I became Lady
Tsunade's apprentice.

183
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:44,117
{\an1}I'm sure you'll find what
you need, too. Your

184
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:48,155
{\an1}aspirations, your mentors,
and your rivals!

185
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,489
Yeah!

186
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,230
Gross!

187
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,399
{\an1}Don't give up now,
Konohamaru!

188
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,268
{\an1}Yeah, just suck it up!

189
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,271
{\an1}All right! Here I go!

190
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,875
{\an1}Alright, here we go! Hah!

191
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,949
I did it!

192
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:14,051
{\an1}I did it! All right!

193
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,453
-So cool!
-Nice one!

194
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,122
Congratulations!

195
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,289
You did it!

196
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:19,991
Yeah!

197
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,425
{\an1}Yeah! [chuckle] Oh!

198
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,728
It disappeared?!

199
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,598
{\an1}You're still having trouble
sustaining them, huh?

200
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,334
{\an1}Big Brother Naruto!

201
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,371
[giggle]

202
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,372
Don't tell me-!

203
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,175
{\an1}Too bad, Konohamaru!

204
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,113
It looks like I
win this time.

205
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,949
{\an1}Aw, no way! I almost
had it, too!

206
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,151
{\an1}I won't lose the next time!

207
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:46,521
{\an1}I swear, you'll be so surprised
that you'll be speechless!

208
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:49,357
{\an1}Okay, do your best! Well,
I've gotta go. I'm moving on

209
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,060
{\an1}to my next training.

210
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,461
[laugh]

211
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,299
I see.

212
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,303
{\an1}Notify everyone else regarding
the funeral services.

213
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,776
Damn Akatsuki...

214
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,181
I saw it...

215
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:10,749
Aghh!!

216
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:14,553
{\an1}I saw what Big Bro Naruto
is training to do.

217
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,723
{\an1}He's working on an
awesome jutsu, and it's

218
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,290
{\an1}gonna be his alone!

219
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,194
{\an1}Are you serious?!

220
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:23,463
{\an1}Konohamaru. There you are...

221
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:24,497
Huh?

222
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:32,339
Wha-?

223
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:36,778
{\an1}Asuma Sarutobi...

224
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,252
Asuma...

225
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,122
{\an1}Uncle Asuma.... [whimper]

226
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:18,593
Huh?

227
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,429
{\an1}<i>I get it Big Brother</i>
<i>Naruto has already</i>

228
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,198
{\an1}<i>made up his mind.</i>

229
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,666
<i>But...</i>

230
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,736
[gasp]

231
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:28,938
<i>But I...</i>

232
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,977
{\an1}Hey, where are you going?

233
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,144
To train.

234
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,782
{\an1}But Konohamaru...

235
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,753
{\an1}If you're actually thinking
about getting revenge.

236
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:42,854
I know!

237
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,756
{\an1}I know it's impossible
for me, right now.

238
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,829
{\an1}But Big Brother Naruto
is planning on going.

239
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,697
{\an1}And he's probably
gonna perfect his new

240
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,934
{\an1}jutsu before then!

241
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,803
Hey! Wait up!

242
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:02,810
{\an1}No matter what, I have
to catch up to him!

243
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,049
Much obliged!

244
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:08,350
Thanks, Sensei!

245
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:11,420
Huh!?

246
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:17,861
{\an1}Shadow clones, huh kid?
It's about time...

247
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,305
{\an1}Okay Naruto, it's on!

248
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:30,574
Sexy jutsu.
Onanoko-tachi Jutsu!

249
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,445
Awgh man! That's
your new move?!

250
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:38,084
{\an1}I wasn't expecting
a twosome!

251
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:40,520
{\an1}You see? The sexiness
paid off!

252
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,389
{\an1}You can't simply rest
on your laurels,

253
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,824
{\an1}you know, Big Brother!

254
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,491
{\an1}Maybe not. But still!

255
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:48,095
{\an1}I'm the one who's in
the lead for now!

256
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,631
{\an1}But that's gonna change! I
won't lose! [chuckle]

257
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,403
{\an1}Then, if you're ready, I say
that it's time for us to

258
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,139
{\an1}start step three of
learning the Rasengan!

259
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,174
Okay!

260
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:04,348
{\an1}I don't get it. Why are they
creating Shadow Clones? The

261
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:07,384
{\an1}Rasengan is supposed to be
done by only one person!

262
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,953
{\an1}Well, Naruto is the teacher...

263
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:13,658
{\an1}Then again, doesn't that make
you happy, Lady Tsunade?

264
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:14,826
Hm?

265
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:17,196
{\an1}I just mean it seems that
you were right to bet on him

266
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,897
{\an1}not being able to master it.

267
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,736
{\an1}I wouldn't be so quick to
pass judgment just yet.

268
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,441
{\an1}Because the Rasengan is one
damn hard jutsu to master.

269
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,710
{\an1}You're right about that.

270
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,613
{\an1}Well, Lord Fourth did
invent it, after all.

271
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:36,517
{\an1}Yes, and it was passed down
to Jiraiya, and then to

272
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,187
{\an1}Naruto, and now to
Konohamaru.

273
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,158
{\an1}Seems life is worth
living, after all.

274
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:45,894
I wonder where
it'll take us next.

275
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,464
{\an1}I just hope we'll be
around to see it!

276
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,567
{\an1}The next generation, huh?

277
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,573
{\an1}The passage of time certainly
is interesting, isn't it?

278
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,081
{\an1}You didn't forget anything,
did you? You won't be home

279
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,049
for a while.

280
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,120
{\an1}Don't worry. I'm all
packed and ready to-- Agh!

281
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:09,922
{\an1}Hey, come on, stop it!

282
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,557
{\an1}Big Brother Naruto!

283
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:12,725
Huh?

284
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,163
{\an1}Hey, Konohamaru! Did you come
down here to see me off?

285
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,664
{\an1}No, I came here to complain!

286
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:18,732
Huh?

287
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,334
{\an1}How can you even consider
leaving on a training

288
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:22,669
{\an1}journey before I've
mastered the Rasengan?!

289
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:25,073
{\an1}Hey, it's your fault for
taking too long!

290
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:28,911
{\an1}Okay fine! I swear I'll have
it under my belt by the time

291
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:32,247
{\an1}you get back. I'll be really
strong then, you'll see!

292
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:35,118
{\an1}I'm gonna be really strong,
too, you know! Huh?

293
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:39,189
{\an1}Uh, by the way, I actually
have a little favor to ask.

294
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:40,291
What's up?

295
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:42,293
{\an1}This is going to be a really
long trip, so I wanna

296
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:45,062
{\an1}entrust that "one thing"
to you while I'm gone.

297
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:47,332
{\an1}Hey, wait! Do you mean your
treasure, Big Brother?!

298
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,135
Shh!

299
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,737
{\an1}How long you going to
stand around gabbing?!

300
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,373
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. I'm coming!

301
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,479
{\an1}Okay. You got it,
Konohamaru?

302
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,747
Don't worry, I'm
on it, Naruto!

303
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:05,986
Got it!

304
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:10,258
{\an1}[chuckle] Now, I'll take
this home and- No...

305
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:13,361
Maybe I should--

306
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:19,068
{\an1}I wonder how Big Brother
is doing right now.

307
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,141
{\an1}He's probably busy doing all
kinds of cool training with

308
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,708
{\an1}his Shadow Clones.

309
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:28,044
{\an1}That's always a possibility
with Big Brother!

310
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,216
{\an1}<i>I have to hurry up and</i>
<i>perfect my Rasengan, too!</i>

311
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:35,887
What's that?!

312
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,155
[gasp]

313
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,862
{\an1}I think that someone's
attacking the village!

314
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,898
Udon! Moegi!

315
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,934
{\an1}We gotta go back right now!

316
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,714
Everyone!

317
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,817
{\an1}Quick, get to the
evacuation shelter!

318
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:11,327
{\an1}Seems you've gotten too used
to having your own way.

319
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,530
{\an1}Well, that ends right here!

320
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,731
{\an1}I have no mercy for
thugs like you!

321
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,602
Ebisu Sensei!

322
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,672
{\an1}Go. Get out of here,
Konohamaru!

323
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,555
<i>Naruto...</i>

324
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,927
{\an1}From now on... We're rivals!

325
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,730
{\an1}Challenge accepted, and
one day we'll fight for the

326
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,667
title of Hokage!

327
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:49,137
{\an1}Until then, let's both look
forward to that day, Konohamaru.

328
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,143
Die.

329
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:06,824
Long ago...

330
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,892
{\an1}I made a solemn promise.

331
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:09,793
Huh?!

332
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:11,863
{\an1}So I'm not choosing
an escape route!

333
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,970
{\an1}Because Naruto won't be
on that shorter path!

334
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,085
{\an1}I'm a Genin, honored with
the name of this village! My

335
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,723
{\an1}surname is Sarutobi, and my
given name is Konohamaru!

336
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,291
{\an1}You will remember me!

337
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,666
[cheering]

338
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,576
{\an1}I heard what you did,
Konohamaru. You took down

339
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,179
{\an1}one of the Pains all by
yourself, huh?

340
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:57,749
{\an1}Well, I wasn't so determined
to catch up to you just for

341
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,618
{\an1}fun and giggles, you know!

342
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,187
{\an1}But still, that was nothing
at all compared to how you

343
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,524
{\an1}were able to save
the whole village.

344
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,292
{\an1}No, that isn't true!

345
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,428
{\an1}Besides, there were still
a whole lot of things

346
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,531
{\an1}that I couldn't protect.

347
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:12,999
{\an1}Hey, Big Brother.

348
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:15,069
{\an1}Oh! Hold on! There's
something I really wanna

349
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,970
{\an1}show you! [chuckle]

350
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:18,305
Hey, what-!

351
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:20,208
{\an1}Where are we going?!

352
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,609
Just follow me!

353
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:25,414
We're here!

354
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:27,750
{\an1}The evacuation shelter?!

355
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,152
{\an1}We just have a little
farther to go now...

356
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,596
{\an1}The valuables warehouse?

357
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,465
{\an1}This is my family's
storage space.

358
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,136
[chuckle]

359
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:46,405
Tadah!

360
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,780
{\an1}This is... it's my jacket.

361
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,217
It's a precious
treasure, right?

362
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,588
{\an1}I thought I should bring it
here just in case. You see?

363
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:02,490
{\an1}I kept my promise
to you, Naruto!

364
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:03,958
Wow, Konohamaru.

365
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:06,927
{\an1}Thank you! You really
are a great kid!

366
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:08,730
{\an1}I know! But thank you.

367
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,799
{\an1}But one of these days, I'm
still gonna be challenging

368
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,567
{\an1}you for the title of Hokage!

369
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,069
So don't forget!

370
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:16,938
{\an1}I am and always will
be your rival!

371
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:18,040
Yeah!

372
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:01,425
{\an1}<i>I can feel it clearly, even</i>
<i>from here. The other half of</i>

373
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,628
{\an1}<i>Super Gramps' power.</i>

374
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:06,330
{\an1}<i>You can't possibly take me</i>
<i>down. I've essentially</i>

375
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:09,902
{\an1}<i>become immortal now.</i>
<i>I've obtained eternity.</i>

376
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,671
{\an1}<i>You idiot. I'm not the one</i>
<i>who's gonna be taking you</i>

377
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:16,309
{\an1}<i>down. We are the ones who're</i>
<i>gonna take you down.</i>

378
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:20,014
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "To Rise Up"</i>

379
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:22,650
{\an1}<i>Your time has come, Madara.</i>
