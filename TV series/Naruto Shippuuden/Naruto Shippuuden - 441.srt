that's what I'd like to say...

disobeyed orders first. Please
punish me as you see fit.

No, Neji! It is not
all your fault!

18

put it that way, then I was the
first one!

acted carelessly, Lord Fourth.

saved us.  That's an undeniable

even worse than I thought!

143
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:40,459
{\an1}Well, one thing's for sure: they
don't deserve to call themselves
Team Jiraiya...

144
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:42,397
{\an1}If I see them again,
they'll pay!

145
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,073
{\an1}That's right! We're gonna get
those guys without a doubt!
Right, Shikamaru?

146
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:48,179
{\an1}Huh? Oh, yeah... sure.

147
00:10:55,662 --> 00:11:00,407
{\an1}My Father is absolutely right.
If Naruto didn't act on his
own...

different this time.

We were in the middle of
an important mission.

153

{\an1}We were just lucky that we

Even so, everyone's
too easy on that kid!

155

{\an1}So, did Father give you another
lecture, Sasuke?

156
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:34,121
It's not like that's
anything new.

157
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:39,234
{\an1}Yes, I see.  But consider this:
it's because Father has such
high hopes for you.

158
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:44,346
{\an1}Also, our clan's in a precarious
position right now.

163
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:10,942
{\an1}But can we trust them
to keep their promise?

164
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:15,253
{\an1}Don't worry. That's why I've
been assigned to watch the
Hokage.

{\an1}In time, the two of us will
sustain the Uchiha Clan.

167

{\an1}To protect our future, I'll find
out what the Fourth is thinking.

{\an1}What a surprise! It's
rare to see you so eager.

173
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,713
I need to get a
whole lot stronger.

174
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:57,854
And to do that, I
need to learn a
definitive jutsu.

175
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:02,866
{\an1}Well then, you're in luck!  I
have just the perfect one!

176
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:09,482

perception of the Sharingan, it
culminates in a penetrating
technique of lightning speed.

I see... Chidori, huh?

178
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:20,775
{\an1}Even though we just got back
from a mission, Sasuke has
been training really hard!

179
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,280
{\an1}What are you talking
about, Choji?

180
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:25,487
{\an1}Not missing a moment to start
training on a new jutsu is
so like Sasuke!

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,995
{\an1}You two guys really
should be more like him!

{\an1}Hey, is what you just
said really true?

184
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:36,011
{\an1}Is Sasuke actually trying to
learn a new jutsu right now?

185
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,751
{\an1}Yeah.  He's with Kakashi Sensei
at the training grounds.

186

{\an1}What!? Damn it! Ugh!

{\an1}Hey, listen, don't get all
worked up, all right?

189
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,442

to themselves, so
they're hard to trust.

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,564
{\an1}He's responsible for
the whole Uchiha Clan...

282
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,517
[panting]

283
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,896
Not that I'm surprised,
really... but I'm amazed at
how quickly you picked it up.

284
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,538
{\an1}It's 'cause I am an Uchiha.

285
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:31,737
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>This jutsu can definitely</i>
<i>compete with that one.</i>

286
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,842
{\an8}<i>But...</i>

287
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:43,900
{\an7}<i>I will surpass him!</i>

288
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:48,713
{\an1}Kakashi, I wanna know... How far
can I make this Chidori evolve?

289
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:52,989
[sigh] Normally, someone
would just be happy to
have gotten this far...

290
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:56,062
But, then, this
is so like you.

291
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,001
{\an1}So, what's the answer?

292
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:01,744
Frankly, Lightning Style
consumes an enormous
amount of chakra.

293
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:06,120
For someone like me who
doesn't have a lot of
chakra, this is the limit.

294
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,058
{\an1}So it's impossible then?

295
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:12,770
I didn't say that... But
taking it any further will
be extremely difficult.

296

<i>You're annoying!</i>
