1
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:29,139
{\an1}I'm sorry to cause you
shame, Lords Kinkaku
and Ginkaku,

2
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:33,943
{\an1}It's also hard for me to
dishonor the two rays
of light among the clouds.

3
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:37,611
{\an1}i'm sorry for the
disrespect, but I'm going
to have to shame both

4
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:38,779
of you a little
right now.

5
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:43,415
{\an1}I'm afraid I might end
up stripping away the
shine from your

6
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,050
gold and silver.

7
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,254
{\an1}With just a single strike
of my Gale Style.

8
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,289
Though it'll be
dull.

9
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:31,114
Hmm. Mm.

10
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:57,865
Just calm down,
Raikage.

11
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,867
You're supreme
commander, remember?

12
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,300
{\an1}You don't know just
how fearsome the

13
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,136
Gold and Silver
brothers are!

14
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:08,239
{\an1}I can't believe there's
actually something
that you're afraid of!

15
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:11,907
Hmph. No, you're
wrong. It's not
that I'm scared...

16
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:16,144
{\an1}But those two... remain
the most reviled
criminals in the

17
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,845
{\an1}whole history of
the Hidden Cloud...

18
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,782
{\an1}<i>A while back at the</i>
<i>formal ceremony to</i>
<i>cement our</i>

19
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:26,483
{\an1}<i>alliance with the</i>
<i>Leaf, they staged</i>
<i>a coup...</i>

20
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,385
<i>... and launched</i>
<i>attacks against both</i>
<i>the Second Raikage</i>

21
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:33,156
{\an1}<i>and Second Hokage. </i>
(Explosions)

22
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:39,292
{\an7}They wielded the five
Treasured Tools of the
Sage of the Six Paths,

23
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,095
{\an7}and they drove the
second Hokage to the
brink of death.

24
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:47,564
{\an1}Who are those two
Shinobi? They possess
the Nine Tails' chakra,

25
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:49,698
and they
have a lot of it.

26
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:55,469
{\an7}But I'd never heard
that they possessed
the Nine Tail's chakra.

27
00:02:56,503 --> 00:03:00,139
Yes, well, years
ago it seems that
the Hidden Cloud

28
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,741
made an attempt
to go and capture
the Nine Tails.

29
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,843
And during that
venture, the Nine
Tails devoured both

30
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:07,912
of the Gold
and Silver brothers.

31
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:14,615
[Growls]

32
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,720
[Growls]

33
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:28,391
{\an5}(Raikage)
But they were so
unruly, thrashing
around in his belly

34
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,393
that the Nine
Tails couldn't stand
it. So he vomited

35
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:32,694
them both back
up.

36
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:39,299
{\an1}<i>Since then, they've</i>
<i>both borne the Nine</i>
<i>Tails' chakra.</i>

37
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,466
<i>Not surprising,</i>
<i>they were inside the</i>
<i>Nine Tails' for</i>

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,502
<i>more than two</i>
<i>weeks.</i>

39
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:48,337
That's quite a
far-fetched tale. But
what are the rumors

40
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,006
{\an1}that they were able
to wield the Treasured
Tools of the Sage

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,741
{\an1}of the Six Paths? Is
there any truth to
them at all?

42
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,510
{\an1}No ordinary human
can wield those
tools.

43
00:03:56,543 --> 00:04:03,014
{\an4}They drain away chakra
and massive amounts
of it. So most who
try, die.

44
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:07,917
{\an7}Except for someone
who harbors the Nine
Tails' chakra like
those two monsters do.

45
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:15,488
{\an4}They're shinobi with
enormous, fiendish
chakra who wreak havoc
wherever they go.

46
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:21,026
{\an4}And they fear nothing.
Not even the Nine Tails.
So what really scares
me about them

47
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,194
{\an1}is the thought of all
our subordinates

48
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,762
{\an1}having to face both
of them in battle.

49
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,541
{\an4}I gotta say, I really
don't like the tone
you're using towards
your seniors

50
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:26,709
{\an1}but I'll shut you up.

51
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:30,312
{\an1}It can't be helped.
It simply seems that too

52
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,213
{\an1}much time has passed.
It's almost as if

53
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,949
{\an7}our comrades have
never even heard of
us before.

54
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,819
Samui, Atsui.

55
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:45,121
{\an8}If you two are
actually the Gold and
Silver Brothers we

56
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,157
{\an8}read about in
our history books. Then
I'd rather not be

57
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,025
{\an7}called your comrade.
It isn't cool.

58
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:55,661
{\an7}Ha! The usually cool-
headed lady is feeling
red hot today, I see.

59
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,663
{\an1}Those two really
must be something.

60
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,706
Let's do this,
Ginkaku!

61
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,540
{\an8}Sure thing,
Kinkaku!

62
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,708
Hold up,
are those?!

63
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,278
{\an4}There's no doubt.
Those must be the Gold
and Silver Brothers'
ninja tools that we

64
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:24,281
{\an4}learned about years
ago. They have four
out of the five
ultimate ninja tools,

65
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:26,849
{\an1}which the Hidden Cloud
collected long ago.

66
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:30,418
{\an5}(Samui cont'd)
<i>Kokinjo, the gold</i>
<i>rope squeezes out the</i>
<i>victim's spirit word.</i>

67
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:35,054
{\an5}(Samui cont'd)
<i>Shichiseiken, the seven</i>
<i>stars blade severs and</i>
<i>curses that spirit word.</i>

68

<i>fan conjures up all five</i>
<i>chakra natures.</i>

70
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:49,231
Quite a lecture,
and I really hate
to interrupt, but...

71
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:58,104
{\an5}(Atsui)
I got this!
Cloud style!
Flame slice!

72
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:01,105
(Atsui)
Those ninja tools
maybe flashy, but...

73
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,073
{\an1}They're still only
tools!

74
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:08,176
{\an4}They don't stand a
chance against our
ninjutsu, that's fueled
by our blazing hot souls!

75
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,245
No, Atsui, wait!
Just stay cool and
let me finish!

76
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,381
He's too hot
hot headed!

77
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:18,649
{\an4}Heh. They talk too
much; this'll be just
perfect. Are you ready
yet?

78
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,751
{\an1}I'll take the one
in the back.

79
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:24,388
{\an1}You got it, Ginkaku!
Just leave the others
to me.

80
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,823
He avoids my hot
fighting spirit to
attack Darui instead!?

81
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:37,095
{\an4}You really think you
can escape my hot attacks
by putting these guys
in between us?!

82
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:37,929
AHH!!

83
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:41,598
{\an7}You have to stay cool
and pay attention
to what's going on
Atsui!

84
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,870
(Painful grunts)
Woah, that was a
scorching hot punch!

85
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,038
{\an1}(Fighting Grunts)

86
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,305
Ah!
Damn it.

87
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,975
Atsui! Samui!
You guys all right?

88
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,376
{\an1}Don't look away when
you're fighting me,
you brat!

89
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:05,014
Change places,
Kinkaku!

90
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:06,615
Right, Ginkaku!

91
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:13,319
{\an5}(Grunt) I can't
even stop one enemy!?
Samui, Atsui, I'm
sorry!

92
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,188
Ha! I get to be
your opponent this
time!

93
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,357
{\an1}I gotta admit, that
Kinkaku fellow packed
a pretty hot punch!

94
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,492
{\an1}Now I'm up against
old man Ginkaku, huh?

95
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:25,261
{\an1}I think it's time we
squeeze him, Kokinjo!

96
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,268
What is this?!
What's happening!?

97
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:39,937
{\an4}Kokinjo here on my
left arm squeezes out
the Spirit Word of
whoever touches it!

98
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,871
Curse them!
Shichiseiken!

99
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:54,013
{\an8}(Chuckle) Now
record them!
Benihisago!

100
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,118
{\an1}All right! That's it.
I'm done here, Kinkaku.

101
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:03,086
Ha!
<i>We're finished.</i>

102
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:07,556
{\an1}Too bad that we're not
done with you! it's our
turn now and we're gonna--

103
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:10,424
{\an7}You should have let
me finish my
explanation..

104
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,194
{\an7}Listen, you can't
speak carelessly from
this point on.

105
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,963
{\an7}Why? What do you mean?

106
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:23,165
{\an7}Atsui and I have a
cursed jutsu and sealing
jutsu cast against us.

107
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,034
{\an7}Our spirit word have
been taken hostage.

108
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:30,137
{\an1}And that means the
next time we utter the
word or phrase,

109
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,372
that we've said
most since birth.

110
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:36,607
{\an5}(Samui cont'd)
We will be pulled into
that gourd and sealed
away inside.

111
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,444
{\an8}My, my, aren't
we knowledgeable.
Seems that as time

112
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:43,146
{\an7}passed, all sorts of
secrets have been
revealed.

113
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:50,117
{\an4}The word that we've
said most since birth
is now forbidden
to us!?

114
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,352
Come on, we're
not playing some
silly word game here?

115
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,620
{\an1}This is all getting
so dull.

116
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,188
(Kinkaku)
I see...

117
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,491
Bashosen!

118
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:03,959
What is it?
What's the hot word
that I say most often?!

119
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,427
{\an1}What could it be?!

120
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:10,531
{\an5}(Samui)
<i>You shouldn't need</i>
<i>to think so hard. It's</i>
<i>pretty obvious.</i>

121
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:11,364
{\an8}Uh!

122
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:12,631
Scroll of fire!

123
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,099
Ahh-

124
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:19,203
Ah! It's so hot!

125
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,138
Ahh!

126
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:23,606
You fool!

127
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:28,842
Ahh!

128
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:29,710
Atsui!

129
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:37,516
You know there's
an old saying, that
silence is golden.

130
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,117
The tongue is a
source of misfortune.
Right, Ginkaku?

131
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:45,154
{\an5}(Ginkaku)
Yeah, Kinkaku!
This is what happens
when you can't shut up.

132
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,756
{\an5}Words are merely
tools and people use
them to trick each
other through lies.

133
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,993
{\an4}Just wait until you
encounter Bee, You'll
rethink what words are
for then.

134
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,395
Who's this Bee?
I know of no such
person!

135
00:11:57,428 --> 00:12:02,331
{\an5}If you move then
I'll kill her. And
I'm not lying about
that.

136
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,639
{\an1}I'm sorry, Samui.

137
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:14,672
Yahh!

138
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,309
Ah!

139
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,447
{\an8}As I expected.
You've both proven
yourselves to be true
Hidden Cloud shinobi.

140
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,115
Gale Style!

141
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,984
(Darui)
Laser Circus!

142
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,653
(Ginkaku)
So fast.

143
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,054
(Ginkaku)
And it's Precision
Ninjutsu?!

144
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,322
(Ginkaku)
Ahh!

145
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,924
Ah! Don't you
underestimate us,
brat!

146
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,724
(Grunt)

147
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:49,496
<i>Good job hitting</i>
<i>him with the</i>
<i>Kokinjo, Kinkaku.</i>

148
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:55,133
{\an1}This one's first,
though.

149
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:04,606
{\an1}<i>What's going on?!</i>
<i>She didn't say</i>
<i>anything!</i>

150
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,807
<i>Why did she</i>
<i>get trapped?!</i>

151
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,409
Curse them!

152
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:11,743
Shichiseiken!

153
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,844
{\an1}<i>His arm regenerated</i>
<i>already?!</i>

154
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,748
And now record
it, Benihisago!

155
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:26,720
{\an8}<i>I think I know</i>
<i>what my forbidden</i>
<i>word is.</i>

156
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,922
Though it'll
be dull.

157
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,123
(Darui)
<i>This is all</i>
<i>getting so dull!</i>

158
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,302
{\an1}<i>My forbidden word...</i>

159
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:53,738
{\an1}<i>The word I've said</i>
<i>most often in my life,</i>
<i>is probably dull.</i>

160
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,973
(Darui)
<i>As long as I</i>
<i>don't say it</i>

161
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,008
{\an5}<i>(Darui)</i>
<i>I won't get</i>
<i>sucked into that</i>
<i>gourd.</i>

162
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:04,613
{\an5}(Darui)
<i>But Samui got</i>
<i>trapped and she</i>
<i>didn't say anything.</i>

163
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,248
(Darui)
<i>So that means.</i>

164
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,351
{\an1}<i>You can get trapped</i>
<i>if your silent for</i>
<i>too long, too!</i>

165
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,653
<i>Am I right?</i>

166
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:19,322
{\an5}Sharp of you to
notice. I think you're
the first person ever
to figure that out.

167
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,023
(cont'd)
You're a smart
one, then.

168
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:25,526
{\an5}But just a little
while ago you told
us all that silence
is golden!

169
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,730
{\an4}But sometimes speech
is golden. Successful
deceit is the truest
proof of eloquence.

170
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:34,999
{\an5}And in this case
silence is prohibited.
It's the most
forbidden taboo!

171
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,600
Ha ha ha!

172
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:41,336
{\an5}Didn't I just
tell you? Words
are merely tools
that people use to

173
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,903
{\an1}trick each other,
nothing more.

174
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:47,173
{\an7}In the Shinobi world,
deceit and betrayal
are acceptable battle
tactics.

175
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,409
Words are ninja
tools, too.

176
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:54,045
{\an5}And is it any
wonder that you two
are considered symbols
of disgrace among

177
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:55,212
{\an1}the HIdden Cloud?

178
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,848
{\an7}What did you just
say to me, you
puny little wimp?!

179
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,417
{\an7}I won't stand here
and indulge your
insults. You're
nothing but a mere

180
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,984
{\an7}pawn of the Raikage's!

181
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:07,488
(Ginkaku cont'd)
<i>You're just an imitation</i>
<i>ninja tool! So shut up!</i>

182
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,590
{\an7}What in the hell is
wrong with the ninja
of today?

183
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:18,228
{\an7}<i>Boss, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>You chose me to be</i>
<i>you trusted bodyguard</i>
<i>but then you lost</i>

184
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,629
{\an8}<i>your left arm.</i>

185
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,230
No, Darui.
Don't blame yourself.

186
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,930
(Darui)
But...

187
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,602
{\an4}I can manage fine
without a left arm.
Cause after all, I've
got two perfectly

188
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,703
good right arms
here already.

189
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:32,537
Two of them?

190
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,272
Yeah. This one.

191
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,009
(Raikage cont'd)
And you, Darui!

192
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,781
(Chuckle)

193
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,651
{\an4}Hey, how about you
include Cee and give
yourself a third one,
too?

194
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:58,487
{\an5}(Chuckle)
Well sure, sounds good.
The more the merrier
isn't that right?

195
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:08,394
{\an5}I'm no fake. I'm
the bosses right hand
man! You will indulge
me!

196
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:09,562
Ha!

197
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,796
(Kinkaku)
Hey, Ginkaku

198
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:12,229
(Ginkaku)
What is it, Kinkaku?!

199
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,830
(Kinkaku)
Get Benihisago ready.

200
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:18,200
Hm?
Oh, I get it.

201
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:25,439
But why?!
I didn't even say
the word "dull."

202
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:29,375
{\an5}I'm no fake. I'm
the boss's right
hand man! You will
indulge me!

203
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:33,778
{\an5}Wait, I get it
now! I said you
will indulge me.
That word, indulge!

204
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,212
Indulge!

205
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,946
Dull, no!

206
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,816
Ah! Damn it!

207
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,852
{\an1}Darui, I want you
to be an Allied Forces
company captain.

208
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,354
You will be my
right hand man.

209
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:50,556
{\an1}I'm so sorry, boss.

210
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:54,391
Being your right
hand man made me
so proud.

211
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:57,660
(Darui cont'd)
<i>I'm sorry, Samui,</i>
<i>Atsui.</i>

212
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,596
(Darui cont'd)
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

213
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:07,467
{\an5}(Darui)
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>say I'm sorry</i>
<i>to everyone.</i>

214
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:14,505
{\an1}We should probably
join the fight,
Ginkaku?

215
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,406
{\an1}All right, Kinkaku.

216
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,041
(Splash)
What?!

217
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:20,476
How the hell?!

218
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:25,045
Mm-Ah!

219
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,213
Ahh!

220
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,515
(Grunt)
Damn it! I
touched the Kokinjo!

221
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:33,150
Why wasn't he
trapped?!

222
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,890
<i>I...</i>

223
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:47,359
I'm sorry about
the desk and the
wall there.

224
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:51,496
{\an5}(Darui)
I'm sorry to cause
you shame, Lords
Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

225
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,465
{\an4}It's also hard for
me to dishonor the
two rays of light
among the clouds.

226
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:59,702
Samui, Atsui,
I'm really sorry.

227
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:04,937
{\an7}<i>I guess that means</i>
<i>I'm a pretty humble</i>
<i>guy! That's not a</i>
<i>bad thing at all.</i>

228
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,809
(Kinkaku)
<i>I know his word</i>
<i>was "dull..."</i>

229
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:16,011
{\an1}I'm so sorry, boss.
I'm sorry, Samui,
Atsui.

230
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,046
I wish I could
say I'm sorry...

231
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,548
(Darui)
<i>...to everyone.</i>

232
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:24,251
{\an4}Do you really mean
to tell me that his
most uttered and
second most uttered

233
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:27,919
{\an4}words switched their
orders while he was
getting pulled into
the gourd?! Huh?

234
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:47,065
Curse them,
Shichiseiken!

235
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:50,401
All right!
Now record them,
Benihisago!

236
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:52,770
{\an1}I think I'm doing
this right so far...

237
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,639
What?! How
dare you!

238
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:02,142
{\an5}(Darui)
They really do
knock the chakra
out of you...

239
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:06,245
{\an1}It feels like I'm
gonna drop before
I can finish this...

240
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:12,750
{\an4}Yeah, you're right.
It's true that words
may be tools that
people use to trick

241
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:13,683
each other.

242
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,387
{\an5}(Darui cont'd)
But when it really
counts, the spoken
word...

243
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:24,156
{\an1}Because after all,
I've got two perfectly
good right arms already.

244
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,859
This one...

245
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,127
{\an1}...and you, Darui!

246
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,430
Sometimes, the
spoken word...

247
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:40,367
{\an8}...can actually
be a really precious
thing. That's able
to relay the truth!

248
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,837
{\an1}I need your help,
Kinkaku!

249
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,306
{\an5}And that's the
exact reason that
I'm going to seal
you, right now!

250
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,408
Kinkaku!!

251
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:57,780
Ahh!

252
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:06,251
{\an4}<i>Samui, Atsui, </i>
<i>this was all thanks</i>

<i>get you out later.</i>

253
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,220
{\an1}<i>One down, one</i>
<i>to go!</i>

254
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,527
Why you, you
whelp!

255
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,028
How dare you!

256
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,744
What the hell?!

257
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,546
(Screams)

258
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,685
Hey, hey, hey,
No way. That's...

259
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:01,588
How dare you do
such a thing to
Ginkaku?!

260
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:03,689
You're going
to pay!

261
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:10,728
{\an5}Now he looks,
