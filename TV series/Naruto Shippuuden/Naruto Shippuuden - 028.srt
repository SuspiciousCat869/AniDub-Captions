1
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,046
-Go to the Tenchi
Bridge in the village

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,985
hidden in the grass 10
days from now at noon.

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:23,190
One of Orochimaru's henchmen
is working for me as a spy.

4
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,527
And that's where I'm supposed
to rendezvous with him.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,529
However, I don't think I--

6
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,582
-Why has it grown so
quiet inside the cave?

7
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,619
Could it mean that
the fight is over?

8
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,621
Neji, can you hear me?

9
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,221
Neji?

10
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,435
-What is going on in
the enemy's hideout?

11
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,114
-Hang on just a minute.

12
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,115
I'll check.

13
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,521
-Looks like it's been settled.

14
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,756
The fight's over.

15
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,110
-Did you say the fight's over?

16
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,447
Well, who won?

17
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,985
-Is Sakura-- Sa-- Sakura!

18
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,657
Where is Sakura?

19
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,225
What has happened to her?

20
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,234
-Sakura's all right.

21
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,270
I see her and Lady
Chiyo walking out.

22
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,349
-Excellent.

23
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,618
That means they beat
that Akatsuki swine.

24
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,554
NARUTO: I would expect
no less from Sakura.

25
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,298
-Unfortunately, that's doesn't
mean our problems are over.

26
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,666
MIGHT GUY: What do you mean?

27
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,570
-There were two of the
Akatsuki in that cave.

28
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,239
Even though one of
them's been defeated,

29
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,508
this jutsu is still in effect.

30
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,142
Which means--

31
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,460
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Which means either

32
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,731
it was the other
who cast the jutsu--

33
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,500
-Or else.

34
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,136
-This jutsu can't be broken,
even if the one who cast it

35
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,303
is beaten.

36
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,006
NEJI: It's a
definite possibility.

37
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:33,406
-Huh?

38
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:46,419
-That just means we will have to
defeat these clones on our own.

39
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,472
[theme song]

40
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,035
-Lady Chiyo.

41
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:23,098
Here.

42
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,099
Let me heal you.

43
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,941
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But
this is only a stop-gap.

44
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,476
It won't save her.

45
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,616
I still have to do something
about the poison that

46
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:42,550
got into her system.

47
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,130
All of the antidote I made
in the Hidden Sand is gone,

48
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:57,031
and I can't make more
because I used up

49
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:59,100
their limited supply
of the herbs I need.

50
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:10,011
If I can arrange to have
the ingredients transported

51
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:16,184
to the Sand quickly enough we
might just make it in time.

52
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,552
-Hurry.

53
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,187
You and I have to quickly
get back to the village.

54
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,456
I'll make another
batch of the antidote.

55
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:21,790
-No.

56
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:26,528
-Why not, Lady Chiyo?

57
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:29,030
We have to get back and
neutralize that poison.

58
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,398
And quickly.

59
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,434
Our job here is finished.

60
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,535
We beat him.

61
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:40,942
-But more than that--
there's something I must do.

62
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:46,414
My job isn't done.

63
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:46,815
Yet.

64
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:11,606
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
A new Sharingan.

65
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,811
-Hm?

66
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:18,613
What is it?

67
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:23,084
-Kakashi-Sensei, don't sweat
it if this doesn't work.

68
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:26,087
Because if it doesn't, I'll
make sure to settle things

69
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,189
once and for all.

70
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,992
-Yeah.

71
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,529
I'm sure you will,
if it comes to that.

72
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:34,929
-Right.

73
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,051
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
What's this?

74
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:10,665
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Just as I feared.

75
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:23,511
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
How can this be?

76
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:27,363
-How can these guys be even
stronger than they were before?

77
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:46,849
-It is true.

78
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:50,186
If anything, his blows have
even more force than they did.

79
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,187
-No.

80
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,722
Our enemies aren't
getting stronger.

81
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:53,789
That's not it.

82
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:06,669
-Exactly right.

83
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,744
The fact is that
we're getting weaker.

84
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,592
-We've gotten weaker?

85
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,727
Do you know why, Neji?

86
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:32,328
Why?

87
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:36,532
-Yes.

88
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,267
Why do we grow weaker
and they do not?

89
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:45,941
-It makes sense when
you think of it.

90
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:48,677
It was that jutsu.

91
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:50,346
-All right, everyone.

92
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,516
Get ready to remove the
tags on the count of three.

93
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,250
One.

94
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:55,251
Two.

95
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:55,651
Three!

96
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:02,725
-By breaking those seals we
created clones of ourselves,

97
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,827
not only identical
to us in appearance

98
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,896
but possessing all
the physical abilities

99
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,932
that we possessed at the
moment the seals were broken.

100
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:14,437
That's why defeating
them is so difficult.

101
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,306
But of course, we are all
made of flesh and blood.

102
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,578
Unlike them we grow weaker the
longer the fight continues.

103
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,381
We get less precise
in our movements,

104
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:26,782
and in executing our jutsu.

105
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:36,258
And the weaker we get,
the stronger they seem.

106
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,327
-We get tired, and they don't.

107
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,397
So, basically, the longer
this fight drags on,

108
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,599
the bigger our disadvantage is.

109
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,634
-That's about it.

110
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:46,602
-No way.

111
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:56,312
-Well, if that is the
case, the only thing to do

112
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:58,447
is not let this fight drag on.

113
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,582
We must beat them now!

114
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,367
-Oh, no!

115
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,199
-Damn you.

116
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:29,171
What now?

117
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:52,695
-Sakura.

118
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,705
-Lee?

119
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,407
Are you-- what's going on there?

120
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,946
-The answer is so simple.

121
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,717
-What do you mean?

122
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,923
-I just figured it out.

123
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,501
I know how to defeat them.

124
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:33,402
It is so obvious.

125
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:36,739
-It is?

126
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,844
Really?

127
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,512
-All right, let's hear it, then.

128
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:53,622
-You really mean it?

129
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,924
You're not just trying
to keep our spirits up?

130
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,725
-No.

131
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,193
I have a sure-fire method.

132
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,442
We just need to make
ourselves stronger

133
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:15,477
than we were when our
clones were created.

134
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,317
These clones have the
same strength levels

135
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:25,187
that we had at the moment
we removed the seals.

136
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:30,426
Now do you get it?

137
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,194
If we increase our
strength levels

138
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:35,230
from what they were
at that point in time

139
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:38,701
it is reasonable to think
we will defeat them.

140
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,335
-Brilliant deduction, Lee.

141
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,670
Brilliant.

142
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:43,472
Then again, you're my student.

143
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:50,312
-Hold it.

144
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,814
I guess that all makes sense.

145
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:54,717
But how are we supposed to
make ourselves stronger all

146
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,318
of a sudden?

147
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:59,421
-Tenten, have you forgotten?

148
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,657
The motto we learned
during our training?

149
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,259
Stronger than we were yesterday.

150
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:04,660
Remember?

151
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,536
It was those words in our
hearts that kept us going,

152
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,572
that got us through
our darkest hours.

153
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:24,413
-What's the matter?

154
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:27,182
Are you giving up already?

155
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:29,952
The three of you got no
further than you did yesterday.

156
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:30,619
-Give up?

157
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,187
No.

158
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:34,523
-We're not going to stop yet.

159
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:37,426
Not 'til we beat
yesterday's mark.

160
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,293
-That's right.

161
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,629
We all have to get stronger.

162
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:43,532
-Stronger than we
were yesterday.

163
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,301
-Stronger than yesterday.

164
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,203
-Stronger that we
were yesterday.

165
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:50,305
-Stronger than we
were yesterday.

166
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:58,247
-Thanks to that training,
Tenten, you and I became Juni.

167
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,583
And Neji became a Jonin.

168
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,752
All because we
worked hard every day

169
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,455
to be better than we
were the day before.

170
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:09,391
But are we satisfied with
how far we have come?

171
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,860
Do we stop now?

172
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:12,895
No!

173
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,696
No!

174
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,599
No, that day will never come
when I do not strive to be

175
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,536
better than I was--
yah!-- yesterday!

176
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,337
Better than I was an hour ago!

177
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,344
Better than I was a minute ago.

178
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,513
-Yes, making Jonin
meant a lot to me.

179
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:34,750
But I've never believed
it was my final goal!

180
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,252
-And I've no
intention of retiring.

181
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,922
At least not any time soon.

182
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:42,191
-It's not like I'm ready
to give up, either.

183
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:43,959
Not by a long shot!

184
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:44,560
Hya!

185
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,209
-Feel this!

186
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,743
The full power of youth!

187
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,597
-Eight trigrams-- strike!

188
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:32,507
-Weapon control, tensesai!

189
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:44,319
-Great leaf blast!

190
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:23,558
-All right.

191
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:32,534
[music playing]

192
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:01,723
NARUTO: Sorry we're late,
but I told you not to worry.

193
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:04,292
Kakashi-Sensei's here, and
he's got a new jutsu that's

194
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,561
gonna finish
Deidara permanently.

195
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,263
SAKURA: Good old
Kakashi-Sensei always

196
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:09,965
likes to keep us in suspense.

197
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,901
NARUTO: Plus he never gives us
a straight answer to anything.

198
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,603
But he always comes
through in the end.

199
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:15,737
SAKURA: You bet.

200
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:17,539
He hasn't been around all
these years for nothing.

201
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:18,807
NARUTO: He's a wily old veteran.

202
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,676
SAKURA: And experience
beats youth every time!

203
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,879
KAKASHI: Uh-- thanks, guys.

204
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,680
Was that supposed
to be a pep talk?

205
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:28,617
NARUTO: Next time--
Kakashi Enlightened!

206
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,585
[music playing]

207
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,933
KAKASHI: A thorough
knowledge of hand signs

208
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:48,503
is indispensable for the
effective casting of ninjutsu.

209
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:50,906
Today we're going to
study these signs.

210
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:52,841
While there are some
special exceptions,

211
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,445
there are essentially 12
basic sign combinations.

212
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,713
Naruto, will you demonstrate?

213
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,215
-OK.

214
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:10,759
Ne, Ushi, Tora, U, Tatsu, Mi,
Uma, Hitsuji, Saru, Tori, Inu,

215
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,595
I.

216
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,832
-Let's try combining some of the
signs to cast the clone jutsu.

217
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:20,202
It's made by combining
the Hitsuji, or sheep, Mi,

218
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:22,704
or snake, and Tora,
or tiger, signs.

219
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,706
-Everybody paying attention?

220
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:26,308
Here we go.

221
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:27,676
Hitsuji, Mi, Tora.

222
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,513
Hm?

223
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,181
Ahh!

224
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:33,582
What the--

225
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,249
-Oh, boy.

226
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,250
-What happened?

227
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:35,917
The shadow clone
jutsu's my specialty.

228
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:36,818
-Well, were you able to do it?

229
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:37,719
I sure hope so.

230
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,888
We'll see you next time.
