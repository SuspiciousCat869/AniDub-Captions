1
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,762
{\an1}Thank you,
Lady Hinata.

2
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:21,632
{\an4}I appreciate all this.
Especially considering
that you're injured as
well.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:26,269
{\an7}No problem. Someone
took care of my wound,
so I'll take care of
yours!

4
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:28,738
{\an1}The village is
so short-handed.

5
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:33,442
{\an1}I've seen just how
busy Sakura is. This
is the least I can do.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,078
{\an1}Hey, Neji!

7
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,880
{\an1}[chuckle]

8
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:44,284
{\an1}Listen, Neji. We need
to ask you a big favor,
can we interview you?

9
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,086
{\an1}Interview?

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,790
{\an4}Yeah! You know how Naruto
played such a huge part
in the battle to save the
Village, right?

11
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:53,292
{\an7}The younger kids at
the Academy asked us
to commemorate it
somehow.

12
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:58,830
{\an7}We decided to do an article
in the Academy newspaper
about everything that
Naruto's accomplished.

13
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:02,032
{\an7}<i>So we're going around</i>
<i>interviewing everyone</i>
<i>we can.</i>

14
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:05,369
{\an1}Sorry, but you'll have
to ask someone else.

15
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:07,970
{\an1}Aw... that's awfully
mean of you, Neji!

16
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:12,041
{\an4}Yeah, I'll say! All the
younger students have
really been looking
forward to this!

17
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:13,875
{\an1}Please help us!

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,578
{\an1}Look! We're
beggin' you!

19
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,747
{\an1}Please!

20
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,585
{\an1}Oh, all right...
I'll tell you guys
a very special story.

{\an1}"Neji Chronicles"

23
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,977
{\an1}This takes place
about three years
ago.

24
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,847
{\an1}On the day of the
Chunin Exam's final
round.

25
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,952
{\an1}<i>That year, the first Chunin</i>
<i>Exam was plagued with</i>
<i>problem after problem.</i>

26
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:25,556
{\an1}Feudal Lords and guests
from all over the various
nations...

27
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:30,760
{\an1}...had gathered in the
Hidden Leaf Village to
witness the final rounds.

28
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:38,966
{\an4}<i>And in the midst of all that, we</i>
<i>received reports that a Rogue</i>
<i>Ninja named Orochimaru was after</i>
<i>Sasuke.</i>

29
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:44,238
{\an1}<i>The Village tightened security,</i>
<i>preparing for every contingency</i>
<i>at every location.</i>

30
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:51,177
{\an4}<i>But still, during the finals,</i>
<i>the Hidden Sand and the Hidden</i>
<i>Sound conspired to destroy the</i>
<i>Leaf.</i>

31
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,881
{\an1}<i>It was something that no one</i>
<i>could have ever predicted.</i>

32
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:59,318
{\an4}<i>The spectators from</i>
<i>the different nations</i>
<i>remained completely</i>
<i>immersed in the matches..</i>

33
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:02,153
{\an1}<i>..unaware of what was</i>
<i>about to transpire.</i>

34
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:17,299
{\an4}<i>Right around then, I was being</i>
<i>treated in the medical room</i>
<i>after having lost my match to</i>
<i>Naruto.</i>

35
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,269
{\an1}I thought I'd come
see how you're doing.
Are you okay?

36
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:26,006
{\an1}Thanks, but
I'm fine.

37
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:32,446
{\an4}Don't be too disappointed.
I mean, it was sheer luck
that Naruto won. I'm sure
you'll win the next-

38
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,848
{\an1}Huh? Oh, I'm over that.

39
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:36,282
{\an1}Huh?

40
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:39,652
{\an1}Lord Hiashi came by
a little while ago.

41
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:46,157
{\an7}I had always believed that those
of us from the side branch of
the Hyuga clan would never truly
be free..

42
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,226
{\an7}..until the power of
the Byakugan was sealed..

43
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,629
{\an7}..and our Curse
Marks disappeared.

44
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:54,865
{\an7}But it seems Father
thought differently.

45
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,468
{\an7}It's true that some
things can never be
changed

46
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:04,206
{\an7}But still... Perhaps I've made
too many blind assumptions
about the way things are.

47
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,408
{\an1}Neji.

48
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:10,779
{\an1}Hey, let's go back
to the stadium!

49
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:16,017
{\an1}Guy Sensei and Lee are there,
and Sasuke's match sure looks
like it'll be exciting.

50
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,818
{\an1}Yeah, all right.

51
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,287
{\an1}And then it
happened...

52
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,388
{\an1}[gasp]

53
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,562
{\an1}Orochimaru's attack
on the Hidden Leaf
had begun.

54
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:36,099
{\an1}Whoa, what is
going on?!

55
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,973
{\an8}You hear that?
No more cheering,
the stadium's gone
quiet.

56
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:45,741
{\an8}Yeah. Something
feels different
now.

57
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,577
{\an1}Byakugan!

58
00:05:54,983 --> 00:06:04,858
{\an4}<i>The Hidden Sand betrayed us and</i>
<i>attacked alongside forces from</i>
<i>Orochimaru's Hidden Sound. Our</i>
<i>Village was thrown into chaos.</i>

59
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:10,395
{\an7}How could this happen?!
Fighting has broken out
in every corner of the
village.

60
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:13,432
{\an7}Sand and Sound ninja
against the Leaf.

61
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:15,634
{\an1}This is just like a-

62
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,401
{\an1}I know.

63
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:19,804
{\an1}It's like a war.

64
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:25,508
{\an4}The two of us rushed
to the stadium to find
out exactly what was
going on.

65
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:30,179
{\an1}But unbeknownst to us,
another incident was
already taking place.

66
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,480
{\an1}Is that?!

67
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,718
{\an1}<i>Lord Elder!</i>

{\an1}<i>[groan]</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

71
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:49,863
{\an4}<i>Later, Kiba told us that he'd</i>
<i>been watching over Lady Hinata,</i>
<i>after she'd collapsed due to</i>
<i>injuries from her match.</i>

72
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:55,067
{\an1}<i>He was knocked unconscious</i>
<i>by enemy ninja disguised as</i>
<i>Anbu Black Ops.</i>

73
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,673
{\an1}[grunt]
Hey...

74
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:04,075
{\an1}What the hell's
going on?!

75
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:06,011
{\an1}Sounds like you're
alright now.

76
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:08,113
{\an1}Lord Elder's wound
isn't fatal either.

77
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,914
{\an1}[grunt]
Sir! What
happened here?!

78
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:15,518
{\an1}We were attacked.
And our assailants
took Hinata!

79
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:15,985
{\an1}[gasp]

80
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,820
{\an1}They did what?!

81
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:25,426
{\an4}Two ninja from the Hidden
Cloud who were here as
spectators assaulted us
and made off with her.

82
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:33,100
{\an4}<i>No doubt they saw an opportunity</i>
<i>to use the confusion to spirit</i>
<i>the Byakugan away from the</i>
<i>Village.</i>

83
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,069
{\an1}<i>I tried to stop</i>

{\an1}[grunt]

85
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:47,980
{\an4}Neji, the Byakugan is
a top-secret jutsu that
your father protected
with his life.

86
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:51,015
{\an1}We simply cannot
allow them to take
it! Go get them!

87
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,483
{\an1}You must bring it
back, whatever it
takes!

88
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:54,818
{\an1}[grunt]

89
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,953
{\an1}I understand, sir.

90
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,355
{\an1}Wait, Neji!
I'm coming, too!

91
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:01,757
{\an1}No, this is
a matter for
the Hyuga.

92
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,126
{\an1}But it's too
much for you to
handle alone.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,164
{\an1}Then count me in.
I mean, Hinata is
my friend.

94
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,231
{\an4}And besides,
I know you don't
have a high
opinion of her.

95
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:14,601
{\an4}I have my doubts that
you're actually going
to try very hard to
save her.

{\an1}Kiba!

97

{\an1}Fine, come with
me. Your nose
will be useful.

{\an1}[sigh]

99
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,150
{\an4}I guess a three-man
squad would make it
easier to track them
down.

100
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:37,189
{\an1}You're wrong.  With Akamaru,
it's a four-man squad. We're
now a basic platoon.

{\an7}<i>(Konohamaru)</i>
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>that happened!</i>

104
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,100
{\an7}Didn't the Jonin
in the stadium
notice all of this
stuff going on?

105
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:56,071
{\an7}I don't really know. But
even if they did, they
probably couldn't spare the
manpower to deal with it.

106
00:08:56,105 --> 00:09:02,877
{\an4}After all, the situation
was so precarious that
Genin like Naruto had to
be sent on A-rank missions.

107
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,989
{\an5}I still can't
believe it! A war
suddenly breaking
out like that?

108
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,926
So much for the
alliance between
those nations!

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,394
We couldn't
pass up the
opportunity!

110
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:27,831
{\an5}The Kekkei Genkai
who's secrets
may not leave
the Village.

111
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:32,301
{\an8}The Hidden Leaf's
Byakugan is ours!

{\an1}[sniffing]

113
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:37,272
{\an4}There are two of
them, headed on
a straight line
through the forest.

114
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:41,475
{\an4}They're going toward
the boarder we share
with the Land of Rice
Paddies...

115
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,678
{\an4}Looks like they're
taking the shortest
route to the Hidden
Cloud Village.

116
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:49,449
{\an4}We're familiar with all
the territory inside our
boarder, but not outside
the Land of Fire.

117
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,818
{\an1}We gotta end
this before they
get too far!

What's wrong?

120
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:59,125
{\an5}Akamaru can determine
the enemy's strength
simply by sniffing
their chakra.

121
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,827
{\an7}<i>(Kiba)</i>
<i>These guys seem</i>
<i>like a real handful.</i>

122
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,464
{\an7}They must be higher
than Chunin level.
Our chances don't
look too good.

123
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:08,699
There are still
ways to win!

124
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,534

mount a surprise
attack, and--

So gross...

<i>...but I didn't</i>
<i>know the truth.</i>

273
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,545
{\an7}I blamed fate,
and held onto
my grudge.

274
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,149
{\an7}<i>But during our</i>
<i>battle, Naruto</i>
<i>explained.</i>

275
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:21,221
{\an7}<i>He told me, Hinata,</i>
<i>that you were </i>
<i>suffering just as</i>
<i>much as I was.</i>

276
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:29,195
{\an7}<i>He said that to gain</i>
<i>acceptance and respect, you</i>
<i>had been trying incredibly</i>
<i>hard to change.</i>

277
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,699
{\an7}I hadn't even
considered what
you were going
through.

278
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:37,502
{\an7}He helped me to
understand just how
selfish and narrow-
minded I was being.

279
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,772
{\an7}[gasp] Naruto
did that?

280
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,474
{\an7}Naruto Uzumaki...

281
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:46,210
{\an7}There's something
about him...

282
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,379
{\an7}Yes!

283
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,653
{\an8}Well he was involved
in the most important
part, so don't worry.

284
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,654
{\an8}What part?!

285
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:02,156
{\an8}Good luck with
the article! I
Look forward to
reading it.

286
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,025
{\an1}[gasps]

287
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:06,361
{\an1}Aww come on,
Neji! No fair!

288
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:09,196
{\an7}You have to tell
us what the most
important part was!

289
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:14,967
{\an7}It's all important!
Every bit. But without
Naruto, that story may
never have happened at all.

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,571
{\an7}<i>(Moegi)</i>
<i>But, we wanna hear</i>

<i>actually did!</i>

291
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:23,908
{\an7}<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Haha! Then maybe you should</i>

<i>I told you ask someone else!</i>

292

{\an1}Ahhh!
Ahhh!

293

{\an1}Who the heck are
you, mister!? You
scared me!

{\an4}<i>(Kisuke)</i>
<i>Oh yeah? Well you're</i>

<i>with that scream!</i>

295
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,663
{\an4}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Hey wait, what</i>

296
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:08,565
{\an4}<i>(Kisuke)</i>
<i>I don't know...</i>
<i>All of a sudden </i>
<i>I was just here!</i>

297
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,133
{\an4}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>All of a sudden!?</i>
<i>What kind of lame</i>
<i>joke...?</i>

298
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:15,704
{\an4}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Uh... Mister? Could you</i>
<i>come take a look in the</i>
<i>mirror for a second?</i>

299
