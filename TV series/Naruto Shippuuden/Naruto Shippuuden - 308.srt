1
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,146
{\an1}I know how hard this
must be, Yugao.

2
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,085
{\an1}Even so, you're the one best
suited for this mission. You
have to go.

3
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:18,485
{\an1}But, Sukui...

4
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:20,387
{\an1}It might seem cruel, I know...

5
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:26,226
{\an4}But in order to reduce the
casualties on our side, we need
as much intel on our enemy as
possible.

6
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,362
{\an1}It might even help
you save lives.

7
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:33,401
{\an1}Now, go. I'm giving
you an order.

8
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:35,737
Mhmm.

9
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,044
You think she'll
be all right?

10
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:45,079
{\an1}This is like
a nightmare...

11
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,555
{\an1}It appears they've erased any
trace of their scent.

12
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:57,158
{\an1}Bringing a Sensory-type was a
good move.

13
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,627
{\an1}Yugao, can you locate the
targets?

14
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:06,367
{\an4}They've detoured around the
battleground to the forest
ahead. They're at about two
o'clock.

15
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,370
{\an1}If we go around, we could
confront them head on.

16
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:21,950
{\an1}You've gotten better.

17
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,687
{\an1}I know. Not bad, right?

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,221
{\an1}I can win about half of our
bouts now.

19
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:30,759
{\an1}Don't get ahead of yourself.
It's really more like one out of
three.

20
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,430
{\an1}That's only because you can
use Transparency Style.

21
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,833
{\an1}But just wait, I'll catch
up to you in no time.

22
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,035
{\an1}You're gonna have to work
way harder to do that!

23
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:42,571
You're open!

24
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,941
Hmph.

25
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,911
{\an1}Huh?

26
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:50,679
[Chuckles]
I lost.

27
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,014
{\an1}You don't get off that easy.

28
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:56,118
But don't worry. I'll
always protect you.

29
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,861
{\an1}All right then, before the
battle begins...

30
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,131
{\an1}We should know more about
who we're up against.

31
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:15,205
{\an1}He's Hayate Gekko, an expert in
the Hidden Leaf Sword Style and
the Transparency Jutsu.

32
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,339
He is highly skilled.

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,309
{\an1}We'll want to avoid close
quarters combat.

34
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,443
{\an1}We better hurry.

35
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,550
{\an1}How boring! That was over too
fast! I wanted to do some more
damage!

36
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,921
{\an1}Are you kidding me? I'm already
sick of being used like this!

37
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:36,092
{\an1}Come on, we just got brought
back to life! We should be
enjoying ourselves, right?

38
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,197
{\an1}<i>To meet again like this...</i>

39
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>But you could...</i>

40
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,637
{\an1}Hey, I'm talking to you. Are you
trying to ignore me, you
bastard?!

41
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,106
{\an1}They're coming.

42
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,405
Hmph.

43
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:55,912
[Screams]

44
00:04:57,947 --> 00:05:02,352
{\an7}Oh! So this is what they mean
when they say we have bodies
that can't die. Well, that's
convenient!

45
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:03,853
{\an1}<i>Don't speak so soon!</i>

46
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,196
[Laughing] A posse, huh?

47
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,364
{\an1}This is more like it!

48
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:19,335
{\an1}Still two left, I wish we could
have stopped at least one more
but...

49
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,872
[Chuckling] That other
reanimated guy didn't last
long...

50
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:27,011
{\an1}But still, this is perfect! You
and I can share this prey,
fifty-fifty!

51
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,478
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

52
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,249
{\an1}We'll take that one.

53
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,516
All right!

54
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,226
{\an1}Yugao, you've come...

55
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,768
{\an1}Just stay back.

56
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,137
{\an1}Sorry, but I'm the one
you're going up against!

57
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,707
{\an1}Earth Style: Flying Stones!

58
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:59,143
Huh!

59
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,412
Now you're mine!

Please! Just keep your
distance from me!

63
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:11,522
{\an1}If you want me to do that, then
return the scroll you took!

64
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,131
No way! [Grunts]

Pay attention!
[Grunts]

{\an1}And now I'll take
care of <i>you!</i>

70
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,822
I'm so sorry.

71

{\an1}I'm an enemy of the Leaf. And
I'm an enemy of yours, as well.

72
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:52,696
{\an1}And that's why I want you to
stop me.

73

{\an1}I don't want to hurt you!

{\an1}[Gasp]

I can't do it!

81

{\an1}[Groaning] I just can't.

82
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,838

00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:37,243

{\an1}This'll hurt a bit. I'll close
the wound.

It's not.

105
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,723
{\an1}But what you said before,
is it true? That you...

106
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,526
<i>That you can't fight?</i>

107
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:03,430
I apologize.

108
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:08,567
{\an1}I always wanted to be an ANBU
Black Ops, so when I heard you'd
left them, I lost my head.

109
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:09,635
{\an3}Huh?

00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:11,570
{\an1}I'm going to get water.

Please, don't go.

112
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,660
Hayate's course
hasn't changed.

113
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:37,664
{\an1}You'll catch him, even if
I'm not here to help.

114
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:40,901
{\an1}If I stay there's still
nothing I can do.

115
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:47,674
{\an1}Why exactly did you leave the
ANBU Black Ops, anyway?

116
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,281
{\an1}Hayate was the love of my life.

117
00:09:54,948 --> 00:10:00,354
{\an7}And at the time, years ago, we
were both studying the Leaf
Sword Style.

118
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:03,690
{\an1}As training partners, we honed
our skills together.

119
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,631
There!

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,969
{\an1}Quite impressive.

121
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,906
{\an1}The Hokage himself certified my
Transparency Style.

122
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:24,345
{\an1}My Sensory skills and my
swordsmanship are why I was
chosen to be ANBU.

123
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,683
{\an1}But you still need some work.

{\an1}I'm almost there!

[Gasp]

126
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:37,859
{\an1}Hayate?

127
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,129
{\an1}I should be happy that your
strength was acknowledged.

128
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:44,165
{\an1}But real missions are
extremely dangerous...

129
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,635
...far riskier than mere
training sessions like this.

130

{\an1}Please...be careful.

131

{\an1}ANBU Black Ops were killed in
this hospital?!

Hayate, I'm okay. But...

133
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:04,453
Huh.

134
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,925
{\an1}The culprit was Kabuto Yakushi.
It seems that he was actually
Orochimaru's spy.

135
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,662
{\an1}You mean the one who was taking
part in the Chunin Exam?

136
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,265
{\an1}He had us all fooled.

137
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:22,737
{\an4}It appears that their goal was
to go after Sasuke, but that
alone doesn't explain all their
actions.

{\an1}Our path is clear, we must learn
more about whatever plans
they've now put into motion.

140
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,889
It's way too dangerous.

141
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,193
I mean, he held his
own against Kakashi!

142
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,196
{\an1}But still someone
has to do it.

143
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,832
{\an1}And with my Tracking Jutsu,
I'm the ideal choice.

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,901
Yes, but...

145
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,672

{\an1}Hayate...I am going to
avenge you!

157
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:29,032
{\an1}<i>It was my way of avenging</i>

158
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:34,904
{\an1}<i>But when the fighting ended, my</i>

{\an1}So now, because of that, it
