{\an1}You were gonna use your
Ketsuryugan to get revenge
against the Uchiha...

3
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:03,839
{\an1}who forced the Chinoike Clan to
Hell Valley?

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,274
Hmm.

5
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,411
So I was your target
from the very start.

6
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:13,615
{\an1}If I sent Exploding Humans to
the Leaf Village, I figured
you'd be sure to go back.

7
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:17,419
{\an1}I planned to kill you along
with the entire Leaf, but...

8
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,955
{\an1}But what, then? We met at
the Bamboo Village?

9
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,892
{\an1}Coincidence can be pretty
scary, don't you think?

10
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:29,063
{\an1}We attacked that village just to
get back at them for what
they did to us before.

{\an1}We never expected that going
there would lead to running
into you.

{\an1}<i>(Chino) But thanks to the head</i>

{\an1}I'll never forgive you,
Fuushin!

16
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,019
I was after Fuushin...

17
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:59,090
{\an1}so you joined me and used your
Exploding Humans as a
diversion whenever needed.

18
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:04,661
And Nowaki, or rather
Fuushin, would attack me with
his chakra sword.

19
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,398
{\an1}And in case you couldn't kill
me...

20
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:11,267
{\an1}you even asked an old partner to
stand by and pretend to be
Fuushin.

21
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:14,971
{\an1}[chuckles] Well, then? Are you
gonna kill me now?

22

{\an1}<i>(Chino) We're both the last ones</i>
<i>left from the Chinoike and</i>
<i>Uchiha Clans.</i>

23
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,346
{\an1}So let's put everything on the
line!

24
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,848
{\an1}And fight to the death!

in doing that.

usual.

27
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:38,159
{\an1}But don't think that you can go
around with that cool expression
of yours on your face forever!

28
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:44,631

your exceptional skill, Sakura!

156
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:52,177
{\an1}The ringleader was turned over
to the authorities last night,
isn't that right?

157
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,278
Yeah.

158
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,212
{\an1}So was Sasuke there, then?

159
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,115
{\an1}I thought that he would be.

160
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,386
{\an1}But they asked for Leaf
shinobi to go to the Land of
Steam to take custody.

161
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,023
{\an1}The one who captured the
ringleader didn't come back
here with them.

Well, hello.

165
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,373
{\an1}I'm the one behind all this.

166
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,010
{\an1}I take full responsibility for
everything.

167
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:31,245
{\an1}So please, I want
you to be lenient with these
guys.

168
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,717
{\an1}No! That isn't what we want,
Chino!

169
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,885
{\an1}Yeah. That's right, Chino!

170
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,387
{\an1}All right, just calm down.

171
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:45,192
{\an1}The truth is I discussed it with
the Mizukage of the Land of Mist
and she wants to take you in.

172
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,996
{\an1}Wh-Why would she?

173
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:52,065
{\an1}Because now's the only
time to stop the chain of
negativity.

But why?

183

{\an1}You must atone for what you
did and doing that will take the
rest of your lives.

break out when you live within

shoulder to shoulder, for year
after year.

257

build up, and you start hating

Clan.

{\an1}Yes, they were definitely
like that, however.

was killed...

263

things stopped mattering to me.

264
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,852
{\an1}So that's why you killed your
entire clan?

265
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:47,623
{\an1}[chuckles] Even still, my
daughter was surprisingly
adorable.

266
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:53,996
{\an1}You witnessed the foolish things
that your dear daughter was
doing in the Coliseum.

267
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:57,533
{\an1}Is that why you gave up on
acquiring Sasuke...

268
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:01,036
{\an1}and instead just used him to put
a stop to her actions?

269
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,339
{\an1}[chuckles] Such a doting
parent.

270
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:07,175
{\an1}Well, I consider myself more
of a disaster, honestly.

271
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,645
{\an1}But still, this whole thing
just kinda feels weird, you
know?

272
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:15,983
{\an1}Sasuke isn't even here in the
Village, but it's like we're
both on a mission together.

273
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,752
{\an1}Yeah, you're right.

274
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,124
{\an1}There's lots of things only a
talented ninja can do. That's
why we need Sasuke around.

275
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:28,828
{\an1}There are guys out there who
are doing terrible things,
like what just happened.

276
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:33,766
{\an1}But I guess that it all works
out in the end if there are guys
like Sasuke to counter them.

277
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,599
Hmm!

278
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,170
{\an1}What's up, Sakura? You seem
kinda happy!

279
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:39,171

281
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,777
{\an1}Before he left to go on his
journey, Sasuke told me...

282
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,180
{\an1}This is a trip to atone for my
sins.

283

{\an1}With what just happened...

284
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:56,487
{\an1}I know Sasuke is definitely
trying extremely hard to
accomplish all of that.

Hmm?

288
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:04,160
{\an1}I just wish that I was
standing next to him while he
does.

00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,836
{\an1}<i>You may not be back in the</i>
<i>village right now, but you're</i>
<i>still protecting it. </i>

296
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:53,639
{\an1}<i>You're just like a one-man Leaf</i>
<i>Police Force!</i>

297
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:58,643
{\an1}<i>(Young Sasuke) Are you going to</i>
<i>join the force too?</i>

298
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,912
{\an1}<i>(Itachi) Well, I'm not sure.</i>

299
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,247
{\an1}<i>(Young Sasuke) Why not?</i>

300
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:06,117
{\an1}Boy, when I grow up, I'm
definitely gonna enter the
police force.

301
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:17,661
{\an1}It's been a while, maybe, I'll
go home.

302
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:59,488
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru)</i> The issue with the
Land of Silence could become
violent.

303
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:03,424
{\an1}<i>But if the Alliance finds out</i>
<i>that we're independently</i>
<i>investigating this...</i>

304
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:04,892
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) it's gonna be</i>
<i>troublesome.</i>

305
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,096
{\an1}<i>Still, taking action against the</i>
<i>Land of Silence in the name of</i>
<i>the Alliance will be thorny.</i>

306
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,633
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Just when we'd</i>
<i>finally achieved peace.</i>

307
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,202
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>

308
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:21,073
{\an1}<i>"Shikamaru's Story: A Cloud</i>
<i>Drifting in the Silent Dark,</i>
<i>Part 1: The State of Affairs."</i>

309
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,943
{\an1}<i>We can't stand by anymore</i>
<i>without taking action.</i>
