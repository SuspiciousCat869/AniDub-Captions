1
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,440
{\an1}It's serious! Someone has
come down into our village!

2
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,477
{\an1}Is it Lord Orochimaru?

3
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,781
{\an1}Don't know. We haven't been
able to confirm who it is yet.

4
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,720
{\an1}Well, if it is Lord
Orochimaru, we will

5
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:12,288
welcome him.

6
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,394
{\an1}If it's a Leaf pursuer...

7
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,633
...then we'll
take care of them!

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,951
<i>Where am I?</i>

9
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:44,359
{\an1}<i>What a strange place...</i>

10
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,634
{\an1}<i>What is he doing here?</i>

11
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:53,969
{\an1}<i>Did he follow me?</i>

12
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:58,408
{\an1}<i>It looks like this really</i>
<i>is a secret hideout.</i>

13
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,845
{\an1}<i>It's a good thing I</i>
<i>found those tracks.</i>

14
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:04,315
{\an1}<i>Have I stumbled upon</i>
<i>something important?</i>

15
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:10,589
{\an1}<i>Mist? No, it's not...</i>

16
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,664
{\an1}This isn't an ordinary
diversion. All right, then.

17
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,804
{\an1}I'm going to find out
who you really are!

18
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,243
[groaning]

19
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,681
{\an1}With that mask. You must
be an ANBU from the Leaf!

20
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,652
You got me! But
who are you?

21
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,588
What exactly are
you doing here!

22
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,104
{\an1}What is that jutsu?!

23
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,974
That's enough.
I'll handle it.

24
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,790
[groaning]

25
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,592
{\an1}Body Oxidation Jutsu.

26
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,261
{\an1}I'll corrode your
body from the inside.

27
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,696
[groaning]

28
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,768
{\an1}Your chakra, blood, organs,
nerves, bone, and muscles.

29
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,604
They'll oxidize
and deteriorate.

30
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,741
Now, how does
this feel?!

31
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:29,412
[grunting]

32
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:32,916
{\an1}<i>Kakashi Hatake...</i>

33
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,395
{\an1}I know what your goal is!

34
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:47,199
{\an1}But you will not lay a
hand on Lord Orochimaru.

35
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,002
Because, before
you can do so...

36
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,439
We will simply
get rid of you!

37
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:53,907
Wood Style!

38
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:58,813
Stop it! You
can't let him die!

39
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:02,149
{\an1}Why not? He's an agent
of the Hidden Leaf!

40
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,986
I can get useful
information out of

41
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:05,921
{\an1}him about crossing
the border.

42
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:08,090
{\an1}Who cares?! We'll kill
anyone who threatens

43
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:10,058
Lord Orochimaru.

44
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,996
{\an1}Well, then I'll have to
take both of you down.

45
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:16,000
[groaning]

46
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:26,444
{\an1}You're brave, taking a stand
like that. But know this.

47
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,247
{\an1}If you're wrong about
letting him live.

48
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:32,350
{\an1}What happened to him
will happen to you, too.

49
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:36,856
{\an1}<i>Wood Style! He's the one</i>
<i>from the Foundation.</i>

50
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:57,313
{\an1}It seems you're finally
awake. All right, I'm gonna

51
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,315
ask you some
questions now.

52
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,754
{\an1}First, where are we? And
what are you doing here?

53
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,591
{\an1}[chuckle] I'm the one
who's going to be asking

54
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,091
{\an1}the questions here.

55
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:09,994
Wood Style!

56
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:12,496
[grunting]

57
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,633
{\an1}How did you find out
about this place?

58
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,904
{\an1}[grunt] I found it by
chance. Of all the luck.

59
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,074
[grunting]

60
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,751
{\an1}I'm sure you Leaf
shinobi can handle

61
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,353
{\an1}this on your own.

62
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,689
{\an1}How much does the Hidden
Leaf Village know about Lord

63
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,424
{\an1}Orochimaru and his plans?

64
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,427
[grunting]

65
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,864
{\an1}Fine, don't talk.
I'm very patient.

66
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,267
{\an1}In time, you'll tell
me everything...

67
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:49,873
{\an1}Are you all right?

68
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,676
Sorry, that was
our only choice.

69
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,945
You mean, you...

70
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,913
{\an1}Lord Danzo's orders.
I'm supposed to wait

71
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,849
here for Lord
Orochimaru.

72
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,686
{\an1}Just as I thought...
You intend on allowing

73
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,022
{\an1}Orochimaru to escape.

74
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,424
{\an1}Really, we're both
after the same thing.

75
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,627
{\an1}Lord Danzo's only
thinking about the safety

76
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,929
{\an1}of the Hidden Leaf.

77
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,531
What we're most
concerned about is Lord

78
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,334
{\an1}Orochimaru leaving the
village's borders.

79
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,070
{\an1}And that's why Lord
Danzo has send me to

80
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,972
{\an1}stop that from happening.

81
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,674
{\an1}I wonder about that...

82
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,445
{\an1}Orochimaru is seriously
wounded. If he can't move,

83
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,882
{\an1}obtaining intel is useless.

84
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,117
{\an1}He might not even
reach this location.

85
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,420
Maybe that's why
intel's so important.

86
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,956
{\an1}By the way, are those
other guys connected to

87
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,126
{\an1}Orochimaru somehow?
Who are they?

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,895
The Iburi Clan.

89
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,031
{\an1}They have the ability
to transform their

90
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:41,498
{\an1}bodies into smoke.

91
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,869
{\an1}Orochimaru discovered
them and apparently

92
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:47,305
{\an1}performed experiments
on them.

93
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:49,274
Experiments?

94
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:53,446
{\an1}Now, what I'm about to tell
you is merely hearsay.

95
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,483
{\an1}But I believe that
someone is continuing the

96
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:59,252
{\an1}experiments and trying
to implant the cells of

97
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,822
Lord Hashirama.

98
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,826
Transformation
into smoke...

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,594
{\an1}If I have to fight
them again, that jutsu

100
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,529
will be a real
nuisance.

101
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:11,533
{\an1}When that smoke got
inside me before, I lost

102
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,204
{\an1}all control of my body.

103
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:15,805
Is that so?

104
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,873
[gasp]

105
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,378
{\an1}I should have known.

106
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:25,217
{\an1}Ultimately, Danzo is
of the Hidden Leaf.

107
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,819
{\an1}And right now, Lord
Orochimaru is just another

108
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,655
{\an1}enemy, isn't that
right, Kinoe?!

109
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:35,661
{\an1}Bastard! You were plotting
since the beginning!

110
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,267
{\an1}<i>There are too many</i>
<i>here to take on.</i>

111
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:46,006
{\an1}We will stand firm
alongside Lord Orochimaru.

112
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,245
{\an1}And both of you will die for
Lord Orochimaru's sake!

113
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:51,780
[gasp]

114
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,587
Tenzo...

115
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,935
{\an1}For Lord Orochimaru's
sake. No...

116
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,839
Tenzo!

117
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:15,740
Hm?

118
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,445
I won't let you
touch Tenzo!

119
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:22,882
Tenzo?

120
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:25,819
{\an1}Are you still going
on about that?

121
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,122
I know! I know,
all right!

122
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,158
Tenzo is already
gone, isn't he?

123
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:32,159
But...

124
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,929
Not again! I
won't let you!

125
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:38,767
Tenzo!

126
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:47,244
Yukimi...

127
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,512
{\an1}Are you seriously...

128
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,749
Betraying Lord
Orochimaru?!

129
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,327
Come on!
This way!

130
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,362
{\an1}What is going on?

131
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:06,932
{\an1}Follow me, Tenzo!

132
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,786
What does this
path connect to?

133
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:26,989
{\an1}It leads outside!

134
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:27,923
[gasp]

135
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:30,994
{\an1}You're going to help us
escape from Orochimaru?

136
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:32,762
I don't know.

137
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,697
Kinoe!

138
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,733
Yeah, okay.

139
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:39,970
{\an1}Hey, uh, are we really
going outside now?

140
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,138
Yes!

141
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,976
{\an1}But if you go outside aren't
you afraid of the wind?

142
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,946
{\an1}It's just there's
something that I really

143
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,915
{\an1}want to see out there.

144
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,883
Huh?

145
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,517
What is it?

146
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,954
{\an1}You hear it? Listen!

147
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,422
Huh?

148
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,061
{\an1}Just listen carefully. It's
faint, but you can hear it.

149
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,634
Yeah! I hear it!

150
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,605
{\an1}I really want to see it, to
find out where all those

151
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:11,941
{\an1}sounds come from.

152
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,044
{\an1}Together with you, Tenzo!

153
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:15,945
[gasp]

154
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,316
Damn it!

155
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:28,793
{\an1}Wha--?! What, and I just
get left behind here?

156
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:43,277
{\an1}Wahoo! [giggling]

157
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,046
{\an1}This really isn't fair!

158
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,716
{\an1}Please! You have to
get out of my body.

159
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,752
{\an1}No, not yet! Till we reach
the source of that sound,

160
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,755
{\an1}we'll be together,
just the two of us.

161
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:55,490
[sigh]

162
00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:00,830
{\an1}[grunts] This feels so good!

163
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:04,301
{\an1}Right now, I feel like the
two of us can do anything!

164
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,771
The two of us.

165
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,393
{\an1}Finally, I'm out.

166
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,261
{\an1}I thought climbing
straight up would do it,

167
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,163
but it sure
wasn't easy.

168
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,401
{\an1}Damn it, I've had nothing
but bad luck today.

169
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:36,270
[gasp]

170
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,873
Who's there?

171
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:40,375
Where is Yukimi?

172
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,045
Sorry, I don't
have a clue.

173
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,547
{\an1}Defying me again, huh?

174
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:49,018
{\an1}Have you forgotten the pain
you experienced earlier?

175
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,390
If you're smoke,
then I'll do this!

176
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:15,115
You're mine!

177
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,051
[grunting]

178
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,095
[excited scream]

179
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:00,267
{\an1}That's the sound! I
hear it so clearly!

180
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,703
Isn't this so
exciting, Tenzo?!

181
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,138
Yeah, well...

182
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:06,241
Oh. All right,
hold on.

183
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:14,150
{\an1}This spot should be good.
Now, just stay still.

184
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:20,689
Okay!

185
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:24,961
{\an1}It's all right now!

186
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,264
{\an1}Come on, let's go!

187
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,313
Wow, I'm here!
So this is it!

188
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,950
{\an1}Isn't it amazing?
There're so many people!

189
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,655
{\an1}Oh, I smell something tasty!
What could it be, Tenzo?!

190
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,455
Oh, my!

191
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,391
I know! She's
so loud!

192
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,727
{\an1}Can you believe those
guys?! Ugh, how rude!

193
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,601
{\an1}Come on! What did you
think you were doing?

194
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,769
{\an1}Look at this! You've
completely ruined

195
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,338
our merchandise!

196
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,007
Tadah!

197
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,711
Tenzo! What
do you think?!

198
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:11,348
It, uh... looks
good on you.

199
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,265
{\an1}The only way to defeat him
is with a surprise attack!

200
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:58,538
[gasp]

201
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Damn it!

202
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:03,310
[chuckle]

203
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:04,311
[grunting]

204
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,984
[grunting]

205
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,661
{\an1}It's over! So talk!
Where's Yukimi?!

206
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,497
Huh?

207
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,640
So, that was
a clone, huh?

208
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,710
{\an1}Tell me, how does it feel to
take down your own clone?

209
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,417
[grunting]

210
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,732
[screaming]

211
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:00,777
Yukimi...

212
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,518
{\an1}You are the only one who
can help Lord Orochimaru.

213
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,988
{\an1}What are you talking
about?! Hey!

214
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,532
How was it?

215
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,167
{\an1}Did you have fun?

216
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:26,172
{\an1}Yeah, but now that
I've seen it myself, it

217
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,441
{\an1}wasn't really as great
as I thought it would be.

218
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,677
What do you
mean? Why's that?

219
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,913
{\an1}It's just that the festival
was completely different

220
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,581
{\an1}from what I'd imagined.

221
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,551
{\an1}If I'd come by myself,
I might not even

222
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,453
{\an1}have known what to do.

223
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,289
{\an1}But since it was the
two of us, Tenzo, it

224
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:42,791
{\an1}was loads of fun!

225
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:46,428
You're right...

226
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,131
"Since it was
the two of us."

227
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,138
{\an1}I was a test subject too.

228
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,779
{\an1}I was poked, prodded, and
stared at it was so painful.

229
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,013
{\an1}I could hardly bear it.

230
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,218
And many of my
friends even died.

231
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,422
{\an1}When you're all alone,
the only thing you

232
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,458
really think
about is dying.

233
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:15,495
But when there
are two of you.

234
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,867
{\an1}The only thing you can
think about is surviving.

235
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:31,480
{\an1}Do you want to run away
somewhere... together?!

236
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,985
{\an1}You've gotta be kidding me.

237
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:46,162
{\an1}Let's return to your
village, together.

238
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,268
{\an1}You're going to have to
go back there immediately.

239
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,269
It's important.

240
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,805
Let's go. Now.

241
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,242
{\an1}Wait just a minute, Kakashi!
Has something happened?

242
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:58,611
Kinoe!

243
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,548
{\an1}This girl is crucial to
the effort to capture

244
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:04,384
{\an1}Orochimaru. He's going
to go to the village all

245
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,954
{\an1}because she exists.

246
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,958
{\an1}We are all of no use...

247
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,628
{\an1}...we have to offer young
Yukimi's blood to Lord

248
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,230
Orochimaru.

249
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,668
She's bait...

250
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,636
{\an1}This is still a mission.

251
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:31,683
{\an1}My mission is just as you
suspected, Kakashi. I'm

252
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:34,117
{\an1}supposed to allow
Orochimaru to get away.

253
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:34,852
What?!

254
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,221
Kinoe!

255
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,991
{\an1}My name is Tenzo!

256
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:40,726
{\an1}Don't mess around!

257
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,178
[chuckle]

258
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,419
Tenzo, wait!
What's the matter?!

259
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,888
What happened
back there?!

260
00:22:58,016 --> 00:22:59,451
{\an1}<i>Lord Orochimaru...</i>

261
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:03,223
{\an1}<i>Inferior things are</i>
<i>useless. Well then, it</i>

262
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,792
{\an1}<i>must be your blood!</i>

263
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:08,596
{\an1}<i>Only with the blood of the</i>
<i>young will this ability</i>

264
00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:10,464
<i>manifest itself.</i>

265
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,800
{\an1}<i>But that's--! You said</i>
<i>you'd help guide us</i>

266
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,468
{\an1}<i>to the next generation.</i>

267
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:19,908
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Their Own Paths"</i>

268
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,110
<i>Yukimi!</i>
