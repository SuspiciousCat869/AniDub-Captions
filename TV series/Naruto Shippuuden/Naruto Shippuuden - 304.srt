1
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:21,378
I don't get it...
What just happened?

2
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,480
<i>(Shino)</i>
<i>Them too?</i>

3
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:24,981
{\an3}Huh?

4
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,450
{\an5}I thought we brought
down the enemy, but
they activated some
kind of jutsu.

5
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:33,055
{\an4}Yeah... he was barely
breathing, so I figured
that I'd better bring
him here...

6
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:38,893
{\an4}But because of those white
guys in disguise, the medical
corps have stopped taking in
any new wounded shinobi.

7
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:42,362
{\an1}So for now, we can't
do anything else for
them...

8
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:43,697
No, not Neji!

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,433
{\an1}Wait, stay back!
Don't come any closer.

10
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,803
{\an1}It might be White
Zetsu's Transformation
Jutsu--

11
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:51,537
{\an1}Be cautious.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,239
What do you think
could have happened
here, Shino?!

13
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:56,441
{\an1}They probably fell
into an enemy trap...

14
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:59,644
Then we have to
locate the enemy
immediately and-

15
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,012
{\an1}<i>I doubt we can.</i>

16
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,379
{\an3}[gasp]

17
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:06,717
{\an1}All of us, even Neji and
Kiba, were already using
our sensory powers.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,220
{\an1}We must remain calm if
we're going to save those
who can still be saved.

19
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:15,158
{\an1}First, Hinata, your
eyes will be crucial.

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,959
{\an1}Could you
examine them?

21
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,761
{\an3}[gasp]

22
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:25,100
Byakugan!

23
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:32,572
What's going on? It's
weak, but I can still
sense their chakra!

24
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,608
Although it's no longer
circulating though their
bodies--!

25
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,781
{\an1}Yes, I see...

26
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,718
{\an1}It's weak, but
there's a heartbeat.

27
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,720
{\an1}They're in a state of
suspended animation.

28
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,922
Then we can
still save them!

29
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:55,559
{\an4}Perhaps... But if
the flow of chakra
has stopped, they
won't last long...

30
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,360
But, we have to...

31
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,631
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Kiba... Neji... You</i>
<i>went off on your own</i>
<i>again, did you?</i>

32
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:08,536
Well, this time around,
I'm not gonna let you
two go without me!

33
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:26,451
No way! The flow of
their chakra stopped!

34
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,553
{\an1}[gasp] I'll go get
the Medical Corps!

35
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:29,287
No, don't.

36
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,156
{\an1}[gasp]

37
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:34,059
{\an1}Whoever shows up could
just be a disguised enemy!

38
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:37,661
{\an1}Shikamaru would say the
same if he were conscious.

39
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:38,796
{\an1}<i>But... I--!</i>

40
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,898
Relax, I'll take care
of these two...

41
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,811
{\an1}What are you doing?

42
00:02:55,844 --> 00:03:01,381
{\an4}I'll infuse them with
my chakra, and use the
pressure to circulate
their own internal chakra!

43
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,682
{\an1}That's ridiculous!

44
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,852
{\an1}You can't rotate the
chakra of two shinobi
all by yourself!

45
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,088
I have to do
something, don't I!?

46
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,158
{\an1}I'm the only person here
who knows medical ninjutsu.

47
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,759
I must try to help
them however I can.

48
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,996
{\an1}<i>But, one wrong step</i>
<i>and you'll die, too!</i>

49
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,831
This is something
I have to do...

50
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,041
{\an1}Shino, just what are
you trying to do?

51
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:33,442
My Parasitic Insects
devour chakra--

52
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:38,680
{\an4}--and since chakra often
acts like water, it flows
toward wherever there's
any empty space available.

53
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:41,817
{\an1}But doing that will
deplete what little
chakra they have left!

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,819
I know... however-

55
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:48,889
{\an5}I'll let the insects
eat my chakra, and
then transfer it to
Kiba and the others.

56
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:51,391
{\an7}Can you actually do
something like that?

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,626
Leave it to me.

58
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,865
{\an7}<i>In truth, my Parasitic</i>
<i>Insects don't have the</i>
<i>trait that enables them</i>
<i>to transfer chakra.</i>

59
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:03,367
{\an7}<i>But if I can successfully</i>
<i>manipulate each insect</i>
<i>one by one...</i>

60
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:09,607
{\an5}I have tens of thousands
of insects. I won't let
the chakra flow in Kiba
and the others stop!

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,742
{\an7}But aren't you going
to use up all of your
own chakra doing that?

62
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,278
Don't worry about me.

63
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,745
{\an1}Don't worry about me!

64
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,114
In the meantime,
get word to HQ...

65
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,183
We'll need a
counterstrategy!

66
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:22,651
{\an1}Right away!

67
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:28,590
{\an7}<i>With the way things are</i>
<i>right now, we all have</i>
<i>to do whatever we can.</i>

68
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,693
[hiss]

69
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,334
{\an8}The Underworld
Transfer Jutsu....

70
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:44,370
{\an7}A jutsu that transports
only the victim's spirit
inside of a barrier...

71
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:46,672
{\an8}It seems to have
worked nicely...

72
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:52,376
{\an7}<i>Extracted souls are placed</i>
<i>inside a special barrier</i>
<i>where they're materialized...</i>

73
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,150
{\an7}<i>Try thought they might,</i>
<i>they can't escape.</i>

74
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:03,486
{\an7}<i>And they can fight</i>
<i>without interference</i>
<i>from the living.</i>

75
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:11,327
{\an7}<i>However, the moment that their</i>
<i>physical bodies die, their </i>
<i>souls die as well.</i>

76
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:19,567
{\an7}<i>Of course, the Sound Four</i>
<i>who were brought back with</i>
<i>the Reanimation Jutsu had no</i>
<i>physical bodies to begin with</i>

77
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:29,009
{\an7}Which means that they have
no bodies that can die, so
inside that barrier, they're
invincible and immortal!

78
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:33,746
{\an8}[chuckle]
This'll be quite
interesting.

79
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,145
{\an1}What is this place?

80
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:31,213
{\an1}Hm.

81
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:32,414
Yeah, what's
going on?

82
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:33,215
{\an3}[bark]

83
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:35,183
{\an1}What's happened
to us?

84
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:38,185
{\an1}Hey, what are you and
Choji doing here, shikamaru?

85
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:40,587
Nevermind. I
don't even know
where "here" is...

86
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:45,825
{\an1}It looks to me like all
of us have been snared by
some kind of nasty jutsu.

87
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,559
{\an1}so it would seem.

88
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,297
Huh? Shikamaru!
Look up there!

89
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,438
{\an1}Seems our game has
already entered the
next level!

90
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:04,641
{\an4}Damn it! I can't believe
that we had to lose just
to keep these lame bastards
from getting away!

91
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,610
{\an1}Damn, that pisses
my off big time!

92
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,712
{\an1}Tayuya, watch
your language!

93
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:10,646
Oh, shut up, fatso!

94
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:14,183
This is a special
barrier...

95
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:18,454
{\an1}It was made specifically
to lock you guys up and
materialize your souls...

96
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,756
Nobody's going to
come to save you,
and you can't escape.

97
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,160
So finally, we're going
to get our revenge for
the last time we fought!

98
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:30,964
{\an7}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>"A special barrier so</i>
<i>that our souls could</i>
<i>be materialized..?"</i>

99
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,633
What do you mean,
our souls?

100
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,568
{\an5}Hold on, are you
trying to tell us
that we're dead
or something!?

101
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,273
{\an1}Boy, that's weird.
I sure don't feel
like I'm dead now.

102
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:45,143
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>How did we end up</i>
<i>here, away from</i>
<i>the battlefield?</i>

103
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,044
[whimper]

104
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:52,183
{\an4}Neji, can you take a
look at our chakra flow,
and also at this barrier
that we're trapped within?

105
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:54,552
Please use your
Byakugan.

106
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:55,919
{\an1}Understood.

107
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,457
{\an1}Byakugan!

108
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,864
{\an1}How does everything
look, Neji?

109
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:12,799
{\an1}All of your chakra
flows appear to be
intact.

110
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,870
Which means that we
can probably still use
ninjutsu and taijutsu...

111
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:20,140
However...

112
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,843
I can't see anything
beyond the barrier.

113
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:27,779
It's like there's an
impenetrable wall in
front of it.

114
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,981
{\an1}Hm. Not to worry,
Neji.

115
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:35,819
{\an4}As long as we're not dead, we
can just pulverize the jutsu
user who created this barrier
and get out of here!

116
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,156
{\an1}We've gotta get back to
the battlefield as fast
as we can!

117
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,459
{\an1}Heh. Looks like they're
finally ready to fight...

118
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:45,962
{\an1}And we've been ready on
this side since the get-go.

119
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,731
Now, let's get this
started for real.

120
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,466
[attack cry]

121
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:02,976

Are you all right?

126
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,654
{\an1}Uh, yeah of course.

127
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,689
It's all going to
be fine, Shikamaru.

128
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:22,859
{\an1}If something's not sitting
right with you, just go
right on ahead and analyze it.

129
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:24,995
And while you do,
we'll handle the enemy.

130
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,130
{\an1}Choji, I--

131
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,899
If that's the case,
then let's do this!

Come on!

00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,969
All right, then!

00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:05,130
{\an1}I've gotta pull my own
weight, here. I can't
keep relying on them.

143
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,200
{\an7}<i>...Now!</i>

144
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,137
Almost. So close!

145
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,106
{\an7}<i>Damn. It's so</i>
<i>much harder</i>
<i>without Ino...</i>

146
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,141
{\an1}Hm?

147
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:22,411
Imagine, <i>you</i> on
the offense...

148
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,080
I thought you'd leave
fatso behind again...

149
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:29,083
{\an1}But I guess you found
your sense of duty,
even if it is for nothing!

150
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:32,752
{\an1}I admit, he's right
about the last time
we fought...

151
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:38,225
{\an4}But this time it's
different! We don't
intend to lose a man for
every enemy we kill.

152
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,759
Hm?

153
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,429
<i>(Shikamaru)</i>
<i>Choji! Watch out!</i>

154
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:43,630
[gasp]

155
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,674
{\an1}I made it just in
the nick of time!

156
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,942
Thanks for that,
Shikamaru! I owe
you one!

157
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:04,413
{\an1}Ugh, man! I can't
believe I missed!

158
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:08,417
{\an1}You all right, Choji?

159
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,452
I'm fine. I just got
a little impatient.

160
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:13,154
But thanks to Shikamaru,
everything's okay...

161
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:16,156
{\an1}Can you give me some idea
of the enemy resistance?

162
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,661
Sure thing. Our physical
attacks are causing
damage. But still...

163
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:29,335
{\an7}Of course. Their bodies
still won't die because
of the Reanimation Jutsu.

164
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:34,139
{\an1}Just give up! There's no
way you can beat immortals
like us, you pieces of crap!

165
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:37,409
{\an1}Enough, Tayuya!
Ladies should watch
what they say...

166
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:38,809
<i>Shut up, fatso!</i>

167
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,119
{\an1}All right,
everyone.
Listen up--

168
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,954
{\an1}Don't forget what
I said earlier...

169
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:58,494
{\an4}I don't want you to even
think about risking your
lives to break through
and finish the enemy.

170
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:02,196
What are you talking
about? You mean we can't
attack them directly?

171
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,930
No, that's not it.

172
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:08,468
{\an4}But first and foremost,
I want you to concentrate
on getting through this
alive.

173
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:10,970
Listen, I want to
make one thing
perfectly clear.

174
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,240
I don't see any way
of beating these
guys this time around.

175
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,108
What are you
saying?

176
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,311
{\an1}<i>There are 3 reasons:</i>

177
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:23,947
{\an1}First of all, even back when
we first faces them, these
guys had chonin level strength.

178
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,552
{\an4}And now they're even
stronger because their
bodies have been
Reanimated.

179
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:30,387
{\an1}The risk is too
great to face them
head-on.

180
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:35,692
{\an4}<i>Second: There really is</i>
<i>no guarantee that defeating</i>
<i>them will cause the barrier</i>
<i>to dissolve.</i>

181
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,993
<i>(Choji)</i>
<i>But, isn't that how</i>
<i>it usually works?</i>

182
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,664
{\an1}Like I said
earlier, these guys
are already dead.

183
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:44,633
{\an1}It doesn't matter to
them if a jutsu has
some risks to it.

184
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
{\an1}He's probably right.

185
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,804
{\an1}So, just what are
we supposed to do
then!?

186
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,706
{\an1}And there's more.
There's still the
third reason...

187
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,508
{\an1}Ugh! Stop pathetically
whispering to yourselves!

188
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,377
{\an1}All right, that's
enough! Let's get
back to business.

189
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,882
{\an1}Sound Ninja Four:
Summoning Jutsu!

190
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,585
{\an1}Four Corner Beast Formation!

191
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,975
{\an1}They have us
surrounded...

192
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,578
{\an1}What now, Shikamaru?

193
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,878
What do we do?

194
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,415
{\an1}Well first, let me
as you something-

195
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:50,021
{\an4}The last time, we were
prepared to lose a man
for every enemy that
we killed...

196
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,291
{\an1}<i>As a result you were</i>
<i>all severely injured.</i>

197
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,161
{\an1}...Are you still certain
that you want me to lead you?

198
00:14:57,194 --> 00:15:02,098
{\an5}What? What do you mean?
That was the best thing
to do at the time to
get Sasuke back.

199
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,067
{\an1}Yes, Kiba's right.

200
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,203
{\an1}Every last one of us
decided on one life
for one enemy.

201
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:10,740
{\an1}And if we got hurt,
it was only because
we weren't strong enough.

202
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:14,909
{\an5}I agree. You really
shouldn't let some
-thing like that
bother you, Shikamaru.

203
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:18,580
And besides, none of
us are the same people
we were last time.

204
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:22,049
{\an1}For one, we have more
intel on the enemy than
we did previously.

205
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,620
{\an1}Also, your analyses and
decision making have
always been spot-on.

206
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:29,356
{\an1}Honestly, you already know
who's the best team captain
in this situation...

207
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,591
{\an1}You just have to let
yourself believe it!

208
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,726
{\an1}<i>...Am I wrong?</i>

209
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:41,332
[sobbing]

210
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:47,171
{\an1}The next time around,
the mission will go
perfectly!

211
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:52,743
{\an1}I swore that time that
I would never whine again,
but just look at me now...

212
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:57,780
{\an4}All of you, be ready to
move on my command.
We're putting our old
team back together again.

213
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,949
We have one main goal

214
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:05,019
...to return from the
battlefield alive!

215
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,855
All right!

216
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:11,892
{\an7}<i>And Naruto... That</i>
<i>includes you, too...</i>

217
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,204
{\an1}Hey, guys! Where are all of
you headed out to right now?

218
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:28,105
{\an1}To provide logistical
support to the Second
Company!

219
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,808
Oh really, is
that so?

220
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,782
Okay. You guys are
good to go.

221
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,517
There are no more
fakes here.

222
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,117
{\an1}You've been a
big help, thanks!

223
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:45,888
Sure. Hey, is there
anyone in this company
who can transmit to HQ?

224
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,890
{\an1}No, sorry.

225
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,124
{\an1}But, I think that
there's someone in
the southern camp.

226
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,160
Great, got
it! Thanks!

227
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:53,561
Hey!

228
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,029
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Shikamaru... Choji...</i>
<i>Neji... Kiba..</i>

229
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,568
{\an7}<i>Hold on just a little bit</i>
<i>longer, you guys! I'm sure</i>
<i>that HQ will come up with</i>
<i>a strategy!</i>

230
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,242
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

231
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:14,212
{\an7}<i>No... not yet.... I</i>
<i>can't give up yet..</i>

232
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:18,549
{\an8}<i>I won't... doing</i>
<i>such a thing is</i>
<i>completely unthinkable!</i>

233
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,819
{\an1}Shino! We just got
word from HQ!

234
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,822
{\an1}What? That's really
all we have to do?

235
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:28,525
Basically, it's the
same thing as
releasing a genjutsu.

236
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,060
If someone is able to
touch the stolen soul
with chakra...

237
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,062
...then the soul can
come back from behind
the barrier.

238
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,799
{\an1}But how's something like
that even possible?

239
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,034
<i>We're doing it</i>
<i>right now...</i>

240
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:45,472
{\an4}This transmission is
chakra. It flows through
our subconscious and thereby
allows us to communicate.

241
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,807
{\an1}Well, then hurry up
and rescue them!

242
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,242
There's nothing I'd
like better, but...

243
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:56,782
{\an5}Even the system we have
at HQ cannot pinpoint
the exact location where
they're being held.

244
00:17:56,815 --> 00:18:02,987
{\an4}We assume the enemy's using
a special barrier, and the
souls of Shikamaru and the
others are trapped inside.

245
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,591
{\an5}Unless I know where
the barrier is,
there's no way I can
communicate with them.

246
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:09,860
[gasp]

247
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:15,698
{\an4}There's just no way to
find a soul that's
separated from it's
physical body...

248
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,166
{\an8}<i>Shino...</i>

249
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:30,010
{\an5}You're just a fatso
who relies on food
pills! There's nowhere
for you to run, now!

250
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,013
Shikamaru, leave
that one to me.

251
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,883
{\an1}Super Expansion Jutsu!

252
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:40,252
{\an7}Well, so now you can
grow without taking
your little pills,
can you?

254

{\an1}Choji! Just think back
to the time when that
guy caught you!

255
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,764
{\an4}You mean, you're
tellin' me that this
puppet of mud has the
ability to absorb chakra?

256
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,833
{\an1}I'll take care of
this other guy,
don't worry!

257
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,201
Huh?

258
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:01,905
{\an1}Hey! I'm the only
one who can handle
that spider!

259
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,105
Hm.

260
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,840
<i>(Kiba)</i>
<i>Shikamaru!</i>

261

How exactly do I
stop these guys?

262
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,046
{\an1}Those things that are coming
out of the giants' mouths
are called Material Ghosts!

263
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,348
{\an1}They'll steal your
chakra with one touch!

264
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:17,217
{\an4}And it's the jutsu
user's flute that's
controlling all of
them!

265
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,822
Oh, I get it!
With sound!

266
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:26,492
Human Boulder!

267
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:29,929
You bastard!

268
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:33,965
Damn it!

269
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:39,136
{\an5}You used your friends
as a distraction so
you could extend your
shadow!

270
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,639
{\an1}Shadow Possession
Jutsu complete.

271
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,210
{\an1}All right, let's see.
Just how should we
take care of you guys?

272
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:50,713
{\an7}<i>Now's my chance...</i>

273
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,918
{\an1}Neji! Do it!

274
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:58,954
Damn it!!!

275
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,893
{\an1}Yes! We did it!

276
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,495
{\an1}Barely. That was way
too close for my comfort.

277
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:17,903
{\an4}Hah! You sure
are trying hard!
Too bad it's all
wasted effort!

278
00:20:17,936 --> 00:20:21,040
We'll do whatever
it takes to get back
to the battlefield!

279
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,874
None of it
is a waste!

280
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:25,877
{\an1}Heh, yeah right.
We're invincible!

281
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,079
{\an1}No matter what
you do, we'll
still thrash you!

282
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:31,682
{\an1}It's beyond pathetic
watching you weaklings
try to stop us!

283
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:35,818
{\an1}But suck it up and keep
fighting, all right? Make
our revenge worthwhile!

284
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,621
{\an1}But remember, it's all
just a waste of time!

285
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,490
{\an1}You know what, Sakon?
We should reward them
for trying so hard...

286
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,925
{\an3}Yes...

287
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:50,597
{\an1}After all, I think you
deserve to know a little
secret about this barrier.

288
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:58,037
{\an4}Even if you could defeat
us-- and that's a huge
"if"... This barrier would
still never open for you!

289
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,237
What do you mean!?

290
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,174
{\an1}No way...

291
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:07,145
{\an4}The only way this game ends
is either you die here, or
your physical bodies give
out there...

292
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,915
{\an1}But either way, it's
not a question of "if"
you'll die....

293
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:15,318
{\an1}<i>It's simply a question</i>
<i>of when you'll die...</i>

294
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,223
{\an7}<i>Damn, I've got a </i>
<i>really bad feeling</i>
<i>about this...</i>

295
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,809
<i>(Sakon)</i>
<i>Tools of war? Is that</i>
<i>what you called us?</i>

296
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:03,912
<i>(Ukon)</i>
<i>We've been seeking vengeance</i>
<i>since the day we were born!</i>

297
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:08,049
{\an5}<i>(Tayuya)</i>
<i>Don't you even dare to think</i>
<i>of lumping us in with all those</i>
<i>other damn reanimations!</i>

298
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:13,753
{\an5}<i>(Jirobo)</i>
<i>The intense hatred that we</i>
<i>harbor towards you allows us to</i>
<i>unleash our full potential!</i>

299
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:16,190
<i>(Sakon)</i>
<i>No one can</i>
<i>stop us!</i>

300
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:21,027
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Vengeful"</i>

301
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,428
<i>(Ukon)</i>
<i>We'll tear you apart!</i>
