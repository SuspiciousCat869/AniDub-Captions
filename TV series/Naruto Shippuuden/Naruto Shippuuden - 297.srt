1
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,297
{\an1}You're no longer
a Jinchuriki,
Gaara?

2
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,598
{\an1}What do
you mean?

3
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:09,435
{\an4}Some time ago,
those who control
you, removed Shukaku
the One Tail from me.

4
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,371
{\an1}And in doing
so, killed me.

5
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,471
[raspy gasp]

00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,514

00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,191
[low moans]

00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:44,165
{\an7}<i>Is that me?</i>
<i>What am I anyway?</i>

9
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:56,507
{\an4}But thanks to the
assistance of Granny Chiyo and
my friends, I was revived
and am still alive today.

10
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,609
{\an1}You mean
Granny Chiyo
did that for you?

11
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,779
Wait, hold
on. You said
friends?

12
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,016
{\an4}Are you telling
me that you
actually have
friends?!

13
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:15,689
{\an5}Up until this point
in time, everything
I've done in my life
has been wrong.

14
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:21,794
{\an1}But at least,
here in my final
hour...

15
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:25,698
{\an4}...I can finally
do something
right for a
change.

16
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,234
{\an1}<i>The sand...</i>

17
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:31,036
{\an1}<i>...And the </i>
<i>leaf.</i>

18
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:40,444
{\an4}<i>May the future that</i>
<i>awaits them, be different</i>
<i>from the way things</i>
<i>were in our time.</i>

19
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:48,717
{\an1}Gaara!
Gaara...

20
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,921
{\an1}Naruto...

21
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,024
{\an1}[shocked gasp]

22
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:59,226
{\an1}[quiet breath
of disbelief]

23
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:04,830
What is this...?

24
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,400
{\an1}They all
came running
to help ya.

25
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,134
You've had
everyone worried!

26
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,907
{\an1}You didn't think
he'd have any friends?

27
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,576
{\an4}Did you really
believe that your
son would just be
alone this whole time?

28
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,312
{\an5}He was a kid!
Everyone has
friends at
that age.

29
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,848
{\an4}Six, father.
You made six
attempts to
kill me.

30
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:30,352
{\an4}And each time,
my fear and
hatred of you
increased.

31
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:34,288
{\an4}But I no longer
harbor any
hatred for you
father.

32
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:38,124
{\an1}Now I'm even
able to understand
why you did it.

33
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,860
{\an1}I've become
the Kazekage.

34
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:46,065
{\an4}It is a leader's
duty to eliminate
threats against
one's village.

35
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:48,099
{\an1}We must protect it.

36
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:50,468
{\an1}[gasp]
What did
you say?

37
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,070
You are...
Kazekage?!

38
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:54,504
{\an1}And that's
not all of it!

39
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,842
{\an4}He's also been named
the commander in chief
of the Allied Shinobi
Forces' Main battle Regiment.

40
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,145
{\an1}Despite his young
age, he not only calls
himself Kage...

41
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,947
{\an1}...But has the
respect of the
other Kage as well.

42
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,648
{\an1}Now it all
makes sense...

43
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,986
{\an4}I thought it was
odd that I sensed chakra
types from various villages,
all mixed together.

44
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:16,823
{\an1}Just imagine,
shinobi united
in an allied force!

45
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,494
{\an5}Well, apparently
what you lack in
eyebrows you more than
make up for in charisma!

46
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,762
{\an5}Hm...Actually
come to think of
it I'm just
the same!

47
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,432
{\an1}Then explain that
sorry excuse
for a mustache.

48
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,999
{\an3}Hmph!

49
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:33,103
{\an4}If you're going
to kill us, then I
suggest you guys start
with the mummy, here!

50
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:35,671
{\an1}I'll be more
than happy
to cheer you on!

51
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,309
{\an1}So he's your
son, then, is
he?

52
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,710
{\an1}He's a fine
shinobi.

53
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,015
{\an1}He's so small...

54
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,420
{\an4}He's premature...
Are you really
sure he's going
to be alright?

55
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,855
{\an1}I'm not certain,
but he's adapting.

56
00:05:55,888 --> 00:06:00,291
{\an4}This is the third
child. So far
he's the only one
that's compatible.

57
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,827
{\an4}His upbringing
is going to
require a good
deal of care.

58
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:08,865
{\an4}[heavy breathing]
Please let...let
me see my...
baby's face...

59
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,467
Are you
alright, Karura?!

60
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:16,938
{\an1}[heavy inhale]
He's so...
just so tiny!

61
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,542
{\an1}It's lady Karura's
heart rate. It's
dropping sir!

62
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,776
{\an1}[worried reaction]
Then do something
about it now!

63
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,013
[fearful gasp]

64
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,839
{\an1}That child's
a failure, too...

65
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,908
{\an1}The rampage's
have begun like
before.

66
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,210
{\an1}[frustrated grunt]

67
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,345
{\an1}We are at a point...

68
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:10,516
{\an4}...Where if we can't maintain
our defenses anymore the
Sand will be weakened beyond
all hope of repair.

69
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,852
{\an5}What we must do
is figure out
how to negotiate
with the other lands.

70
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,687
{\an4}But
something must be done
about Shukaku
as well!

71
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,390
{\an1}The new
Jinchuriki remains
unreliable.

72
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:24,127
{\an4}So for the moment,
we have to depend on
Lord Kazekage's development
of new jutsu...

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,930
{\an1}...And in our
gold dust trade for
village stability.

74
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,198
{\an1}And now as
for Gaara...

75
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,401
Yashamaru,
I need to speak
to you later.

76
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,468
{\an1}Yes, sir.

77
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:38,139
{\an1}But Lord
Kazekage,
Lord Gaara...

78
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,341
{\an1}...Is still just
a child!

79
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,777
{\an4}In my time
as Kazekage, I've
had to judge the
value of many things.

80
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:47,713
{\an4}And I'm going
to have to
test his worth
as well.

81
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,148
{\an1}[defeated sigh]

82
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,350
{\an1}We shall
assess Gaara
tomorrow.

83
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:56,287
{\an1}After the village
has been evacuated,
go and corner him.

84
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:00,723
{\an4}Tell him about
his mother, and
provoke him
emotionally.

85
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:05,628
{\an4}If he doesn't
go Berserk after that,
then I will spare
his life.

86
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:09,632
{\an1}Tell him...
about my sister,
are you sure?

87
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:16,537
{\an4}I am well aware
that he loves and
respects his mother
Karura with all of his heart!

88
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:22,108
{\an4}If that's taken
from him, and he
can still suppress
his rage...

89
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:25,244
{\an1}Only then will
he suffice as
a Jinchuriki!

90
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:42,958
{\an1}Huh?!

Why come
after me?!

do it?

By your own father.

My father...
Want me dead?

110
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:15,335
{\an4}Before you were born,
the Sand Spirit Shikaku,
was planted inside
of you.

111
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:19,705
{\an4}All these years
you've been watched
and studied as part
of an experiment.

112
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:22,741
{\an1}It became clear
that you could
never control it...

113
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:27,645
{\an4}...This Shukaku that
possesses the
power of the
sand itself.

114
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:32,482
{\an4}The day is coming
when your existence
will be too dangerous
for the village.

115
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,250
{\an1}It had to
be done
before then.

116
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:40,621
{\an4}You-You had to
obey my father.
You didn't have
any choice.

117
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,591
{\an1}You're wrong.
I actually
had a choice.

118
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:48,462
{\an4}Yes, Lord
Kazekage made
his wishes known to
me. But...

119
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,531
{\an4}Still I could have
have refused to
do this if I
had chosen to.

120
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,468
{\an1}I suppose
it's because...

121
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,369
{\an1}...Deep in
my heart...

122
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,204
{\an1}...I hate you,
Gaara.

{\an1}[quivering]

124
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:05,376
{\an1}My sister died
bringing you
into this world.

125
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,778
{\an1}I can't

for that.

127
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,582

that was left
of her.

128
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:17,552
{\an4}And so I kept telling
myself that since I
loved her, I should
love you as well.

129
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,220
{\an1}I tried...

130
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,555
{\an1}...But I
never could.

131
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,826
{\an4}It wasn't her

you, to be made
a human sacrifice.

132
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,896
{\an1}And so she died,
cursing this
village.

{\an1}The day
she died...

134
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:40,705
{\an4}...I felt a wound
in my heart that
I knew would
never heal.

135
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,943
{\an4}The name you
have, is the one
that your mother
gave to you.

136
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:49,678
{\an1}Your name
is Gaara...

137
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:52,414
{\an1}...A demon that
loves only itself.

138
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,884
{\an1}As you must
love no one
else.

00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,052
{\an1}Care for no
one's existence
but your own.

140
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,121
{\an1}In that way,
you will be
sure to survive.

141
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,691
{\an4}This is the
dying gift,
your mother
left you.

142
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,225
{\an1}However...

143
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:13,264
{\an4}It was not done out
of maternal affection, it
was not because of love that
she gave you your name.

144
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,701
{\an8}She wanted you to
survive-not as a
kindness, but as
a punishment.

145
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,503
{\an1}It was part
of her curse.

146
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:26,742
{\an7}It was from her
undying rage at this
village. That you should
survive and grow.

147
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:30,311
{\an1}Her hate,
lives on in
you.

148
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:33,080
{\an1}You were
never loved,
Gaara.

149
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,615
{\an1}Never.

150
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,456
{\an1}[angry roar]

151
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,024
{\an1}It's another
failure.

152
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:48,960
{\an1}Gaara is
useless to
us now.

153
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:52,430
{\an1}[angry roar]

154
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:11,111
{\an4}It's seems this
Reanimation Jutsu...May
actually have something of
merit to it after all.

155
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:14,949
Come! show me!

156
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,618
{\an5}Let me determine
once again what
you may be worth,
Gaara.

157
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,353
Can you defeat
me or can't you?!

158
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,790
Yes, Ohnoki...You
must stop me.

159
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:27,926
{\an4}Against Particle
Style, the number of
opponents doesn't
matter.

160
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,361
{\an1}You're the
only one
who can stop me.

161
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,963
{\an1}I'm aware
of that.

162
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:32,897
{\an1}And also...

163
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:37,601
{\an4}...You must remember
what I taught you about
what happens to allies
after a victory.

164
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:42,705
{\an4}Once the war is over,
the alliance is too. It
becomes a fight for the
spoils of victory.

165
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,140
{\an4}That is what
truly decides
which village is
the victor.

166
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,309
{\an4}Hey! Knock it off,
Tsuchikage! You're
just playing dirty
now!

167
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:50,711
{\an1}I won't let
that happen!

168
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:55,414
{\an4}I have no intention
of doing any such
thing, Lord Mu.
Not at all!

169
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,349
{\an1}[in unison]
Hm?

170
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:57,650
{\an1}I see!

171
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,553
{\an4}So it seems that you
didn't actually
turn into a stubborn
old geezer.

172
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,154
{\an1}Pft. I wouldn't
be so sure
yet.

173
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,658
{\an4}In any case,
we aren't in
control of our
own bodies right now.

174
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:12,262
{\an4}We've been set to
automatically counter
whatever jutsu the enemy
tries to use against us.

175
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:15,163
{\an1}So hurry! Kill
us and return us
to the netherworld!

176
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:17,901
{\an1}We'll even tell
you all our powers
and weaknesses.

177
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:23,137
{\an4}But still, it's going to
be up to you to stop us.
And it isn't going to
be an easy task.

178
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:40,151
Move in!
Everyone!

179

is father!

{\an1}[emotional gasp]

189
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:39,099
{\an5}What parents
need to do, is
to believe in
their children.

190
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,401
That one simple
thing...

191
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,670
...Is the real

{\an1}Isn't that the
whole truth of
it, Karura?

194
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,977
{\an1}Now I see
it clearly.

195
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:55,280
{\an4}I didn't posses
the ability to
judge the true
value of things.

196
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,548
{\an1}What do you
mean by that?

197
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:01,952
{\an4}No matter what,
the Sand will
always protect
you.

198
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,554
{\an1}But that is not
Shukaku's power...

{\an1}...It belongs
to your mother!

you really just

loved me?!

206
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:42,718
{\an4}But that day
long ago...when
Yashamaru came
after me!

207
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:47,322
{\an1}<i>You were never</i>
<i>loved, Gaara.</i>
<i>Never...</i>

208
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,192
{\an4}I told Yashamaru
to lie to you then,
he was merely
following orders.

209
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:57,330
{\an4}I had to see if you'd
lose control of the
tailed beast inside you
if you were distraught.

210
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:59,632
{\an1}For the sake
of the village.

211
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,368
{\an8}If there was
anyone Yashamaru
truly hated...

212
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,938
...It would've
been me, and
not you.

that every single
thing I did was
a mistake.

221
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,429
{\an1}I burdened you
unnecessarily.

222
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:41,232
{\an4}I arbitrarily
decided that you held
no true value to our
village-or to anyone.

223
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:47,204
{\an4}I took away your future by
making you a Jinchuriki,
robbed you of your mother, and
poisoned you against her.

224
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,808
{\an1}I took away
everything.

{\an1}Your ability
to know or
love others.

226
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,045
{\an1}I even tried
to take
your life.

227
00:17:55,645 --> 00:18:00,850
{\an4}In the end, as
a parent...there's
just one thing
that I gave you.

228
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:04,486
{\an4}The only thing
you got from
me was a

on the heals

the pain eventually
fades away.

235
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:33,375
{\an4}And with a
little help from
medicine, it can
heal even faster.

dangerous is a
wound dealt
to the heart.

{\an4}'Cause there's
nothing that
has more trouble

to the heart?

heart are a little
different from
wounds to the flesh.

the body, there is no

00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:54,025
[shocked gasp]

275
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:59,296
{\an7}Thanks to her...
I have now received
medicine from
you father.

276
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:00,697
{\an1}Gaara...

277
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:02,966
{\an1}My son!

278
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,405
{\an1}You surpassed
me long ago.

279
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:16,010
{\an1}<i>I leave the</i>
<i>village to you,</i>
<i>Gaara!</i>

280
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,827
Itachi Uchiha?!
Nagato?!

281
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,696
You know these
guys, Naruto?

282
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,563
{\an1}Yeah! I know
both of them!

283
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:07,534
{\an4}Never did I think
I would have to
battle you again,
Naruto.

284
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:11,037
{\an1}You now command
the power of
the Nine Tails?

285
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,239
{\an1}I'm impressed
with your
development.

286
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:19,011
{\an4}Next time on
Naruto Shippuden:
Contact! Naruto vs.
Itachi!

287
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:23,314
{\an1}Naruto, there's
something I must
ask you.
