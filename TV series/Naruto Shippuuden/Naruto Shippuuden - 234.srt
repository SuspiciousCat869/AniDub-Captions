to leap into action
when the order is
given, Lady Tsunade.

00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,134
{\an3}Good.

5
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:46,777
You guys, we can't
just stand around
doing nothing!

6
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,611
{\an3}-Huh?
-Huh?

-Woahhh!
-Woahhh!

[coughing]

16
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:09,874
Hey, stop
Konohamaru!

17
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:13,713
{\an1}Yeah, you're really
overdoing it.

18
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:19,787
{\an4}Look guys, the
entire Village is
gearing up for
war as we speak!

19
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:24,194
{\an4}And everyone has to
be ready to answer the
call to arms when it
comes, including us!

20
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:28,264
{\an7}We're still Genin,
so I doubt they're
gonna send <i>us</i> into
battle right away.

21
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:33,138
{\an7}And besides, aren't
there still things kids
like us are supposed
to be doing Konohamaru?

22
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:37,978
{\an4}How can you guys be
so relaxed!? We're
not just kids! We've
grown up a lot!

23
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:42,350
{\an4}The time's come to
make our mark and
become heroes of the
Village like Naruto!

24
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,220
[groans]

25

{\an1}[determined grunt]

26
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:37,235
{\an5}Anyway, now it's
<i>our</i> turn to achieve
great things for
the Hidden Leaf.

27
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,840
{\an1}But, Konohamaru,
how are we gonna
do that?!

28
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:43,810
{\an1}That's right.
It's way easier
said than done.

29
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:47,982
{\an1}Uhhh...
Lemme think...

30
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:50,386
{\an1}Hmm... Huh?!

31
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,130
{\an1}Oh! That's it!
We'll just use
the Leaf News!

32
00:03:58,163 --> 00:03:58,797
{\an3}Huh?

33
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,300
{\an1}What do you mean?

34

{\an7}<i>(Konohamaru)</i>
<i>We're from the</i>

{\an4}During the last
major incident,
we just helped
everyone evacuate.

37
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,287
{\an5}But do you think
there's anything
else we can do
to help out?

38
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,893
{\an1}There is! Hold
out your hands...

[groaning]

40
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,636
Okay! Take those to

[groaning]

42

{\an1}Thanks a lot!
That was a
big help!

43
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,598
{\an1}Yeah, but
Sakura!

44
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,534
{\an1}...hold on!

45
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:43,701
Hm?

46
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,772
{\an1}You didn't tell us
what we can do to
help during the war!

47
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,809
{\an1}We really wanna
do our part!

48
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,013
{\an4}Yeah! We wanna
do something big
to help out the
Village!

49
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,114
Mhm!

50
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:58,188
{\an5}Hm, [gasp]
but you're already
doing something big to
help the village out!

51
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,989
{\an1}-huh?
-huh?
-huh?

52
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:04,563
{\an5}All these boxes! They
contain medicine for
the ninja who will be
fighting out there!

53
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,631
{\an1}No! That's not
what we mean!

54
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,536
{\an1}We wanna do
something
really important!

55
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,972
{\an1}Like the kinda
stuff Big Brother
Naruto does!

56
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,444
{\an5}What are you
saying!? War
isn't a game
you know!

57
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,479
{\an1}[gasps]

58
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:18,914
A lot of people
out there could
get hurt or die!

59
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:20,784
So don't speak
lightly of it!

60
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:28,194
{\an7}Man! I can't believe
she was looking down
on us just because
we're still only genin!

61
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,664
But what Big Sister
Sakura said really
is true!

62
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:32,833
{\an1}Mhm.

63
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,370
Listen, maybe we
should just stick
to--

64
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:38,541
{\an1}No way! We are
not gonna give
up that easily!

65
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,411
{\an7}<i>(Shikamaru)</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

How do we get on
the front lines and
fight the Akatsuki!?

68
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:55,796
{\an5}I brought down Pain!
And that means I'm a
full-fledged Leaf
Ninja now!

69

{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru)</i>

{\an4}Alright, I have a
question for you,
full-fledged Leaf
Ninja...

71
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,876
Uh, okay.

72
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:11,250
{\an7}What's the identity
of the King that
you must protect?
Answer that.

73
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,955
The King...?

74
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,737
{\an1}Heh...

75
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,074
{\an4}If you don't
know the answer
to what I'm
asking...

76
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:33,514
{\an4}...then I'm afraid
I can't acknowledge
you as a "full-fledged
Hidden Leaf Ninja."

77
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:37,552
{\an1}Heh, look at me
talkin' all big.

78
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:41,757
{\an1}I only got the
answer recently
myself.

79
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,028
{\an1}Anyway, there's
no need to push
yourself so hard.

80
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:48,667
{\an1}We'll talk again
some other time.

{\an1}Here!

82
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,859
What's that?

83
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,464
{\an1}Why'd he write the
symbol for "ball?"

84
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:13,600
{\an1}It's "king!"

Fine. If that's
the way it is.

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,016
{\an1}Who are we
gonna interview?

No one...

for you, trust me.
