Aah!

Aah!

27
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:52,136
I-- I can't breathe.

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,970

00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,136
I'm just really flexible.

33
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,870
And now to fight back.

[laughing nervously] Oh, right.

38
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,070
That's all that jutsu does.

39
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:24,203
-He's just toying with us now.

40
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:26,636
-So this formation's
no good, either, huh?

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,736
I can't believe he's been able
to dodge all of our attacks.

42
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,103
-Kakashi--

43
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:33,203
-Yeah, I know.

44
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,170
-Nngh.

45
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,870
KIBA: Hey, Naruto.

46
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:39,670
Our formation attack-- the
timing was dead-on, wasn't it?

47
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,770
-Yeah.

48
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:43,203
-He should have taken
a direct hit, then.

49
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:47,536
So how the hell was he
able to evade every strike?

50
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,970
-I think we did hit him.

51
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,303
-What?

52
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,470
-This is just like when I
attacked him with the Rasengan

53
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:54,370
at the very beginning.

54
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,303
I know I got him then, too.

55
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,370
SHINO: So in other
words, he just

56
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:07,903
made it look like he evaded
it, when in actuality, he

57
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:11,270
allowed you and your jutsu to
pass right through his body.

58
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:13,670
Is that what you mean, Naruto?

59
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:17,070
-Uh, yeah?

60
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,336
-Damn it, Shino.

61
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,470
No one can even understand
what you're trying to say.

62
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,270
-You know, It could be a clone.

63
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,270
Or maybe some kind
of genjutsu that

64
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:26,736
makes you see
illusions or visions.

65
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,836
-I thought so, too.

66
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,136
So I increased my field
of vision with Byakugan.

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,903
I surveyed the area for other
chakra, but all that I detected

68
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,303
was his.

69
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,603
And it's coming from
the person we see.

70
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,770
-There we go!

71
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,136
-(TO HIMSELF): Pass through.

72
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,536
No wonder.

73
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,470
Well, Kakashi.

74
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:47,370
What do you think about this?

75
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:48,770
-No doubt about it.

76
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,036
It's some special jutsu
that's unique to him,

77
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,936
which makes it a real
bother, but-- Shino--

78
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,336
-I know.

79
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,736
[insects buzzing]

[theme music]

81
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:50,796
-In these situations,
hidden jutsus

82
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,663
like Shino's are very useful.

83
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:53,463
-Ew!

84
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:56,396
You're one of the Aburame Clan!

85
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,096
Yech!

86
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,230
All wriggly and gross.

87
00:05:58,263 --> 00:05:58,896
-Ha.

88
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,963
Shino.

89
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:02,463
Looks like you're
raring to go for once.

90
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,230
-Of course I am.

91
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,730
It's because I was left
behind the last time you all

92
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:09,196
went on a Sasuke rescue mission.

93
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,630
Go!

94
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,596
-Yech!

95
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,463
Gross!

96
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,363
Wah!

97
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:15,330
-Hey, Shino!

98
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:16,163
What the heck?

99
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:17,930
He's dodging every one of them!

100
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:20,863
-Rather than utilizing pinpoint,
narrowly-focused attacks,

101
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:24,163
the Aburame Clan specializes
in wide-range, sweep-type

102
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,496
assaults.

103
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,396
KIBA: Naruto, you haven't
teamed up too often with Shino

104
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,196
on missions, but just relax.

105
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,530
Sit back and watch
the bugs go to work.

106
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,463
Just make sure you
stay out of their way.

107
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,996
-What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,463
-Scatter.

109
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:44,963
-Now he's trapped.

110
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:47,630
It's impossible to evade
all of those insects.

111
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:49,130
-Whoa.

112
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:53,263
-Is he dodging, or letting
our attacks pass through?

113
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,463
I'll figure out his
jutsu right now.

114
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,263
Do it.

115
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:58,063
Hidden Jutsu, Beetle Sphere!

116

[buzzing insects]

117
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:00,796
-Now wait just a second, guys!

118
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,196
-All right!

119
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,296
Nice one, Shino!

120
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,796
-I'll settle this.

121
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,830
I'm part of this mission now.

122
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:09,330
I must do everything I
can to make myself useful

123
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,330
this time around.

124
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,963
-Come on.

125
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,296
Still holding onto
that grudge, huh?

126
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,763
[buzzing insects]

127
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,063
-Aah!

128
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:19,063
-(TO HERSELF): The insects
are closing in as we watch.

129
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,996
It's impressive how he can
manipulate so many so easily.

130
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,896
-Well, Hinata?

131
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,296
-Yes, right.

132
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,096
I'm detecting and confirming
the target's chakra.

133
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,996
That is definitely him.

134
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,930
He's inside that
swarm of insects.

135
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:35,696
-Yamato.

136
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,230
-Got it.

137
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,896
-Ready to go whenever you are.

138
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,563
-Shino, what do you think?

139
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,163
-He's definitely in there.

140
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,830
I can feel him resisting.

141
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,363
The parasitic insects
are feeding on his chakra

142
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,563
as we speak.

143
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,630
-Nice!

144
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,796
Just let them suck him dry then.

145
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,996
-What-- What just happened?

146
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,996
The insects that were
feeding off his chakra

147
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,096
suddenly lost track of
him, but that's impossible.

148
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,530
-Teleportation Jutsu?

149
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:11,730
-No way.

150
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,596
It's not too teleportation.

151
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,063
If it were only something
as simple as that.

152
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,496
My insects would have sensed
the reappearance of his chakra

153
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,530
and gone to his new position.

154
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:22,763
They wouldn't lose him entirely.

155
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:25,496
-Then he used some kind of
transportation technique?

156
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,896
No.

157
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,763
That's not possible, either.

158
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:34,630
-But he-- suddenly
just vanished.

159
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,763
-He traveled through space
without weaving signs,

160
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,430
employing summoning,
or using marks?

161
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,430
That's ninjutsu
that far surpasses

162
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:43,430
even the fourth hokage.

163
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:46,430
-So he erased his whole body?

164
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,796
He can wipe out his
entire presence?

165
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,096
-No way.

166
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,263
However, if we accept that
he can erase his whole body

167
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,730
at will, then it
follows that he can also

168
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,930
erase just a part of it, too.

169
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:01,896
And if that's the case, then he

that are targeted and would be
struck by any external attacks,

171
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:08,296
thereby making it appear
that the attack went right

172
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,130
through him.

173
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:10,596
-So he didn't evade the attacks.

174
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,563
They were actually
slipping right through him

175
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:15,696
the whole time.

Over there!

00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,496
-Oh, hello there!

180
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,296
-Nice try, but don't think
you can escape my nose!

-Didn't you listen?

184
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,130
That isn't gonna work, Kiba.

185
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:41,930
-Ugh.

186
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,596
passed right through again, huh?

187
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,530
Damn it.

188
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,563
-Uh, Kiba?

189
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,230
I think this time
he just dodged you.

00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:01,996
-It's over.

193
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:08,530
-He was on the Akatsuki
roster Kabuto left us.

194
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:10,830
-I'm tired of all
this interference!

195
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,230
-Sasuke triumphed in the battle.

Itachi Uchiha is now dead.

-Sasuke triumphed in the battle.

00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,546
Itachi Uchiha is now dead.

00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,213
-What?

200
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,846
I don't believe it!

201
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,113
Kidding.

202
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,979
-It's just as I expected.

203
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,379
-What?

204
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,646
Sasuke killed him?

205
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,113
He killed Itachi?

206
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:45,579
-Sasuke is down right now, too.

207
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,179
So what's next?

208
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,013
I think he's in
pretty bad shape.

209
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:54,146
-Hey!

210
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:54,913
You up there!

Tell us where
Sasuke is right now!

-What do you mean by aloe?

214
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,946
-Ignore him.

215
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:13,579
-We're just going to have to
finish this some other time.

216
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:14,879
-That's a Sharingan.

217
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,546
Who in the is he?

218

-Later.

About ten kilometers
ahead, a strong chakra

spread across a wide swathe.

225
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:15,779
Also, for some reason,
the forest's on fire.

226
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,413
And it's burning
with black flames.

227
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,179
-(TO HIMSELF): Amaterasu.

time, for sure.

00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,779
We're going full speed ahead.

-I'm not you.

235
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,813
I simply can't shift
as fast as you do.

-Since you were
watching, you better

00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,946
have recorded the battle.

00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:00,746
-Relax.

239
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,246
I captured the whole thing.

240
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,979
Every moment.

241
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:04,779
-Good.

242
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,013
I'll review it closely later.

243
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:09,479
We're taking
Itachi's corpse too.

244
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:10,579
We should go now.

245
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:15,613
-Huh?

246
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,113
I've detected their scents.

247
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,913
And they've already
reached Sasuke's location.

248
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:20,846
-Ah, damn it!

249
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,313
-(TO HIMSELF): Nngh.

250
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:24,513
So that's the Amaterasu.

251
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:26,513
I've never seen it before.

252

-No way.

253
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,079
What is all that?

254
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:29,113
-I know what that is.

255
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:31,679
It's one of Itachi's jutsus.

256
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,779
-Careful.

257
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,413
That fire won't go out
until it completely

258
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,913
incinerates everything
in its path.

-Go on.

266
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:58,846
You can proceed now.

267
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,613
-All right.

Quit wasting time.

-We're not just wasting time.

275
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,779
-So it's all over then, is it?

276
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,679
-Yes, it's finally settled.

-How's Sasuke?

00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:33,146
Sasuke won the battle.

[sighing]

281
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,713
-So where's Sasuke now?

282
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:41,579
-He has already been
evacuated to a safe place.

283
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,213
-What kind of safe place?

284
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:46,679
-He's been taken to the
Akatsuki hide-out in the east.

285
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,946
All of you should
head there, too.

286
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:52,879
The Hidden Leaf will arrive
here very shortly, I'm sure.

287
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:53,946
-Let's go.

288
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,279
We need to get to Sasuke.

289
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,079
-And what will you
do now, Kisame?

290
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:02,679
-If Itachi isn't around anymore,
I think I'll spread my wings

291
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:04,646
and see where fate takes me.

292
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,779
-I see.

293
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:07,346
Well, do as you please.

-Aw man.

297
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,913
What do you guys
think happened here?

298
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,479
I mean, what kind
of battle could

299
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:30,313
cause this amount
of destruction?

300
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,179
-(TO HIMSELF): Two
wielders of the Sharingan.

301
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:37,579
Are all battles between members
of Uchiha Clan this intense?

302
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:38,479
-Where's Sasuke?

303
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,079
-I detect no other chakra here.

304
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:48,746
Aside from us, there's
no one else in the area.

305
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,513
-There's still a faint
trace of scent left.

306
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,813
But still--

307
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,413
-We're too late.

308
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:57,346
-Nngh.

309
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:57,846
-Oh, Naruto.

310
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:01,813
-Why?

311
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,313
Why can I never reach him?

312
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,613
Why can I never get
catch up to Sasuke?

313
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,979
-I treated your wounds.

314
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,913
-Nngh.

315
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:51,313
[breathing heavily]

316
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,013
-You won.

317
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:03,446
But you sustained
quite a bit of damage

318
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,713
and you're not
completely recovered yet.

319
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,113
Try not to move
unless it's necessary.

[footsteps]

321
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,646
-We've met once before.

00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,946
-Wait, I know those robes.

323
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:28,913
You're with--

324
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,646
-Although we were enemies then.

325
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,713
Don't worry.

326
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,246
I don't hold Deidara's
death against you.

327
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,179
I am not your enemy.

328
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,746
I merely brought you here in
order to tell you something.

329
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:58,946
And you're not
interested at all, I see.

330
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:02,479
Maybe if I put another
way, you'll want to listen.

331
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,346
It's about Itachi Uchiha.

332
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:09,813
That's right.

333
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:12,379
You think you know all
about your older brother,

334
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:13,379
but you know nothing.

335
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,313
All right.

336
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:22,479
Let me just start with a
simple introduction then.

337
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:30,213
Like you, Sasuke, I am a
survivor of the Uchiha Clan,

338
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:33,679
and one who knows the
truth about Itachi Uchiha.

339
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,579
[heart thumps]

340
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:40,446
-Aah!

341
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,113
No!

342
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,146
It can't be!

343
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,013
-Aah!

344
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,479
Nngh!

345
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:50,446
Aah!

346
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:50,946
-Nngh.

347
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:53,379
[gasping]

348
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:53,879
-Aah!

349
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:08,413
-[breathing heavily] Aah.

350
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:22,646
-[breathing heavily] Aah.

351
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,646
What as that, just now?

352
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:42,579
[footsteps]

353
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:46,546
-The Amaterasu, which Itachi
seems to have implanted in you.

354
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:01,679
Leave it to Itachi to set a
trap even after he's dead.

355
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:05,179
I can't believe how
well he plans ahead.

356
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:06,179
-What's that?

357
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:08,279
What are you talking about?

358
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:12,279
-To put it simply, he
placed a jutsu inside you

359
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:13,746
in order to kill me.

360
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,813
Or perhaps I should
say, he did that

361
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,679
in order to keep
me away from you.

362
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,613
He probably set up
this little trap

363
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,713
so that the Amaterasu
would automatically

364
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,413
activate when you
saw my Sharingan.

365
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,179
Thankfully, Itachi didn't
know everything about me

366
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:38,779
or else I would undoubtedly
be dead right now.

367
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:41,813
So this was Itachi's
final trick, huh?

368
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:44,379
Too bad it didn't work on me.

369
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:45,679
-What is this?

370
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,279
Just what are you talking about?

371
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,079
-Itachi must have done
something to you before he died.

372
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:01,679
At the very end,
for your sake, he

373
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:05,579
managed to transfer his
own visual prowess to you.

374
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,913
-What exactly are
you telling me?

375
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:11,213
I mean what-- what
are you trying to say?

376
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:13,879
Why would Itachi
do such a thing?

377
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,313
-Don't you get it?

378
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:19,613
[gasps]

379
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,946
-He did it to protect you.

380
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:32,551
[theme music]

381
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:04,351
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): he
wanted to protect me?

382
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:05,751
Are you kidding?

383
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,718
MADARA (VOICEOVER): You think
you know all about your older

384
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,751
brother, but you don't nothing.

385
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:12,518
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): If you keep
spouting nonsense and lies,

386
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,285
then I'll kill you right here.

387
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:15,785
MADARA (VOICEOVER):
What I'm telling

388
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:17,418
you is simply the truth.

389
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,585
Itachi did mention
it, didn't he?

390
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:22,618
About his accomplice
that fateful night?

391
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,918
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Next time
on Naruto Shippuden, "Fate."

392
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:29,618
-I am Madara Uchiha.
