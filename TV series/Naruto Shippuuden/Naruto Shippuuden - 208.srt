00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:11,731
{\an1}<i>[Samurai]</i>
<i>What happened</i>
<i>downstairs?!</i>

2
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:13,833
<i>[Suigetsu]</i>
<i>We're the only</i>
<i>two survivors.</i>

3
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,171
{\an5}Two of Sasuke's men
are probably still
here somewhere.
You haven't seen them?

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,908
{\an1}Nope. But, uh, maybe
they're dead, too?

5
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:24,611
{\an1}It's such a mess
down there, you
wouldn't believe it.

6
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:29,616
{\an5}No. A sensory type
ninja from the Hidden
Cloud confirmed that
they're still alive.

7
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:32,352
And he told us to
go capture and
arrest them.

8
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:35,020
Oh... really?

9
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:36,822
You two...

10
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:40,993
{\an1}Take off your armor.

11
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:46,198
Oh, well... Looks
like they caught on.

12
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:53,072
{\an1}Guess it wasn't such a
good idea after all.

13
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,179
{\an7}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I don't get it, Sakura.</i>
<i>Why would you do</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

14
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:06,852
Huh?

15
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:09,188
Sai...!

16
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,223
What's wrong;
what are you
doing here?

17
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:13,158
It's a clone.

18
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:18,430
{\an1}I'm here to relay to you the
truth that Sakura wanted to say,
but wasn't able to tell you.

19
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,267
Uh? What she
wanted to say?

20
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:23,335
Hmm.

21
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,037
Just what do
you mean, Sai?
Tell us.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,010
{\an1}Sakura didn't come
to confess her love.

23
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:37,949
{\an1}She came to tell you
something that she and her
Leaf classmates decided.

24
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,422
{\an5}Yeah, she was acting
really weird. So she
was hiding something
after all?

25
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,269
{\an1}I've come to understand
her feelings.

26
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,339
{\an1}And why she couldn't tell you.

27
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:06,143
{\an1}All right. Tell us, Sai.
What did they decide?

28
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,750
{\an1}They'll dispose of
Sasuke themselves.

29
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:18,488
{\an1}Your comrades are all committed.
And are ready to move.

30
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,930
As One's Friend

31
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,868
{\an1}They'll dispose of
Sasuke themselves.

32
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:18,238
{\an1}<i>Your comrades are all committed.</i>
<i>And are ready to move.</i>

33
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,409
Even Sakura, too?

34
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:25,546
Tell me, did she
actually agree to
something like that?

35
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,315
Sakura's completely
in love with Sasuke!

36
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:29,918
There's no way!

37
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,319
{\an1}She couldn't have.

38
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,928
{\an1}After the Akatsuki's
assault on our village.

39
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,299
{\an4}Shinobi of the Leaf
can't support Sasuke,
not when he's an
Akatsuki, too.

40
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,904
{\an1}Sakura isn't a fool.

41
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:54,842
{\an1}Or a child who doesn't
understand the circumstances.
And the situation.

42
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:59,011
{\an1}<i>That's why she came all</i>
<i>the way here, to try to</i>
<i>tell you that in person.</i>

43
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:03,316
[sigh]

44
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,520
Why didn't she?!

45
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,523
{\an1}Why didn't she just
come right out and
tell me the truth?!

46
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:16,329
{\an4}It's not that easy,
Naruto. You know that.
She knew that the
truth would hurt you.

47
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,731
{\an1}Yeah, but still...

48
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,337
{\an1}Saying she's given up on
Sasuke and declaring
that she loves you now,

49
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,772
{\an1}frees you from the
burden of your promise.

50
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:27,840
[gasp]

51
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:34,312
{\an1}Naruto... This is a...
once in a lifetime request.

52
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:39,484
{\an1}Just bring him home.
Please, bring Sasuke
back to me.

53
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:44,022
{\an1}But then you said you still
wanted to save Sasuke.

54
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,960
{\an1}<i>I think that's why she</i>
<i>couldn't tell you the truth.</i>

55
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,829
{\an1}<i>She was being considerate</i>
<i>of your feelings.</i>

56
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,332
{\an1}<i>And she probably already knew</i>
<i>what you were going to say. </i>

57
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:02,139
{\an1}Actually, Sakura had
asked us not to tell you
anything at all, Naruto.

58
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,343
{\an1}She wanted to tell you herself.

59
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:08,713
{\an1}She said that it was her duty.

60
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,754
{\an1}Yes, but, if she predicted
Naruto's reaction,

61
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,123
{\an1}Doesn't it mean that she never
intended to tell him the truth?

62
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,692
<i>What's Sakura</i>
<i>planning?</i>

63
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,496
{\an1}I'm not sure.
This is just
conjecture.

64
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,033
{\an1}But I think Sakura...

65
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,970
{\an1}She's planning to
kill Sasuke herself.

66
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,140
{\an1}Is that true?! Really?!

67
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,276
{\an1}It's likely.

68
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,983
{\an5}[Sai]
Please don't take
all of this on
yourself, Sakura.

69
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:48,886
I'm in Team 7
with you.

70
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:51,822
Also the others.

71
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,692
{\an1}Oh, I know.

72
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,160
And thank you, Sai.

73
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,296
{\an1}But don't worry;
I don't intend to.

74
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:05,568
{\an1}Then Sakura smiled and said
she'd work together with us.

75
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,572
{\an1}But even I could tell that
it was a false smile.

76
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,544
{\an1}It's a lie. Sakura would
never do something like that.

77
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:17,547
{\an1}She truly loves Sasuke
with all her heart.

78
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:22,885
{\an1}It's because she loves him,
that she can't let him continue
to progress toward evil.

79
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:30,827
{\an1}<i>It's because she loves him</i>
<i>that she wants to save him</i>
<i>from this path of darkness.</i>

80
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:35,263
{\an1}<i>Even if that means killing</i>
<i>him with her own hands.</i>

81
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,103
{\an1}<i>That is how committed she is,</i>

82
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,872
{\an1}<i>in her love for Sasuke.</i>

83
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,375
{\an1}Also, by choosing this,

84
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,912
{\an1}She's prepared for
you to hate her.

85
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:50,980
[gasp]

86
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:53,082
{\an1}I think that...

87
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:58,286
{\an1}It's how she's atoning for
the lifelong burden she
feels she's forced upon you.

88
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:06,495
{\an4}<i>Sakura feels she has relied</i>
<i>on you too much in the past.</i>
<i>This time, she wants to do</i>
<i>everything herself.</i>

89
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:15,971
{\an1}But Sai. Why, then? Why are
you telling me all of this?

90
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:23,111
{\an7}<i>It's obvious that Sasuke</i>
<i>is making Naruto suffer.</i>

91
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,080
{\an7}<i>But I think you may be, too.</i>

92
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,282
{\an1}Even though it
wasn't my intent.

93
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:32,453
{\an1}I pushed Sakura
toward this action.
It's partly my fault.

94
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,989
{\an1}So I had to tell you.

95
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:40,194
{\an1}I can't just leave Sakura be.
I'm a member of Team 7.

96
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:42,830
I see.

97
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,804
{\an8}<i>Naruto's mind must</i>
<i>be in turmoil after</i>
<i>learning all this.</i>

98
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:53,507
{\an7}<i>The question now is,</i>
<i>what's he going to do?</i>

99
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:05,318
{\an3}Ngh!

100
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,098
{\an1}We have very important
news and everyone needs
to listen carefully.

101
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:20,767
{\an1}We're going to tell
you what happened at
the Five Kage Summit.

102
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,377
It's been a long
time, Danzo.

103
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:36,216
{\an1}We haven't seen other
since the Uchiha incident.

104
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,666
{\an1}[gasp]
[gasp]

105
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,205
{\an1}Foo, Torune. cover me.

106
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:03,876
{\an1}You keep him occupied.
I'm breaking the seal
on my right arm.

107
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,580
Are you really going
to fight me, Danzo?

108
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:13,585
{\an1}Madara. His full
abilities are unknown;
be on your guard.

109
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:14,520
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

110
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:18,556
{\an1}Torune, we'll both attack
together for support.

111
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:19,457
Yes, I agree.

112
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:27,966
{\an8}<i>Mind Transfer.</i>

113
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:31,970
Huhh?

114
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,074
He vanished into
the pillar.

115
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,744
Guess it's true.
He really can pass
through solid objects.

116
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:44,415
{\an1}I guess so. But even
if you can't see him,
can you sense his chakra?

117
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:47,285
{\an1}I can't. It's completely gone.

118
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:06,170
{\an1}A Sensory Type with
Mind Transfer abilities.

119
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:09,040
{\an1}You're from the
Yamanaka Clan, right?

120
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,781
{\an5}He can dematerialize
his body so that his
opponent's attacks pass
right through him.

121
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:21,017
He becomes completely
intangible when he
needs to.

122
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:25,755
{\an1}But if he wants to strike a
blow or touch something,
then he has to manifest.

123
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:28,491
{\an1}All right, then.
aim for his counterattacks.

124
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:32,796
That was a very
thoughtful analysis.

125
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,933
The counterattack has
to be timed perfectly.

126
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:41,437
{\an5}We'll attack one
after the other,
and then get him In
the second stage.

127
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,974
The first stage
will be a decoy.

128
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:49,045
{\an5}Let me be the decoy.
He's already seen
through my Mind
Transfer Jutsu.

129
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:51,814
Your jutsu should
be the main act.

130
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,016
{\an1}Right. Got it.

131
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,055
That technique.

132
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:07,129
{\an1}Torune. Use your jutsu.

133
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:31,153
Now!

134
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,994
Hn... Uuggh...

135
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,232
{\an1}Of course. He just pretended
to attack to trick us!

136
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,335
{\an1}<i>Damn it! We fell for it!</i>

137
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:57,312
{\an1}Awww. A jutsu where
chakra is poured in to
destroy an enemy's cells.

138
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,479
{\an1}How bothersome.

139
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,684
Sorry, Foo...
I'll clear it now.

140
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,359
{\an1}That's not chakra.

{\an1}Heh, I've heard of them.

144
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:36,249
{\an4}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>You. You're a shinobi</i>
<i>from the Aburame Clan who</i>
<i>knows Hidden Ninjutsu.</i>

145
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:41,620
{\an1}You must be Shikuro Aburame's
brat. You've got antibodies
against those insects.

146
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,391
{\an1}To think you're with
the Foundation.

147
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,794
Danzo, you 've got
yourdself an impressive
array of subordinates.

148
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,933
Torune, forgive me.

149
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,935
{\an1}It's fine.
But don't relax.

150
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,704
{\an1}Quick, see if you can
sense his location.

151
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,141
{\an1}I'm ending this right now.

152
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:09,882
No!

153
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,885
{\an8}<i>He pulled in Torune!</i>

154
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,859
{\an1}My right arm's been
infected with beetle venom.

155
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,563
[gasp]

156
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,402
{\an1}You're next!

157
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:51,790
I see.

158
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,593
{\an1}I can't believe the
Summit got so chaotic.

159
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,096
{\an1}But I guess with Danzo...

160
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,069
{\an1}I'm not really too eager
to become Hokage...

161
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,839
{\an1}And even with circumstances
being what they are,

162
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:13,011
{\an4}I'll still need to go
back to the Hidden Leaf
Village and discuss this
with the others first.

163
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:17,282
{\an1}Madara announced that
he was going to declare
war on all of us.

164
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,783
{\an1}We don't have all the
time in the world, here.

165
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:23,887
I don't think it'll
take long to get
everybody's approval.

166
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:28,393
{\an1}So let's have them proceed
as if you'll be confirmed
as Hokage, Kakashi.

167
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,895
It'd be worse if
the Akatsuki or
Madara strike first

168
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,631
and we're put on the
defensive because
we're slow to respond.

169
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,504
{\an1}Well, I guess you're
right. Thanks.

170
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,449
{\an1}And then
there's Sasuke.

171
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:54,884
{\an1}[sigh]

172
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,422
{\an1}I can't believe
he'd go as far as to
attack the Summit.

173
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:04,060
{\an1}Naruto. I will have you know
that this is also a battle,

174
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,897
{\an1}to protect the Eight- and
Nine-Tails, namely you.

175
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,067
{\an1}So for the sake of
the shinobi world,

176
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:15,905
{\an1}As Kazekage, I will make sure
to protect you at all costs.

177
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,343
<i>And if, as an</i>
<i>Akatsuki subordinate,</i>

178
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:26,182
{\an5}<i>Sasuke were to stand</i>
<i>against our Allied</i>
<i>Shinobi Forces,</i>
<i>I will not show mercy.</i>

179
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:34,457
{\an1}<i>[Gaara] [flashback]</i>
<i>Sasuke, you and I</i>
<i>are quite alike.</i>

180
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,759
{\an1}<i>We've both walked through</i>
<i>the darkness of this world.</i>

181
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:42,465
{\an1}So your eyes should pick up even
the faintest glimmer of light.

182
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,435
In the past or even
at this moment.

183
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:50,839
{\an1}I shut my eyes a long time ago.

184
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:54,376
{\an1}The things I seek now lie
only in the darkness.

185
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:59,080
{\an1}I'm afraid that Sasuke
doesn't see you anymore.

186
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:02,050
{\an1}The only thing he
sees now is darkness.

187
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:02,784
[gasp]

188
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:09,457
{\an1}Naruto, you once told
me that you would
become Hokage one day.

189
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,662
{\an1}Well, I've become Kazekage.

190
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,543
And if you've
truly resolved to
become a Kage,

191
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,214
{\an1}Then you're going to have
to do what needs to be
done as Sasuke's friend.

192
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:01,741
{\an1}We've said everything
we came here to say.
So let's go, Gaara.

193
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:06,447
{\an1}We're going to head back
home to our village now.

194
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:09,082
Kakashi Hatake.

195
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,852
{\an1}The Sand will proceed as if you
will be confirmed as the Hokage.

196
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:17,156
<i>As an ally, we ask that</i>
<i>there be no confusion</i>
<i>in communications.</i>

197
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:19,792
Understood.

198
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,637
{\an1}I consider you a friend.

199
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,344
{\an1}In the past, "friend"
was just a word to me.

200
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,513
{\an1}Nothing more, nothing less.

201
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:44,016
{\an1}But after meeting you,
I realized something.

202
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,388
What's important is the
meaning of that word.

203
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:51,823
{\an1}What does it mean to you?

204
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:59,064
{\an1}You must decide for yourself
what you can do for Sasuke.
Think hard on that.

205
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,168
Let's go.

206
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,040
[sigh]

207
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:11,909
Naruto.

208
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,480
{\an1}He needs to figure this
one out on his own.

209
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,469
[Karin]
Here I am, all alone in
the dark with Sasuke,

210
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:41,807
taking care of him
while resisting every
urge in my body.

211
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,975
{\an1}Just hurry up and
get well already!

212
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:48,879
Huh?!

213
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,149
Uaaa!

214
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,152
{\an1}You scared me half to death!
Are you all right, Sasuke?

215
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,090
{\an8}<i>Cold as ever.</i>
<i>He'll never change.</i>

216
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,729
{\an8}<i>But... still...</i>

217
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,102
{\an1}Let me out of here.

218
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:17,207
All right, don't fret.
That's just what I'm
about to do.

219
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,110
I even have a present
waiting for you outside.

220
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,694
So you're here,
Sasuke Uchiha.

221
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,130
You stay back.

222
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,866
You'll die if you
get involved.

223
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,507
{\an1}Now this is just perfect.

224
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:13,896
{\an1}Listen, Sasuke, and Madara.

225
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,300
{\an1}I am going to take both
your Sharingan and add
them to my collection.

226
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,964
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>There's one thing</i>
<i>I want to ask you.</i>

227
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,804
{\an4}<i>Is it true Itachi slaughtered</i>
<i>the Uchiha Clan because he was</i>
<i>following orders you and the</i>
<i>other Leaf elders gave him?</i>

228
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:07,908
{\an1}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>It seems you alone</i>
<i>really were special.</i>

229
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:12,311
{\an1}<i>Damn him! Itachi told</i>
<i>you everything before</i>
<i>he died, didn't he!</i>

230
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:17,950
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Danzo's Right Arm.</i>

231
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:21,520
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Don't speak any</i>
<i>further about Itachi!</i>
