You should be able
to figure it out.

say I can't, OK?

do is think about it,

going to wait and let

-No sense standing around
here, time's a wasting.

155
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,895
It's up to us to
make the first move.

156
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,030
-Well OK.

157
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:44,797
Let's do it.

00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,059
Getting a little
overconfident, aren't you?

165
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,365
-Now, Naruto!

166
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:56,168
-Listen to this Kakashi-Sensei!

167
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,939
I know the final plot twist
of "Make-Out Tactics!"

168
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:00,940
-What?

169
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,674
No.

170
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,875
No!

171
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,645
-Turns out the hero actually
is none other than--

172
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,846
-No, shut up.

173
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,347
I don't want to hear.

174
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:08,848
Ah!

175
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,656
Oh no, because of the Sharingan
I can still read his lips.

176
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,035
Wha--?

177
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,302
-Ha!

178
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,270
-Hm!

179
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,038
-(disappointed) Oh.

180
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,143
-A ninja must see
through deception.

181
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,546
-Isn't that right, Sensei?

182
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,148
-I deserved that.

183
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,151
[laughter]

184
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,599
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
It's like he's

185
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,702
encased himself inside a cocoon.

186
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:12,111
It's amazing he survived the
blast, if he survived it.

187
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:12,611
Hm.

188
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,154
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Sand Prison!

189
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,431
[MUSIC - NAGAREBOSHI, "SHOOTING
STAR"] [non-english speech]

190
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,687
NARRATOR: Beating
Kakashi by threatening

191
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,023
to give away the way the
book's ending, ingenious!

192
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,524
NARUTO (VOICE
OVER): I thought so.

193
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,026
SAKURA (VOICE OVER): But isn't
the Make Out series intended

194
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,327
for mature readers only?

195
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,329
NARRATOR: That's right, what
were you doing reading it?

196
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,297
You're not mature.

197
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,298
NARUTO (VOICE OVER): Oh!

198
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,566
I-I barely even glanced at it.

199
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,667
It was really boring.

200
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,302
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): He
only read ten pages.

201
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,469
NARRATOR: Aha!

202
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,304
Guilty.

203
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,371
All right, Naruto.

204
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:20,840
Just for that you'll
spend the next three

205
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,908
days cleaning the
Academy bathroom.

206
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,109
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Say what?

207
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:28,914
Next time, the
Kazekage stands tall.

208
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:32,351
[music]

209
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,595
-Greetings class.

210
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:45,531
Today our topic will be Gaara.

211
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,600
Known as Gaara of the
Desert for his ability

212
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,969
to control
chakra-infused sand, he's

213
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,705
the youngest of three
sand village siblings.

214
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,507
Shortly after he was born,
the Sand Spirit Shukaku

215
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,709
was sealed within him.

216
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,377
His own father tried
to destroy him out

217
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,980
of fear of the spirit's
terrible power.

218
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:05,251
After that, Gaara trusted no
one and fought only for himself.

219
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,753
Naruto, who had been an
orphaned outcast himself,

220
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,822
could have followed
a similar path.

221
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,558
But instead, he showed
Gaara that true power

222
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,226
comes from loving
your friends enough

223
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,096
to fight for them, not yourself.

224
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,398
The Sand and Leaf
Villages are now allies,

225
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,433
helping each other
in times of crisis.

226
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,536
And Gaara has been named
Kazekage, Leader of the Sand

227
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,838
Village.

228
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,306
OK, pop quiz.

229
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,975
What do the characters
emblazoned on Gaara's forehead

230
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,177
signify?

231
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,412
Answer?

232
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,613
Love.

233
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,115
Now then, if you
don't mind, there's

234
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,984
a book I'm just dying to finish.
