00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,850
[panting]

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,485
[playful fighting]

3
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:25,959
Huh?

4
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,694
(Kiba)
Granny? I'm
coming in!

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,200
Here! A care
package from
your daughter
and her husband.

6
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,370
Oh my! Thank you
ever so much!

7
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,408
Here's a letter
for you!

8
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,509
[happy barking]

9
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,014
Hey! It's Kiba!

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:53,086
Yeah, he's been a big
help. He volunteered
to be the messenger
for the entire Village!

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,156
Look at those
two! Always
together...

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,125
[small laugh] You
were like that once!

13
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,193
Huh?

14
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,963
Remember? How you
were completely
stuck to Sasuke?

15
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,333
That's just cause we
were both on Squad 7!
You were the same way!

16
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,703
I don't mean that!
Did you really forget?

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,672
I mean when you
were stuck for real!

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,242
Oh! That's right!

19
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,713
(Naruto)
Now I remember!

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,218
We were on a mission
to retrieve a treasure
that belonged to a
Feudal Lord's sister!

21
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,187
A treasure that had
been taken by thieves!

22
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,469
We've received intel
on the thieves who
took the golden statue.

23
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:29,376
They're either on land on
this forest path, or they're
sailing by boat and will land
somewhere in this area.

24
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:35,048
So, we'll split into
two teams and wait for
them in both locations.

25
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:41,822
Now, to keep the teams
balanced, I'll be on
one, and you three
will be on the other.

26
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,323
Hold on, what
does that mean?

27
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,660
Are you saying that
Sasuke needs all the
help he can get?

28
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,161
No! He means
YOU!

29
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:53,433
I know I'm not up to
your level yet, but I
doubt you need three
on one team!

30
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,702
So why don't you
take Naruto off
my hands?

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,272
You subtract his
skill from yours,
and we'll be even.

32
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:06,346
[gasp] Sasuke! is this
just a clever ruse so
that you and I can be
alone together!?

33
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,150
Ugh! Come on!
You've gotta
be kidding!

34
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,186
Why would my
skill subtract
from his!?

35
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,688
Simple, because you
have nothing to add.

36
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,089
WHAT!?

37
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,660
Oh! Sasuke wants to
be with me so much
he can't even wait!

38
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,395
You're as annoying
as he is...

39
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,399
[screaming]

40
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,634
[gasp]

41
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,336
Pay attention now.

42
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,904
Uhhh??

43
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,409
I'll watch the pier,
and you three will
keep and eye on this
path in the forest.

44
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,745
If the thieves
appear, notify
me right away.

45
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,884
Do not underestimate
them. Our mission is
to retrieve a stolen
golden statue.

46
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,821
We must proceed with
the utmost caution.

47
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:52,526
If the thieves appear
at my location, I will
send a signal with this.

48
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,930
When this lightning
barrel is tossed
into the air, it will
release a thunderbolt.

49
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,968
Once you verify that
it went off, rush
straight to the location
that it marks.

50
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,571
You better be
careful with that.
I don't wanna get
zapped again!

51
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,375
Remember, you
three are not
to act on your
own...

52
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,444
[groan]

53
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,452
[gasp]

54
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,387
It's the thieves!

55
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,197
[struggling
grunts]

56
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:34,468
[grunts]

57
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:40,541
You idiot! Be careful
with that treasure,
you hear me!?

58
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,709
Yes! Sorry,
Boss Jako!

59
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,911
(Jako)
Get it together!

60
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,312
Yes sir!

61
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,848
(Thinking)
The treasure's in
that wicker box?

62
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,553
This is it!
This is my
big chance!

63
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,657
You're amazing,
Naruto! You're
so much cooler
than Sasuke!

64
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,326
You really showed
him up!

65
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,030
Huh!?

66
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,299
(Thinking)
Don't tell me he's
planning the same thing!

67
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,433
[scoff]

68
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,535
(Thinking)
I'm not gonna
lose to him!

69
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,006
Huh!?

70
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,176
[gasps]

71
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,844
Whaaa?

72
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,645
What is this!?

73
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,348
[struggling grunts]

74
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,752
[shouts]

75
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,255
[shouting]

76
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,224
Damnit! They
took the treasure!

77
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:34,761
(Thinking)
What do they think they're
doing!? We're supposed to
notify Kakashi Sensei first!

78
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,365
Huh? There's
another one?

79
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,372
[gasp]

80
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,544
Ahh!

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,983
[cringing]

82
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,486
[grunts]

83
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,523
You two! Give
me that treasure
back!

84
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,324
No way!
Forget it!

85
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,159
Then take THIS!

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,363
Ahhh!

87
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,336
[grunt]

88
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,275
I'm not gonna
lose it now!

89
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,381
[whimper]

90
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,586
[screaming]

91
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,325
Damn!

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,338
So the Hidden
Leaf's coming
after us, huh?

93
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,341
Were those two
the only ones
with you?

94
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,275
[stubborn grunt]

95
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,277
[gasp]

96
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,780
I know that
there must be
more of you...

97
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:04,451
Yeah, that's why
you tried to send
that signal to
reveal our location!

98
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,420
Pft!

99
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,730
[gasp]

100
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,899
It's pretty
cool, isn't it?

101
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,803
Clearly I'm a natural
born thief who's
rotten to the very
core of his being...

102
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:28,242
So rotten, in fact,
that as you can clearly
see, even my chakra
has become befouled.

103
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,413
Those two friends
of her's escaped
downstream...

104
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,350
We'll split up and
search the river
until we find them.

105
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,986
And then we'll
take back our
treasure...

106
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,554
What do we
do with her?

107
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,991
(Jako)
We'll bring her
with us and keep
her as a hostage,

108
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:50,397
[panting]

109
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,136
I can't believe
they stole something
as ridiculous as
this- this teddy bear.

110
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,708
The thunderbolt...
The signal to warn
Kakashi...

111
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,810
It didn't go
off, did it?

112
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,312
Oh... no.

113
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,282
Maybe Sakura
couldn't release it.

114
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,418
You think Sakura
was captured!?

115
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,488
Huh?

116
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,789
[grunt]

117
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,124
Huh!?

118
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:21,428
What... What?
...WHAT IS THIS!?

119
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,035
What!? What's
going on!?

120
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,470
We're stuck
together!

121
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,344
Ready!? Pull!!

122
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:46,453
[grunting]

123
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,389
[defeated groans]

124
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:58,732
[charging shouts]

125
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,535
[painful grunts]

126
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,641
[weary sigh]

127
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,708
[screaming]

128
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,110
[kissing]

129
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:52,019
[gasps]

130
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,221
Why do I
always end up
kissing you!?

131
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,124
You took the
words right out
of my mouth!

132
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,294
[embarrassed sigh]

133
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,472
Don't worry!
You'll see
your friends
soon enough!

134
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:20,214
After they return the
treasure, I'll make sure
that you're all back together
again, in the after life.

135
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:25,285
Your ninja, but even
ninja become helpless
if their hands are tied!

136
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,357
(Thinking)
Sasuke...
Naruto...

137
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,424
Sakura...

138
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:38,398
While we're stuck
like this, Sakura
could be...

139
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,633
Ahh!

140
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,336
Naruto! Stop,
you idiot!

141
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,206
Hang tight, Sakura!
I'm coming to save
you right now!

142
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,509
Listen! Just
wait you loser!

143
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,577
[grunting]

144
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,080
Ah! Ooof!

145
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,249
Just what the
hell are you
doing, Sasuke!?

146
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:58,051
I mean, don't you
even care what
happens to Sakura?

147
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:02,623
Look, we will
save her! But we
can't do anything
when we're like this!

148
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,460
Saving her no matter
what stands in the way
is what a true friend
would do!

149
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,463
I.. I just--!

150
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,766
(Naruto)
I don't want people
to say that I'm scum!

151
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,968
Who doesn't care
about his friends!

152
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:20,807
Those ninja who
abandon their friends
are even worse than
scum...

153
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,912
Yeah, fine! But
joining up with
Kakashi is still
the right move!

154
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,147
It'll increase
our chances of
survival!

155
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,250
Look don't talk
to me about our
chances!

156
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,353
That just depends
on how hard we
work to save her!

157
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:37,090
No way I'll
let her die
over this
stupid thing!

158
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,993
You idiot!
Naruto! Stop it!

159
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:48,035
Damnit! Damnit!
Damnit!!

160
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:54,341
But someone who
doesn't take his
mission seriously
is scum too.

161
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,111
[sob]

162
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,450
Gotta pee.

163
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,284
You what!?

164
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:08,055
I said...
I gotta go
take a leak!

165
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,159
Hey! What in
the hell!?

166
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,561
Oh, uh, okay.
One handed then.

167
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:19,233
What!? Cut it
out! Not so close!
You're gonna splash
it on me!

168
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,436
Listen, I'm sorry.
But if you gotta go
then you gotta go.

169
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,637
Just hold it!

170
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,339
I can't!

171
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:28,408
[arguing]

172
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,676
Huh!?

173
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,483
Ahhhh!

174
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,490
[grunts]

175
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,228
Don't get in
my way, Naruto!

176
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:52,165
Are you kidding!?
You're the one
who's in my way!

177
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,702
Stop! Give us back
the treasure!

178
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,205
[screams]

179
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,377
Multi Shadow Clone
Jutsu!

180
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,180
[gasp]

181
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,416
You can't weave a
sign like this, idiot!
You need two hands!

182
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,820
It's like I said
before... We don't
have a chance!

183
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,489
I know that now!

184
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,260
[grunt]

185
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,799
Naruto! Stop this!

186
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,668
No. No way!

187
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,071
If you're not in,
I'll cut my arm
off, then go!

188
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:36,076
I'm gonna beat
this guy! And
then go and
Save Sakura!

189
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,048
[grunt]

190
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,717
[frustrated gasps]

191
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,652
You're always
so reckless!

192
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,489
Ooof!

193
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:59,132
Heh heh! Alright!
Let's go!

194
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,570
If those guys came this
far, they'll probably
find us before we can
meet Kakashi Sensei.

195
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:10,377
If that's the case, it'll
be faster if we just make
this guy tell us where Sakura
is and save her first.

196
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,578
Sasuke...

197
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:16,049
However... to
succeed we have
to work together
perfectly.

198
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,152
Huh!? Got it!

199
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:24,391
Ooohhh... I
just remembered...
I gotta pee.

200
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,094
[gasp]

201
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,865
[sigh]

202
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,134
Me too...

203
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,005
[chuckle]

204
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,558
What do you mean
Sugaro still hasn't
reported back yet?

205
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,927
Ya know... I
wonder...

206
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,528
(Sasuke)
You're wondering
right!

207
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,529
(Naruto)
We got him!

208
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,667
(Thinking)
Sasuke...
Naruto...

209
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,971
There!

210
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,144
Tsk!

211
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:21,181
Ha! That's right!
We're back and
free at last!

212
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:25,085
Only a Feudal Lord's
sister would own a
statue like that one!

213
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,455
And that's exactly
what managed to
pull us apart.

214
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,724
(Thinking)
So their hands
are free now?

215
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:36,296
Here's our offer:
We'll let you have
this back, in exchange
for our teammate!

216
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,699
Refuse, and I'll
pulverize every
one of you!

217
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:42,503
Trust me, that
won't be a problem
now that my hands
are free!

218
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:58,352
We're both ninja.
Surely you don't
think mere robbers
can defeat us!

219
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,320
You can't!

220
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,800
[grunt]

221
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,669
[grunt]

222
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:24,578
Ha! Tell me, why
are you gritting your
teeth so hard?

223
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:29,483
(Jako)
You're sweating. You're
veins are practically
popping out of your skin!

224
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:36,690
Alright then! If
you're truly free
then come over here!

225
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,325
(Jako)
Come on!

226
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,900
Just as I thought.
Their hands are
still fused!

227
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:47,668
Get em!

228
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,471
He called our bluff!

229
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,240
Then we have
no choice...

230
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,146
Why you!

231
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,114
Huh?

232
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,716
Ahhh!

233
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:06,620
Naruto!

234
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,454
Right!

235
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,627
Argh!

236
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,608
[painful grunts]

237
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,447
Oh no...
not that!

238
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,317
(Sakura)
Guys! Look out!

239
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:42,923
[gasp]

240
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,994
That treasure is
all mine!

241
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,632
[attack roar]

242
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,240
Even like this
we can take that
guy! Let's go!

243
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,008
Right!

244
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,250
Ahhh!

245
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,492
[attack shout]

246
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,367
Don't even
think about it!

247
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,508
Fire Style!

248
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,144
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

249
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,746
No way! A
hand sign?

250
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,919
Heh! No. Even if we
could weave signs,
we couldn't infuse
chakra like this, idiot.

251
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,288
Don't treat me
like a fool!

252
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,657
But we do
have a combination
attack!

253
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,625
What!?

254
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,328
Pachinko Jutsu!

255
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,199
Ahhh!

256
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,374
[chuckle]

257
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,779
(Kakashi)
Well, maybe it can
be welded down and
re-cast...

258
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,315
Though, that's
a pretty big maybe.

259
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,150
(Sakura)
Oh, Sasuke!
Thank you!

260
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:21,255
Whaaat? He didn't
do it by himself,
you know Sakura...

261
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,292
This is getting
ridiculous! Can't
you do anything
Kakashi Sensei!?

262
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,161
Look, that thief
already told you
guys!

263
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:31,231
It'll just crumble
apart on it's own
in two or three days!

264
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:34,301
If I have to put
up with him that
long, I'll kill him!

265
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,603
I should be the
one who's saying
that!!!

266
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,071
[laughing]

267
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:42,209
Uh. Uh-oh.
I've gotta go.

268
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,310
Again!?

269
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:47,514
Yes, again. And
this time it's
number two!

270
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:50,484
You've gotta
be kidding me!

271
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,619
Don't you dare,
Naruto!!

272
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:56,590
C'mon! We already
peed together,
what's the big deal?

273
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,659
This is so
much worse!

274
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:07,167
Those who abandon
their friends are
worse than scum...

275
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:11,171
These three overcome
their differences so
easily...

276
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,708
[chuckle]

277
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,981
(Kakashi)
The main purpose of
this mission is to
rescue the hostage.

278
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:04,384
(Kakashi)
That mean's we'll have to
confront the bandits who are
stealing the Village's crops.

279
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:07,387
(Asuma)
Their hideout's located in
a natural fortification.

280
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:10,023
(Asuma)
And they have three
forts guarding the
only way in.

281
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:13,827
(Asuma)
But the trickiest challenge
will be outwitting their
clever leader, Baji.

282
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,797
(Shikamaru)
Then I guess that's
just what we'll have
to do.

283
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,869

<i>NExt time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"Team 10's Teamwork"</i>

284
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,538
(Shikamaru)
I'm counting on
you guys!
