1
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,952
{\an1}I had nothing at all.

2
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:50,760
{\an1}It's still not enough yet!

3
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:57,835
{\an1}This still... isn't...
who I am!

4
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:06,111
{\an1}And that is why I've
kept on adding to myself.

5
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:11,082
{\an1}So what I want right now
is not your lecture,

6
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:14,152
but instead your
abilities and intel.

7
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:17,055
{\an1}Not only are you a Leaf
Shinobi, you're of the

8
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,225
{\an1}famed Uchiha bloodline.

9
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:22,461
{\an1}You possess Sharingan that
have awakened the Mangekyo.

10
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:25,598
{\an1}You also bore many secrets
and stopped a war...

11
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,968
{\an1}And you had many jutsu
and a lot of power.

12
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:32,104
{\an1}Itachi, you possessed
many things that

13
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,608
{\an1}made you who you are.

14
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,946
{\an1}There is no finer foil to my
Reanimation Jutsu than you.

15
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,749
And my pawns are
part of my power.

16
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,018
{\an1}You exaggerate...

17
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:47,854
{\an1}The reality is, I failed.

18
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,524
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

19
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,725
No... earlier.

20
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,362
{\an1}Even though I may have
mocked the Uchiha name in

21
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,264
{\an1}front of you, I have
to admit that I'm

22
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:58,666
{\an1}actually still quite
envious of it.

23
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:02,003
{\an1}The Uchiha name merely
indicates a bloodline and

24
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:03,137
clan membership.

25
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,408
{\an1}It's meaningless for
you to claim it.

26
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,387
{\an1}<i>From the very beginning,</i>
<i>I was nobody...</i>

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,693
<i>I had nothing.</i>

28
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,998
{\an1}I bet he's from that city...

29
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,866
{\an1}Where that recent
battle was just fought.

30
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,802
{\an1}Where are your parents?

31
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,074
{\an1}Don't worry. Just relax. I
can help. I'm able to do a

32
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,776
{\an1}little Medical Ninjutsu.

33
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,217
{\an1}Wait, how about...
Kabuto, as in helmet?

34
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:47,485
So simple.

35
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:48,352
That was fast.

36
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,621
It's just what
he's wearing!

37
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:52,056
{\an1}It's best not to overthink
things sometimes.

38
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:56,295
{\an1}Until I was given a name and
a place to call home....

39
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,865
{\an1}You think that claiming
a name is meaningless?

40
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,400
It's not.

41
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,636
It does hold
meaning for me!

42
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,674
{\an1}Are you sure it would
be bad to kill him?

43
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,742
{\an1}As it is, we're stuck
playing catch-up!

44
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:12,578
{\an1}I already told you no! He
controls the battlefield

45
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,414
{\an1}right now. Be patient.

46
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,983
Is the Izanami
still not ready?!

47
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,418
{\an1}He's about to attack!

48
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,125
{\an1}Don't worry, Sasuke. I'm on
it. It's just going to take

49
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,661
{\an1}a little more time.

50
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:31,031
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru said
this to me once.

51
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,667
{\an1}Sakon! Demon Twin Jutsu!

52
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,305
{\an1}Jirobo! Earth Style:
Terra Shield!

53
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,785
{\an1}If you want to know who and
what you are, all you need

54
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,986
to do is gather
every last thing

55
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,591
{\an1}and piece of information
that exists in this world!

56
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,893
{\an1}Kidomaru! Spiral Web!

57
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,633
{\an1}These threads can't
be cut with a blade!

58
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,168
Amaterasu!

59
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,508
Kimimaro!

60
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,512
{\an1}Macabre Bone Pulse!
Bracken Dance!

61
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,116
He's laid down
the spider silk

62
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,550
all the way
to the back.

63
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:23,120
{\an1}I'll get the back,
Brother. Take the front!

64
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,188
Can you still
use the Susano'o?

65
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:25,922
Yes.

66
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,891
Inferno Style!
Flame Control!

67
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,804
{\an1}They ran to the back, huh?

68
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,508
{\an1}Too bad it's no use!

69
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,478
{\an1}Tayuya! Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia!

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,818
{\an1}Are you okay, Sasuke!

71
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,290
Genjutsu, huh?

72
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,528
{\an1}Even your precious
Susano'o can't block

73
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:03,396
{\an1}out sound, can it?

74
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:04,998
I knew it...

75
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:09,002
{\an1}Now that I've immobilized
you, all that's left is...

76
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:14,642
{\an1}To absorb you using
Lord Orochimaru!

77
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,488
[gasp]

78
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:09,263
{\an1}Well, Sasuke? How about it?
Do you remember this?

79
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,599
{\an1}You recognize this
current form of mine?

80
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:12,600
That's--

81
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,306
{\an1}Thanks to you,. I was
finally able to take Lord

82
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,542
Orochimaru into
my own body...

83
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,778
After you had
killed him!

84
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:26,915
That's right!

85
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:30,887
{\an1}I've achieved it at last!
This is my true form!

86
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,622
{\an1}Remember, I said that all
the laws and principles of

87
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,424
Nature, which
Lord Orochimaru

88
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:39,395
{\an1}researched and compiled for
so long, are now stored and

89
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,364
{\an1}being used inside of me.

90
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,232
{\an1}The only thing that
was missing...

91
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:46,003
...was Lord
Orochimaru himself!

92
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,972
But now, as you
see, I possess

93
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,807
{\an1}him inside of me, too!

94
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:53,510
{\an1}I really can't thank
you enough, Sasuke!

95
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:57,314
{\an1}Kabuto... You are
not Orochimaru.

96
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,684
{\an1}It's fine to imitate
someone you respect...

97
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,254
{\an1}But don't remake yourself
into him to that extent.

98
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,395
{\an1}You do realize a majority
of people start out by

99
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,998
{\an1}mimicking another person
they admire, don't you?

100
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:17,202
{\an1}Just like the way
Sasuke emulated you.

101
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:20,605
[gulp]

102
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,461
{\an1}Wow, Itachi! You nailed
every target, even the one

103
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,764
{\an1}in the blind spot
behind the rock!

104
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,999
All right, now
it's my turn!

105
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,903
No, Sasuke. It's
time to go.

106
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:49,670
[grunt]

107
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,840
{\an1}What happened to the new
shuriken jutsu you promised

108
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,241
{\an1}to teach me, huh?

109
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:55,543
It'll have to
wait 'til later...

110
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,412
{\an1}I have an important
mission in the morning.

111
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,946
And I need to
prepare for it.

112
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:01,983
You're such a
big fat liar.

113
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,025
Sorry, Sasuke.

114
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:11,727
{\an1}Maybe some other time.

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,028
Hmph!

116
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,964
{\an1}Okay, just watch this!

117
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,633
Hm?

118
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,268
{\an1}Hey, be careful!

119
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:20,502
[screaming]

120
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,418
{\an1}Keep excelling like
this and you'll be

121
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,387
just like your
brother in no time.

122
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:44,929
{\an7}<i>Father... I wanted you to say...</i>
<i>"that's my boy"... to me...</i>

123
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:53,804
{\an1}Such behavior is just a
process to help one mature!

124
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,074
{\an1}Don't use it as a cloak to
deceive yourself, like

125
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,142
you've done!

126
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:01,179
{\an1}If you've attached your
self-value to something

127
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,748
{\an1}external to you...

128
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,617
{\an1}Even something admirable
and praiseworthy.

129
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,220
{\an1}Then you gain nothing.

130
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,923
I'll say this
one last time.

131
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,293
{\an1}Don't mislead yourself with
lies. Those who cannot

132
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:18,598
{\an1}acknowledge themselves
will invariably fail.

133
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,335
Fail?!

134
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,005
{\an1}The way I am now?

135
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,341
{\an1}How could I fail?!

136
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,679
Sasuke... Look
into my eyes!

137
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:36,184
[gasp] That's
right! Of course!

138
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,484
{\an1}Genjutsu! Sharingan!

139
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:38,852
Tsukuyomi!

140
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:01,442
{\an1}I shall now engage the
Izanami. Which means that

141
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:04,513
{\an1}you have already failed.

142
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:10,953
Is it over?

143
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,075
{\an1}You, a genius that always
had everything, would never

144
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,743
{\an1}understand at all...

145
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,547
{\an1}The only thing I want is to
be who and what I am!

146
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,918
{\an1}I won't let anyone
interfere!

147
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:58,271
Sas... uke...

148
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,414
{\an1}Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

149
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,551
Water Style:
Giant Vortex Jutsu

150
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,194
[groaning]

151
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,376
[gasp]

152
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,495
{\an1}You're just repeating
the same old moves.

153
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,165
Makes it easier
for me to counter.

154
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,734
{\an1}I already told you, with
this body I have the power

155
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:01,570
{\an1}to recover from any wound
you try to inflict, so

156
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,340
attacking me is
pointless.

157
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:09,413
{\an1}Since I shut off my vision,
genjutsu won't work on me.

158
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,915
You two have no
chance of winning.

159
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:15,686
{\an1}Your fate is already
entirely in my hands.

160
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:19,257
{\an1}All thanks to the Uchiha's
other Forbidden Jutsu.

161
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,059
That is...

162
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,296
Well, then...

163
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,733
{\an1}Shall we put that boast of
yours to the test, Itachi?

164
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,038
The Izanami!

165
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,378
Sasuke... do not
leave my side.

166
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,149
{\an1}This feels like déjà vu.

167
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:47,853
{\an1}But you bore me...

168
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,656
{\an1}So let's put an end to
this fight, already.

169
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,028
{\an1}Your fate may be in
my hands now...

170
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,364
{\an1}But only you can truly
decide how that fate

171
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,631
{\an1}shapes your destiny.

172
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,437
{\an1}Remember all that
I've told you.

173
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:05,973
{\an1}You have to think hard.

174
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:09,609
{\an1}Sorry, but I have
absolutely no idea

175
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,312
what you're
talking about.

176
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,615
{\an1}Anyway, that's enough of
your word games.

177
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,550
{\an1}I will have everything
that I want!

178
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,387
{\an1}I'm the strongest of all!

179
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,089
{\an1}That is a simple fact!

180
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:25,327
{\an1}He who forgives himself and
acknowledges his true self...

181
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,163
[growl roar]

182
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,098
Is the most
powerful of all!

183
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:33,969
{\an1}Losers like you...

184
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,239
{\an1}...should be quiet!

185
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,015
This is...

186
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:51,988
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>What is he doing?</i>

187
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,404
{\an1}<i>How?! My horn had</i>
<i>already been cut off!</i>

188
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,075
{\an1}<i>How? I cut off my sight...</i>

189
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,811
{\an1}I should be invulnerable
to genjutsu.

190
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,746
{\an1}But this is clearly...

191
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:19,918
[screaming]

192
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,270
{\an1}What did you do to me?!

193
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,507
I have you in
my Visual Jutsu.

194
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:41,807
Huh?

195
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,344
Impossible!

196
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,147
{\an1}It's the Izanami!

197
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,618
How?

198
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,821
Well, it doesn't
matter anyway.

199
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,458
Because no one
can stop me now!

200
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,128
{\an1}I am all-powerful!

201
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:26,356
{\an1}As I told you... I hold your
fate in my hands right now!

202
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,857
Itachi Uchiha!

203
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,802
{\an1}If this is a genjutsu...

204
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:44,575
Release!

205
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:51,616
Huh?

206
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:54,318
[growling]

207
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,460
[growling]

208
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,107
{\an1}Just stay calm... This is an
Uchiha Genjutsu. And since

209
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,211
{\an1}Itachi cast it, it won't
be easy to release.

210
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,682
{\an1}But there are many ways
to undo a genjutsu!

211
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:23,416
It's useless.

212
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:25,851
{\an1}Remember all that
I've told you.

213
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:29,389
{\an1}Of course! I'll just copy
the same trick that you

214
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,624
two used before!

215
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,193
Tayuya!

216
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,465
Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia!

217
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:44,606
{\an1}This will switch Itachi's
control over this

218
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:47,141
{\an1}genjutsu to Tayuya.

219
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:51,745
Ahh-ahh...

220
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,450
[scream]

221
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:00,888
{\an1}Then I'll do this!

222
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,225
{\an1}Sage Art! Inorganic
Animation!

223
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,573
{\an1}There, this whole area
is under my control!

224
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,742
{\an1}Better retreat for now...

225
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,782
{\an1}[confident chuckle]

226
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,622
Damn it!

227
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,692
{\an1}Don't mess with me!

228
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:46,438
{\an1}He cannot escape this loop.

229
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:49,408
{\an1}He'll remain stuck
inside this samsara.

230
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:53,612
{\an1}So this is the other Uchiha
Forbidden Jutsu, the

231
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:55,080
{\an1}companion to Izanagi.

232
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,818
{\an1}A jutsu that decides fate...

233
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,121
{\an1}This is the Izanami.

234
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:58,906
{\an1}<i>So Kabuto's trapped inside</i>
<i>the loop that you created?</i>

235
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,108
{\an1}<i>No, the Izanami is a jutsu</i>
<i>meant for stopping the</i>

236
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:04,745
{\an1}<i>Izanagi. There's an</i>
<i>escape route that's</i>

237
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:06,180
{\an1}<i>built into the loop.</i>

238
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,782
{\an1}<i>What does that mean?</i>

239
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:10,518
{\an1}<i>What I am about to tell you</i>
<i>is the story of the Uchiha's</i>

240
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:14,255
{\an1}<i>Izanagi and how the</i>
<i>Izanami came to be.</i>

241
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:18,560
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"Izanagi and Izanami."</i>

242
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:22,764
{\an1}<i>The Uchiha Clan's history of</i>
<i>conflict. I understand.</i>
