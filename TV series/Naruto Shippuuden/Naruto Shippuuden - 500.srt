00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,260
{\an1}You need to come to Lord
Hokage's.

{\an1}It's Naruto! It seems he's

No!

Naruto!

23
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,692
{\an1}Because I'm Iruka.

00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:16,694
Uh!

25
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:21,134
{\an1}Naruto's one of a kind. Works
hard, puts his whole heart
into it.

26
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:24,873
{\an1}Sure, he messes up sometimes,
and everyone jumps on him.

27

him stronger.

{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) Huh?!</i>

32
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,972
{\an1}What's this all about, anyway,
Iruka Sensei?

33
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:37,478
{\an1}Do you remember that
congratulatory message that you
recorded me delivering before?

34
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:42,720
{\an1}Huh? Oh yeah. You mean that
boring message without style
or enthusiasm?

35
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:47,058
{\an1}C'mon, now, don't say that!
Can't you just use that one
for your video?

36
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,329
{\an1}But you told me that you wanted
to redo it.

37
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:53,003
{\an1}So I've been waiting around this
whole time for you to come up
with something else!

38
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:54,304
{\an1}I'm sorry about that.

39
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:59,278
{\an1}But the more I think about it,
the less sure I am about what I
should say to Naruto.

40
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:04,020
{\an1}But you held out for so long,
and now you're the only one who
hasn't finished theirs!

41
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,053
{\an1}Look, don't over-think it.

42
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,325
{\an1}Just make up your mind and send
him a cool, heartfelt message,
okay?!

43
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:13,233
{\an1}Please forgive me. Tell you
what, I'll treat to you some
ramen next time, okay?

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,070
{\an1}Hey! Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!

46
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,990
{\an1}I can't believe it's almost
here! Naruto's wedding is next
week!

47
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:31,896
{\an1}So, Iruka, are you going to
give a congratulatory speech?

48
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:37,605
{\an1}Uh. Oh no. That's Lord Hokage's
job! I'm pretty sure he's gonna
be taking care of that.

49
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,381
{\an1}<i>(Ayame) Hey, Iruka!</i>

51
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:51,192
{\an1}Is something the matter? You
haven't been around much at
all lately.

52
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,697
{\an1}Oh, I just wanted to hold off
until I figured out what to
say...

53
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,301
{\an1}for the message that Konohamaru
asked me to record.

54
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,939
{\an1}I'm trying to practice some
self-restraint.

55
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:02,944
{\an1}Oh! So did you get your
message all finished up, then?

56
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,981
Uh, well, uh.

57
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:11,089
{\an1}I'll stop by again in just a
little while. Please say hello
to your dad for me!

{\an1}That night, you acknowledged
me. Do you remember?

66
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:38,899
{\an1}It was the first time ever!

67
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:42,838
{\an1}And that's the reason why I'm
here today.

um.

{\an1}Well, I was just thinking about
you.

80

stop by here to you know, see if
you were still alive!

{\an1}What the hell does that mean?

82
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,870
{\an1}The thing is, I'm gonna be
getting married soon, and with
you still being single...

83
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:50,543
{\an1}and all, I was worried about you
being alone. Anyway, I'm gonna
come on in!

{\an1}It's really nothing at all, just
some stuff.

87

{\an1}But more importantly, what about
you? What's going on?

{\an1}Oh, uh, well, uh.

89
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:05,332
{\an1}Oh yeah! Ramen! Do you want to
go and get some ramen with me?

90
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:10,340
{\an1}Some ramen? Actually, I was just
in the middle of making dinner
right now.

find someone to get married
to, Iruka Sensei!

Should you be neglecting
Hinata right now?

"neglecting?"

hard...

prepare for your wedding?!

Sensei?

{\an1}Uh. A large miso char siu
ramen topped with naruto
fishcake, please.

143
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,816
{\an1}<i>(Teuchi) One large miso char siu</i>
<i>ramen!</i>

144
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,520
{\an1}<i>(Ayame) You got it! Coming right</i>
<i>up!</i>

145
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:45,873
<i>(Iruka) Hinata!</i>

146
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,478
{\an1}Huh? Iruka Sensei!

147
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:51,081
{\an1}How are all of the
preparations coming along?

148
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:54,052
{\an1}They're good! Now, we just
have to wait for the big day.

149
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:58,826
{\an1}Well, I'm very glad to hear
that! Anyway, I have something
to say.

150
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:01,932
{\an1}I'll just dive in. It's about
the wedding ceremony.

151
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,305
{\an1}Oh, you've accepted Naruto's
request to attend as his
father, haven't you?

152
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:11,112
{\an1}So you already knew about
that, huh? Yeah, of course you
would! [laughing]

153
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:15,285
{\an1}I think it's something that's
been on Naruto's mind for a
long time, now.

154
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:18,724
{\an1}There's no doubt that you're
Naruto's teacher, Iruka Sensei.

155
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,395
{\an1}But he didn't really think of
your bond as just a...

156
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:23,899
{\an1}student-teacher or mentor
relationship.

157
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:24,766
[taken aback]

158
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,369
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) Thing is...</i>

159
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,576
{\an1}<i>I kinda feel like this shouldn't</i>
<i>be coming from the point of view</i>
<i>of a teacher to his student.</i>

160
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:34,882
{\an7}<i>Naruto was thinking the same</i>
<i>thing as I was!</i>

161
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:40,858
{\an1}And so his answer to what he
was thinking was to ask me to
attend as his father, huh?

162
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:47,101
{\an1}That's right. I hope that you'll
continue to support him just as
you always have, Father!

163
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:47,836
[gasps]

164
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:51,975
{\an1}Uh, yes, of course!

165
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:56,048
{\an1}[chuckles] But it's kinda
embarrassing to be asked so
formally!

166
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,787
[giggles]

167
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,056
Anyway.

168
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,764
{\an1}I don't get it. What is this?

169
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:09,135
{\an1}It isn't very much, but please
put it toward the cost of the
wedding.

170
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,037
What?!

171
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,375
{\an1}Naruto asked me to stand in as
his father, so I have to!

172
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:15,912
{\an1}If I tried to give it to him,
he wouldn't take it.

173
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:19,918
{\an1}I'm not going to take it
either! Listen, please! Don't
worry about that!

174
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:21,187
Oh. I see.

175
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,425
{\an1}Guess I don't have much of a
choice...

176
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,395
{\an1}but to accept your answer
and wait for the big day to
arrive.

177
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,435
{\an1}I wish that I could've done
something fatherly to help you
out more, though.

178
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:31,637
[giggles]

179
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,707
Uh! What is it?!

180
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,648
{\an1}[giggling] With that expression
on your face, you look just like
my father!

181
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:41,820
{\an1}So in a way, you are acting
like the father of the groom.

182
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,254
{\an1}Really? You think so?

183
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,157
[laughing]

184
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:51,634
{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) Three, two...</i>

185
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:54,506
{\an1}One! And we're rolling!

186
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,681
{\an1}Naruto, Hinata, congrats on
your wedding day!

187
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,116
Naruto.

188
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,155
[chuckles]

189
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,196
{\an1}What's the matter now, Iruka
Sensei? You at a loss for
words again or something?

190
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,035
{\an1}No, sorry, sorry. Don't worry,
I'll do it right, I promise!

191
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,305
{\an1}Can I start over again, just one
more time?

192
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,708
[weary sigh]

193
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:27,256
{\an1}Naruto and Hinata!
Congratulations on your wedding!

194
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:30,594
{\an1}Please create a home that is
as bright as the morning sun!

195
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,030
{\an1}May you always be happy!

196
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:32,998
Cheers!

197
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:34,100
Congratulations!

198
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,168
Do your best!

199
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,272
{\an1}Don't eat too many tasty
homemade meals!

200
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:38,406
Congratulations.

201
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,810
Yeah, congrats!

202
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:43,514
{\an1}Congratulations to you both,
Mr. Naruto and Miss Hinata!

203
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,989
{\an1}Congratulations on getting
married!

204
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:51,293
{\an1}Stop by once in a while for
ramen, okay?

205
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,229
{\an1}Congratulations, you two.

206
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,231
Congratulations!

207
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,772
{\an1}Naruto, Miss Hinata, a lot's
happened, but congratulations.

208
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,678
{\an1}Big Brother Naruto, you did
it! And I'll do my best, too!

209
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,582
Naruto Uzumaki,
congratulations.

210
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:07,819
{\an1}Dear Naruto, do your best.

211
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:08,520
Yeah!

212
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:16,532
Naruto, Hinata,
congratulations on your
wedding!

213
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,037
{\an1}Be there for each other, and
may you have everlasting
happiness!

214
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:27,115
{\an1}Naruto! Hinata! Congrats on
your wedding!

215
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:33,024
{\an1}Hinata, as you know, Naruto's
absentminded and reckless. He's
gonna need all your support.

216
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:36,062
{\an1}So I ask of you: please take
good care of him!

217
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:39,668
{\an1}Naruto, I just have this to
say.

218
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:42,573
{\an1}You'd better do everything to
make Hinata happy!

219
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:44,576
[mild chuckle]

220
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:48,916
{\an1}That was great! I'd even say
it was perfect, Iruka Sensei!

221
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:54,324
{\an1}[relieved sigh] It went off
without a hitch, huh?

222
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,111
Great.

223
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,416
{\an1}Could you get the receiving
desk set up, too?

224
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:12,184
Lord Kakashi!

225
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,991
{\an1}[groans] Like I said about a
hundred times, drop the "lord"
part.

226
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:18,461
{\an1}The Lords Kage have just
arrived in the Village.

227
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,097
{\an1}Huh? They're here
already?!

228
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,933
{\an1}Shall I escort them in, then?

229
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,537
{\an1}Yes. It's rude to keep them
waiting.

230
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:28,309
{\an1}Hmm? Hey, Kazekage entourage!

231
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:31,615
{\an1}We're here from the land of
Lightning, delivering our
wedding blessings.

232
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,086
{\an1}Let's forget the past and all be
friends till the last!

233
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:38,392
{\an1}Yes, of course! I don't feel
like fighting like little
brats anymore.

234
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:43,867
{\an1}Yo, now direct your eyes, see
my gift and be surprised. Even
the couple will be rapturized!

235
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,003
{\an1}<i>(Raikage) Enough!</i>

236
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:46,304
[grunts]

237
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,275
{\an1}<i>(Shizune) The reception desk is</i>
<i>now open. Please come and sign</i>
<i>the guest book...</i>

238
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,512
{\an1}Hey, where's Temari run off
to?

239
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,348
{\an1}I haven't seen her since we
got here.

240
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,257
{\an1}Between you and me, how much
are you giving them, Ebisu
Sensei?

241
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,363
{\an1}Well, etiquette says that
working adults are supposed to
give about.

242
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:03,798
Huh?!

243
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,039
{\an1}You can give that little? Man,
I put five bills in my
envelope.

244
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,876
{\an1}What?! Did you say you
put five in?!

245
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:13,914
{\an7}<i>Oh, no! I'll lose face as a</i>
<i>teacher!</i>

246
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:19,056
{\an1}Oh, this is the gift table!
Hold on a second. Here's our
gift!

247
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:21,324
{\an1}No, dad, not that one!

248
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:24,296
{\an1}Oh, yeah. Good catch.
This one!

249
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:25,665
Oh, seriously!

250
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,139
{\an1}Now listen up, Lee! When we
honor people, we hone our mind
and spirit.

251
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:32,341
{\an1}That's what a wedding
celebration is for!

252
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,815
{\an1}What you are saying is to
never forget to train, even
when at a party!

253
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:36,949
{\an1}[grunts] Naturally!

254
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,521
{\an1}Look, people are starting to
stare, so will you cut it out
already?!

255
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,357
{\an1}We'll start with dumbbell
juggling!

256
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,793
Yes, Guy Sensei!

257
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,096
Hah!

258
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,971
{\an1}What a day! What a joyous day
this is!

259
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,339
{\an1}This training especially so!

260
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:54,242
{\an1}You have way too much joy in
your heads!

261
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:59,350
{\an1}<i>(Kurenai) So? Did you get ahold</i>
<i>of the honey wine?</i>

262
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:00,552
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Of course!</i>

263
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,392
{\an1}And we're gonna tell Naruto
all about the history of the
Senju Clan along with this!

264
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:09,233
{\an1}Are you really well versed
enough in their history to be
able to do that?

265
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,902
{\an1}Huh?! Well, kinda. I, uh...

266
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:13,873
{\an1}I'll tell you what, why don't
you run it by me first?

267
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,877
{\an1}Oh, uh, thanks, but...

268
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,611
{\an1}<i>(Mirai) Giddy up! </i>

269
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,113
Run! Go!

270
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:19,548
{\an1}What are you doing,
Mirai?

271
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,252
{\an1}I'm playing horsey-back!

272
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:26,125
{\an1}Akamaru is a dog. You can't
ride a dog and call it
horsey-back riding.

273
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,895
{\an1}Then I'm doggie-back riding!

274
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:32,702
{\an1}That's true, it is doggie-back
riding. But Akamaru looks a
little tired now.

275
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,373
{\an1}So why don't you just come on
down from there? The reason
is...

276
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,075
No! Wanna ride!

277
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,746
{\an1}I guess there's no choice.

278
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:43,186
{\an1}We'll go Shino-back riding,
then.

279
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:47,524
{\an1}That seems new to me. Was
Shino always this good with
the little kids?

280
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,831
{\an1}He seems to think that he
might be suited to teaching in
the future.

281
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,736
{\an1}Just what are you smiling
about?

282
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,173
{\an1}What? Who ever said that I was
smiling?

283
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,576
Yeah, whatever.

284
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,979
{\an1}I know what the deal about
weddings is.

285
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:04,151
{\an1}Men go to them to meet single
friends of the bride, isn't that
right?

286
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:09,059
{\an1}That's not it! Man, this is
such a drag. Come on, let's go
over there.

287
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,929
{\an1}[gasps] So sweet!

288
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:14,433
{\an1}It's definitely going to be
sweet.

289
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:18,106
{\an1}How long has that been going
on? When did those two get
together?!

290
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,674
{\an1}Just who do you mean?

291
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,477
{\an1}Shikamaru and Temari.

292
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,882
{\an1}Did you know they were like
that?

293
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:25,184
M-hm.

294
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:29,357
{\an1}Anyway, you know that everyone's
probably thinking the same thing
about us right now.

295
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:35,132
[sighs]

296
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,902
[gasps]

297
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,087
[gasps]

298
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,195
Sasuke.

299
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:18,299
{\an1}Hey, what's the matter, Iruka
Sensei? Is there something
that's still worrying you?

300
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,634
Well.

301
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,203
{\an1}It'll all be fine.

302
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:25,643
{\an1}Thanks to you we have enough
shinobi to cover guard duty and
anything else we might need.

303
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:28,815
{\an1}Oh no, all of that was really
your doing, Kakashi.

304
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:31,485
{\an1}[chuckles] No, I hardly did
anything at all.

305
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,256
{\an1}Maybe I managed to help things
along a little.

306
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,663
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) But it's really all</i>
<i>thanks to the bonds that Naruto</i>
<i>forged. </i>

307
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,668
{\an1}<i>Everyone's here today, all</i>
<i>because of Naruto.</i>

308
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:47,344
{\an1}I'm sure that he's going to
make Hinata very happy.

309
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:49,981
{\an1}So what exactly are you
worried about?

310
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:54,988
{\an1}Well, I never really got around
to preparing my toast for the
reception.

311
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:58,461
Huh?! [laughing]

312
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,676
{\an7}<i>Big Brother Neji. I'm about to</i>
<i>get married.</i>

313
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,476
{\an1}<i>(Hanabi) Elder Sister! It's</i>
<i>time!</i>

314
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,477
Right!

315
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,917
Wow! You look so
beautiful!

316
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,719
{\an1}Don't you think so, Father?

317
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,665
{\an1}Okay, are you ready?
