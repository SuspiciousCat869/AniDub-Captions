still use this timber?

Looks like it.

{\an1}Hm?

what was built by the previous
generations of Hokage.

Yeah.

Lady Tsunade will wake up
really soon, I'm sure of it!

{\an1}I mean, she's really strong.
She's the Hokage. You'll see.

Sorry, no can do.

either,

00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:49,781
{\an1}Sorry. Guess the three
of us misjudged you.

299
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:53,719
Ah!

Ulp!

303
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,828
{\an1}Agh! You know how
worried you had us?!

304
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,198
{\an1}You are such a...
You're such a...

Sorry...!

I just...!

I'm sorry!

They're crying
like babies!

310
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,715
It's okay at
times like this.

[crying]

312
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,723
Oh yeah, I almost
forgot I had something
to give to you, Naruto!

{\an1}[sniffling]

314
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,894
{\an1}Oh, don't worry.
I still have the coupon.

315
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,196
{\an1}[gulp] It's gone.

316
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,534
{\an1}You probably lost it in the
river. Just forget it.

317
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,940

DAHHH!

just like me.

They're all working
right over there.
You see?

321
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:53,626
Wow, what a surprise!

322
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,462
{\an1}We're grateful that you
helped us on that day,

323

{\an1}and with Gato
the time before.

324

{\an1}Because of you,
the Land of Waves has
become very prosperous.

325
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:07,209
{\an1}That's right! And now it's time
for us to return the favor!

00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,378
{\an1}The first thing I'll build is...

327
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,786
{\an1}Ichiraku! Just you watch!
I'll build you an amazing
noodle house!

Inari...

329

that would be great!
