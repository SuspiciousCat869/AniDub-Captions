(Zetsu)
That's how the battle between my
mother and the brothers ended.

148
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:39,225
{\an1}I remained, but I was powerless.

149
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:46,831
{\an4}That's why I went deep into the
darkness where I could carefully
and cautiously plan my mother's
revival.

150
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:52,736
{\an1}Ignorant of this, Hagoromo was
raising Indra and Ashura ...

151
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,639
{\an1}and created that Ninshu/Ninja
Creed nonsense.

152
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:01,343
{\an1}Time passed, and so did
Hagoromo.

153
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,146
{\an1}but not before scattering the
Tailed Beasts around the world.

154
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:13,119
{\an1}To revive Mother, I needed the
Divine Tree and the Infinite
Tsukuyomi cast by the Rinnegan.

155
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:20,058
{\an1}But the Rinnegan required
Hagoromo's chakra, which he
passed on to Indra and Ashura.

156
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:25,962
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts, needed to
form Ten Tails, were scattered
across the world.

157
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:30,733
{\an1}To bring Mother back, it all
had to be collected.

158
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:35,337
{\an1}You can't imagine how
long it took to do that.

159
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:43,944
{\an4}First, to regain Hagoromo's
chakra, I tempted Indra, who'd
lost the fight over ninja creed
succession.

160
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:51,783
{\an1}And later, I selected Indra's
descendants, the Uchiha, to be
the cast of my tale...

161
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:58,589
{\an1}...by meddling with and altering
that rubbish Hagoromo penned,
just a little bit.

162
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,391
You mean?!

163
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:06,996
{\an1}That's right. Hagoromo's Stone
Tablet. I took it upon myself
to rewrite some of it,

164
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,766
{\an1}like how Infinite
Tsukuyomi was the path
to save the Uchiha.

165
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,670
{\an1}I must say, you Uchiha played
your parts brilliantly.

166
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,373
(Sasuke)
Why you-!

167
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:24,877
(Zetsu)
Indra and the Uchiha...
Ashura and the Senju...

168
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,315
{\an1}I was able to set up a pattern
of fighting and power-seeking.

169
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:41,390
{\an4}Time after time, I'd approach
the reincarnates of Indra and
Ashura in each clan to attempt
Rinnegan manifestation.

170
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:44,026
{\an1}But it always ended in failure.

171
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,130
{\an1}Just with that alone, a
thousand years passed.

172
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:55,835
{\an1}But when the reincarnates became
Madara Uchiha and Hashirama
Senju,

173
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:01,541
{\an1}I came to believe that
Madara could achieve it.

174
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:05,243
{\an1}That was the first step
towards Mother's return.

175
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:09,080
However...

176
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:37,769
{\an1}Madara Uchiha lost to
Hashirama Senju.

177
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:42,474
{\an1}I thought that I'd have to go
back to the drawing board.

178
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:45,809
{\an1}But Fate did not turn
her back on me.

179
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:51,646
{\an1}Madara's corpse was like a
treasure trove to other shinobi.

180
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,786
{\an1}Tobirama, who'd been studying
the mysteries of the Sharingan,
didn't destroy Madara's body...

181
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:02,689
{\an1}He hid it deep within the Leaf's
mountains instead.

182
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:05,358
{\an1}But Madara was no fool.

183
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:11,797
{\an1}He guessed that if he lost to
Hashirama in battle, Tobirama
would keep his body.

184
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,299
{\an1}So he placed a jutsu on himself.

185
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:21,271
{\an1}You can invoke a time-delay
spell in one's eye using the
Mangekyo Sharingan.

186
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:27,109
{\an1}Just like how Itachi implanted
the Amaterasu in yours, Sasuke.

187
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,477
[gasps]

188
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:32,780
(Zetsu)
Madara had installed the Izanagi
in his right eye.

189
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:38,819
{\an1}At the cost of that right eye,
Madara rewrote reality and
returned to life-

190
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:42,421
{\an1}then passed off a Shadow
Clone as his corpse.

191
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:50,828
{\an4}He vomited up the piece of flesh
he bit off Hashirama,
transplanted it onto his
wound...

192
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:56,167
{\an1}...and finally awakened the
Rinnegan and summoned the Gedo
Statue.

193
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:02,738
{\an1}He then cultured Hashirama's
flesh using the Statue to try to
prolong his life.

194
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:07,041
{\an1}The White Zetsu seemed to be an
incidental by-product of that...

195
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:17,517
{\an4}...but actually were people from
the past Infinite Tsukuyomi,
whom I extracted from the Statue
and made look that way.

196
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:24,355
{\an1}"It is these opposites operating
together that give rise to all
things."

197
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:30,360
{\an1}As inscribed on the Stone
Tablet, Madara solidified his
attachment to Hashirama.

198
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:36,265
{\an1}I started implementing a plan: I
made it look like I was born out
of Madara,

199
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,368
{\an1}manipulated Obito, and began
collecting Tailed Beasts.

200
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:45,839
{\an1}I formed the Akatsuki and
steered them towards war.

201
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:52,245
{\an1}To increase battle strength, I
deliberately let Kabuto discover
Madara's corpse.

202
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:58,983
{\an1}I guided him to use it as a
bargaining chip and cooperate
with Obito.

203
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:05,055
{\an1}As long planned, the Infinite
Tsukuyomi was launched during
this war...

204
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:12,595
{\an4}...and by amassing a large
amount of the human chakra
that'd been scattered, Mother
was restored.

205
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,197
{\an1}I truly detest both of you...

206
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:20,501
{\an1}Hagoromo... Hamura,  my two
children...

207
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,903
{\an1}You  are now mine.

You shall return with me to the
