1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:12,033
JIRAIYA: You want to
end up like this, too?

2
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,466
Talk, or you'll end up living
on dragonflies and beetles

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,200
for the rest of
your miserable life.

4
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,066
-Fine, turn me
into a frog, then!

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm not going to say
anything else to you!

6
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,166
I made be low-ranking,
but I still have my pride.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm a ninja.

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,266
I have nothing to say
to an outsider who

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,366
has no idea what goes
on in our nation.

10
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:39,766
-Heh, still a ninja
no matter how lowly.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,966
Well, interrogation was
never my forte, anyway.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,466
OK, talk time is over.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,966
But you're still
going to stay put.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,866
I'll just go ahead and ask this
god of yours in person, then.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,433
-What's the big idea?

16
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:12,366
I mean, what are you
thinking summoning me here

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,266
right now, Jiraiya?

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,500
Is this about Naruto's key?

19
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,100
-No, it's not about
training this time.

20
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,166
I have my reasons,
but I'm thinking

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,933
of removing you
from me for a bit.

22
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,633
-Thinking of removing me?

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,366
What in the world is going on?

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
-I'm just about
to go into battle

25
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,366
with a very tough opponent.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,533
-Uh-huh.

27
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,133
This guy must
really be something

28
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,400
if you have to release
me to go fight him.

29
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,200
-Don't worry.

30
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,733
It's just a precaution.

31
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:39,000
Anyway, I want to press the
storage release seal now, so--

32
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:39,933
-Very well, then.

33
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,066
JIRAIYA: There

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,733
-So how long do you
think it'll take?

35
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,166
When will you be coming back?

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,933
-I really doubt that
it'll take all that long.

37
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,466
But if something
should happen to me,

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,333
you just go and store
yourself inside of Naruto.

39
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,033
-What?

40
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,833
Have you lost your mind?

41
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,266
You're well aware
that the key that

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,400
corresponds to Naruto's
eight sign seal

43
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,533
is transcribed on my belly.

44
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,733
Each and every year, the Fourth
Hokage's seal grows weaker.

45
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,033
We keep the key in order
to re-tighten the seal

46
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,000
if we should ever find the need.

47
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:22,466
To place a key right next to
the lock it opens is unheard of.

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,866
-Yes.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,033
And yet, don't forget that it
was entrusted to us by Minato.

50
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,133
It was always meant to be
returned to Naruto one day.

51
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,466
-But it's too soon.

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,433
Once already you sweet talked
me into loosening the tetragram

53
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,066
seal, and you know
just as well as I

54
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,433
do what happened that time.

55
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,066
You haven't forgotten, have you?

56
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,300
-No.

57
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,966
But I believe that
Minato entrusting me

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,133
with his jutsu formula indicates
that his will was for Naruto

59
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,133
to complete that jutsu
for himself one day.

60
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,566
-That jutsu?

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,833
Are you serious?

62
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,300
-Yes.

63
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,000
-You really think that
Naruto requires such a jutsu?

64
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,233
He would never be able to
control the Nine-Tails's

65
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,300
chakra.

66
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,600
And besides, when that
lock was loosened,

67
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:19,033
Naruto's own chakra
was pushed aside

68
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,966
by the Nine-Tails's
chakra, which

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,933
leaked out in large amounts
and took over Naruto.

70
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,200
If the seal is
undone any further

71
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,800
and the Nine-Tails
completely overtakes Naruto,

72
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
that would really go against
the Fourth Hokage's will.

73
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:37,666
-But Minato only used this seal
on the Nine-Tails's Yin chakra.

74
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,500
He split the Nine-Tails's
power into Yin and Yang

75
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,100
and sealed the Yang
power inside of Naruto.

76
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,966
He left the Nine-Tails's
chakra to Naruto on purpose.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,633
-Perhaps.

78
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,466
But still--

79
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
-Why did Minato do that?

80
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,900
Why did he go so far as to seal
that chakra inside his son?

81
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,000
-Who can tell?

82
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:59,066
Perhaps it was necessitated
by the sealing.

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,766
Or it could be that
as a father, he simply

84
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,500
wanted to pass on
that power to his son.

85
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,900
-I was Minato's teacher,
so I knew him very well.

86
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:14,233
And he never did anything at
all without a very good reason.

87
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,733
Minato must have known
something important.

88
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,500
And as a result, he entrusted
the Nine-Tails's power

89
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,033
to Naruto because of
the knowledge he had.

90
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,566
-I think you're reading
too much into it.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,733
-Do you really
believe that's true?

92
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:31,666
The last time the
Nine-Tailed Fox spirit

93
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,366
attacked the Hidden
Leaf Village,

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,666
it was said to have
been a natural disaster.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,233
But lately, I've begun
to suspect something else

96
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:44,200
happened, that its appearance
was not a natural phenomenon.

97
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,033
I think there's more to it.

98
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:49,166
I believe it may very well
have been manually summoned.

99
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,366
-Fool.

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,133
The Nine-Tails has always
been a natural disaster

101
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,933
that appears when humanity
becomes steeped in evil.

102
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:58,566
Besides, there's no one
that's powerful enough.

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
No one can summon the
likes of the Nine-Tails.

104
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,400
-Yes.

105
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,233
Well, that's just the thing.

106
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:04,833
There was one.

107
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:05,333
-What?

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,100
-And who's that?

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,900
-One of the Uchiha clan
founders, Madara Uchiha.

110
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:20,666
-Ribbit, ribbit!

111
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

112
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,266
You fool.

113
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,066
Madara lived back in the
early days of the Hidden Leaf.

114
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,466
No way he was still
alive 15, 16 years ago.

115
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,166
-Yes, that's true.

116
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,300
And I also know,
as everybody does,

117
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,833
that the First Hokage defeated
Madara Uchiha in the Battle

118
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,066
at the Final Valley.

119
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
-Exactly.

120
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,633
Your theory is pointless.

121
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,866
-Perhaps.

122
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,233
But I just have this
feeling that I can't shake.

123
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,066
And it fills me with unease.

124
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,400
-Return to the
Hidden Leaf Village.

125
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,433
When you get there, go
straight to see Ibiki.

126
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,033
He already knows
you'll be coming.

127
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,766
I'm counting on you, now.

128
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:37,166
Well, then, I certainly
hope this plan works.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,866
Here we go.

130
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:52,966
[music playing]

131
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,758
PAIN: Well?

132
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,624
-It's Jiraiya.

133
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,891
PAIN: I see.

134
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,258
Jiraiya sensei, huh?

135
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,991
How nostalgic.

136
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,224
-What'll you do, Pain?

137
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:01,624
-Jiraiya isn't on our side of
things, isn't that correct?

138
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,458
-Probably.

139
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,558
-Then I must kill him.

140
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,624
It's far too late for regrets.

141
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:09,924
I came forth in this body
to kill the intruder,

142
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,324
and I'll do just that.

143
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:12,691
Now take me to him.

144
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:13,891
-All right, then.

145
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:23,191
Pain, I'll go ahead now
and handle him by myself

146
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:25,758
until you arrive.

147
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,124
-Try to kill him if you can.

148
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,958
-Fire Style Flame Bomb!

149
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,291
[coughing]

150
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,724
-Toad Subjugation.

151
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:10,258
Art of the Manipulated
Shadow, huh?

152
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,958
JIRAIYA: I dangled
a lure in hopes

153
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:13,858
of drawing out this Pain fellow.

154
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,591
But I never imagined
that I'd catch you.

155
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:22,358
You've honed your
jutsu magnificently.

156
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:25,158
But even more, you've
become quite a catch, Konan.

157
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:34,524
It was my understanding
that all of you had died.

158
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:36,224
But I never would have
guessed that you'd

159
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,524
turned into sheets of paper.

160
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,458
-It's really you.

161
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,358
You're the messenger,
Lady Angel.

162
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,824
-First a god, now an angel.

163
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:46,591
Which means that
you're the messenger

164
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:48,191
for this so-called god.

165
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:49,091
Is that right, Konan?

166
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,591
-This man is an intruder.

167
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:53,391
You should kill him now!

168
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:54,824
-Leave now and stay away.

169
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:57,358
-Yes, ma'am!

170
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,958
-So who is this Pain?

171
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,291
-It's really none of
your business, sensei.

172
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:16,791
-And doing that helps
you feel like an angel?

173
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:21,391
Does putting on an act like
that really have any benefits?

174
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:23,324
-I've received my
orders from god.

175
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:24,791
I will kill you.

176
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:36,491
-Cloud oil bomb!

177
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:46,491
You're soaked in oil so
you can't peel apart.

178
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,991
You had such a love
of origami, and you

179
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,524
were the kindest and gentlest
of the three of you children

180
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,524
that I trained.

181
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:56,658
What happened to the others?

182
00:11:56,691 --> 00:12:00,191
Nagato and Yahiko?

183
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:05,058
I heard you all died, but
I guess that was a rumor.

184
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,558
Oh, I see.

185
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,424
So tell me, which
of the other two

186
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,758
ended up becoming
this Pain, then?

187
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,991
-Just what do you want
appearing before us

188
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,024
after all these years?

189
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:17,391
-That wasn't my
intention if you all

190
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:20,591
hadn't been part
of the Akatsuki.

191
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,891
I heard that all
of you had died.

192
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:26,191
I never imagined that it would
come to something like this.

193
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:30,424
-Way back then, you should have
done what Orochimaru suggested.

194
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,991
Isn't that what
you're thinking now?

195
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:39,291
-These kids-- shall I kill them?

196
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,724
We've seen so many war orphans.

197
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,524
It's always so pitiful.

198
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:45,524
They'd be better off if
we simply put them out

199
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,924
of their misery right now.

200
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,991
-Back then, you saved the three
of us from that fate instead.

201
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:52,758
But it's too late now.

202
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,258
We've wholeheartedly
embraced his ideology,

203
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,891
and we have now made our move.

204
00:12:56,924 --> 00:13:00,258
-I have no regrets about
letting the three of you live,

205
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,491
no matter how this may end.

206
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,824
I'm just very sad.

207
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:09,958
The reason I taught you ninjutsu
was to enable all of you

208
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,291
to survive those harsh times.

209
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,491
You were all
undoubtedly my students.

210
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,624
And I know the world
is a cruel place,

211
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:20,058
but to attack me without even
so much as a greeting-- well,

212
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,591
that's just too sad.

213
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,858
For a few years after
our time together, I

214
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,624
heard your names
mentioned here and there.

215
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,858
You made a reputation
for yourselves,

216
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,824
fighting for hire
in a few conflicts.

217
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,124
But then--

218
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,724
-You know nothing about what
happened to us afterward,

219
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:36,691
sensei.

220
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:37,524
-No, I don't.

221
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,958
That's quite apparent.

222
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,891
But why all this stuff
with the Akatsuki?

223
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:45,191
What the Akatsuki is
doing now is simply wrong.

224
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,191
-This is what I've
thought through on my own.

225
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,724
And that is that,
Jiraiya sensei.

226
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:07,288
-Well, your appearance
has changed quite a bit.

227
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,988
But those eyes,

228
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,388
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): That
shape, that ripple pattern.

229
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,455
I can't believe it.

230
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:14,822
That eye.

231
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,622
The Rinnegan.

232
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:20,788
-So I guess you're the
one who became Pain.

233
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,155
Nagato.

234
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:25,288
It appears you've strayed
from the path of goodness.

235
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,255
What happened to you?

236
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:29,255
-You don't need to know.

237
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,788
After all, you are an outsider.

238
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:36,088
-You really have
changed, Nagato.

239
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:36,788
-Summoning jutsu.

240
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:40,955
-Hmm?

241
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,822
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Foam.

242
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,255
Leave it to my students
to know my weakness.

243
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,622
He intends to nullify
and wash away the oil.

244
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,222
-Kona, stay back.

245
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,555
-Art of the Raving Lion's Mane!

246
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:32,022
Nagato, it's time for me
to ask you a few questions.

247
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:35,255
What happened to Yahiko?

248
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,355
-Ah, yes.

249
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:39,655
There was such a fellow
once, wasn't there?

250
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,155
But he died a long time ago.

251
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:46,122
-Nagato, what happened?

252
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:50,755
-All I want to do is protect
those two, no matter what kind

253
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:54,722
of pain I may be
forced to endure.

254
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,688
-I understand.

255
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,488
What happened to you?

256
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,022
The old you would never--

257
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:02,288
-Nothing happened.

258
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:04,555
Nothing except for the war.

259
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,055
Too many people
died in this land.

260
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:11,755
All that pain forced
me to grow up.

261
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:14,055
-What does that mean?

262
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,355
-That even innocent,
foolish children

263
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:20,722
will grow up in the face of
pain until their thoughts

264
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,655
and beliefs are
the same as adults.

265
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,988
-But abandoning one's love for
his friends and fellow man?

266
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,255
Is that really what it
means to become an adult?

267
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,088
-Oh, sensei.

268
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,822
You are still merely a man.

269
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:35,855
However, I, mired
in endless pain,

270
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:39,522
have matured and become
much more than a man.

271
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:41,088
-What are you saying?

272
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,222
-Yes.

273
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:47,655
I've grown from a man to a god.

274
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:51,188
And since I'm a god, all
my words and thoughts

275
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:52,988
have become absolute.

276
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:56,288
Poor sensei, you're
still only human.

277
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:59,422
It's not your fault if you don't
understand what I'm saying.

278
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,155
-Have you really
become that twisted?

279
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,422
-Things that I couldn't see
when I was human are clear to me

280
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,122
now that I'm a god.

281
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:10,922
And being a god, I realize that
there are things I can do which

282
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,288
moral men cannot even dream of.

283
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:17,322
Or to put it more simply,
I have evolved beyond that.

284
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:21,522
-Just what exactly are
you planning to do?

285
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,388
-At last, I'm
going to put an end

286
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,622
to this senseless,
war-riddled world.

287
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,422
This will be my sacred deed.

288
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:29,988
-If that's your goal,
then why are you

289
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,088
gathering up all
the tailed beasts?

290
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,688
-Well, you are about
to die, anyway,

291
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:38,755
so I don't need to keep this
secret from you any longer.

292
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,855
I will use the
sealed tailed beasts

293
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:49,922
to develop new, forbidden
jutsu, jutsu of such magnitude

294
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,855
that just one could
destroy an entire nation.

295
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:56,322
They will be the most powerful,
the ultimate forbidden

296
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,455
jutsu weapons.

297
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,722
-But how could creating
such jutsu possibly

298
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,322
bring about an end to war?

299
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:02,922
Weapons such as
those will simply

300
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:05,655
increase conflicts
between nations.

301
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:08,688
PAIN: The world is already
rife with conflict, so what's

302
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,688
the quickest way to
get nations to stop

303
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,088
fighting each other,
Jiraiya sensei?

304
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,588
JIRAIYA: That's
what I'm asking you.

305
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,955
So answer me!

306
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,522
-To each one of the
warring nations,

307
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:22,255
I will hand out a
forbidden jutsu weapon.

308
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,588
For once they have them, once
they possess such a power,

309
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:26,922
then they're bound to use it.

310
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:27,588
-Wait.

311
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:29,222
What are you saying?

312
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:30,388
-Just think.

313
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:33,255
Tens of millions of
people will die instantly,

314
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,322
and all mankind will
quake in terror.

315
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:40,888
All of humanity, all the nations
will learn what pain truly is.

316
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:43,422
Fear would breed a
strong aversion to war.

317
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,188
Conflicts would cease.

318
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:47,222
It can be said that
this world is still

319
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,788
in the process of
maturing, that it's still

320
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,522
on the path to stability.

321
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,422
Pain will make
the world grow up,

322
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:57,455
just like it forced
us to grow up.

323
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,188
In order for the world
to develop to the point

324
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,988
where it can think
and walk on its own,

325
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,555
it needs the help
of a god's hand.

326
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:07,922
This world is still
but a child, you see.

327
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,655
-You want to teach the
world pain in order

328
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,522
to make it grow up?

329
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:11,722
Is that it?

330
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:13,855
Do you really believe
that this is your mission?

331
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:15,155
-I do.

332
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:18,488
I believe in this fully
because I am a pacifist god.

333
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:22,222
-Well, I see you've developed
a sense of humor, Nagato.

334
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:23,622
-Oh, I'm not joking.

335
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:25,655
Far from it.

336
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:27,122
My vision is too important.

337
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:32,855
I'm over here, sensei.

338
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:36,222
-So that's your
summoning then, is it?

339
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,222
-To me, you're like a
single-celled organism

340
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:40,755
that hasn't evolved at all.

341
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,155
[laughter]

342
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:45,055
-Summoning jutsu!

343
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:48,222
Just imagine a kid
treating me like a kid.

344
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,655
Well, I have news for you, kid.

345
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:52,522
I'm not really human
anymore, either.

346
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:55,522
These tears of blood
overflowing with rage--

347
00:19:55,555 --> 00:20:00,288
I went from Sannin to Sage-- the
Hermit Sage of Mount Myoboku!

348
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:01,755
I am master Jirai--

349
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:08,022
-You haven't matured
at all, sensei.

350
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,722
You're just as clumsy as ever.

351
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:10,488
-Come on!

352
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,988
Watch it, Mister Gamaken!

353
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,888
Don't jostle me during
such a crucial juncture!

354
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,888
[music playing]

355
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,355
-I'm sorry.

356
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,355
I'm quite ungraceful.

357
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:35,016
[music playing]

358
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,837
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
I really have

359
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,470
to hand it to my former student.

360
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:07,770
He knows my moves all too well.

361
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,703
I don't know what
happened in the past,

362
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,337
but now he's powerful enough
to head up the Akatsuki.

363
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,970
Plus, he wields the
legendary Rinnegan.

364
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:17,637
Against this foe, there
shall be no playing by ear.

365
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,003
I'll have to go full
strength with my Sage Mode

366
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,237
from the get-go.

367
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,803
Next time-- Honored Sage Mode!

368
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:26,103
Look forward to seeing me
in all of my awesome action

369
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,437
then because I know you are!
