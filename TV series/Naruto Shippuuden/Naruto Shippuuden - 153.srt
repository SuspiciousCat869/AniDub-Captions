1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,644
SAKURA: Naruto, wait.

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,946
Where are you going?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,483
-If the Pervy Sage had
been the Fifth Hokage,

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,287
he wouldn't have let Granny
Tsunade take a risk like that.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,754
Never.

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,329
-Naruto!

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:29,830
-Please, Sakura.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,964
Enough.

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,999
Just drop it.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,867
Let him be for now.

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,869
-But milady--

12
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:41,308
-I can see that this child truly
loved and admired Jiraiya boy.

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,443
It makes me hope
more than anything

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,746
that he is the
child of prophecy.

15
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,993
[theme music]

16
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,706
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry.

17
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,444
You always seem to get such
unfortunate assignments.

18
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,880
-What's with the
sudden confession?

19
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,918
-Look, I'm really saying you
were supposed to become Hokage.

20
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,854
After all, the
Third Hokage always

21
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,455
wanted you to succeed him.

22
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,958
-I'm not cut out for
that sort of thing.

23
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,659
I like being free
and unfettered.

24
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,562
-You regretted not being
able to stop Orochimaru.

25
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,031
That's why you tracked
his movements by yourself

26
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,168
for so long, isn't it?

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,272
-Well, guess I no longer
need to do that, do I?

28
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,674
Of course, that also
means I get to release

29
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,745
the sequel to my
novel even sooner.

30
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,046
FUKASAKU: Tsunade girl.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,248
Tsunade girl!

32
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,920
-Are you doing
all right, milady?

33
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,355
-Yes.

34
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,890
I'm fine now.

35
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,458
I apologize.

36
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,127
-You've received
some very sad news.

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,963
No one can blame you
for being distraught.

38
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,900
But that said, you have
a vital duty to perform.

39
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,535
You must protect the village.

40
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,638
It's essentially
that you stay strong.

41
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,273
-I know.

42
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,875
In any case, let's
discuss the clues

43
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,211
that Jiraiya boy left for us.

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,480
In addition to the message
he's put on my back,

45
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,283
he's given us other
leads, as well.

46
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,252
A Hidden Rain ninja that
Jiraiya boy managed to capture

47
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,589
is inside the
belly of that frog.

48
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,357
And one last thing remains.

49
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,998
Inside this toad is one
of the bodies of Pain

50
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,800
that Jiraiya boy
managed to kill.

51
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,670
One of the six.

52
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,671
-Pain's body?

53
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,802
[groan]

54
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,571
-Oh, there they are!

55
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,573
So many beautiful girls.

56
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,841
-Hey, what are you doin'?

57
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,076
Knock it off!

58
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,978
-Just taking in the sights.

59
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,413
And getting inspiration
for my next novel.

60
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,898
FUKSAKU: This is Pain.

61
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,299
SHIZUNE: The ripple pattern.

62
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,668
Is that the legendary Rinnegan?

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,869
-That's correct.

64
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,005
If we studied his
body, I believe

65
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,874
we may find clues on
how to defeat pain.

66
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,377
-A shinobi's corpse is
full of information.

67
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,679
We'll need skilled
medical ninja,

68
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:50,384
and then we'll launch a full
autopsy on him immediately.

69
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,552
Shizune.

70
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,119
-Right.

71
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll take care of it.

72
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,727
-Hm.

73
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,362
The photo's very clear.

74
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:06,500
I have given you everything
that was entrusted to me.

75
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,234
-Yes.

76
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,402
Indeed.

77
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,471
-I will return home now, but
let me know what you find.

78
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,774
Since Jiraiya boy's
student is here,

79
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,742
you can send him to
contact me at Mt.

80
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,844
Myoboku.

81
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,445
-Thank you very much.

82
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,616
I promise you, we will find
a way somehow to defeat Pain.

83
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,233
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Now listen, Naruto.

84
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,701
I only have three
years to get you

85
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,402
strong enough to
stand on your own.

86
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,172
We'll spend that time
training, but it won't be easy.

87
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,441
So be prepared to work hard.

88
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:47,908
-I'm ready.

89
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,209
Trust me.

90
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,045
And this time, I'm gonna
bring Sasuke back for sure.

91
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,082
There's no time to waste,
so let's get going.

92
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,289
Come on, I can't
stand this anymore.

93
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,025
This has gotta be the
lamest training ever!

94
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,793
-There's no such thing
as lame training.

95
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:10,163
And you'd know that if you
weren't such a complete fool!

96
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,205
-Gotcha!

97
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,843
[laughter]

98
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,211
-You aren't the
only one here who

99
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,680
knows how to use
the shadow clones.

100
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,582
Sometimes you're still so naive.

101
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,256
-Damn.

102
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,924
So close.

103
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,293
I almost had you had time.

104
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,360
-Oh, please.

105
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,330
It'd take you 100 years
before you could beat me.

106
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,131
NARUTO: No way.

107
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,300
I can't wait 100 years.

108
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,668
Just watch.

109
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,168
Next time.

110
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,216
Nice!

111
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,617
Man, this is a cool outfit!

112
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,421
-Well now, they do say
the clothes make the man.

113
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,194
IRUKA: Yo.

114
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:14,661
Naruto.

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,603
I hear you've been real
active on missions lately.

116
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,373
Everyone in the village
is talking about you.

117
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,009
Hey, you and I should go
somewhere and catch up.

118
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,678
How about we hit up
Ichiraku for some ramen?

119
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,150
-Maybe later.

120
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,211
-What?

121
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,979
You want me to do this now?

122
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,147
-That's right.

123
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,616
Take that over to
them right away.

124
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,854
-But the guys in the cypher
division don't work this late.

125
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,122
Lady Hokage--

126
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,025
-Then summon them and tell
them it's on my orders.

127
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,726
I'm putting you in charge.

128
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,628
Get that message decoded.

129
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,264
-Look, I know this is
an important encryption,

130
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:28,268
but can't you ask someone who
isn't on a mission right now?

131
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:28,836
Wait!

132
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,003
Where are you going?

133
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,572
I actually came here
on other matters.

134
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,272
I--

135
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,808
-Shikamaru.

136
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:35,943
-But--

137
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,712
-Lady Tsunade has been
very busy all day.

138
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,186
-Well, the same goes for me.

139
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,288
-Shikamaru, please don't.

140
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:03,103
-You know, you've become even
more beautiful than before.

141
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,605
-And you haven't changed a bit.

142
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,244
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Betray that dream,

143
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,481
and you make all their
sacrifices meaningless.

144
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:18,352
If I thought you could, I would
stop you right here and now.

145
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,191
I know.

146
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,093
How about making a bet with me?

147
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,595
You gamble everything
on me dying.

148
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,998
After all, Tsunade, you
always lose your bets.

149
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,766
Isn't that right?

150
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,234
Promise me.

151
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:38,071
If I do actually manage to make
it back alive-- [laughter] I'm

152
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,606
only kidding, Tsunade.

153
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,142
You know, I'm really
quite grateful to you.

154
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,384
Well, hello there.

155
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,985
I'm Jiraiya.

156
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,054
You can send love letters later.

157
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,689
Nice to meet ya.

158
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,996
-You stupid fool.

159
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,221
-Naruto?

160
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,196
I heard what happened
to Master Jiraiya.

161
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:53,841
-All I ever wanted was to have
him keep watching over me.

162
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:58,579
I wanted him to see
me become Hokage.

163
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,282
But I only showed him the
worst, most uncool side of me.

164
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,353
I'm still so--

165
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,821
-Listen to me.

166
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,990
All Jiraiya ever had
was praise for you.

167
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,125
he always boasted about you.

168
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,329
He kept saying that you were
like his own grandchild.

169
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,597
It's true.

170
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,666
He had faith that you were the
one who you'd inherit his will.

171
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,303
And he truly believed that you
would become a wonderful Hokage

172
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,305
one day.

173
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,710
He's still watching,
and he always will be.

174
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,111
Even at this very minute.

175
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,983
No matter where he is,
I know that he wouldn't

176
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,219
be happy to see you
this upset and sad.

177
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:45,459
Naruto, just go back to being
the you he praised so highly.

178
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,061
Cheer up.

179
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,831
For you are a distinguished
student of one

180
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,067
of the legendary Sannin.

181
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,470
Acknowledged by the
great Jiraiya himself.

182
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,350
NARUTO: Thanks, Iruka-sensei.

183
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,140
-So, how's it going?

184
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,543
-Well, I checked it and
double checked it again.

185
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,479
This is definitely not a
code from the Hidden Leaf.

186
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:43,183
It doesn't correspond to
any of our algorithms.

187
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,118
But considering
that Jiraiya wrote

188
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,553
this in his final
moments, I wouldn't

189
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,455
think he could come
up with a code that's

190
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,157
too terribly complex.

191
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,925
It's a string of
numbers, so it has

192
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,228
to be a shared key encryption.

193
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,297
-I see, but can you decode it?

194
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,498
-Ahem.

195
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,666
-Hm?

196
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,536
-Frankly, without the key,
it's impossible to decipher

197
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,805
the code.

198
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,273
-The key?

199
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,508
-Yes.

200
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,309
Basically, without knowing the
rules that govern this code,

201
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,245
we simply can't decrypt it.

202
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,480
Unless we can find something
from Jiraiya's life that

203
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,416
could be the key, I doubt
we'll ever crack the code.

204
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,353
-So then, where do you
suggest we start looking?

205
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,288
-I wouldn't know
how, I'm afraid.

206
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,524
But perhaps someone
that was close to him

207
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,958
would recognize it.

208
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,394
Perhaps they would know the key.

209
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,230
-But, given the
circumstances of his death,

210
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,165
he could have come up
with this encryption

211
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,536
hastily, to prevent the enemy
from discerning his message.

212
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,038
We can be sure of nothing.

213
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,641
Consider who he could have
meant the message for,

214
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,142
and go and ask them.

215
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,179
Perhaps then you'll
find some clues.

216
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,982
-Well, that would
be Lady Tsunade.

217
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,716
Or Kakashi-sensei.

218
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,655
[yawn]

219
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,657
-Well, thank you very much.

220
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,326
If I find out anything,
I'll come right back.

221
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:07,634
-Sure, but I'll be home in bad,
so just come by the house, OK?

222
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,838
I'm heading home to sleep.

223
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,172
What about you, Shiho?

224
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:18,145
-Oh, well, uh, somebody's
gotta stay behind, right?

225
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:25,219
KAKASHI: 9, 31, 8,
106, 7, 2017, 15.

226
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,721
-Does anything come
to mind at all?

227
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,223
Did any of these
numbers ever come up

228
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,625
in a conversation with
Jiraiya that you can recall?

229
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:36,430
-Hm?

230
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,334
-This one.

231
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:47,407
106.

232
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,076
Master Jiraiya?

233
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,446
-It's easily 106.

234
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,313
-What is?

235
00:16:58,652 --> 00:16:59,353
-106 centimeters.

236
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,092
-No.

237
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,194
That's not it.

238
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,128
-Huh?

239
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,630
-Nothing's coming to me.

240
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:13,233
Why don't you try Lady
Tsunade or Naruto next?

241
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:18,038
-I already asked Lady
Tsunade about it.

242
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,974
Well, I guess that
leaves Naruto.

243
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:25,078
-Aside from the code, I'm
also worried about him.

244
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,415
Do what you can to cheer him up.

245
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,283
-I will.

246
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:32,619
But don't get your
hopes up too high.

247
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:33,987
[doorbell]

248
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,260
[doorbell]

249
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,361
-Terrific.

250
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,129
He's not home.

251
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,740
-Hey, Shikamaru.

252
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:54,441
What's up?

253
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,276
What do you want?

254
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,314
-Well, for starters, how
about letting me come in?

255
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,286
Do these numbers
mean anything to you?

256
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,259
Hey.

257
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,227
Naruto.

258
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,561
You still with me, or what?

259
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,232
Naruto!

260
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:21,602
-Oh, right.

261
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:22,703
Sorry.

262
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:26,707
So, uh, what'd you say?

263
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,474
-All right.

264
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,475
You're coming with me.

265
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,377
Let's go.

266
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,445
-To where?

267
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,780
-Just come on.

268
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:34,281
NARUTO: What?

269
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,057
Why did you bring me here?

270
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:47,327
-Just wait.

271
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,896
There she is.

272
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:49,363
-Huh?

273
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,569
Huh?

274
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,870
Kurenai-sensei?

275
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,205
-That's right.

276
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,140
-Were you hospitalized for
eating too much barbecue?

277
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,042
Your stomach's
bigger than Choji's!

278
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,245
-She's pregnant, not overweight.

279
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,313
Oh, boy.

280
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,550
You're still just as
obnoxious as you ever were.

281
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,186
-So, then, you mean she's--

282
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:16,757
-Shikamaru, you know, you
don't have to come every time.

283
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,491
-Sorry.

284
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,126
No can do.

285
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,595
Asuma made me promise him.

286
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,238
-Shikamaru, what did
Asuma-sensei ask you to do?

287
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,208
-Their child will be my student.

288
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,008
-Huh?

289
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,810
-I'm being serious.

290
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,212
He entrusted me with that.

291
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,321
I heard about Master Jiraiya.

292
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,459
Having lost my
teacher just like you,

293
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:57,564
I understand exactly what
you're going through right now.

294
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:02,302
But whining and sulking
won't make things better.

295
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:06,673
Face it, both of us are way
past that point in our lives.

296
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,610
-What do you mean?

297
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:13,146
-Asuma-sensei imparted a
lot of knowledge to me.

298
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,083
Some lessons were
important, some not so much.

299
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,218
It didn't matter.

300
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,354
The same for you, right?

301
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:25,092
An infinite number
of priceless things.

302
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,295
So I think it's time
for us to step up.

303
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,063
-How so?

304
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:35,102
-To stop being students,
and become teachers.

305
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:39,439
It's going to be a drag, but
we can't keep complaining.

306
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,476
Eventually, you'll be the
one paying for the ramen,

307
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,114
and someone will be
calling you Naruto-sensei.

308
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,984
After all, we can't
stay brats forever.

309
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,187
Not if we want to
become cool shinobi.

310
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,456
Like the type of shinobi that
Asuma and Jiraiya both were.

311
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,837
-You're right.

312
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,207
Shikamaru, thank you.

313
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,709
-So pull yourself
together, 'cause

314
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:19,780
you've got some work to do.

315
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:20,480
-All right.

318

NARRATOR: Comrades move to
decode the message left behind.

319
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:07,020
Entrusted to Naruto, what is
the key to Jiraiya's encryption?

320
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,156
Shikamaru's intellect
and Shiho's experience

321
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,225
will lead them to
a clear answer,

322
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:16,163
and at last the hidden
mystery will be revealed.

323
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:20,367
Next time on Narruto
Shippuden, Decryption.

324
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,204
What was Master Jiraiya
trying to tell us?
