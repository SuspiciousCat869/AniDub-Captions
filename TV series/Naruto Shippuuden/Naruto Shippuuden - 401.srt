Huh...?!

23
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:54,392
{\an1}You see, it's all because of
you that I can be a shinobi.

24
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,560
{\an1}Back then, Lord Gaara
said to me...

25
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:03,666
{\an1}I've met someone like you. He's
a shinobi from the Village
Hidden in the Leaves.

26
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,003
{\an1}Through sheer perseverance, he
has become a fine shinobi.

27
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:14,509
{\an1}And Shira...I think you'll be as
splendid a shinobi as he is.

28
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:21,915
{\an1}It might've been your fists
that changed Lord Gaara.

29
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:24,418
{\an1}Not true! That
was not my doing.

{\an1}[grunt] Instead, it was
your perseverance that
moved Lord Gaara.

Yes, well said!

{\an1}That is the creed of those
dedicated to taijutsu!

34
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,733
They really seem
to be enjoying this.

35
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:46,870
{\an1}Maybe Lee has finally
met someone he can
consider a true rival.

36
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:50,440
{\an1}You can only go so
far training alone.

37
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:53,676
{\an1}But to surpass your limits,
you need...a rival.

38
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,079
Oh...? Do you have
a rival, Neji?

39
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:01,216
My rival...?

40
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,886
{\an1}It may be the Hyuga way to cave
in to destiny, it's not mine!

41
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,756
{\an1}If you think it's futile to
fight, then don't! Just
stand there and take it!

42
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,159
{\an1}I'll change the way
of the Hyuga clan...
After I become Hokage!

43
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,529
{\an7}<i>You're the only one</i>

45
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:26,505
{\an1}Neither of them has
delivered a decisive blow.

46
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,373
{\an1}They're just sizing each
other up right now.

47
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,944
{\an1}Huh? They're not fighting at
their full potential?!

48

<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>More like fifty percent.</i>

49
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,582
{\an1}But how much can a body endure?
If they stay evenly matched...

50
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:42,184
{\an1}No...They are not quite equal.

51
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,687
Huh? What do you
mean, they aren't?

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,591
{\an1}They're equal in speed
and in the number of
moves that they possess...

53
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:52,093
{\an1}...But Shira's physique is
much bigger than Lee's.

54
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:56,431
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>In boxing, weight influences</i>

<i>but with Lee's smaller build.</i>

56
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,269
So Lee's sustaining
more damage?

57
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:06,272
{\an1}I'd say that he should
be feeling the effects
very soon...

58
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:10,643
{\an7}<i>Blow for blow, Shira's punches</i>

Lee...!

61
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,529
{\an1}The stance he's in...

62
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,964
{\an1}Don't tell me Lee
plans to use the Lotus!

63
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,265
It's too risky!

64
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:39,201
{\an1}But he is an opponent who
is worth that risk!

totally silent!

83
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:05,910

we've honed all our 5 senses...

{\an1}He's right again!

149
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,772

making it happen!

150
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,778
[panting]

151
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:01,814
{\an1}That is amazing, Guy Sensei!
So what is your trick?

152
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,784
{\an1}It isn't a trick. I simply made
you move the way that I wanted
you to.

153
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,719
{\an1}That's it. There
is no more.

154
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,022
{\an1}You made me move...?!

155
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:14,992
{\an1}That's right! I just used
counters that forced you into
making certain moves.

156
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,095
{\an1}In battle, there's a sequence to
techniques and jutsu.

157
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,732
{\an1}When you control that flow,
predicting what comes next
isn't hard at all.

158
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:25,901
{\an1}Just now, I controlled the
flow of my opponent,

159
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:30,139
{\an1}who though more physically fit
than me, lost steam before I
did!

160
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:34,576
{\an1}It is true! Guy Sensei, you
are not even breathing hard!

161
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,477
{\an1}By controlling the flow
of our battle,

162
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,881
{\an1}I was able to deplete your
stamina while preserving my
energy.

163
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:44,483
{\an1}There aren't many chances to
take down a foe in the midst
of battle.

164
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:48,988
{\an1}All attack strategies are
just attempts to create
such a chance!

165
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:52,490
{\an1}And that's what I meant
by using your head!

remembered that training

00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,791
{\an1}It's a taijutsu breathing
method Shira invented himself.

192
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:51,962
{\an1}He inhales large amounts of
oxygen to invigorate his whole

technique, his lung capacity
increases by nearly four times!

194

{\an1}So it's his version of the
Eight Inner Gates, huh?

195

{\an1}No way. He thought of
that on his own?!

00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,941
Those two really
drive home the fact...

have trained under
Guy Sensei, too.

219
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,639
{\an1}Shira, why did you
release my Chakra Points?

220
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,075
{\an1}So you noticed?

221
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:07,179

could give one hundred percent.

You were too reckless!

{\an1}Shira. I want you to have this.

227
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,864
{\an1}Guy Sensei gave it to me long
ago. This is what helped me

breathability and wicking
properties,

229
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:36,070

You will definitely feel a
difference!

230
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:37,972
{\an1}And you will love it
immediately!

{\an1}Thank you, Lee. I accept it.

233
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:48,515
{\an1}Shira, you said earlier that
this would be your last fight.

234
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:53,419
{\an1}Over in the Land of Wind,
there's a battalion that guards
the northern border.

235
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:58,857
{\an1}That battalion never leaves its
station. The environment there
is extremely harsh,

236
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,127
{\an1}so there are hardly any
candidates for the position.

237
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,029
{\an1}It's my intention to go
and volunteer for it if
I pass these Exams.

you around either, Yome.
