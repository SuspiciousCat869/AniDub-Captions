00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,000
{\an1}You wanna go?

151
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,335
{\an1}Cut it out!

152
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,774
{\an1}Hey, what'd you hit me for?

153
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,577
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) Because you were rude</i>
<i>to Lord Hokage!</i>

154
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:21,649
{\an1}Seriously, it's so peaceful,
thanks to you.

155
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:26,822
{\an1}Not quite. It's thanks to
everyone who worked hard
for the sake of the village.

156
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,925
{\an1}It'd be nice to tell
Rin about it someday...

157
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,560
{\an3}Yeah.

158
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,603
{\an1}<i>(Obito) Imagining the village,</i>
<i>comrades, and me as Hokage...</i>

159
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:47,344
{\an1}<i>Even after all that's happened,</i>
<i>just the thought of it seems to</i>
<i>fill up the hole in my heart.</i>

160
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,782
{\an1}[chuckles]

161
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:56,956
{\an1}Is it because I'm dying? I find
myself rambling all of a sudden.

162
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:02,763
{\an1}[grunts]

163
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:11,005
{\an1}<i>(Rin) Don't act tough and hide</i>
<i>your wounds.</i>

164
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:14,076
{\an1}I'm always watching, you know.

165
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:18,447
You promised me you'd
become Hokage, Obito.

166
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:25,955
{\an1}Listen, I want to stop this war,
too. Just like you. I truly want
to save the world!

167
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:31,762
{\an1}And that's why I've decided I'm
gonna stick by your side and
watch over you!

168
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:39,938
{\an1}You told me that saving you was
pretty much the same as saving
the whole world, remember?

169
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,406
[gasps]

170
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,647
[crying]

171
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:53,352
{\an1}Well then, since I'm keeping an
eye on you, you can't hide
anything from me anymore.

172
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,290
[crying] Mhm.

173
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,927
{\an1}Go for it, Obito!

174
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:03,765
{\an1}Become Hokage, and show me just
how you're gonna save the
whole world!

175
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,267
{\an1}And that's another promise for
you to keep.

176
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:08,804
Let's go!

177
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:22,553
{\an1}A lot more suffering
likely awaits you, Naruto.

178
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:29,528
{\an1}However, just keep on forging
ahead like always, without
changing.

179
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,331
{\an1}<i>(Obito) You once told me...</i>

180
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:38,004
{\an1}<i>That never going back on your</i>
<i>word, is your Ninja Way, right?</i>

181
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,707
Yeah.

182
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,420
Naruto...

183
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:58,761
{\an1}You better...become the Hokage!

184
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,232
I will!

185
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:39,808
[gasps]

186
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,085
[chuckle]

187
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,820
Hmm?

188
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:56,827
{\an1}<i>(Real Zetsu) That pesky traitor</i>
<i>vermin's finally dead, huh?</i>

189
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:03,702
{\an1}Though as insects go, his
persistence was like a roach's!
[laughing]

190
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,538
{\an1}Don't laugh at Obito!

191
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,243
Naruto...

192
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,812
Naruto.

193
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,187
{\an1}If you keep resisting, you're
only going to end up pitifully
crumbling to dust...

194
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,955
just like him!

195
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,857
As someone who tried
to become Hokage...

196
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,059
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Obito is...</i>

197
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:27,562
[gasps]

198
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:30,232
{\an1}Nothing but awesome to me!

199
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,167
[gasps]

200
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:37,974
{\an3}Rin!

201
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,342
{\an1}I've been waiting.

202
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:43,314
{\an1}Really? Sorry about that.

203
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,783
{\an1}It seems you got lost
along the way.

204
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,518
{\an3}Yeah.

205
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:50,688
Lots happened before
I could come here.

206
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,396
Rin, I...

207
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,632
{\an1}Didn't keep my promise.

208
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,734
[disagreeing]

209
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,903
{\an1}I'd say you did your best.

210
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,005
Huh?

211
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:06,206
{\an1}<i>(Rin) I've been...</i>

212
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,643
{\an1}...watching you. All along.

213
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,687
Let's go!

214
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,093
[crying]

215
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:01,738
{\an1}<i>(Rin) Come on, Obito.</i>

216
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,443
{\an1}<i>(Obito) Rin, do you mind waiting</i>
<i>just a little longer?</i>

217
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,709
<i>(Rin) Obito?</i>

218
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,612
{\an1}<i>(Obito) Just a bit before we</i>
<i>move on.</i>

219
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:13,351
{\an1}<i>You see, I'd kinda like to make</i>
<i>one more detour along the way...</i>

220
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:16,321
{\an1}<i>(Rin) [chuckling] Who do you</i>
<i>want to save this time?</i>

221
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:21,561
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Sharingan</i>
<i>Revived."</i>

222
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:23,763
{\an1}<i>(Rin) I'll be waiting, here.</i>
