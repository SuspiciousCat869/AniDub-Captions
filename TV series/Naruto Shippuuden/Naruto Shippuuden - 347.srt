1
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,659
{\an1}[lascivious chuckle]

2
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:57,427
Jiraiya Sensei?

3
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,796
Hm? Yes, what
is it, Kakashi?

4
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,899
{\an1}There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

5
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,969
{\an1}Is it urgent? 'Cause I'm
kind of busy right now.

6
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:07,406
[sigh]

7
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,175
{\an1}[disapproving sigh] There
you go again. Must you

8
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,111
always sound so
dejected, Kakashi?

9
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,481
{\an1}Sure, some things may be
difficult, but when you make

10
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,750
{\an1}everything seem like a
drag, you make the people

11
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,153
around you
uncomfortable!

12
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,456
{\an1}I'm sorry to have
bothered you...

13
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,226
{\an1}Ah! Wait, wait, wait.
You're already here!

14
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,061
Just, you know
speak your mind!

15
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,262
But...

16
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:30,798
{\an1}I don't want to interrupt
all your important business...

17
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,034
{\an1}You know, on second
thought, there's nothing

18
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,070
{\an1}more important than
students like you.

19
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,006
{\an1}Besides, I know you...

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,543
{\an1}You haven't spoken to
anyone today, have you?

21
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,846
{\an1}You know, people really
should talk to other people

22
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,583
{\an1}every day, even if
it's just small talk.

23
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:49,820
{\an1}Otherwise, their hearts
grow dark and sullen.

24
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,457
{\an1}Talking to others builds
bonds of friendship and

25
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,758
{\an1}camaraderie! It broadens
the mind! And it

26
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,429
makes you feel
grateful to be alive!

27
00:02:57,463 --> 00:03:00,566
{\an1}That's the kind of
creatures we humans are!

28
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,469
{\an1}So, what's going on?

29
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,472
Well...

30
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,508
{\an1}I wanted to talk to you
about the three children

31
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,210
{\an1}from the Hidden Rain
that you taught in the

32
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,513
{\an1}past, Jiraiya Sensei.

33
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:13,813
Oh?

34
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:17,753
You mean Yahiko,
Nagato, and Konan.

35
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,153
Yes.

36
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:21,657
{\an1}Recently, they've been
trying to bring about change

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,125
{\an1}in the Hidden Rain Village.

38
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,993
{\an1}Or so I've heard.

39
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,597
{\an1}And they're doing so not
through military might but

40
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,366
{\an1}instead through discussion.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,534
Really?

42
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,924
{\an1}Those three, huh?

43
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:55,796
{\an1}I see. So they've started to
stand on their own feet,

44
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,397
then, have they?

45
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,599
How would you
describe them?

46
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:00,866
Huh?

47
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:05,406
{\an1}<i>[chuckle] He's curious</i>
<i>about others...</i>

48
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,108
{\an1}<i>Now that's a good sign!</i>

49
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:10,945
Well, Yahiko is
passionate.

50
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,548
He's driven to
achieve his goals.

51
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,384
{\an1}And he's completely single-
minded about them.

52
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:20,189
{\an1}I'm going to get real
strong, I swear! And then...

53
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,960
{\an1}I'm going to change
the entire world!

54
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,931
{\an1}Konan is a girl who never
shows her emotions. She

55
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,568
{\an1}always plays things
close to the vest.

56
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,739
{\an1}But she was talented.
And very pretty!

57
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:36,040
{\an1}She must've grown up
into a real beauty.

58
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,711
{\an1}Now as for Nagato.

59
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,456
[groaning]

60
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,990
What happened?!

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,892
{\an1}It- It was him...

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,329
{\an1}A renegade shinobi
attacked us!

63
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,700
{\an1}He told us to hand over
our food and our valuables.

64
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,435
And then Nagato!

65
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,378
[sobbing]

66
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:12,148
{\an1}Nagato. What's bothering
you? Talk to me.

67
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:15,852
Sensei...

68
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:19,524
I'm scared...

69
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,994
...of myself.
What I did...

70
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,664
It was wrong! I
know it was wrong!

71
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,634
{\an1}I don't know. I can't
really say whether what

72
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,904
{\an1}you did was right
or was wrong.

73
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,972
{\an1}But still, thanks to your
actions Yahiko is still

74
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:37,009
alive. You saved
your friend.

75
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,479
{\an1}So I believe that's always
the right thing to do.

76
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,250
{\an1}No one can fault you for
helping a friend when

77
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,585
they're in need.

78
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,254
{\an1}Once you've been hurt,
you learn to hate.

79
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,425
{\an1}But if you hurt another,
you become hated.

80
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,727
And you shoulder
a sense of guilt.

81
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,530
{\an1}However, it's from
understanding such

82
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,066
{\an1}pain that generosity
toward others becomes

83
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,635
second nature.

84
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,873
{\an1}And that, that is what
makes us truly human.

85
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:05,375
It's a process
called growing up.

86
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:08,078
{\an1}Experiencing pain
helps us to mature.

87
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,114
{\an1}It's about being able
to think, and make

88
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:12,417
{\an1}your own decisions.

89
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:18,256
{\an1}All I want to do is protect
those two. No matter what

90
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,059
{\an1}kind of pain I may
be forced to endure.

91
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:24,831
I understand...

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,868
{\an1}Tell me, Sensei...

93
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,437
{\an1}What are you always
thinking about?

94
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,205
What has you so
preoccupied?

95
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,676
{\an1}There's so much war
and hatred in this world.

96
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,946
{\an1}Sometimes it seems
like they're the only

97
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,181
{\an1}things that really exist.

98
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,316
I want to do
something about it.

99
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,588
{\an1}And I'd really like to
know what the answer

100
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,057
{\an1}to finding true peace is...

101
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,431
Jiraiya Sensei?

102
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,501
Hm? Oh!

103
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,003
{\an1}Is something wrong?

104
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:04,074
{\an1}About Nagato, he's a
young man who I believe

105
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,945
{\an1}could have been a hero
in one of my novels.

106
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,514
{\an1}A hero in your novels?

107
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,150
{\an1}As long as I still remain
alive, then there's at least

108
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,988
{\an1}a chance that I'll get
to see him again...

109
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,024
Kakashi!

110
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,091
{\an1}Hurry up already and become
the kind of man who can be a

111
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,194
{\an1}hero in my novels, would ya?

112
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,363
{\an1}[exasperated sigh]

113
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,006
{\an1}Brother, a whole lot of
requests have come in for us

114
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,043
{\an1}lately. I don't know if we
can fulfill all of them!

115
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,645
{\an1}We will! If there are
people in need, then

116
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,948
{\an1}we'll save them all.

117
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:40,750
{\an1}That's the entire
purpose of the Akatsuki.

118
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:43,353
{\an1}It would be nice if
we had an organization

119
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,221
{\an1}as big as Hanzo's,
though...

120
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,958
Hanzo is setting
an example for the

121
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,694
{\an1}rest of us shinobi... by
fighting to try to bring

122
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,696
{\an1}peace to this world.

123
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,833
{\an1}We will prove that one day
the Akatsuki will surpass

124
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,602
{\an1}him in that quest!

125
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,842
Akatsuki?

126
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,412
{\an1}Yes, I've heard rumors going
around about them lately.

127
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,514
{\an1}The shinobi in our
village like them...

128
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,553
{\an1}I approve of a group that
resolves issues through

129
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,888
{\an1}nonviolent means. It
will help me realize

130
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:18,125
{\an1}my dream of uniting the
Five Nations without force.

131
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:21,496
{\an1}But they have appeared
rather suddenly...

132
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,799
Is there someone
behind them?

133
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,469
{\an1}According to rumors,
they're pupils of Jiraiya

134
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:27,870
{\an1}of the Hidden Leaf.

135
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:31,340
{\an1}Jiraiya?! You mean one
of the Leaf's Sannin?!

136
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,978
{\an1}Yes. After he fought you,
Master Hanzo, Jiraiya

137
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,180
{\an1}stayed in this area for
three years, teaching

138
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:39,316
{\an1}ninjutsu to war orphans.

139
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:49,662
{\an1}So they're the apprentices
of that brat! [chuckle]

140
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,464
{\an1}The compassion to help
others. The Akatsuki just

141
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,102
{\an1}might be the repayment of a
favor that's finally arrived.

142
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,980
{\an1}Brother Yahiko, listen. The
word is that the villages

143
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,183
{\an1}along the border are being
attacked a lot recently.

144
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,652
{\an1}What's it all about?

145
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:13,055
{\an1}Well, it's hard to tell for
sure since they're mostly in

146
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:15,524
remote locations
with little contact.

147
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:17,660
{\an1}But it seems the border
with the Land of Earth

148
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,395
is in a bad way.

149
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,030
{\an1}That's the Seventh Ward...

150
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,266
Let's check it
out, Nagato, Konan.

151
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,200
Okay.

152
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,903
{\an1}Kyusuke, Daibutsu...

153
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,738
Keep an eye
on things here.

154
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,006
{\an1}Sure, you got it.

155
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,574
{\an1}Leave it to us, Brother!

156
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:37,515
How terrible...

157
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:39,785
Who would do
something like this?

158
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:42,888
{\an1}This is far worse than
anything we've ever

159
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,390
handled before.

160
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,694
Who's there?!
Show yourself!

161
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,406
Who are you?
Tell me now!

162
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,209
The Akatsuki.

163
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,777
Akatsuki?

164
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,880
{\an1}You three look like
Hidden Rain shinobi...

165
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,482
We're part of an
organization that's

166
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:09,052
working to bring
peace to this village.

167
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,087
{\an1}We heard this area was under
attack, so we came to

168
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,556
{\an1}investigate. Who did this?

169
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,824
{\an1}Can we trust them?

170
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,294
{\an1}The Hidden Stone.

171
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,463
{\an1}The Hidden Stone?!

172
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,564
It can't be!

173
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:23,367
{\an1}But I had heard that
the Stone and the Leaf

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,203
{\an1}have been negotiating
a cease-fire.

175
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,805
{\an1}How the hell should I know!

176
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:29,976
{\an1}Look at this village! The
Hidden Stone has completely

177
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,779
{\an1}ravaged this entire area!

178
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,215
{\an1}What do you plan to do
with those weapons?

179
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,484
{\an1}We're going to fight of
course! What else is there?!

180
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,221
{\an1}We've already formed an
alliance to gain strength!

181
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:44,725
{\an1}No, wait! That's only going
to cause more casualties!

182
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:47,061
{\an1}Then what do you expect us
to do? Are you saying that

183
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:50,365
{\an1}we should just sit here and
wait for our turn to die?!

184
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:53,035
{\an1}We'll go to the Hidden
Stone and talk to them!

185
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,703
{\an1}[gasp] You'll what?!

186
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,106
{\an1}If we acknowledge their pain
and suffering, we can speak

187
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,441
{\an1}honestly, and I'm sure
they'll understand!

188
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,377
{\an1}Enough with your ideals!

189
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,846
{\an1}What about getting
even for our friends

190
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,181
{\an1}who were killed?!

191
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,486
{\an1}One finds the true world
only after knowing another's

192
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,691
{\an1}pain and shedding
tears alongside them.

193
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:19,131
{\an1}Shedding tears alongside
them? You mean in revenge?

194
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,767
No. I don't mean
that at all.

195
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,937
{\an1}In mutual understanding.

196
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,739
Stop talking so
idealistically.

197
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,576
No such thing
exists in this world.

198
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:31,846
{\an1}What is going on?!

199
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:34,582
{\an1}If this continues, the
tenuous peace between

200
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,284
{\an1}the Stone and Leaf
will be shattered!

201
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:39,921
{\an1}Maybe there's some kind
of schism in the Stone.

202
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,390
{\an1}Perhaps the leaders are
trying to pursue peace, but

203
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,726
{\an1}the shinobi under
them don't want it.

204
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,798
{\an1}It's also possible it's the
work of Rogue Ninja.

205
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:52,336
{\an1}Whatever the case may be,
we must settle this quickly!

206
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:55,873
Scatter!

207
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,575
[gasp] What?!

208
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,382
{\an1}They were waiting for
us! It's an ambush!

209
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,087
{\an1}Wait! You're Hidden
Stone Shinobi, right?

210
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,089
{\an1}We're the Akatsuki!

211
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,259
{\an1}We're shinobi from
the Hidden Rain!

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,593
We've only come
here to talk!

213
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,832
Damn it! They
refuse to negotiate!

214
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,734
{\an1}What do we do, Yahiko?

215
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,237
{\an1}Our goal is negotiation
at all costs!

216
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,872
{\an1}Whatever happens,
do not kill them!

217
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,910
[gasp]

218
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,617
{\an1}This can't be happening!

219
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:36,919
Yahiko!

220
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:41,824
Yahiko!

221
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,459
Konan, no!

222
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,258
Who's there?!

223
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,162
[attacking yell]

224
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,196
Damn! Enemies?!

225
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,298
{\an1}Run, now; get out of here!

226
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,534
Nagato! Go!

227
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,512
{\an1}Nagato... Hurry... Run!

228
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,823
{\an1}Run, Nagato! Run and
don't look back! Hurry!

229
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,225
[groan]

230
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:51,070
[crying]

231
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,707
[angry roar]

232
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,513
[roaring]

233
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:06,955
[roaring]

234
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,056
Nagato!

235
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:09,357
No, Nagato!

236
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:10,892
Stop!

237
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,861
Stop it, Nagato!

238
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:15,630
Yahiko, what-?!

239
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,005
{\an1}We'll retreat for now!

240
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:33,217
{\an1}So that was the power of
the Rinnegan, was it?

241
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,188
{\an1}Quite a frightening
power. So what now?

242
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,259
{\an1}If the Akatsuki discover
our other teams disguised as

243
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,762
{\an1}Stone shinobi, the plan
will be in danger.

244
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:47,434
{\an1}To ensure the future of the
Leaf, peace must not exist

245
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,768
{\an1}with the Hidden Stone.

246
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,405
{\an1}This strategy was put into
action precisely to prevent

247
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,674
such a peace
from transpiring.

248
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:57,011
{\an1}But perhaps we can
use that power...

249
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,048
{\an1}Gather up all of these
corpses! Eliminate any

250
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,485
{\an1}traces that the Hidden
Leaf was ever here!

251
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,318
Sir!

252
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:07,256
Danzo, eh?

253
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,860
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf's working
behind the scenes...

254
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,167
Nagato...

255
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:18,869
Yahiko...

256
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:21,272
{\an1}The jutsu Nagato used...

257
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,809
{\an1}He can probably perform it
because he has the Rinnegan.

258
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:26,277
But that's...

259
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,646
{\an1}I know; I felt it, too.

260
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,915
{\an1}Just like that time...

261
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,894
{\an1}That desire to kill made
my hair stand on end.

262
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,431
{\an1}That power is not
of this world.

263
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,367
We must not let
Nagato use it!

264
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:50,938
{\an1}For if he does, I believe
that it will kill him...

265
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,465
{\an1}Konan, where's Yahiko?

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,468
{\an1}He went to look for food.

267
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:17,903
I see...

268
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:21,140
{\an1}What's the matter?

269
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,045
{\an1}I'm really scared...
of my power.

270
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:28,748
Nagato...

271
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:32,753
Back then, I had
Jiraiya Sensei.

272
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,956
{\an1}I'm positive that the main
reason he taught me ninjutsu

273
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,661
{\an1}is so that I could learn
to control this power.

274
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:43,065
{\an1}But now, Jiraiya Sensei's
no longer here...

275
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:47,002
{\an1}Yes, that's true.
Jiraiya Sensei is gone...

276
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:47,937
But...

277
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,408
You have Yahiko
and me here.

278
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,679
{\an1}And we'll help you to
control your power.

279
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,680
Always.

280
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,316
Konan...

281
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,037
{\an1}Yahiko, please be careful.

282
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,907
{\an1}I don't need to have a
send-off. Just go and tend

283
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,645
{\an1}to Nagato's wounds instead.

284
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:28,083
{\an1}From now on, you should save
all your worrying for him.

285
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,952
{\an1}He's the keystone
of the Akatsuki!

286
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:35,291
{\an1}He's the man who will change
this nation and this world!

287
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,660
But the same can
be said of you...

288
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,929
{\an1}Every one of us is here
because we respect and

289
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:42,865
admire you...
Nagato included!

290
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:48,171
{\an1}But Nagato is someone
who will be the bridge

291
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,973
{\an1}that leads to peace.

292
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,480
{\an1}My role is to make that
happen. I am a pillar that

293
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,315
{\an1}will support that bridge.

294
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,351
Yahiko...

295
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:05,058
{\an1}As usual, this land
continues to weep.

296
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:07,494
It endures pain.

297
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,199
{\an1}I used to hate this land
that's crying all the time.

298
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:14,735
{\an1}But now, I want to save it.

299
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:17,805
It's what I want
with all my heart.

300
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,410
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

301
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,714
{\an1}It's like the crybaby I
was. I can't ignore it.

302
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,483
Yahiko!

303
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,121
{\an1}Please, be careful...

304
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,858
{\an1}It's Yahiko who'll be
the bridge to peace.

305
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,797
{\an1}That is, his will
itself will be.

306
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:41,800
Nagato...

307
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,536
{\an1}We believe in Yahiko
with all our heart!

308
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,271
{\an1}Let's go, everyone!

309
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:47,606
Right!

310
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,022
{\an1}How did this happen?

311
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:06,160
It was too late
when we found them.

312
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,263
{\an1}We were on the way to a
peace conference with the

313
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:11,767
{\an1}Land of Earth. But we
recognized these

314
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,703
{\an1}men as members of
your clan, and...

315
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:18,941
{\an1}Lord Danzo, did you see
who was responsible?

316
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:22,212
I'm sure it was
the Akatsuki.

317
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,549
{\an1}The Akatsuki?! But
the Akatsuki is...

318
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,052
{\an1}They're a group that
expounds peace and has been

319
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,822
{\an1}growing in influence in
this village as of late.

320
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:33,792
{\an1}Yes, I know that! I had
heard that they are an

321
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:37,996
{\an1}organization that
shares my goals! So why?

322
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:40,700
{\an1}Lord Hanzo, it appears that
you have left them on their

323
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,335
{\an1}own for too long.

324
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,403
What?!

325
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,374
{\an1}It's all fine and good if
you choose to be idealistic.

326
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:50,778
{\an1}However, it's therein
that your weakness lies.

327
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,212
My weakness?!

328
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:55,983
{\an1}It's because you possess
such high ideals, you're

329
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:58,720
{\an1}blind to those who say
they feel the same.

330
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:01,791
{\an1}However, they have turned
against you and have now

331
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:03,826
{\an1}become the enemy,
and that is the root

332
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,128
cause behind
this tragedy.

333
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:09,433
{\an1}No matter how noble your
ideals, not everyone will be

334
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:11,334
{\an1}willing to support them.

335
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,271
{\an1}The Akatsuki may have acted
like they share your goals,

336
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:17,007
{\an1}but they're just a
disorderly mob.

337
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,677
{\an1}And ultimately, any mob
will become obsessed by

338
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,815
{\an1}greed and power and spread
evil across the land.

339
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,249
{\an1}Cast off the Akatsuki's
sheep's clothing and you'll

340
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,520
{\an1}find they're just wolves
out to take over the village.

341
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,422
Lord Hanzo...

342
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,695
{\an1}If nothing is done about
them soon, they will take

343
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,230
{\an1}over this village.

344
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:44,706
{\an1}Danzo of the Leaf?

345
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,876
{\an1}Interesting that he
has gotten involved...

346
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:52,180
{\an1}Just like Obito said, the
clouds are moving strangely.

347
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:55,718
{\an1}There is no such thing
as peace in this world.

348
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,386
That is reality.

349
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,923
{\an1}And reality is like
this grand river.

350
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:03,794
{\an1}No matter how hard one tries
to stop it, reality will swallow

351
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:08,131
{\an1}them up whole and
mercilessly crush them.

352
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:12,035
{\an1}There is but one way to
escape that suffering.

353
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,472
Through the
Infinite Tsukuyomi,

354
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,376
{\an1}Project Tsuki no Me!

355
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:01,126
{\an1}<i>Nagato, reality is moving</i>
<i>forward quickly. The time</i>

356
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,496
<i>has come to join</i>
<i>me. What Yahiko</i>

357
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,299
<i>proposes are</i>
<i>just naïve ideals.</i>

358
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:10,304
{\an1}<i>No matter what you say, I</i>
<i>believe in Yahiko's ideals!</i>

359
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:13,808
{\an1}<i>Though you possess the</i>
<i>Rinnegan, you still think</i>

360
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,844
{\an1}<i>like an ordinary man.</i>

361
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:19,982
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The New</i>
<i>Akatsuki."</i>

362
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:24,285
{\an1}<i>Very well, then. Go witness</i>
<i>reality for yourself!</i>
