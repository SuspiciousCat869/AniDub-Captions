1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,847
-What's that?

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,914
{\an1}What the hell's going on?

3
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,649
{\an1}-Naruto is down there fighting
Pain right at this very moment.

4
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:20,716
-He's what?

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,216
{\an1}-He's fighting Pain?

6
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,751
All by himself?

7
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:24,751
-Yes.

8
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:27,451
{\an1}And he asked that
no one interfere.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,253
{\an1}-Then all we can do
now is have faith.

10
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:31,587
{\an1}And trust Naruto.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,588
[bark]

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,924
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,125
{\an1}-There's no mistaking it.

14
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,291
{\an1}That's definitely Naruto.

15
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:48,761
{\an1}-And he's battling
Pain all by himself?

16
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:49,260
-No.

17
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:50,161
Wait.

18
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:51,328
Lady Hinata!

19
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,496
{\an1}-But Naruto's risking
his life for our village!

20
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,397
{\an1}-If you interfere in
this kind of a battle,

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,765
{\an1}then you're only going
to get in his way.

22
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,464
{\an1}And doing so will put
him at great risk.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,401
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,905
[theme music]

25
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,918
{\an1}-Chief Toad and the others.

26
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,518
{\an1}They were all blown away!

27
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:17,853
{\an1}-Ma, we must launch the
genjutsu right away.

28
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:19,554
{\an1}-Performing the duet
in front of everyone

29
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:21,388
{\an1}is always so embarrassing.

30
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:22,855
{\an1}-Would you quit complaining?

31
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:23,723
Just do it.

32
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:25,789
{\an1}-Yeah, yeah I know.

33
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:29,524
{\an1}-Now, this genjutsu requires an
enormous amount of Sage jutsu

34
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:32,325
{\an1}chakra, so it's going to
take a little bit of time

35
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,727
before the jutsu
really gets going.

36
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,860
-All right.

37
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,828
{\an1}I'm gonna go for that
five second interval,

38
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:41,463
{\an1}so when your chakra is ready,
just start the genjutsu.

39
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,496
-Remember.

40
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,797
{\an1}You only have one
shadow clone left

41
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,932
{\an1}that can make Sage jutsu
chakra for you, Naruto, boy.

42
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:51,800
{\an1}Once he's gone, you can't
use Sage jutsu chakra,

43
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,600
{\an1}since you can't stay
still during a battle

44
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,202
{\an1}to build up more.

45
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,937
{\an1}And your Sage mode will only
last another five minutes.

46
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,804
{\an1}-Using shadow clones to help
you maintain stillness and make

47
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,371
{\an1}Sage jutsu chakra
was a good idea,

48
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,806
{\an1}but why didn't you just make
a bunch more shadow clones?

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,474
{\an1}-It's like trying
to look to the right

50
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,675
and to the left
at the same time.

51
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,009
{\an1}Naruto boy certainly tried, but
manipulating Sage jutsu chakra

52
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:16,643
{\an1}is simply too hard.

53
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:18,477
{\an1}At his current level
of proficiency,

54
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,277
{\an1}two chakra-making shadow
clones was his limit.

55
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,779
{\an1}-And on top of all that, I
can only create up to three

56
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,180
{\an1}more shadow clones
for the battlefield.

57
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,314
{\an1}If I make more than
that here, then the ones

58
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:31,683
{\an1}manipulating Sage jutsu
chakra will get distracted.

59
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,316
-Yes, I see.

60
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,885
{\an1}Well, either way, prolonging
things isn't to our advantage.

61
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,759
-I must say.

62
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,960
{\an1}You're truly strong, Naruto.

63
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,594
{\an1}This is the farthest that
Pain has ever been pushed.

64
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,029
But no more.

65
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:05,629
It's over.

66
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:06,697
Universal Pull.

67
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,534
{\an1}We're going to end
this right now.

68
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,568
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
Forgive us, Naruto boy.

69
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:21,903
{\an1}Just hang in there.

70
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,036
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

71
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:26,905
-Don't worry.

72
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,938
{\an1}I won't kill you.

73
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,606
{\an1}You are a precious Jinchuriki.

74
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:36,175
{\an1}-Did you really think you
could hurt me with this move?

75
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,642
You shouldn't
underestimate Sage mode.

76
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,177
{\an1}And now it's my turn to--

77
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,245
{\an1}-Yes, you're right.

78
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,745
{\an1}Sage mode is troublesome.

79
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,311
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's happening?

80
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,579
{\an1}I'm losing power.

81
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,746
Wait.

82
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,981
I get it.

83
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,447
{\an1}This guy's ability.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,415
{\an1}He's sucking all the Sage
jutsu chakra right out of me.

85
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,220
{\an1}-The Nine Tails has
now been captured.

86
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,089
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
Just a bit longer

87
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,223
{\an1}and we'll be able
to use the genjutsu.

88
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:14,657
{\an1}Hang on, Naruto, boy.

89
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,693
-Not yet.

90
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,393
I'm not done.

91
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,761
{\an1}-You're quite the
stubborn one, aren't you?

92
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,499
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That's it.

93
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:40,600
{\an1}Not being able to move right
now will be just perfect.

94
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,873
-Seems you've
accepted your fate.

95
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,146
{\an1}-I guess you didn't
know about this,

96
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,247
{\an1}but nature energy is
really hard to control.

97
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:26,418
-What is this?

98
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,020
{\an1}FUKSASAKU (VOICEOVER):
That's it.

99
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:31,320
{\an1}That Pain took in too much Sage
jutsu chakra from Naruto boy

100
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:34,088
{\an1}and underwent petrified
frog transformation.

101
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:44,659
{\an1}-Sage jutsu chakra.

102
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,160
{\an1}Seems it comes with its
fair share of risks.

103
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,295
-All right.

104
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,229
{\an1}We're finally down to just you.

105
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,496
{\an1}-Well, unfortunately,
that's not correct.

106
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,696
-Huh?

107
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,597
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

108
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,033
{\an1}KATSUYU: These Pains
are only puppets.

109
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:03,533
{\an1}There is another manipulating
these Pains from the shadows.

110
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,767
The real Pain.

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,801
{\an1}NARUTO: The real Pain?

112
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:11,503
-All right.

113
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,337
We're ready now.

114
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,038
Let's do it, Ma.

115
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:14,571
-Gotcha!

116
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:19,439
-Geezer Sage!

117
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,578
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): I've had
enough of that genjutsu.

118
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,683
INO: Shikamaru!

119
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:44,816
-Ino!

120
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,251
You all right?

121
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,052
-Yeah.

122
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,719
{\an1}Except Lady Shizune.

123
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,352
-What?

124
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,321
{\an1}Does that mean she's--

125
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,323
{\an1}-Dammit, man, does that hurt.

126
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,524
{\an1}I think every single bone
in my body's been broken.

127
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:11,994
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: I see.

128
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,262
{\an1}So that's what happened.

129
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,629
{\an1}If we'd just been more
diligent, then this never

130
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:19,264
{\an1}would've happened.

131
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,598
{\an1}-We can't let Lady
Shizune's death be in vain.

132
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,699
{\an1}It's up to us now to
solve the mystery of Pain

133
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,166
{\an1}that she was working on.

134
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,667
{\an1}We can mourn her loss after we
find him and this is all over.

135
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,968
-Shikamaru.

136
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,070
{\an1}Settle down and go
a little easy now.

137
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:33,736
-No.

138
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,436
{\an1}He's right, Shikaku.

139
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,204
{\an1}The best way to make
ourselves useful

140
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:40,906
{\an1}is to find the location of the
real Pain as soon as possible.

141
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,505
-OK, Inoichi.

142
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,373
{\an1}But with your jutsu
mastery, can't you

143
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:47,175
{\an1}catch and trace the enemy's
chakra back to its source?

144
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,775
{\an1}-I already attempted
that, but the enemy's

145
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,843
{\an1}been constantly changing the
chakra frequency they use.

146
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,211
{\an1}A trace back's impossible.

147
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,045
{\an1}Pain is quite adept.

148
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,952
-Pa, no!

149
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:14,418
-Bastard.

150
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:18,888
-Universal Pull.

151
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,162
So tell me.

152
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,796
{\an1}Did this tame you, at
least a little, Nine Tails?

153
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,800
-What are you?

154
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,768
{\an1}What do you want?

155
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,003
Why?

156
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:58,435
{\an1}Why are you doing all this?

157
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,803
-You ask why?

158
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,638
Sometimes things
happen randomly,

159
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,239
{\an1}and the reason only becomes
apparent afterwards.

160
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,042
{\an1}These circumstances,
well, perhaps I

161
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,709
{\an1}can try to explain it to you.

162
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:18,044
{\an1}-We'll use Katsuyu as a conduit
and gather every piece of intel

163
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,280
{\an1}from anyone who's ever
had any contact with Pain.

164
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,079
Even if they're
dead, there may still

165
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:25,281
{\an1}be information that we
can glean from them.

166
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:29,149
{\an1}We'll get answers, even if we
have to haul out dead bodies.

167
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:32,284
{\an1}INOICHI (VOICEOVER):
Haul dead bodies?

168
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,284
-Wait.

169
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,351
{\an1}I think that I just
figured it out.

170
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,652
{\an1}I know where we can
find the real Pain.

171
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:38,686
{\an1}-What do you mean?

172
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,653
{\an1}-Can you lead us to
where he's hiding?

173
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,587
-Yes.

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,621
{\an1}In the mind of that ninja,
the one from the Hidden Rain

175
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:46,989
{\an1}village whom Jiraiya captured.

176
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,990
{\an1}I saw that he and
his partner had

177
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:55,226
{\an1}been assigned the duty
of transporting bodies.

178
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,160
{\an1}-I've developed a knack
for this over the years.

179
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,560
{\an1}I can tell this one's
probably a woman.

180
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,695
{\an1}-The tallest tower in
this whole village,

181
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:05,330
{\an1}you know, where we always
deliver the bodies.

182
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:06,897
{\an1}-Delivering bodies?

183
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,197
-Right.

184
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,998
{\an1}And what you said
triggered my memory.

185
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:13,400
{\an1}Here's the thing,
it's basic knowledge

186
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,533
{\an1}that someone who's
transmitting chakra signals

187
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:19,202
{\an1}must be as close to the signal
receivers as possible, right?

188
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,903
{\an1}In this case, that
ninja and his partner

189
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,836
happened to be
transporting bodies

190
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,204
{\an1}to the tallest of the
numerous towers scattered

191
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,805
{\an1}around the Hidden Rain village.

192
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:31,073
{\an1}The very same tower
where it was rumored

193
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,207
{\an1}that Pain was supposedly living.

194
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,976
{\an1}-But actually, you know,
there's a rumor going around

195
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:40,244
{\an1}that Lord Pain lives
in that tower, there.

196
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:44,079
{\an1}INOICHI: Plus, that woman who
appeared as one of the Pains,

197
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:46,212
{\an1}she looks identical to
the one that those two

198
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:49,114
{\an1}ninja transported to
that particular tower.

199
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,815
So that place is
probably the laboratory

200
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,816
{\an1}where those black, rod-like
chakra receivers were implanted

201
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,617
into corpses to
create the Pains.

202
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,817
-OK.

203
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,918
{\an1}So how is that connected
to the location where

204
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,585
you think we can
find the real Pain?

205
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,887
{\an1}INOICHI: He needs a location
that is the most efficient

206
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,821
{\an1}for transmitting chakra signals.

207
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,522
{\an1}And to send out signals
the farthest and widest,

208
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:13,489
{\an1}the most logical place is the
tallest tower in the Hidden

209
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,824
Rain village.

210
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:15,958
-Of course.

211
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:18,758
{\an1}And that means, now that
his puppets are here,

212
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:21,727
{\an1}the real Pain must be in the
highest spot near the Hidden

213
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,428
Leaf village.

214
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,795
-Right.

215
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:27,529
{\an1}We'll search each high spot
one by one until we find him.

216
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:37,334
{\an1}-You asked me why
I'm doing all this.

217
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:40,867
{\an1}But even if I told you
why, I doubt very strongly

218
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,035
{\an1}that the knowledge would
change anything at all.

219
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:47,004
{\an1}But let's say that I take the
time to explain it to you.

220
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,937
{\an1}What do you think
would happen then?

221
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:51,439
{\an1}-I have nothing to say to you.

222
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:54,873
{\an1}-My goal is to fulfill the
dream even Jiraiya-sensei

223
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:58,241
{\an1}was unable to achieve.

224
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:01,042
{\an1}As I said earlier,
what I want is

225
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:04,744
{\an1}to create peace and
bring about justice.

226
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,078
-Create peace?

227
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,412
Justice?

228
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,979
Are you kidding?

229
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,313
Give me a break!

230
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:16,349
{\an1}You killed my master, and
my sensei, hurt my friends,

231
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,482
{\an1}destroyed my village!

232
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:27,820
{\an1}After all of the horrible
things that you've done,

233
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:30,721
{\an1}don't you dare talk
about peace and justice!

234
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,623
-Then tell me.

235
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,092
{\an1}What is your goal?

236
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,059
{\an1}-First, I'm gonna
kill you, and then I'm

237
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:47,060
{\an1}gonna bring peace
to the ninja world!

238
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,061
-Oh, I see.

239
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,262
{\an1}That is noble of you.

240
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,297
{\an1}That would be justice.

241
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,498
{\an1}However, what about my family?

242
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,065
My friends?

243
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,200
My village?

244
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,234
{\an1}They suffered the same
fate of this village

245
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,868
{\an1}at the hands of you
Hidden Leaf ninja.

246
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,436
{\an1}How is it fair to let
only you people preach

247
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,635
{\an1}about peace and justice?

248
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,171
{\an1}-What the hell are
you talking about?

249
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,740
{\an1}-Once, the Land of Fire and the
Hidden Leaf had grown too big.

250
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,640
To protect their
national interest,

251
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:24,042
{\an1}they forced feudal clans to
wage war against each other

252
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,377
{\an1}and profited from it.

253
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,945
{\an1}Otherwise, the people of the
villages would've starved.

254
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,679
{\an1}As it happened, our little
nation and its villages

255
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:37,047
{\an1}became the battlefield where the
great nations waged their war.

256
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,149
{\an1}Each time they did, our nation
was ravaged and laid to waste.

257
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:46,251
{\an1}After many such battles,
the great nation stabilized,

258
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,918
{\an1}but our smaller nation suffered,
and it barely recovered.

259
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,889
{\an1}You and I are both seeking
the very same thing.

260
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,856
We both want to
achieve the peace

261
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,758
{\an1}that Jiraiya-sensei envisioned.

262
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,591
{\an1}You and I are the same.

263
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:08,826
{\an1}We're both motivated by our
desire for peace and justice.

264
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,527
The justice that
I have delivered

265
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,496
{\an1}against the Leaf village
is no different from what

266
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,996
{\an1}you are trying to do to me.

267
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,731
{\an1}Everyone feels the same pain
when missing something dear.

268
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:24,233
{\an1}You and I have both
experienced that pain.

269
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:30,035
{\an1}You strive for your justice,
and I strive for mine.

270
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,568
We're both just
ordinary men who have

271
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:36,971
{\an1}been driven to seek vengeance
in the name of justice.

272
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:40,205
{\an1}And, if one comes to
call vengeance justice,

273
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:43,307
{\an1}such justice will only
breed further vengeance,

274
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:48,642
{\an1}and trigger a vicious
cycle of hatred.

275
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,411
{\an1}Right now, we live
in such a cycle.

276
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,812
{\an1}I know the past, and
can foretell our future.

277
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:58,846
{\an1}It is the same as our history.

278
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,281
{\an1}So we believe that human beings
simply cannot understand each

279
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,215
{\an1}other, and they never will.

280
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:11,651
{\an1}The shinobi world of ours is
ruled by hatred and hatred

281
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:12,152
alone.

282
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:17,787
-However.

283
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,756
{\an1}Even I'm able to see that
there's entirely too much

284
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,791
{\an1}hate in this shinobi
world of ours.

285
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:29,025
{\an1}-There's too much hate?

286
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:30,526
{\an1}-I've always wanted
to do something

287
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,160
{\an1}about all of this hatred.

288
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:35,961
{\an1}I'm just not quite sure
how to about it as of yet.

289
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:39,063
{\an1}But I truly believe
that eventually, the day

290
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:42,297
{\an1}will come when all people
will understand one another

291
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,265
{\an1}and live in harmony.

292
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,765
{\an1}-Boy, it sounds kind
of complicated to me.

293
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,500
{\an1}-And if I can't find the
solution to this problem,

294
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:53,001
{\an1}then perhaps I'll entrust you
to find it instead, eh, Naruto?

295
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,402
-Yes sir.

296
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:57,203
{\an1}I can't turn down a request from
my master, can I, Pervy Sage?

297
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:01,805
-So, Naruto.

298
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:03,705
How would you
confront this hatred

299
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:04,972
{\an1}in order to create peace?

300
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:11,476
{\an1}I want to know what
your answer is.

301
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,247
-I don't know.

302
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,881
{\an1}I don't have an answer.

303
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:37,486
{\an1}-But you see, that is why
I formed the Akatsuki.

304
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,253
{\an1}To break the cycle of hatred.

305
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,054
{\an1}I can put an end to it.

306
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,122
{\an1}But I need the Nine Tails.

307
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,123
{\an1}I must have his power in
order to achieve that goal.

308
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,690
{\an1}I'll use the power
of all nine beasts

309
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:52,158
{\an1}to create a tailed
beast weapon many times

310
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,659
{\an1}stronger than the one that
flattened this village.

311
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:58,894
{\an1}Strong enough to wipe out
an entire nation instantly.

312
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:00,495
{\an1}-A tailed beast weapon?

313
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:03,629
{\an1}-I'm going to show the
world what true pain is

314
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:07,764
{\an1}and stop all the wars with the
terror that pain will inspire.

315
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:11,233
{\an1}I shall lead the world down the
road to stability into piece.

316
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,834
{\an1}-But if you do achieve
peace like that,

317
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,302
{\an1}then the whole thing is
nothing but a big lie!

318
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:19,936
{\an1}-Human beings are not the
most intelligent of creatures.

319
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:23,337
{\an1}This is the only way that
peace can be achieved.

320
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,038
Of course, after
several decades,

321
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:28,339
{\an1}that pain too will
eventually fade with time.

322
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:30,639
{\an1}It will no longer
act as a deterrent.

323
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:33,241
Humanity will
return to war again.

324
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:36,075
{\an1}This time, they themselves will
use the tailed beast weapon

325
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:40,444
{\an1}against one another and
reconfirm what true pain is.

326
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,778
{\an1}-And then, for a time,
peace will briefly

327
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:46,913
{\an1}be restored again, in the course
of this endless cycle of hatred

328
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,280
{\an1}begetting more hatred.

329
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,549
{\an1}This unbearable pain will
give rise to momentary peace.

330
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,150
{\an1}That is my dream and my goal.

331
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:57,617
[coughing]

332
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,717
-Nagato.

333
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,785
{\an1}Please don't push yourself.

334
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,386
{\an1}You've already spent
so much chakra.

335
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,861
{\an1}-Peace is now within out grasp.

336
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,363

337
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:58,932
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): I'm
here because I want to be.

338
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,433
{\an1}I used to be such a cry
baby, always giving up

339
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,934
{\an1}before I even got
a chance to start.

340
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,968
{\an1}I almost took the wrong
path so many times.

341
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:08,170
{\an1}You have changed who I am.

342
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,337
{\an1}Your smiling face
saved me, Naruto.

343
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,005
{\an1}That's why I'm not
afraid to protect you.

344
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:15,906
Even if--

345
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,340
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on
"Naruto Shippuden."

346
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:21,008
Confessions.

347
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,742
{\an1}I will protect Naruto,
no matter what!

348
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,877
[applause]

349
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,279
-Hey, Hinata.

350
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,445
-Oh, Sakura.

351
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,446
{\an1}-What's the deal with
the new ending credits?

352
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,980
{\an1}-Uh, I don't know what you mean.

353
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,748
{\an1}-How dare you take the
place of me, the heroine,

354
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,949
{\an1}and have the entire
ending all to yourself?

355
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,949
-Uh, but I don't
know anything about--

356
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:42,584
-Yeah?

357
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:43,217
{\an1}Then explain that!

358
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,017
-Uh--

359
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,951
-What?

360
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:45,984
{\an1}Did you bribe the
animation staff

361
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:47,452
{\an1}to put you in the
ending or something?

362
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:48,985
{\an1}-No, I wouldn't do such a thing!

363
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:49,586
-And bicycles?

364
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,153
I mean, come on!

365
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,220
{\an1}If you're a ninja, then--

366
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,621
{\an1}-Give it a rest, Sakura.

367
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:54,888
-Naruto.

368
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:56,922
{\an1}-There are fans of Hinata
on the staff of the show,

369
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,190
{\an1}and I guess that they just
got a little out of control

370
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:00,690
{\an1}this time, that's all.

371
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:01,890
{\an1}-And what does that mean?

372
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,358
-Besides, just
listen to that song!

373
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:06,026
{\an1}They keep repeating bicycle
throughout the entire thing,

374
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,060
{\an1}so the only choice any
animator would have

375
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,894
{\an1}is to put her on a bicycle.

376
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:10,461
-Hm.

377
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,528
That is true.

378
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,396
{\an1}But that isn't the point!

379
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,430
{\an1}Hey, all you animators, make
some new ending credits with me

380
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,197
{\an1}in them, or else!

381
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,964
{\an1}You hear me, guys?

382
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:24,500
