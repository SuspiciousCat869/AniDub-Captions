1
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,825
{\an1}THIRD HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Iruka.

2
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,660
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): What
is it, Lord Hokage?

3
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,595
{\an1}THIRD HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
I know how you feel.

4
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,497
{\an1}You grew up just like
Naruto, without knowing

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,532
{\an1}the love of a mother and father.

6
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:29,534
{\an1}Because of the Nine-Tails
attack most people

7
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,335
{\an1}won't even look at him.

8
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,472
{\an1}That's why he gets into so
much trouble all the time.

9
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:38,275
{\an1}So that people will be
forced to notice him.

10
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,909
{\an1}He just wants his existence
to be acknowledged,

11
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:42,777
{\an1}no matter what form it takes.

12
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,754
{\an1}The final wish that
the Fourth Hokage

13
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,723
{\an1}made before he sacrificed
himself to save our village

14
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,627
{\an1}was for Naruto to one
day be seen as a hero.

15
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,129
[cheering]

16
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,980
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): Lord
Third, Lord Fourth,

17
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:30,516
[cheering]

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,984
MAN: Naruto!

19
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:37,921
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): There is
a hero right before our eyes.

20
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:38,489
-Yeah!

21
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:42,958
-Hip-hip-hooray!

22
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,610
{\an1}WHITE ZETSU (VOICEOVER): I
never imagined that someone

23
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:08,547
{\an1}as powerful as Pain
would be defeated.

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,215
{\an1}BLACK ZETSU (VOICEOVER): We've
gotta tell Tobi about this.

25
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:11,915
Let's go.

26
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,796
{\an1}OMOI: What do we do?

27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,764
-Oh, come on.

28
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:30,964
{\an1}What are you kidding me?

29
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,532
{\an1}You're getting tired already?

30
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,634
{\an1}We only just left the village.

31
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:36,469
-Not that.

32
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:40,238
{\an1}I was thinking about how Lord
Raikage was when we left.

33
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:41,206
-Listen.

34
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,808
We shall rescue
Bee no matter what.

35
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:46,643
{\an1}We will save him!

36
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,344
-Lord Raikage.

37
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,980
{\an1}-What if Lord Raikage is
still crying even now,

38
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:53,382
{\an1}and his tears are dripping
down, and creating a pond,

39
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,184
{\an1}and then making it larger
and larger until it becomes

40
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,754
{\an1}a big lake, and what if when
we return to the village,

41
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,755
{\an1}it becomes all wet
like the Hidden Rain?

42
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:01,555
{\an1}What do we do then?

43
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:02,055
-Ugh.

44
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:02,857
Come on.

45
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,124
{\an1}Give it a rest, would you?

46
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,459
{\an1}Something like that is
impossible, and you know it is.

47
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,328
{\an1}Tears can't create a lake, no
matter how hard somebody cries.

48
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,330
{\an1}-Maybe for normal
person, but we're

49
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,197
{\an1}talking about Lord Raikage.

50
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:15,666
{\an1}Just think of the awesome
amount of power he has.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,603
{\an1}He could cry himself
a lake in no time.

52
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,837
{\an1}Actually, let's forget
I even mentioned a lake.

53
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,272
{\an1}I bet that he could
cry up an entire ocean.

54
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,441
{\an1}And if a giant wave from
that ocean swallowed us

55
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:26,908
{\an1}up, what do we do then?

56
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,710
{\an1}What are we gonna--

57
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:28,209
-Shut up!

58
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,511
Stop!

59
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,480
{\an1}Listening to you go on and
on completely wears me out.

60
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,648
{\an1}OMOI: I could understand
Samui getting tired because

61
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,818
{\an1}of the way that those
gigantic breasts of hers--

62
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,985
{\an1}but how are you tired?

63
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,353
{\an1}You have no breasts.

64
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,822
-Shut up!

65
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,522
-Look.

66
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,556
{\an1}Enough of this, you two.

67
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,892
{\an1}We're just starting out
on our mission here.

68
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,894
{\an1}It'll be days before we
reach the Leaf Village.

69
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:52,897
{\an1}Do you really plan on
keeping this up all day?

70
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,799
{\an1}We can't afford to keep
wasting time like this.

71
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:56,699
{\an1}Now let's move out.

72
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:57,199
-Right.

73
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,442
[theme music]

74
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:53,559
{\an1}IRUKA: Such devastation.

75
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,461
{\an1}-Guess you'll be teaching
outside for a while.

76
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,563
{\an1}-Let's see if we can
salvage anything.

77
00:05:58,596 --> 00:05:59,864
{\an1}Something for the class.

78
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,098
-Yes.

79
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,400
{\an1}That's a good idea.

80
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,133
-All right.

81
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,301
{\an1}Let's spread out then.

82
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:05,802
Scatter.

83
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:13,275
{\an1}-This place is a wreck too.

84
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,615
{\an1}But this tree- it survived.

85
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,623
-Here goes!

86
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:33,558
Bombs away!

87
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,930
Hahaha!

88
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:41,430
Bullseye!

89
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,399
{\an1}Operation Red Nose
Hokage is complete!

90
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,401
Woohoo!

91
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,369
{\an1}-He's incorrigible.

92
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:52,439
{\an1}IRUKA: Lord Hokage, please,
I need to think about this.

93
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:56,043
{\an1}I don't know about
becoming Naruto's teacher.

94
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,779
{\an1}-As you know, nearly every
single person in this village

95
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,013
is troubled by
Naruto's mischief,

96
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,682
and his irksome
pranks are becoming

97
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,584
{\an1}more and more troublesome
each and every day.

98
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,853
{\an1}No one wants to take
him on as a student.

99
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,854
I believe that a
teacher's job is

100
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:14,156
{\an1}to enhance each student's
inherent virtues.

101
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:21,162
{\an1}Now listen, if Naruto is
not able to graduate from

102
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:24,364
the Academy, he
cannot become a ninja.

103
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:26,433
He'll remain an
outcast in this village

104
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,100
{\an1}for the rest of his life.

105
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,736
{\an1}-Surely someone else
is a better fit.

106
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,706
{\an1}-If he cannot find a teacher,
then I'll have no other choice

107
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,673
{\an1}but to expel Naruto
from the Academy.

108
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,012
{\an1}Just forget about it.

109
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,547
{\an1}No one's going to blame
you for how you feel.

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,548
{\an1}And even if we do
have to kick him out,

111
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,783
{\an1}it certainly wouldn't
be your fault.

112
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:48,985
-Please, wait.

113
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:49,952
-What's that?

114
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,987
{\an1}Then you've decided
to take the job?

115
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,355
-Uh-- well fine.

116
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:54,856
-Oh.

117
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:55,756
Excellent.

118
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,157
{\an1}That's really good to hear.

119
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,660
{\an1}You've no idea how much
good this will do Naruto.

120
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:13,004
{\an1}-And keep wiping until every
speck of that graffiti is gone.

121
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:13,704
-Look.

122
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,772
{\an1}It's that-- that kid.

123
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,708
{\an1}-Why do they even let that boy
stay in the village anyway?

124
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:23,277
{\an1}-Lord Hokage should have
more consideration for us.

125
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,113
-Shut up!

126
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:24,679
-Hey!

127
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,615
Come back here.

128
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,984
{\an1}-I'm not "that kid."

129
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,318
{\an1}I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

130
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,787
{\an1}And-- and I'm going
to be Hokage one day.

131
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:00,474
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
It was just a dream.

132
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,720
[yawn]

133
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:37,270
-What?

134
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:37,871
Oh yeah.

135
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,938
That's right.

136
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,040
{\an1}I almost forgot I start
a new class today.

137
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,809
Well, you never
get a second chance

138
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,910
{\an1}to make a good first impression.

139
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,845
{\an1}I gotta give him the
greeting that he deserves.

140
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,913
[giggling]

141
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:01,824
{\an1}-Another day, another
chance to raise some hell!

142
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,291
{\an1}KIBA: Come on, Akamaru.

143
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:03,858
Hey.

144
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:04,692
Where you going?

145
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:05,358
Come on.

146
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,597
-Iruka-sensei.

147
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,599
{\an1}So you volunteered to be
Naruto's new teacher, huh?

148
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:14,900
-That's right.

149
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:17,535
{\an1}The Third Hokage asked,
so I couldn't say no.

150
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:20,905
{\an1}-It looks like you got the short
end of the stick, I'm afraid.

151
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,307
{\an1}-Frankly, I've been
feeling a bit lost.

152
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,775
{\an1}I don't how to do this.

153
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:27,144
{\an1}-Well, he sure is a handful.

154
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:27,710
Listen.

155
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,845
Take my advice.

156
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,546

him the same attention

{\an1}-Just don't make a big fuss
about it every time he acts up.

160
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:40,187
{\an1}I've found that if
you can ignore them,

161
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,722
{\an1}bothersome kids tend to
go away all on their own.

{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): All right.

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,129
{\an1}I'll take your advice.

That eraser was
nothing but a decoy!

And you totally
fell for it, too!

-No.

-What a letdown.

{\an1}I was kind of looking forward
it to to tell you the truth.

{\an1}First allow me to
introduce myself.

food is mixed rice.

a person's chakra

193
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,330
{\an1}is greatly influenced by
that person's mental energy.

-What?

198
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,981
-Just look.

everything for today.

{\an1}Boy, that smarts.

208

{\an1}But how did you figure
it out so quickly?

yourselves, I want each of you

{\an1}to demonstrate your
skill with ninjutsu.

{\an1}You're not going to
be graded on this.

216
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:18,361
{\an1}It's merely so I can assess
where you are in your studies,

00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,729
{\an1}and plan how to proceed
with our lessons.

OK.

219
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,666
{\an1}We'll start off with a
basic Clone Jutsu then.

220
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:29,903
And the first up
is Sasuke Uchiha.

-Hmph.

{\an1}Using Clone Jutsu is even
easier than child's play.

act so smug all the time?

{\an1}-Just shut up, you loser.

{\an1}-Leave Sasuke alone.

{\an1}I'm the same as always.

318
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,160
{\an1}-All right, kids.

319
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:31,395
{\an1}Today we're hands-on
with Shuriken Jutsu.

320
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,332
{\an1}First, let's have someone
demonstrate it for us.

321
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,600
Let's see.

322
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:36,299
Um--

323
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:36,800
NARUTO: Oo!

324
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,200
Oo!

325
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:37,701
Oo!

326
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:38,401
Me, me me!

327
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,202
{\an1}KIBA: Leave it to me!

328
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,136
{\an1}I can do it in one try.

329
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:40,970
I know it!

330
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,004
{\an1}NARUTO: Sensei, I'm right here!

331
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,938
Oh come on.

332
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:43,872
{\an1}Why won't you look?

333
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,975
{\an1}-Shino, you go ahead.

334
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,675
{\an1}SHINO: Iruka-sensei,
I'm afraid you've

335
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:50,811
chosen the wrong
person for this.

336
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,613
{\an1}The Shuriken Jutsu
is not something

337
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,914
{\an1}the Aburame Clan practices.

338
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,917
{\an1}For all forms of warfare,
we rely almost exclusively

339
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,751
{\an1}on parasitic insects.

340
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,419
{\an1}We house them inside
our bodies, and--

341
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:01,987
-OK, Shino!

342
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,021
That's enough.

343
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:03,854
Come on, Sasuke.

344
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,055
{\an1}-Please just show us the basics.

345
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,024
[girls cheering]

346
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:07,992
{\an1}-Way to go, Sasuke!

347
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:14,897
{\an1}-He's so full of himself.

348
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,432
{\an1}Since when does acting
stuck up make you popular?

349
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:17,933
GIRL: Yeah!

350
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:18,833
Way to go!

351
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,907
{\an1}-IRUKA: Well done, Sasuke.

352
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,509
{\an1}Excellent example.

353
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,342
[girls swooning]

354
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,443
{\an1}GIRL: Sasuke, you are so cool!

355
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:32,444
So cool!

356
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:33,145
-Hah.

357
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,013
{\an1}Stuck up and a showoff.

358
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:38,116
{\an1}I could do that too, if
I wanted to, you know.

359
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,082
-All right.

360
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,217
{\an1}Then I guess you're
up next, Naruto.

361
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,018
-Sweet.

362
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,519
{\an1}I'll show you how it's done.

363
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,719
{\an1}Get ready to be amazed.

364
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:46,622
Hmph.

365
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,427
[gulp]

366
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,563
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I gotta
do it in one throw too.

367
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:57,131
{\an1}That'll make everyone stand
up, and finally take notice.

368
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,000
-Go!

369
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,511
[laughter]

370
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,512
-What a joke!

371
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,546
That's the worst
attempt I've ever seen!

372
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,047
[chuckling]

373
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,048
-Yeah.

374
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,482
{\an1}I was just fooling
around, you guys.

375
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:24,620
[wind blows]

376
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,388
{\an1}-Sensei, you just gotta
let me try one more time.

377
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:28,822
You just gotta!

378
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:29,790
I can do this.

379
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,490
-No.

380
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:32,758
That's enough.

381
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:33,893
OK.

382
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:35,428
{\an1}Which one of you wants
to give it a shot next?

383
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,200
-Hey, Shikamaru.

384
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:46,237
{\an1}Do you want to go to the candy
store with me after class?

385
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,671
-No way.

386
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:51,307
{\an1}I mean, if you get caught you'll
be OK, because your mom's nice.

387
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,976
{\an1}But if my mom found out that
I had a snack before dinner

388
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:58,680
{\an1}and ruined my appetite,
boy, would I ever get it.

389
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:00,081
-Hey.

390
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:03,350
{\an1}Did you know that everyone in
the Uchiha Clan was killed?

391
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:04,551
-Yeah.

392
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,152
{\an1}I heard my father talking
about it a while ago.

393
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:07,654
{\an1}-Sasuke's the only
one who survived.

394
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,235
[theme music]

395
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,474
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): The
Nine-Tails sealed inside

396
00:22:57,507 --> 00:23:00,876
{\an1}of Naruto is responsible
for my parents deaths.

397
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,746
I'm fully aware
that Naruto is not

398
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,716
{\an1}to blame for what occurred back
then, whenever I look at him,

399
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:08,916
{\an1}I can't stop thinking
about the Nine-Tails that's

400
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,218
{\an1}hiding deep inside of him.

401
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:15,456
{\an1}I don't think someone like
me can make Naruto open up.

402
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:18,558
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time
on Naruto Shippuden-- Iruka's

403
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:19,891
Ordeal.

404
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:21,360
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
The Third Hokage

405
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:22,994
{\an1}sure made a bold decision.
