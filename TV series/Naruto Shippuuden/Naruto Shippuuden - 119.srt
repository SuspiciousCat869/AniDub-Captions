-[panting]

3
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,139
OBITO (VOICEOVER): This is bad!

4
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:59,672
If I don't hurry,
he's going to kill me!

5
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:03,572
Can I make it?

6
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,439
[grunts]

7
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,105
-Did I make it?

8
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,772
-No, you're late, Obito.

9
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:18,005
What, did you forget what
time we were supposed to meet?

10
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,805
When you're a
full-fledged shinobi,

11
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,972
you're expected to follow all
the rules and regulations.

12
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:24,972
-Well, I was on my way,
but a feeble old lady

13
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,905
with these heavy bags
asked me for directions.

14
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,872
I-- I mean, I got
something on my eye.

15
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,239
And--

16
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,372
KAKASHI: If you're going to lie,
at least make up a good one.

17
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:35,039
-All right, Kakashi,
that's enough.

18
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,305
I'm sure Obito showed
her the way to go.

19
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,272
Obito, right?

20
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,372
-And carried her bags. [laughs]

21
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,739
-You're too nice, Minato Sensei.

22
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,605
Every time Obito's
late, he says he

23
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,939
stopped to help
some needy person.

24
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,639
Ninja who break the rules
and laws are regarded

25
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,505
as nothing but scum,
isn't that right?

26
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,805
-[chuckles]

27
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,772
-Don't you even have
a shred of kindness

28
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:58,972
in that heart of yours?

29
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,005
All we ever talk about
are rules and regulations.

30
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,905
The key is self-control.

31
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,139
-[grunts]

32
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:06,972
-All right.

33
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,905
Let's just calm down, you guys.

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,839
We're on the same
team, remember?

35
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:13,339
-You're too easy on Obito, Rin.

36
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:16,705
Remember, today is also
a special day for me.

37
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,239
-Oh, yes, of course.

38
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:21,739
-And why is that again?

39
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:25,805
MINATO: As of today, Kakashi
is a Jonin, just like I am.

40
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,239
For this mission, Kakashi and
I will break up into two teams.

41
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,472
That makes us more efficient.

42
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,339
After all, the Leaf's
military strength

43
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,739
is the lowest it's ever been.

44
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:35,839
-We're splitting up?

45
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,672
So then--

46
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,872
-That's right.

47
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,839
Kakashi will be captain
of a three-man squad

48
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:41,939
with you and Rin, Obito.

49
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,639
And I'll be working alone.

50
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:47,405
-Remember, we were just talking
about this the other day

51
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,472
when we discussed
getting Kakashi a gift?

52
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,072
OBITO: Sorry, guess
I wasn't listening.

53
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,439
-Well, here's what I got for
you-- a custom-made kunai

54
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,439
knife.

55
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:01,972
It's a little heavy
and unconventional,

56
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:05,005
but you'll get
used to it quickly.

57
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,039
-Yeah, thanks.

58
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:08,905
-This ones from me.

59
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,072
I made a personalized
med kit for you.

60
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:14,072
I adjusted a few things
to make it easier to use.

61
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,705
-Thanks.

62
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,672
-Hm?

63
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,605
What are you holding
your hand out for?

64
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,305
If you're expecting a gift
from me, you can forget it!

65
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,672
-That's fine.

66
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:28,039
I doubt it would have
been anything good anyway.

67
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:31,505
Better nothing at all
than a useless burden.

68
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,372
-What I don't
understand is how a guy

69
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,205
like you gets to become a Jonin!

70
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,939
-That's amusing,
coming from you.

71
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:42,572
-I am Obito Uchiha of
the powerful Uchiha clan.

72
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,372
I'll be stronger
than you'll ever be!

73
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:48,239
Kakashi, you just wait
until my Sharingan awakens.

74
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,072
-I thought everyone
in the Uchiha clan

75
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:51,572
were supposed to be elite.

76
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,739
So you really shouldn't
have to rely on that.

77
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,439
You should be great already.

78
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:57,439
-What?

79
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:58,872
-Guys, stop it!

80
00:04:58,905 --> 00:04:59,705
-Yes.

81
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,939
Can I explain the mission now?

82
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,739
We don't have that much time.

83
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,405
We're getting close
to the border now.

84
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,705
See, it's this line here.

85
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,739
It shows where the Land
of Earth is currently

86
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,405
invading the Village
Hidden in the Grass.

87
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,705
The enemy are shinobi
from the Hidden Stone.

88
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:22,605
And according to intel,
they deployed 1,000 shinobi

89
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,439
to the front lines, here.

90
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,139
-They've advanced farther
than the last time.

91
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,905
-Well, the Grass Village
is situated right next

92
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:30,939
to the Land of Fire.

93
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,772
We should have
stepped in earlier.

94
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,739
-If the Hidden Stone's
able to invade like this,

95
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,305
then it must mean that they
have an efficient system

96
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,772
for reinforcement.

97
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:45,005
-That's why our mission is
this-- the Kannabi Bridge.

98
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,805
To crush your enemy
at the front lines

99
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,739
requires an immense
amount of shinobi, right?

100
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:52,772
Therefore, shinobi like us,
whose focus is sabotage,

101
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:56,305
are forced to work in a
small, efficient unit.

102
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,739
-The bridge.

103
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,372
So our mission is infiltration.

104
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,872
-Hm.

105
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,272
Team Kakashi, your mission
is to sneak behind the enemy

106
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,772
and reach that bridge.

107
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:10,372
Once the three of
you are there, you

108
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,939
will destroy it in order to
disrupt the enemy support

109
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,972
operation.

110
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:16,472
After that, you will
promptly withdraw.

111
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,139
ALL: Understood.

112
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:22,005
-And you?

113
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,939
-I'll confront the enemy
directly on the battlefield.

114
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:28,105
That will create a diversion
so that you can do your job.

115
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,739
Now remember, Kakashi is
your captain on this mission.

116
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:33,305
All four of us will travel
to the border together.

117
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,739
But once we get there, we'll
split up for our missions.

118
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,305
ALL: Right!

119
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,372
-Hm.

120
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,672
MINATO (VOICEOVER):
Nice, Kakashi.

121
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,405
STONE NINJA (VOICEOVER):
They detected me.

122
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,239
I'm impressed.

123
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:58,672
Huh?

124
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:02,372
That's-- no, it can't be.

125
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:03,939
Better just observe for now.

126
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,705
-There's one.

127
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:09,505
Hm.

128
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,572
Be on your guard, everyone.

129
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:13,239
There are 20 of them out there.

130
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,439
But I believe they're
only shadow clones.

131
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,972
-I agree, Sensei.

132
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,205
All right then, I'll attack.

133
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,205
Please back me up.

134
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,305
-Wait, don't be hasty.

135
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,239
I'll go.

136
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:28,172
You can cover me, Kakashi.

137
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,039
-Sensei, I am
captain today, right?

138
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,672
I want to try out a new
jutsu I've been working on.

139
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:34,872
STONE NINJA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

140
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,572
What's he doing?

141
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,539
-Chidori!

142
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,439
OBITO (VOICEOVER): Oh,
what is that jutsu?

143
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:43,439
RIN (VOICEOVER):
Incredible chakra.

144
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,172
-Here goes.

145
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,672
No matter how many there
are, I can take them down

146
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,739
in an instant with this jutsu.

147
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,472
It's exactly like
your nickname, Sensei.

148
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,039
Besides, you said it yourself.

149
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:58,372
Right now, I'm the
captain, not you.

150
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,139
And the rules clearly
state that the team

151
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,172
must obey its captain's
orders, Sensei.

152
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,505
-I can't believe he'd
try a frontal attack.

153
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,972
Huh!

154
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:13,472
Haah!

155
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,439
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Thanks
to those kunai attacks,

156
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,972
I know exactly where he is.

157
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:24,605
-Here I come!

158
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,372
-He's fast!

159
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:33,472
-Huh!

160
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,172
A shadow clone!

161
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,505
Then on to the next one.

162
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,605
-Huh!

163
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,039
-Don't let your guard down.

164
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:46,639
-Right.

165
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:47,339
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,039
-Number 18!

167
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:58,372
-Don't push your luck, brat!

168
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:58,872
Aah!

169
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:08,405
-Kakashi!

170
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,205
STONE NINJA (VOICEOVER):
I was able to counter

171
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,205
that brat, but just barely.

172
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:16,605
But the way the blond
guy moved-- my mark, too.

173
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:40,739
RIN (VOICEOVER): Sensei's
teleportation jutsu is so fast!

174
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,072
-It's impossible.

175
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,572
It can't be you-- the
Yellow Flash of the Leaf.

176
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:49,005
In the Village
Hidden in the Stones,

177
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,272
we were warned that we must
flee the very moment we

178
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,872
caught sight of you.

179
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,839
Now, I understand why.

180
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:56,839
[clang]

181
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:05,005
-Kakashi's wound is serious.

182
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,039
For now, we'll retreat
and set up camp.

183
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:09,039
-I'm fine.

184
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,739
-No, you aren't, Kakashi.

185
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,839
It's all because you
ignored Sensei's warnings

186
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,072
and charged in there, you fool!

187
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,172
-I don't want to
hear that from you.

188
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:21,105
You, the Uchiha elite who
is just cowering and crying.

189
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,005
-I've got some dust in my
eye and started tearing up,

190
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,272
that's all.

191
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:27,172
-Then I suppose you're not
familiar with the 25th rule

192
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,105
of shinobi conduct--
the rule that

193
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,705
says a ninja must
never show tears.

194
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:34,239
-You guys, come on.

195
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:35,872
Stop it already.

196
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:39,672
-That's quite
enough, both of you.

197
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,472
-Kakashi, rules and regulations
are indeed important.

198
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,805
But it doesn't mean
they're all that matters.

199
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,905
I told you, at times,
you must adapt and take

200
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,939
steps appropriate to
the situation at hand.

201
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:53,439
-Hah!

202
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:54,405
See!

203
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,305
-You're not blameless
either, Obito.

204
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,305
There's no way you can
get dust in your eyes

205
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,072
when you're wearing goggles.

206
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:01,805
It's fine to speak
to self-control,

207
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,505
but you must be strong at
heart, not just in your words.

208
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,939
Now, one more thing.

209
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,372
Kakashi, in my
opinion, you shouldn't

210
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,172
use that jutsu of yours again.

211
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,205
From what I saw, it's a
strike with a single focus.

212
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:19,272
It certainly has speed
and destructive power,

213
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,272
but it makes you move too fast
to ascertain an opponent's

214
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:23,739
counterattack.

215
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,372
It's still an imperfect jutsu.

216
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:32,172
Now, before we part, let
me say this one more time.

217
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,505
For shinobi, the one thing
that's important above all else

218
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:36,005
is teamwork.

219
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,003
OBITO: Sensei?

220
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,370
-Hm?

221
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,137
What is it, Obito?

222
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,470
-Sensei, I-- I
know that teamwork

223
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,403
is the most important
thing of all.

224
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:11,037
But when-- when Kakashi
keeps belittling me,

225
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,237
rubbing my nose in my lack
of discipline, I-- um,

226
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,037
no, what I mean is, I might have
been born into the elite Uchiha

227
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,437
clan, but I'm still
just a failure.

228
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,537
I admit that Kakashi is
an awesome guy, but--

229
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,470
-Hm.

230
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:31,270
Kakashi's father is Sakumo
Hatake, the genius ninja

231
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:33,903
feared as the White
Fang of the Leaf.

232
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:38,937
In his time, even the legendary
Sannin paled in comparison.

233
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,103
With having spent
his early childhood

234
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,303
beside a genius like that,
it's hardly a surprise

235
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:47,003
that Kakashi's standards for
other people and his teammates

236
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,570
are unnaturally high.

237
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,337
-White Fang of the Leaf?

238
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,070
You know, come to think of
it, I've heard of him before.

239
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:56,070
He was that hero who died
while protecting the village.

240
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:58,737
But Kakashi never mentioned
a single word about that.

241
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:05,870
-The White Fang, the great man
that everyone looked up to,

242
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:06,803
especially Kakashi.

243
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:14,170
At least, they did
until that incident.

244
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,437
-Incident?

245
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,337
-Honestly, I'm not
entirely sure it's

246
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,770
my place to tell you the story.

247
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,403
But since you're
Kakashi's teammate,

248
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,003
I believe that you
should know about it.

249
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,003
-What happened?

250
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:29,503
-Kakashi's father,
Sakumo, took his own life

251
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,103
after he was vilified
by everyone around him.

252
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,337
-What?

253
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,970
-Five years ago, he led a
dangerous top-secret mission

254
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,870
deep behind enemy lines.

255
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,003
It went bad.

256
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,870
And he had one of two
choices-- either save

257
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,870
the mission or his comrades.

258
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:48,837
Of course, according to
the law of the village,

259
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,437
you cannot abandon the mission.

260
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,903
But to save the life
of his comrades,

261
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:56,703
Kakashi's father put
the mission on hold.

262
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:00,270
However, a great deal of
damage resulted in the end.

263
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:02,103
Both the Land of
Fire and his peers

264
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,403
blamed him for everything.

265
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:06,337
On top of all that, even
the people he rescued

266
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,303
turned against him
and slandered him.

267
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:11,003
The ordeal took its toll
on Sakumo, physically

268
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:12,137
and mentally.

269
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,903
Until finally, he
took his own life.

270
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,737
[thunderclap]

271
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,270
Since that day, Kakashi
refuses to utter

272
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:26,103
a word about his father.

273
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:29,070
He's devoted himself to the laws
and regulations of the village.

274
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,803
Obito, please try to
understand, even just a little.

275
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,703
Kakashi really does mean well.

276
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:51,537
RIN: It's healing very nicely.

277
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,470
But don't overexert yourself
or you'll reopen the wound, OK?

278
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:57,037
-Yeah.

279
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,337
-All right, let's go.

280
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,803
TEAM: Right!

281
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,770
-This is where we go
our separate ways.

282
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,903
Do your best, all of you.

283
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,937
Listen, the enemy that
we encountered yesterday

284
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,670
was merely a lone scout.

285
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:11,037
But now, we should
expect to fight teams.

286
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,837
Be careful.

287
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,170
OBITO: Let's get
going then, Captain.

288
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,437
-All right, let's go.

289
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,737
TEAM: Yes, sir.

290
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,237
-Scatter.

291
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:36,870
-Hey, Mahiru went
on a scouting run.

292
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,937
He hasn't come back yet.

293
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,303
You don't think those three
little brats took him down,

294
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:42,903
do you?

295
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:43,937
-Let's go ask.

296
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,070
Come on.

297
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:46,537
Camouflage Jutsu.

298
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,237
OBITO (VOICEOVER): Fire
Style, Fireball Jutsu!

299
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:23,970
RIN: Aah!

300
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:24,470
-Huh!

301
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:32,270
-We'll be taking
this one with us.

302
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:32,770
-Wait!

303
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:39,570
-No!

304
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,337
-Obito, don't go after them!

305
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,137
-What?

306
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,337
Are you crazy?

307
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,503
Do you have any idea what
you're saying, Kakashi?

308
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,237
-Yes.

309
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,870
The two of us have to
complete this mission alone.

310
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:55,870
-And Rin?

311
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,937
What do we do about Rin, huh?

312
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,837
-We'll come back for her later.

313
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,637
Look, the enemy will want to
find out what we're up to.

314
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,137
So they won't kill
her right away.

315
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,370
Luckily, Rin is a medic.

316
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,570
So even if she ends
up a prisoner of war,

317
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,437
she'll be treated well.

318
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,270
As long as she cares for
their wounded, she'll be safe.

319
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,703
But we'll be in serious
trouble if the enemy has

320
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,903
time to learn what
our strategy is.

321
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,370
If they do obtain that
information, they'll, no doubt,

322
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:23,037
increase the security on
the bridge right away.

323
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,570
That would make our mission
much more difficult.

324
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,603
-But you're only assuming
that Rin will be safe

325
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,070
based on these guesses of yours!

326
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,803
What if those guys who
caught her are just

327
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:33,803
nobodies who don't
know any better?

328
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:36,337
Look, saving Rin takes
priority over the mission.

329
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,503
And that's that!

330
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,170
-We are shinobi.

331
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,770
We must carry out
our mission even

332
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:44,803
at the expense of our comrades.

333
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,837
That's the law.

334
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,837
If we fail, the
war will drag on.

335
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,770
And more lives than
just Rin's will be lost.

336
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:55,070
-That's just another
one of your guesses.

337
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,837
Are you willing to desert
her for a mere hypothesis?

338
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,903
How can you be willing
to abandon someone who's

339
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,137
been through life
and death with you?

340
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,670
When we were wounded,
Rin saved our lives

341
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,470
with her medical ninjutsu.

342
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,070
Without her, the two of us
would have died in the field

343
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,537
a long time ago!

344
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,937
-Rin was just doing
her job, like we must.

345
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:17,603
-I don't like you!

346
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:18,803
I never will!

347
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:20,470
-I don't care if you do or not.

348
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:21,970
I am the captain right now.

349
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,903
You will obey my
decisions, Obito.

350
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,937
Whatever the
circumstances, one person

351
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,137
alone makes the decisions
to keep the team together.

352
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,670
That's why we have the rule
that says all team members must

353
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,637
obey the captain
without question.

354
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,037
Obito, you have no power.

355
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,670
That's why I'm the captain
of this team and you aren't.

356
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:45,903
-And then why won't you
try to save Rin yourself?

357
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,903
It means you have the power
to rescue your teammate,

358
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,570
isn't it that right, Kakashi?

359
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,070
-If you give in to your
emotions even for a moment

360
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:56,737
and fail your mission, you'll
regret it sooner than you know.

361
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,703
That's why shinobi have rules.

362
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,770
That's why we're taught that
we must suppress our emotions.

363
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,437
You should already know that.

364
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,737
-But Rin, she was so
concerned for your well-being

365
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,737
that she put together that
special med kit for you.

366
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,037
She even sewed the
protective amulet inside it!

367
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,703
-The med kit and
medical ninjutsu

368
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,237
are great systems that
the Hidden Leaf developed

369
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,103
to increase the success
rate of our missions.

370
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:27,970
But like I told you yesterday,
Obito, better nothing

371
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:31,770
at all than a useless burden.

372
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,770
-Useless burden?

373
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,970
-To carry out a mission,
a ninja should only

374
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:42,003
have tools necessary
to the task at hand.

375
00:19:42,037 --> 00:19:44,637
Useless things, like
emotions, only get in the way.

376
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,570
-It's-- do you
really means that?

377
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,003
Do you honestly believe
that stuff, Kakashi?

378
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,003
-Yes, I do.

379
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:20,837
-Just forget it.

380
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,170
We'll never agree.

381
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,470
We're like oil and water.

382
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,803
I'm going to rescue Rin.

383
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,537
-You don't understand, Obito.

384
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,003
You don't know what happens
to people who break the rules.

385
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,503
-I believe that the White
Fang was a true hero.

386
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,970
-[gasps]

387
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,270
-You're right.

388
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:47,237
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules and laws

389
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,370
are regarded as scum.

390
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:54,403
But those who would abandon
even one of their friends

391
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:57,403
are worse than scum.

392
00:20:57,437 --> 00:21:01,803
I'm scum anyway, so I'm going
to choose to break the rules.

393
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:05,703
If doing that somehow makes
me less than a true shinobi,

394
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:09,603
then I'll just go and crush all
of the so-called real shinobi.

395
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,895
[music playing]

396
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:04,964
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Even now, when

397
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:09,031
I think back on that time, I
still feel pangs of regret.

398
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,631
I've just been promoted a
Jonin, and every other word

399
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:14,664
out of my mouth was about
rules and regulations.

400
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:17,698
To tell the truth, I was
simply an arrogant brat.

401
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:22,331
I had no idea what was truly
important, until that day when

402
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:25,064
you taught me what
really mattered.

403
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:28,498
Next time, "Kakashi
Chronicles-- a Boy's Life
