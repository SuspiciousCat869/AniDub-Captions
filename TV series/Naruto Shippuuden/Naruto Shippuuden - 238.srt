that at all.

186
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,831
{\an7}Listen, just don't
forget what captain
Yamato told us, that
we're a team.

187
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:28,865
{\an7}When one of us
makes a move, the
other is there to
back him up!

188
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,831
{\an7}We operate by
using the buddy
system.

189
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,199
{\an7}And right now, while
we're going to get
Sasuke back...

190
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:41,533
{\an7}If we run into an enemy
that gets in our way, we
need to know each other's
strengths and weaknesses,

191
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,799
{\an7}so we can fight
more effectively.

192

{\an1}And, Sai, you're
more levelheaded
than me.

193

{\an4}So you might figure
out a way to make better
use of my strengths than
even I can.

{\an1}Hm.

00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:06,434
{\an4}And if Sasuke returns,
I'll be able to leave

{\an7}...wouldn't you
agree, Naruto?

210
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,404
{\an7}But this time,
my whim is
telling me...

211
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,337
{\an1}...to finish
what I started!

212
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,537
{\an4}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>When I saw those eyes,</i>

{\an1}<i>But Naruto's feelings</i>

214

{\an1}<i>He still held true</i>
<i>to his old friend.</i>

215
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,438
{\an7}It's funny, there was
a time when I really
hated Sasuke's guts,

216
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:55,171
{\an7}but, I gotta admit!
It was always a lot
of fun being around
the guy!

217
00:17:55,937 --> 00:18:01,004
{\an7}After all, Sasuke's
the one who accepted
me more than anybody
else...

218
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:05,338
{\an7}Sasuke is my
best friend...

219
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:09,438
{\an7}It took a while,
but now we have
a special bond.

220
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,804
{\an1}Maybe, but, you must
fight Orochimaru.

221
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:15,605
{\an7}If he tears off
my arms, I'll
kick him dead!

222
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,539
{\an7}If he tears off
my arms, I'll
bite him dead!

223
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:21,972
{\an7}If he tears off
my head, I'll
stare him dead!

224
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:25,572
{\an7}If he gouges out
my eyes, I'll
curse him dead!

225
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:31,905
{\an7}Even if I'm chopped to
pieces, I'll beat Orochimaru
and I will take my friend
Sasuke back!

{\an4}<i>(Sai Thinking)</i>

<i>in a world of lies</i>
<i>and betrayal...</i>

227

228

229

Naruto's plans.

232
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:06,674
