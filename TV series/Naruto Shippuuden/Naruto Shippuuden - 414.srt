{\an1}...really gonna...

18

{\an1}Just hang in there, Naruto!

00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,632
{\an1}But why?! My Jutsu's
not working!

28
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:13,268
{\an1}Because the Nine Tails was
extracted.

Impossible!

30
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:17,406
{\an1}Madara attacked him.

31
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,977
{\an1}But there is a way to save
him! And that's why we're
hurrying, right now!

32
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,246
{\an1}To where?!

33

{\an1}Where the Fourth Hokage is.

{\an1}Hey, Kazekage! Do me a

{\an1}His father...

36
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:34,325
{\an1}One half of me's sealed
inside Minato.

37
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:39,364
{\an1}So you just take that other
half and transplant it in
Naruto.

38
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,466
{\an1}That will save his life.

{\an1}<i>Hurry to the Fourth Hokage! </i>

40

{\an1}He has the Teleportation
Jutsu. Why don't we just
have him come here?

41
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,109
Not possible.

42
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:54,081
{\an1}His Teleportation Jutsu's
tied to my Sealing Formula.

43
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,218
{\an1}However, once I'm extracted,
it'll disappear.

44
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:03,191
{\an1}Just rush Naruto over to the
Fourth Hokage! You got that,
Gaara?!

Kazekage!

{\an7}That's what the Nine Tails
said to me.

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,458
{\an7}As of right now, there isn't
any other way for us to save
Naruto!

49
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:33,460
{\an1}Then let's go! How much
farther?

50
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,829
{\an1}Several kilometers!

went charging in there like
that?!

{\an1}Let's go back her up!

69

{\an1}I've gotta get to Sasuke!
Move, you bastard!

{\an1}No way... Impressive,
Karin...!

not nice. You broke my

too late even if you make it
there, anyway.

00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:41,389
{\an7}<i>Wait for me! I'll be there</i>
<i>as fast as I can, Kakashi. </i>

150
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,960
{\an1}Kakashi...! Hurry up! The
left eye.

151
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:50,065
{\an1}Obito's conscience is clear.
Now's our chance.

152
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,636
{\an1}Yes, but the problem is how
are we going to tear that
guy away from Obito?

153
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:58,975
{\an1}And we can't let him hand
over that left eye to the
enemy...

154
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,286
[inhaling]

155
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,622
[exhaling]

156
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,647
{\an1}I'm feeling a little bit
heavier than I ought to,
now. It seems something's

157
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,350
{\an1}catching in my chest.

158
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:37,653
[spitting]

159
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,630
{\an1}The Sage's Ninja Tools, huh?
Useless.

160
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,300
{\an1}But now, I'm lighter.

161
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,589
{\an1}Exactly what are we
going to accomplish by
returning now, anyway?

162
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:12,093
{\an1}Tenten! Stop your grumbling!

163
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:15,696
{\an1}I just have this feeling,
deep in my gut, that some
unknown horror is

164
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:16,730
approaching!

165
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:17,365
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,101
[yelling]

167
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,844
{\an1}What was that?! Are you two
all right?!

168
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,046
Yes...!

169
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,646
[groaning]

170
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,587
{\an1}No way... Are those...?!

171
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,422
They are!

172
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:53,173
[panting]

173
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:58,346
{\an1}<i>You two guys sure</i>
<i>are stubborn.</i>

174
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:02,683
{\an1}Obito's consciousness... is
no longer stable.

175
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,887
{\an1}Kakakshi... Let's go!

176
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:07,624
{\an1}Hold up, Minato!

177
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:08,857
{\an1}Uh!

178
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:13,163
{\an1}Quick, switch your chakra
into Sensory Mode! Now!

179
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,070
{\an1}Uh!

180
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,640
{\an1}No way!

181
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,809
{\an1}We were distracted, here...

182
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,780
{\an1}There's no mistake. My other
half's been extracted!

183
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,317
Sensei?

184
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,719
Huh?

185
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,921
Uh--

186
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,790
Kakashi Sensei!

187
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,691
[gasping]

188
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,463
{\an1}What happened, Sakura?!

189
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:47,168
{\an1}The Nine Tails was extracted
from Naruto! It doesn't
look good.

190
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,074
{\an7}<i>Naruto... </i>

191
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:56,246
{\an1}A message from Naruto's Nine
Tails!

192
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,717
{\an1}Listen, Fourth Hokage! He
said to transplant the other
half of Nine tails within

193
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,818
{\an1}you into Naruto.

194
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:04,455
{\an1}It's the only way to save
him!

195
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,124
Hmm...

196
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,027
{\an1}Kakashi, he's all yours.

197
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:10,963
{\an1}Understood.

198
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:14,601
I'll help!

199
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:29,384
{\an1}Well, I'm going.

200
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,851
Be careful.

201
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:35,156
{\an1}Of course! There's no way
I'm going to die before I
see my child's face.

202
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,127
[sighing]

203
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:45,168
{\an1}Once this child is born, I'm
going to have two things to
worry about...

204
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,280
{\an1}Hey, don't worry!

205
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,683
{\an1}I can take care of the kid!

206
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,687
{\an1}No matter what happens, and
no matter what it takes!

207
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,221
Mm.

208
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:07,027
{\an1}But you're so busy being the
Hokage, and I think he's
going to be mischievous, and

209
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,530
{\an1}incorrigible, and say he
wants to become Hokage, too!

210
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:12,867
{\an1}And he's gonna be clueless
about girls... defy his
teachers--

211
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,769
{\an1}Hold on!

212
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,036
[gasping]

213
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:20,142
{\an1}Calm down. I mean, the kid
hasn't even been born, yet!
You're worrying too much!

214
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,746
{\an1}Besides, how do you know
that it's a boy? Or that
he's going to want to be the

215
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,916
{\an1}Hokage, even before we lay
eyes on him?!

216
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:27,917
Easy!

217
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,222
{\an1}Because I'm his mother.

218
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,758
Uh--

219
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,263
[chuckling]

220
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:43,034
{\an1}Anyway, I'm the Hokage. I'm
not going to die easily.

221
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:47,774
{\an1}And as Hokage, I'll protect
that child no matter what!
Don't worry!

222
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,277
{\an1}You're awfully confident
when it comes to this baby!

223
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,944
{\an1}Well, of course...

224
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:56,718
{\an1}I am his father.

225
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,556
{\an1}The current me can...

226
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:08,732
{\an1}This time for sure!

227
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:25,350
Uh--

228
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:26,618
{\an1}[gasping]

229
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,921
That was-!
[growling]

230
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,392
{\an1}Nine Tails...

231
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:36,563
{\an1}Now... you're finally...
mine!

232
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,768
[grunting]

233
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,606
What happened?!

234
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:49,411
[grunting]

235
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,220
How is Naruto?!

236
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:02,526
What was that?!

237
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,230
No way...

238
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,367
{\an8}<i>Lord Madara... </i>

239
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,841
Black Zetsu...

240
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,341
{\an1}You're taking too long.

241
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,014
{\an1}So I decided I should
come to you, instead!

242
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:02,031
{\an1}<i>I need to ask you something,</i>
<i>Madara. What am I to you? </i>

243
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:06,602
{\an1}<i>[chuckling] You have to be</i>
<i>kidding, right? What kind of</i>
<i>a stupid question is that?</i>

244
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,371
{\an1}<i>You have always been only</i>
<i>one thing to me. </i>

{\an1}<i>Yes... you are...</i>
