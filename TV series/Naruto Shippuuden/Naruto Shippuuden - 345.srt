1
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:09,313
Well hello!

2
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,415
How you doing?

3
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,587
{\an1}Bad, of course! What do you
think?!

4
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,060
{\an4}[sigh] How long have I been
stuck inside here, anyway?
It sure feels like it's been
a long while.

5
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,096
{\an1}Don't worry! I mean, it's
not like you need to pay
rent or anything!

6
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:30,733
{\an1}Those of us created from the
Gedo Statue don't have to
eat, either.

7
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:36,573
{\an1}No food bills, no need for a
bathroom. 'Cause guess what?
We don't even need to poo!

8
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:41,244
{\an1}Yeah, so what? Don't lump me
in with all the rest of you
guys!

9
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:45,815
{\an1}I just have half of that
weird stuff stuck onto me,
I'm not made of it like you!

10
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:50,319
{\an4}And thanks to having it as a
part of you, you can survive
without eating or drinking
at all!

11
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:54,090
{\an1}In fact, in all honesty, you
should be grateful and thank
us.

12
00:02:54,123 --> 00:03:01,196
{\an4}Good grief. We're the ones
who don't want to be lumped
in with you! What you have
is emotionless synth-tissue.

13
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,833
{\an1}We're full artificial
humans. We have feelings
and everything!

14
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:09,671
{\an1}You may have a better sense
of humor, but what we have
is much better!

15
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:13,842
{\an1}Both our vocabulary skills
and mental acuity are far
higher than yours!

16
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,676
{\an1}But we still don't poo...

17
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,483
{\an4}Shut up! All right, fine! Go
ahead, prove that you guys
are at a higher level than I
am!

18
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:25,420
We're the ones...

19
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,086
...in charge...

20
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,855
{\an1}...of watching you!

21
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,990
{\an1}Don't talk in unison!
It's annoying!

22
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:34,563
{\an4}Now listen: we're only
helping you with your
rehabilitation because
Madara ordered us to

23
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:39,633
{\an1}make sure that we get you up
and running and usable by
the time he wakes up again.

24
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:44,638
{\an1}Ha! So he just gets to sit
on his chair over there,
sleeping the whole time...

25
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:47,241
{\an1}...while these noisy
puppets guard me?!

26
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:53,780
{\an1}I swear that somehow I'm
gonna get outta here and
return to Rin and Kakashi!

27
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,082
{\an1}Tell me where the exit is!

28
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,185
{\an1}Nope, not possible!
There is no exit.

29
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,225
{\an4}Madara already sealed it off
with a huge boulder after we
lugged you here on his
orders.

30
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,493
{\an1}What?! He sealed us in?!

31
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,865
{\an1}Oh, by the way, you've been
saying "Rin-Rin-Rin" in your
sleep a lot. Do you want to

32
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,668
{\an1}go outside to collect
a bell or something?

33
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:21,641
{\an1}And also, sometimes you said
"stupid-stupid-stupid." And
"stupid Kakashi."

34
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:24,810
{\an1}Yeah, that's right, he does!
Every so often.

35
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,845
{\an1}What's a "stupid Kakashi?"

36
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,716
{\an1}Beats me. Why don't you
just ask him about it?

37
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:33,653
{\an7}<i>I really said that?!</i>
<i>Seriously?!</i>

38
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,923
[whispering]

39
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:42,461
{\an1}Um, Hi... hello... Uh, can
we, can I ask you something?

40
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:44,129
What?

41
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:49,301
{\an1}The call of nature! In
short, what does the urge to
poo feel like? For example...

42
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:54,306
{\an4}I thought it was about
Stupid Kakashi! Why are you
guys so obsessed with poop
and stuff?

43
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,242
{\an1}You know, there's really no
need for you to get so angry
with us.

44
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:02,013
{\an1}All right, we'll ask you
about Rin and Stupid Kakashi
later.

45
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:09,053
{\an4}I especially hate you, the
one with the whirly face!
Sure, you may not poop, but
you look like it!

46
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:12,456
{\an1}Anyway, where did all the
other white guys that were
here go?

47
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,259
{\an1}Oh they went outside to
collect intel.

48
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,795
{\an1}Huh?! You mean you guys can
actually go outside?!

49
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:22,932
{\an1}All of us are able to move
through the earth's surface
quite easily.

50
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:23,933
What?!

51
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:27,170
{\an1}You can really do that?!

52
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:32,309
{\an4}I can't believe this. I get
locked up in this place
where I have to hear about
all this weird stuff.

53
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:34,644
{\an1}I am sorry to bother
you about poo!

54
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,479
{\an1}I'm not talking about that!

55
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,282
{\an1}I mean that stuff
Madara said.

56
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:42,519
{\an1}Something about severing
fate or something like that...

57
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:48,491
{\an4}Well Madara's not nice
enough to talk to a brat
like you on your level, to
be frank.

58
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:54,163
{\an1}But to put it very simply,
he means tossing the real
world's bad stuff...

59
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:58,467
{\an1}...and escaping inside of a
dream that's entirely full
of good things!

60
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:00,469
Inside a dream?

61
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:06,275
{\an4}Since it's a dream,
everything is just how you
want it! Even those who are
dead can be alive again!

62
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:08,310
Hmm... Yeah...

63
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:14,450
{\an4}Just think of it as all of
us going to this huge dream
world that was created
using genjutsu!

64
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:21,289
{\an4}Well, I guess it's more like
forcibly taking everyone
there... and for their whole
life, too.

65
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,592
With genjutsu?

66
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:28,396
{\an4}[sigh] Man, that's so
incredibly beyond stupid
that I can't even understand
it.

67
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:34,168
{\an1}If you have as much power as
Madara, then anything is
possible.

68
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:40,108
{\an4}It's just that he's weak
right now and can't do it
yet. There's still much that
has be prepared.

69
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:43,311
Oh, yeah? Well,
I don't care.

70
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,413
{\an1}What's important...

71
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,915
{\an1}Is that I'm gonna make it
outside! I swear I will!

72
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,888
{\an1}I'm gonna get back
to Rin and Kakashi!

73
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,256
What?

74
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,293
{\an1}I've got to get my body back
in working condition again.

75
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:03,230
[groaning]

76
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:16,309
[groaning]

77
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:31,724
[groaning]

78
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:27,311
Yay!
[cheering]

79
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:18,093
[groaning]

80
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:19,695
No!

81
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,068
{\an1}Don't act tough and
hide your wounds!

82
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,204
{\an1}I am always watching,
you know.

83
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,416
{\an8}<i>It's starting to</i>
<i>feel natural.</i>

84
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,586
{\an7}<i>Just a bit longer.</i>

85
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,824
{\an7}<i>I'll be seeing you soon, Rin...</i>
<i>Kakashi!</i>

86
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,599
{\an4}Hey! Listen! I was outside
just now! Your friends Rin
and Stupid Kakashi are in
trouble!

87
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,367
{\an1}What?! What's going on?!

88
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,504
{\an1}They're alone and completely
surrounded by Hidden Mist
Shinobi!

89
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,678
[painful groan]

90
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,187
{\an1}There's no way you can break
through boulders with that
body yet.

91
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,891
{\an1}But I have to go save
Rin and Kakashi...

92
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:07,666
{\an1}Here, why don't you
wear my body?

93
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,608
{\an1}But you guys are Madara's
henchmen. Are you sure about
this?

94
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,644
{\an1}He really is... a good boy.

95
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:25,316
{\an1}Don't you want to help Rin
and Kakashi?

96
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:30,287
{\an1}You guys... thank you.

97
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:59,916
{\an4}Oh, so you kept the root
tethered and borrowed the
statue's power, is that it?
That's good thinking.

98
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:05,021
{\an1}Yeah! I'm pretty good, huh?

99
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:10,527
All right!

100
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,663
{\an1}So, you're going?

101
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:24,973
{\an1}I'm grateful that
you saved me...

102
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,609
But I'm leaving.
I have to go.

103
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:35,684
{\an1}You are being far too hasty.
Besides, I would say it's
premature to thank me.

104
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:39,287
{\an1}Yeah, but I'll probably
never come back here.

105
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,390
{\an1}I've given my thanks.
Now I'm going!

106
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:44,659
{\an1}You're wrong about that.

107
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:52,000
{\an4}You will return here to me.
And when you do, that is
when I will get your true
gratitude.

108
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:56,205
{\an1}Hey, white one! What's Rin
and Kakashi's location?!

109
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:58,506
{\an1}Take me to them right away!

110
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,344
{\an1}What you're wearing all over
your body right now is
essentially a clone of me.

111
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:08,182
{\an4}And we're able to talk
telepathically to each
other, at least over limited
distances.

112
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:13,420
{\an4}Others of us are scattered
here and there underground.
We're able to exchange
intel.

113
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,556
{\an1}Don't worry. I'll use
them to guide you.

114
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,992
{\an1}Is that you, Swirly?

115
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,594
{\an1}First, we need to
get outside.

116
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,963
{\an1}Then let's go! I'm
counting on you.

117
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,579
{\an1}What's the status
of Rin and Kakashi?

118
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,416
{\an1}Well, according to the
others, it sounds pretty
bad.

119
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:51,191
{\an4}They're talking about
some Hidden Mist test
subjects...but I don't
really understand.

120
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,792
{\an1}Some test subjects?

121
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:57,663
{\an1}Anyway, it seems that Rin
and Kakashi are totally
surrounded.

122
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:01,767
{\an1}Sounds like all of the Mist
guys appear to be jonin or
ANBU Black Ops.

123
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,904
{\an1}What's Minato Sensei doing?

124
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:06,005
Who?

125
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,009
{\an1}I'm asking what the Yellow
Flash of the Leaf is doing!

126
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,512
{\an1}Hmm...It seems that he's
on some different mission.

127
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,447
{\an7}<i>At a time like this?!</i>

128
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,051
Kakashi...

129
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,587
Promise me...
Take care of Rin.

130
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,322
I will.

131
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,359
{\an7}<i>Kakashi! You made</i>
<i>me a promise!</i>

132
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:30,795
{\an8}<i>Rin...</i>

133
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,699
{\an7}<i>Please, protect Rin!</i>

134
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,303
{\an7}<i>I'll be right there!</i>

135
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:44,909
{\an1}Obito, it's likely going to
come to battle. So I want to
say some things beforehand.

136
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:46,044
What is it?

137
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,047
{\an1}Your fighting ability is
lower than mine.

138
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:56,920
{\an4}Plus, right now, it's like
my big body is wrapped
around and protecting your
wounded little body, so.

139
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,489
Yeah, so what?!
What's your point?!

140
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:04,027
{\an1}I think it would be better
if I do all the fighting
once we get there.

141
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:07,898
{\an1}Remember what Madara told
me? He said that only with
two together can the

142
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:10,366
{\an1}Sharingan's true power
be unleashed!

143
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,637
{\an1}My other Sharingan half,
Kakashi, is out there on the
battlefield right now!

144
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:17,874
{\an1}So together, our combo
attacks are superior!

145
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,510
{\an1}Kakashi and I will
protect Rin!

146
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,884
{\an1}Well, you do have
Hashirama's tissue
attached to you.

147
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:36,792
{\an4}A whole different kind of
strength may emerge when
Senju and Uchiha powers are
combined together but...

148
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,428
What's that?

149
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:41,663
[gasp]

150
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:53,775
{\an1}I thought it was rain,
but it's that...

151
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:58,146
{\an1}I just got word from the
others. It seems...

152
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,415
{\an1}That's the location.

153
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:03,785
Let's go!

154
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,424
[gasp]

155
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:20,734
{\an7}<i>What's happening?! Stop</i>
<i>showing these weird images!</i>

156
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,005
{\an1}Just a little-- just a
little bit farther!

157
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,713
[gasp]

158
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:42,056
Kakashi...

159
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,196
{\an1}Damn it! He did it!

160
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,199
{\an1}After all the trouble we
went through to get her!

161
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:33,671
Rin...

162
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:51,155
{\an1}[distraught yell]

163
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:52,390
Where am I?!

164
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:54,392
[angry yell]

165
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,393
{\an1}What in the world...

166
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:57,428
...is this place?!

167
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,064
Who's that guy?!

168
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:01,399
Reinforcements?!

169
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:03,533
{\an1}What a fool, coming alone!

170
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,668
{\an1}I won't accept it!

171
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:10,774
[angry growl]

172
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,209
I will...

173
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,577
{\an1}What just happened?!

174
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,380
He dodged them?!

175
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:20,717
{\an1}I will not accept
any of this!

176
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:30,126
Do not mock the
Blood Mist Village!

177
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,897
[screaming]

178
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:44,573
Die!

179
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,444
[groan]

180
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,311
{\an1}We can't hit him!

181
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,586
{\an1}Who is that guy?!

182
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,522
{\an1}He wields strange jutsu!

183
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,591
{\an1}We need to at least
retrieve the girl!

184
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,693
{\an1}We can't let the enemy
get a hold of her corpse!

185
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:18,005
{\an1}There's no mistake! This guy
passes right through you!

186
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,385
{\an1}Wood Style: Cutting Sprigs
Jutsu out of the blue!

187
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:35,622
{\an1}Obito, now I understand why
Madara picked you!

188
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:38,091
[attacking yell]

189

191
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,594
{\an1}What the-- Who is he?!

192
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,406
[gasps]

193

[sreaming]

194
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:04,841
I...

195
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,613
I get it...

196
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,385
I see now...

197
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:20,190
I am in Hell.

198
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:01,821
{\an1}<i>I shall sever the nexuses of</i>

199
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:05,693
{\an1}<i>You still felt loyalty to</i>

<i>did you?</i>

200
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:09,295
{\an1}<i>Not at all. It doesn't</i>

201
