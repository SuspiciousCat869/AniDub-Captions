{\an7}"Itachi's Story - Light and
Darkness: The Darkness of
the Akatsuki"

2
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,381
{\an1}Do you know a shinobi called
Might Dai?

3
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:19,415
{\an1}I know a Might Guy.

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,353
{\an1}Ah... well, he's the
brat from that day.

5
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,923
{\an1}I was one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist back
then...

6
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,092
{\an1}But thanks to
that Might Dai,

7
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:35,162
{\an1}the seven swordsmen
ended up being cut down
to only three.

8
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,398
{\an1}Who would've thought that
scuzzy bearded jerk would be

9
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,000
{\an1}able to use a
taijutsu like that?

10
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:45,137
{\an1}Anyway, look. I wanna make
something completely clear,
all right?

11
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:49,174
{\an1}I really couldn't care less
about the reasons why you
joined the Akatsuki.

12
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,775
{\an1}I don't even want to
hear your reasons!

13
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:56,280
{\an1}It doesn't matter why I
joined either, and I don't
want you to ask me.

14
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:58,948
{\an1}Hey, are you even listening
to me right now?

15
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:01,450
Hyyyaaa!

16
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,958
{\an1}Pay attention. Because
there's something
important that I need

17
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,026
{\an1}to ask you.
It's about...

18
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,162
{\an1}<i>...your ninjutsu</i>
<i>specialties. </i>

19
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,466
{\an1}As you can probably tell, I
use this Executioner's

20
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,734
{\an1}Blade to attack and
cut up enemies.

21
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,571
{\an1}So how about you?

22
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,738
{\an1}Genjutsu, Fire Style, and
Shuriken Jutsu.

23
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,242
{\an1}You know, you're
really being way too
humble.

24
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:35,379
{\an1}Former Leaf ANBU Itachi
Uchiha, Itachi of the
Sharingan, Clan-Killer

25
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,949
{\an1}Itachi. People sure
throw around a lot of
nicknames for you.

26
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,954
{\an1}Anyway, let's decide on
our formations.

27
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:49,090
{\an1}You can just start out with
a preemptive attack with
your genjutsu, shuriken, or

28
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,392
{\an1}whatever your specialty
is exactly.

29
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:56,296
{\an1}Then I'll jump into the
fray. And at that point,
you'll become my back-up.

30
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,932
{\an1}We can call that
Formation B.

31
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,200
What's A?

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,502
{\an1}<i>We each do whatever we want!</i>

33
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:04,769
Understood.

34
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,739
{\an1}But first, one
word of warning.

35
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:10,976
{\an1}You can't take any
opponent for granted.
Got it?

36
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,678
Understood.

37
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:27,422
{\an1}Who are you?

38
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:28,890
{\an1}Get out of the way!

39
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,394
{\an1}Shinobi villages always talk
a good game about peace and
order, but they're really

40
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:36,230
{\an1}just worried about their
roles getting smaller.

41
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,966
{\an1}Behind the scenes, they're
trying to reduce their
opponent's power...

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,204
{\an1}...while also trying to
increase their own and to
stop the other nations from

43
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,538
{\an1}finding out about their
little schemes!

44
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:51,109
{\an1}That's why the Akatsuki
gets jobs. The more peaceful
the world is,

45
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,977
{\an1}the more work
we get.

46
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:57,814
{\an1}We accept any request we
receive. And we don't care
about the details at all.

47
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,650
{\an1}Why you scoundrels...!

48
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,685
{\an1}Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

49
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:04,820
[grunting]

50
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,989
[screaming]

51
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,392
[grunting]

52
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:13,861
[groaning]

53
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,033
{\an1}That's why--

54
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,901
{\an1}We don't need to know
who's inside this
thing...

55
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:24,070
{\an1}And we don't
want to know.

56
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,048
{\an1}What's also nice is that you
don't have to waste any
thought...

57
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:41,084
{\an1}<i>...on who the hell would pay</i>
<i>us to do dirty work like</i>
<i>this. </i>

58
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,560
{\an1}That's what the Akatsuki's
about.

59
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:56,130
{\an1}Our leader, Pain, had said
that the plan was for the
Akatsuki to rule the world.

60
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,932
{\an1}Yeah, well, that won't be
for a long time.

61
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:02,369
{\an1}First we need to
amass money and power.

62
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,808
{\an1}Speak of the devil; he's
summoning us.

63
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:29,726
{\an1}Have you gotten used to the
Akatsuki, Itachi?

64
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,564
{\an1}How would you feel about
changing partners and
teaming up with me instead?

65
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,999
{\an1}Hey, we just started getting
our formations down!

66
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,736
{\an1}Don't try to steal
him from me already!

67
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:47,906
{\an1}I second changing partners.
There's something called
compatibility, you know!

68
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,211
{\an1}I wish our leader would put
a bit more thought into
this.

69
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:56,714
{\an1}You're one to talk, you
damn snake! Hmm.

70
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:07,189
{\an1}Thanks to all your efforts,
the Akatsuki's reputation
is growing in the underworld.

71
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:12,961
{\an1}We're getting bigger jobs...
which means higher
compensation, as well.

72
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:18,633
{\an1}But that's just a step.
The Akatsuki's ready to move
to the next level...

73
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,371
{\an1}...the Tailed Beasts.

74
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:27,707
{\an1}There's nine of 'em,
right? Those Tailed Beasts?

75
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,676
{\an1}The Five Great Nations
harbor most of them.

76
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,813
{\an1}But the whereabouts of a
few still remain unknown.

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,315
{\an1}Those currently without jobs
will search for them.

78
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,584
{\an1}We just have to find them?

79
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,051
For now.

80
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,220
{\an1}And what's the end goal?

81
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,389
{\an1}Hunt down and collect
each of them.

82
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,891
{\an1}And then?

83
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,226
{\an1}They'll be deterrents in
our quest for world
domination.

84
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:57,733
{\an1}But Tailed Beasts...? Seems
to me there are a lot of
other ways...

85
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:01,736
{\an1}Our leader's reasoning is
quite sound about this.

86
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,336
{\an1}Here are your assignments.

87
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,874
{\an1}Juzo... you'll handle
the request from the Land
of Water.

88
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:11,477
[grunting] Isn't
there something else I can do?

89
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:13,945
{\an1}You're familiar with
the territory.

90
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,147
[grunting]

91
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:26,055
{\an1}This is just ridiculous.
That place is so depressing.

92
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,524
{\an1}I never wanted to
go back there again.

93
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,427
{\an1}<i>Isn't that where you're</i>
<i>from? </i>

94
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:36,164
{\an1}Well, at least the job's
easy. We have to assassinate
a member of the Feudal

95
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,533
{\an1}Lord's clan in the
Land of Water.

96
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,903
{\an1}The story is that there's an
intra-clan fight over
succession, which is

97
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:45,271
{\an1}ridiculously common in the
Land of Water.

98
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,909
{\an1}The Hidden Mist can't
interfere in the affairs of
the Feudal Lord's Clan...

99
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,912
{\an1}And that's why they've
come to the Akatsuki
for help.

100
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,553
{\an1}This river's the border.
You ever been to the Land of
Water before?

101
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:03,955
{\an1}Never on a mission.

102
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,423
{\an1}Family vacation?

103
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,660
{\an1}You've got no sense of
humor, you know that?!

104
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:11,660
{\an1}Although...

105
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,030
{\an1}...you do know what'll
happen to a shinobi from
another village if he's

106
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:18,233
{\an1}found in the Land of Water,
right?

107
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,735
{\an1}The Hidden Mist doesn't
keep any prisoners.

108
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:25,739
{\an1}Shinobi that are captured
are killed after being forced
to divulge their jutsu.

109
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:28,609
{\an1}You know, you have it good,
Itachi.

110
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:35,113
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf is naive.
So you and Orochimaru can
traipse around as Rogue Ninja.

111
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:39,484
{\an1}But in the Hidden Mist,
there's a special unit that
tracks down Rogue Ninja.

112
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:42,119
{\an1}So if I ever get caught
in this village...

113
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:46,524
{\an1}Oh, yeah... Guess I forgot
about Formation C.

114
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:51,594
{\an1}If the Hidden Mist manages
to get me, then you'll have
to kill me immediately.

115
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,530
{\an1}If I have the chance.

116
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,533
{\an1}<i>What do you want me to do</i>
<i>for Formation D? </i>

117
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,003
{\an1}Nothing in particular.

118
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,705
Fine. Let's go.

119
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,717
{\an1}We're here. Are you any good
at infiltration?

120
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,952
{\an1}I'm average.

121
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:24,054
{\an1}Oh. Yeah? Okay, well, why
don't you show me?

122
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:29,693
[grunting]

123
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,696
Huh?!

124
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,434
[groaning]

125
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:43,038
{\an1}Please! Spare me!

126
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,806
{\an1}Look, I don't hold a
grudge against you.

127
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,542
{\an1}This is just a job
I have to do.

128
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,277
W-Wait! No!

129
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,181
Hey...

130
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:56,983
Yeah.

131
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:59,451
{\an1}Hidden Mist Jutsu!

132
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,722
{\an1}Wind Style! Supreme Typhoon!

133
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,625
{\an1}Wait, this is--!

134
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,898
{\an1}Damn. it's Lord Fourth!

135
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,467
The Mizukage?!

136
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,736
{\an1}Do you remember the warning
I gave you?

137
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,371
{\an1}But he's just a kid.

138
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:27,708
{\an1}He's also the Jinchuriki
of the Three Tails.

139
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,711
{\an1}And they're the Mist's
Shinobi Tracking Unit.

140
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:34,947
{\an1}Well, Juzo... I never
expected you to show your
face in the Village again,

141
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:36,482
{\an1}but... here we are.

142
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:39,718
{\an1}I didn't wanna come back
