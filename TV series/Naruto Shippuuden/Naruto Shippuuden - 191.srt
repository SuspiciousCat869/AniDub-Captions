00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,167
{\an1}Listen and enjoy, people
of the Leaf Village!

3
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:20,572
{\an1}I've come to provide a
moment's respite from
life's hardships with

4
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,541
{\an1}some festive song
and dance.

5
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:26,412
[applauding]

00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:31,850
{\an1}Hanare.

00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:17,699
{\an1}"Kakashi's Love Song"

8
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:30,613
{\an1}Good job on that mission,
guys.

9
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:35,952
{\an4}Yeah, we're great. But
what's really great is
that I can finally get
some Ichiraku ramen!

10
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,988
That does sound good.
Naruto... It's your
treat, right?

11
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:41,958
{\an1}What?! Oh, all right... I
guess so...

12
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,992
{\an1}Wait a second...

13
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,830
Sasuke! How about you
treating us for once?!

14
00:02:45,863 --> 00:02:48,532
{\an1}Huh. I'm gonna go
train, not eat.

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,202
{\an1}What about you Kakashi
Sensei?

16
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:52,203
{\an1}Hm?

17
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,618
Wow.

18
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,720
{\an1}That woman is so
beautiful!

19
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,822
{\an1}<i>And a criminal,</i>
<i>apparently. </i>

20
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,601
{\an4}I've heard she's a
kunoichi who disguised
herself as a street
performer so she could

21
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,736
{\an1}gather intel on the Land
of Fire.

22
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,674
{\an1}So she's actually a
spy. What happens now?

23
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:31,613
{\an4}<i>Well... she'll be</i>
<i>interrogated so we can</i>
<i>discover exactly what</i>
<i>she learned.</i>

24
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:36,752
{\an4}They'll use any and all
means at their disposal
until she confesses what
she knows.

25
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,974
{\an1}Welcome, come in.

26
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,610
{\an1}We call this the
Honesty Room.

27
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,122
{\an3}Hmm.

28
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:16,795
{\an4}She's must be quite well
trained indeed if she's
able to resist your
interrogation techniques.

29
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:21,701
{\an5}Not one scream escaped
her. All we heard was the
sound of her gritting her
teeth.

30
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:25,538
{\an1}My, what an impressive
kunoichi!

31
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:31,077
{\an5}Well, then, we'll just
have to reach into that
silence and listen to her
inner voice, instead.

32
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,880
{\an1}<i>I understand, sir. </i>

33
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,682
{\an1}Please summon
him for me.

34
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:40,554
{\an7}<i>Clouds...</i>

35
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:45,359
{\an7}<i>They look like clouds.</i>
<i>Just like the ones... </i>

36
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,330
{\an7}<i>...we saw that day... </i>

37
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:57,807
We're all finished
using pain. It's time for
a gentler approach.

38
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:00,810
{\an1}Heh.

39
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:34,245
{\an1}Now, Hanare. Your task
is to infiltrate the Land
of Fire and report back

40
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:36,515
{\an1}on the state of affairs
in the Leaf.

41
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,485
{\an1}<i>I'm to go to the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village...? </i>

42
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:43,123
{\an1}<i>Our nation has survived</i>
<i>all these the years not</i>
<i>because of our military</i>

43
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:46,893
{\an1}<i>might but rather due to</i>
<i>our skill at espionage.</i>

44
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:50,664
{\an1}We gather all of the
information we can from
the other nations.

45
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:55,803
{\an4}...use it to plan
strategies. And gain
advantage over opponents
in negotiations.

46
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,739
{\an1}That way, we can avert
potential conflicts.

47
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,176
{\an1}The fate of our nation
now rests in your hands,
Hanare.

48
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,679
{\an1}<i>Yes, sir! I will not</i>
<i>fail! </i>

49
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:15,624
<i>What's that? </i>

50
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,427
<i>That headband!</i>

51
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,298
{\an1}The Hidden Lock
Village... In the Land of
Key!

52
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,781
Uh!

53
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,034
{\an1}We captured her before
she was able to reach the
Leaf Village... She

54
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,336
{\an1}didn't learn anything of
importance.

55
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:03,944
{\an4}And now... it's my turn
to get some intel on your
village and why you were
sent here...

56
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:24,099
{\an4}What's going on...? Why
doesn't she have any
memories of her own
village?

57
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:28,771
[gasping]

58
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,208
{\an1}It was nothing...

59
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,754
[gasping]

60
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:50,928
[gasping]

61
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:55,065
{\an1}What?

62
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,138
Memories of me as a
child?

63
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:03,074
{\an1}Yeah, do you remember
anything about her?

64
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:06,279
No... I've never met her
before.

65
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:09,815
Oh, I see.

66
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:12,317
{\an1}Did you learn anything
else?

67
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,324
{\an4}Nothing significant. She
seems to have no memories
of the Hidden Lock
Village at all.

68
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:19,993
{\an1}I'm guessing that she
purged them.

69
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,394
Purged them?

70
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,701
{\an5}But... something else is
bothering me. Something I
can't quite put my finger
on...

71
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:31,405
And it's more than just
the fact that she had
memories of you. She's

72
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:34,776
hiding something...
something even I can't
dig up.

73
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,245
{\an1}I'm baffled.

74
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,250
{\an1}That's why you're
here. I need your help
with this, Kakashi.

75
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:45,721
{\an1}Huh? Me? But I'm not a
member of the Intel
Division!

76
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:49,191
Yes, but you have the
Sharingan...

77
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:52,561
{\an1}<i>You might be able to see</i>
<i>deeper into her psyche</i>
<i>than we can. </i>

78
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:15,086
[chatting]

79
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:21,059
{\an4}You must be some kind of
fool. You're showing me
around the very village I
infiltrated to spy on!

80
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,396
You won't see anything
here you wouldn't see in
any other village.

81
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,734
And I thought you could
use some air after being
in that stuffy room.

{\an1}Huh?

88
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:52,394
{\an1}What...? Uh huh... Uh
huh... What? No way!

89
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,829
Wait a minute, what
did you just say?!

90
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,765
{\an1}Oh, my, Kakashi Sensei...

91
00:09:58,967 --> 00:09:59,734
Huh?

92
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,675
{\an1}Kakashi's with her?!

93
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,678
So you're curious too,
huh?

94
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,446
{\an1}It's not like that, you
idiot.

95
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,948
Hey, it's that woman!

96
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:15,118
{\an1}<i>The one accused of being</i>
<i>a spy that we saw at the</i>
<i>gate! </i>

97
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,788
{\an1}<i>Yeah! The really pretty</i>
<i>lady! </i>

98
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:20,190
What's he doing with
someone like her?

99
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,225
Huh? Hey!

100
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:56,997
{\an7}You don't have to keep
your distance. I promise
I won't try to get
information out of you.

101
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,600
{\an7}I was just asked to spend
the day with you, that's
all.

102
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,804
{\an1}And once the day is done,
so is my assignment.

103
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,707
What will happen to me?

104
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,142
{\an1}I don't know...

105
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,447
{\an1}<i>That cloud... it looks</i>
<i>like Naruto to me... </i>

106
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:16,184
And next to that one
is... Sasuke maybe?

107
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,619
Is he serious?!

108
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:24,559
{\an4}When I look at the
clouds, I see my mother
and father, who gave life
to me.

109
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,864
{\an1}Although I never knew
them.

110
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:32,568
{\an7}When things were hard...
and I was sad... I'd
always look up at the
clouds...

111
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:37,540
{\an1}I'd stare at them and let
my imagination run free.
I'd daydream about the

112
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,645
{\an1}village where I was
born... and imagine what
my parents might be like.

113
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:49,187
{\an4}<i>Those daydreams helped me</i>
<i>endure my loneliness...</i>
<i>and the pain of not</i>
<i>knowing a home or family.</i>

114
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,957
{\an1}It was the only way I
could accept being
just a spy.

115
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,562
{\an1}I can't hear anything!

116
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:00,466
{\an1}They both seem so perfect
for each other, don't
they?!

117
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,567
Huh! Ridiculous.

118
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,037
{\an1}I'm gotta get closer so I
can hear!

119
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,374
I wasn't allowed to have
a home.

120
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,977
I was raised outside the
village, so that I
couldn't divulge any

121
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,413
{\an1}information about it if I
were captured.

122
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:20,954
{\an7}All this time... I've
risked my life on missions
for a homeland that I've
never even seen before.

123
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:26,562
{\an1}That's why having a home
and people who accept
me.. is so important.

124
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:37,706
{\an1}Why are you telling me
all this now when you've
been silent all day?

125
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,709
Because...

126
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,113
There's something that
you've taught me...

127
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:43,912
{\an1}Hmm?

128
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:47,584
I knew the moment I saw
you.

129
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,853
<i>That you were the boy</i>
<i>from my past. </i>

130
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,763
{\an1}<i>I had decided to meet my</i>
<i>parents, and so I set out</i>
<i>for my village. </i>

131
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:04,135
{\an1}<i>But I got lost. I was</i>
<i>feeling helpless when we</i>
<i>met... </i>

132
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:14,614
{\an1}<i>You told me</i>
<i>that...</i>

133
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:18,950
{\an1}<i>...whenever I was</i>
<i>feeling sad, I should</i>
<i>look up at the clouds... </i>

134
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:23,624
{\an4}<i>That as the clouds</i>
<i>changed shape, I could</i>
<i>turn them into whatever I</i>
<i>wanted. </i>

135
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:29,061
{\an4}<i>You promised that as long</i>
<i>as I had hope, the clouds</i>
<i>would give me the comfort</i>
<i>I needed. </i>

136
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:45,813
{\an1}<i>From then on,... I</i>
<i>searched the clouds for</i>
<i>your likeness. </i>

137
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:50,419
{\an7}That's why I recognized
you right away, even
though time had changed
you.

138
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:53,589
{\an7}Because you've always
been in my heart.

139
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:57,860
{\an1}You gave me hope when
things were darkest.

140
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,200
{\an1}Whoa. Things are really
starting to heat up!

142
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,268
{\an1}Careful! Or else you'll-

143
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,072
[screaming]

144
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,743

00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,754
[gasping]

146
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,189
{\an1}What are you three
doing?!

147
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,291
{\an1}Oh, well, you see...

148
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,026
Hey, what are
you doing?! Let go!

149
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,430
{\an1}Here you go!
Congratulations!

150
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,531
{\an1}Huh?!

151
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,235
{\an1}Thank you.

152
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,738
[giggling]

153
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:53,020
{\an4}We've received news that
the Hidden Lock has
captured Riichi, one of
our jonin.

154
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,822
{\an1}The Hidden Lock Village?

155
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:58,058
{\an8}We think the spy comes
from there. That
kunoichi.

156
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:04,232
{\an4}Yes. Hanare. And the Lock
Village has proposed that
we exchange her for
Riichi.

157
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:07,802
Fortunately for us, it
appears that she's
gathered very little

158
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:11,072
information about the
Land of Fire and our Leaf
Village.

159
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,409
{\an1}<i>So releasing her would be</i>
<i>harmless. </i>

160
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:14,776
Huh?!

161
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,315
{\an4}No, you can't! I
mean... I'm completely
opposed to giving her
back.

162
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:20,216
Hmm?

163
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,640
<i>It's not a</i>
<i>Transformation Jutsu. </i>

164
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,776
{\an1}That's Riichi. Without a
doubt.

165
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:44,610
{\an3}Mm.

166
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:50,215
{\an1}All right, then! One man
from each side will
accompany their prisoner

167
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,286
{\an1}to the center of the
bridge. And that's where
we'll make the exchange!

168
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,121
{\an1}Agreed?

169
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,324
Agreed!

170
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,097
Kakashi Sensei.

171
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,032
I never thought it would
end like this.

172
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:37,900
{\an1}I won't let you go.

173
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:38,901
[gasping]

174
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,544
{\an1}Hanare!

175
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,014
{\an1}Make sure you bring
back the intel on the
Hidden Leaf!

176
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:51,882
Mm.

177
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,254
{\an1}<i>Retreat! </i>

178
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,595
{\an1}Quick, it's already
started!

179
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:08,734
Hm?

180
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,106
{\an1}Give it up! There's no
escape, old man.

181
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,478
Don't underestimate the
ninja of the Lock.

182
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:22,884
{\an7}Once a key turns a lock
closed, not even death
can open it!

183
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,219
{\an1}Uh!

184
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,372
{\an1}So you knew... But
how?!

185
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,274
{\an1}It was that day.

186
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:50,513
{\an1}<i>You were weaving a sign</i>
<i>with your eye movements. </i>

187
00:17:54,617 --> 00:18:00,089
{\an5}Without even realizing
it, my Sharingan followed
the sign, and I learned
your jutsu.

188
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:05,061
When I used it, I was
able to see inside my own
mind.

189
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:09,333
{\an1}<i>That right eye of yours</i>
<i>doesn't look at the</i>
<i>outside world. </i>

190
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:13,438
{\an1}<i>It gazes into your inner</i>
<i>world, inside your own</i>
<i>mind. </i>

191
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:17,843
{\an5}And it can peer into the
thoughts of anyone who
infiltrates your mind as
well.

192
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,981
{\an1}<i>You purposely let</i>
<i>yourself be captured so</i>
<i>you could lure your</i>

193
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,050
{\an1}<i>interrogator into your</i>
<i>mind.</i>

194
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:30,790
{\an4}<i>Then you secretly</i>
<i>gathered intel from his</i>
<i>mind without him even</i>
<i>knowing it. </i>

195
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:35,529
{\an4}<i>You could access every</i>
<i>bit of information</i>
<i>Inoichi had about the</i>
<i>Leaf. </i>

196
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:40,734
{\an1}<i>And you'd take all that</i>
<i>data with you after we</i>
<i>exchanged prisoners. </i>

197
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,975
{\an4}<i>At first, I was opposed</i>
<i>to the swap. But I knew</i>
<i>it was our best chance to</i>
<i>rescue Riichi. </i>

198
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,879
We planned to return you
to the Lock to get Riichi
back... and then

199
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:54,349
{\an1}recapture you to stop you
from handing over your
intel.

200
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,351
{\an1}You didn't have to do
that...

201
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,486
{\an1}The information I
gathered...

202
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,589
{\an1}I erased it from my mind.

203
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,426
{\an1}You really expect me
to believe that?

204
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,464
{\an1}Use your Sharingan and
see for yourself.

205
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:18,009
{\an1}Please. I want you to. Do
this so I'll know that
you'll believe me.

206
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,442
Hanare.

207
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:23,381
{\an1}The Leaf Village was just
what I'd imagined my real
home would be like.

208
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:29,186
{\an4}<i>Walking through it with</i>
<i>you I felt like I'd come</i>
<i>home, even though it was</i>
<i>my first time there. </i>

209
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,558
{\an1}<i>When Naruto and his</i>
<i>friends gave us their</i>
<i>blessing, I felt like I</i>

210
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,760
{\an1}<i>was accepted into the</i>
<i>village.</i>

211
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:38,463
{\an1}I truly believed it...
That's why...

212
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:43,002
{\an1}I won't do it. I won't
betray the place... that
I call home.

213
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,904
Hanare, I--

214
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:48,641
{\an1}Even if I go back now,
I'll most likely be
arrested for deleting the

215
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,377
{\an1}intel I had, and I'll be
executed.

216
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:55,849
{\an1}If I'm going to die
anyway, I want to die at
your hands!

217
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:59,620
{\an7}Then I can die
believing, for the first
time...

218
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:04,458
{\an7}I was able to do
something good For the
only place that's felt
like home...

219
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,728
{\an1}<i>For my birthplace... </i>

220
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:11,566
I can't kill someone
who has lost her pride as
a ninja.

221
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,305
{\an5}A true ninja... never
allows their emotions to get
in the way of the mission
that they've been given.

222
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:23,512
{\an1}I wanted us to face as
two ninja, fighting to
the death... but now...

223
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:26,415
{\an1}So that's it? That's your
answer, then?

224
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,854
{\an3}Go.

225
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,031
Kakashi Sensei!

226
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,234
Where's Hanare?

227
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:50,909
{\an4}I guess she felt cornered
and had no other
recourse. She threw
herself off the cliff.

228
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,013
{\an1}She was an admirable
ninja.

229
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,481
She did what...?!

230
00:20:55,514 --> 00:21:00,386
{\an1}But you... You can't be
okay with this Kakashi
Sensei; I mean, what if

231
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,123
{\an1}that lady really was in
love with you, and you
guys could've-

232
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:06,026
{\an1}Enough! It doesn't matter
now...

233
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:59,414
{\an1}<i>Hey, Neji! Can we</i>
<i>interview you? </i>

234
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:03,419
{\an1}<i>We decided to do a</i>
<i>newspaper article about</i>
<i>Naruto's accomplishments!</i>

235
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,922
{\an1}<i>Sorry, but you'll have to</i>
<i>ask someone else. </i>

236
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,291
{\an1}<i>That's awfully mean of</i>
<i>you, Neji. </i>

237
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,928
{\an1}<i>All the younger students</i>
<i>have really been looking</i>
<i>forward to this! </i>

238
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,463
<i>Please! </i>

239
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:16,201
{\an1}<i>Oh, all right. I'll tell</i>
<i>you guys a very special</i>
<i>story... </i>

240
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:20,504
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Neji</i>
<i>Chronicles.</i>

241
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,775
{\an1}<i>Now... listen very</i>
<i>closely.</i>
