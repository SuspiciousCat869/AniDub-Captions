Shikamaru! What's goin on?

{\an3}Huh?

5

{\an5}The first round of the
Chunin Exams is going
to be held here,

6
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,501
so we're making
a few upgrades.

7
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:12,936
{\an1}The Chunin Exams? It's
sure been a while since
they held them!

8
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,603
Yep, two
years now...

9
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,269
{\an1}That means we get to
participate this time!

10
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,571
{\an1}That's so cool! We're all
gonna get to become chunin!

11
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,338
{\an1}Hold up. You three are
still Academy students.

12
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,338
You're not even
genin yet so you
can't participate.

13
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:30,272
That's kind of a
disappointment, but
also a big relief...!

14
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:34,340
{\an1}Hold on! That means
Big Brother Naruto's
coming back, right?!

15
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,641
Huh, Naruto?

16
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,175
{\an1}Isn't he coming back to
take the Chunin Exams?

17
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,209
He's not coming.

18

{\an4}I don't even know if he's even
heard the news that we're gonna
hold the Chunin  Exams again...

21
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:57,345
{\an1}They're really gonna
go ahead without
Big Brother Naruto?

22
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,214
It's not like the
village plans things
to fit his schedule.

23

{\an1}Big Brother's gonna
get left behind...

24

{\an1}Yeah! Our boss is
gonna be disqualified!

25

the Hidden Sand! We've
just gotta become Chunin, OK!?

26

get all worked up.

calm down, Yukata.

29

going to be a proctor
for the exams.

30
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,923
That isn't surprising.
That's because he's
already a chunin.

31
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:55,792
{\an1}Then I say we should just
buckle down and get
promoted to chunin, too!

You're all registered.

preventing us from submitting an
application, is there?

37
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:18,797
{\an8}Well, the exam's
details are up to the

144
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:41,345
{\an1}This exam isn't only about
solving the questions on
it. The test's a test.

145
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:44,180
{\an1}Quit saying things
that'll confuse me more!

146
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:49,248
{\an1}<i>None of the three questions</i>
<i>are that difficult...</i>
<i>unless you're really dumb.</i>

147
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,815
{\an1}<i>...anyone can solve</i>
<i>even the fifty point</i>
<i>question...</i>

148
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:56,249
{\an1}Don't underestimate me!
I don't quit and I
don't run! No way!

149
00:10:56,282 --> 00:11:02,617
{\an4}I don't care if I'm stuck as a
genin for the rest of my life,
I'll still be Hokage some day!

150
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:07,651
{\an4}<i>[Neji Thoughts]</i>
<i>Come to think of it, there</i>
<i>was a guy like that.</i>

151
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:12,719
{\an1}<i>He couldn't answer one question</i>
<i>in the first round exam, but</i>
<i>he passed.</i>

152
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:18,587
{\an1}<i>Which means They're not testing</i>
<i>our problem-solving skills.</i>
<i>It's the same as last time!</i>

153
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:31,224
{\an7}<i>Now then... 100 points is</i>
<i>either 30, 30, and 40, or</i>
<i>50, 50, and 0.</i>

154
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:37,024
{\an1}So what's the
point of this
first round?

155
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:39,692
{\an4}The point of it is to try to
think of the score that the

156
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:42,125
{\an1}other two team members
are going to get.

157
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,060
{\an1}Or rather, how to make your
fellow team members get a
certain score.

158
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:49,861
{\an4}Although that gives an advantage
to any of the teams who might

159
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,862
{\an1}know jutsu that enable them
to contact each other.

160
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,829
{\an1}If that's their solution to
this, then that's fine.

161
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:01,297
{\an1}That just means those teams that
have those skills will get a
hundred points.

162
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,730
{\an1}And the rest have to suck it up
and figure something out, huh?

163
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:09,631
{\an1}The last Chunin Exams'
first-round was just
like this, wasn't it?

164
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,565
{\an1}The point count isn't
what's important.

165
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:17,067
{\an1}The Chunin Exams are
intended to illuminate who's
team-captain material.

166
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,068
{\an1}If the point was to test
strength, I wouldn't be a
chunin.

167
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,667
That's for sure.

168
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,135
{\an1}Thanks for having
my back...

169
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:47,106
[buzzing]

170
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,708
[gasp]

171
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:56,008
{\an8}<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>It's completely</i>
<i>sealed off...</i>

172
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:00,475
{\an1}Big Brother Neji?

173
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:13,712
{\an1}<i>Double paned windows, huh? They</i>
<i>made sure we couldn't contact</i>
<i>our teammates...</i>

174
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,113
{\an1}Should you be walking
around like that?

175
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,813
{\an1}We were told a few rules
at the beginning,

176
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,614
{\an1}but no one's reprimanded us
yet for talking like this.

177
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:25,249
I see...

178
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:28,882
{\an1}In other words, they
don't care if we
cheat or not.

179
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:32,949
{\an1}Yes, of course. The last
time around, the first
exam was about cheating.

180
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,951
It won't open...

181
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,219
{\an1}Leave it to Shikamaru
to come up with a
difficult exam.

182
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:48,287
{\an1}For this test, if you're able to
contact your teammates somehow,

183
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,786
you gain a very
significant advantage

184
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,888
{\an1}But no one on my team
uses such ninjutsu.

185
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:57,322
{\an1}I wonder if Shino has come
up with any ideas yet...

186
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:02,556
{\an1}The only thing left to try
is to guess which questions
my teammates will solve.

187
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,923
{\an4}<i>If we just choose the number</i>
<i>that we each drew, </i>

188
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:08,057
{\an1}<i>then our point total will</i>
<i>be over one hundred.</i>

189
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:11,424
<i>(Komugi)</i>
<i>Going over a hundred points</i>
<i>means disqualification.  </i>

190
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,725
{\an1}... <i>We have to avoid</i>
<i>that at all cost.</i>

191
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:19,959
{\an1}So if one of us just scores zero
points, then we'll avoid going
over one hundred, right?

192
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:24,294
{\an1}But there's no guarantee the
other two will both pick the
fifty-point question.

193
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:28,262
{\an1}And if the point total is too
low, there's a good possibility

194
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:31,196
of being disqualified
because of a low average.

195
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:36,763
{\an1}If all of us were to solve the
thirty-point question, Then
we'd end up with ninety points.

196
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,998
{\an1}But then we would just
lose out to the team that
has one hundred points!

197
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:44,165
{\an1}Besides, if a lot of teams get
100, they'll raise the average

198
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,531
{\an1}and teams with 90 points
will be disqualified.

199
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:55,001
{\an1}I guess finding a way to
escape won't be possible.

200
00:14:55,034 --> 00:15:02,236
{\an5}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>The choices are, 30, 30,</i>
<i>and 40... or 0, 50, and</i>
<i>50 to score 100 points.</i>

201
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,137
{\an4}So the question is, how do we
figure out which question each
team member is going to solve?

202
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:12,171
{\an1}How am I supposed to know what
questions Ino and Sakura will
pick?

203
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:15,404
{\an1}And what exactly
are Shino and Kiba
thinking of doing?

204
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:20,039
{\an1}Those two are probably busy
wondering the very same thing
about you right now.

205
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:23,406
{\an1}Got it! I finally
figured it out!

206
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,673
What? Really,
you did!?

207
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:28,208
{\an1}Yes! I got the answer to
the 50 point question!

208
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,808
Oh, I see...

209
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,376
I will not show
you, though!

210
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:35,110

don't have to look...

214
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:59,681
{\an7}<i>Who are you...? You don't</i>
<i>seem to be an Insect User.</i>

215
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:05,383
{\an1}I hate to say this... but if
Naruto were here, this
first-round exam would be easy.

216
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,917
Huh? Why's that?

217
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,183
{\an1}I mean, you just know that
he'd score zero points.

218
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:14,385
{\an1}Well... I'm pretty sure that
even Naruto could solve the
thirty-point question.

219
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,785
Nope, no way.

220
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,652
{\an1}Leave it to
Naruto...

221
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:23,387
{\an1}I mean it really would be
much simpler for our team
if Lee were as dumb as that.

222
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,354
{\an1}Uh, hey,
excuse me?

223
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,687
What is it?

224
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,454
{\an1}So, uh... can you tell
me what we're supposed
to do for this test?

225
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,454
{\an1}What do you think we've all
been trying to figure out?!

226
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:39,823
{\an1}Oh, you guys, too, huh?  Yeah,
these questions are, like,
seriously hard, aren't they?

227
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,723
Uh, yeah...
they are...

228
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:52,226
{\an4}Doesn't it seem that the safest
thing to do is for each of us to
just choose the 30-point
question?

229
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,426
{\an1}But what about that average
score thing he talked about?

230
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,361
{\an1}Oh, I see. Then we have to
score one hundred points,
no matter what.

231
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,895
{\an4}I can barely even
figure out how to get
one hundred points!

{\an1}Let's continue your
lesson right here.

{\an1}Uh... Oh. Okay.

Eight Trigrams:
Air Palm...

285
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,110
{\an1}With all your might...

286

way you need to go about
about solving this question.
