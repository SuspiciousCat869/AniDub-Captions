up with some autograph?

I to you, huh!?

how to control the power
of the Nine Tails!

141
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,869
{\an7}I have to do this!
I can't run away
from it!

142

the same thing, too!
Those statues are just
there to scare you!

Fools! Ya fools!!

{\an1}So, is this...

156
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:10,073
{\an4}You need to go in
there, sit down,
close your eyes,
and focus...

157
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:14,210
{\an4}Just like at the
waterfall. Then
you'll meet up with
your Tailed Beast.

158

ago, back when I
was in training...

159
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:21,750
{\an4}...I was taught a
drill that allowed me
to meet the Nine Tails
inside of my  mind.

160
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:25,154
{\an1}Yeah, sure. All

that!

{\an7}<i>[Bee]</i>

163
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:48,274
{\an8}Naruto, what kind of
Sealing Jutsu was used
on your Nine Tails?
Answer my question.

164
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,075
{\an8}Umm...

165
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,608
{\an7}It's a Tetragram
Seal.

166
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:54,746
{\an1}Tetragram Seal, huh?
I gotta say, that's
impressive.

167
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,183
{\an1}It's even more solid
than my Steel Shell Seal.

168
00:15:58,216 --> 00:15:59,884
{\an1}<i>[Bee]</i>

170
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:07,191
{\an1}Alright! But only
because you say so,
Great Lord Elder!

171
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:14,697
{\an1}[gasp] What is this?

172
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,635
{\an4}A key left by the
Fourth Hokage to lock
and unlock the Sealing
Jutsu on your belly!

173
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,338
{\an3}Yeah.

174
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:25,575
{\an7}So you'll really have
to undo the seal...

175
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:31,979
{\an7}But what if Naruto isn't
able to control it?! What
happens if the Nine Tails
fully manifests!?

176
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:35,015
{\an1}Then we'll just have
to seal him away in
here!

to get a new host.
