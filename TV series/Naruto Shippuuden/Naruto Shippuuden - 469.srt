1
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:21,438
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) All right, with that</i>
<i>being said, our mission is now</i>
<i>over!</i>

2
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:22,905
{\an1}You're all dismissed.

3
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:27,475
{\an1}Already?! It's only ten in the
morning! Our missions
have been so boring!

4
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:30,609
When are we gonna get an
S-rank mission? Come on!

5
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:33,644
{\an1}Hmph! "S-rank?" Yeah,
right. A loser like you?

6
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:36,913
{\an1}What are you talking about?
We're still only genin,
remember?

7
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:40,449
{\an1}I want something with more
pizazz, more oomph! So...?

8
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,850
{\an1}There just aren't any
missions. Anyway, dismissed!

9
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,618
[groan]

10
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,620
{\an1}You heard him! So, Sasuke, how
about today, the two of us...

11
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,521
I'm going home.

12
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:53,023
{\an1}Wait. Just hold on a minute.

13
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,525
{\an1}I know of one S-rank
mission the three of us could
actually do right now.

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,560
Hm?

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,195
{\an1}A mission that's failed again
and again, one that only we can
pull off...

16
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,630
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) To see what Kakashi</i>
<i>Sensei's face really looks like!</i>

17
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:10,233
{\an1}Let's find out our target's
best-kept secret!

18
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,061
{\an1}Do you even know
what you're saying?

19
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:59,464
{\an1}Listen, just forget about
that. It's impossible!

20
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,465
I mean, right, Sasuke?

21
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,300
{\an1}This would be the perfect
mission for a day like today!

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,034
(giggling) I couldn't
agree more.

23
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:10,137
{\an1}Sasuke! How could you? You
betrayed me! Cha!

24
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,670
[chuckling]

25
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,673
{\an1}But what do we do? Every single
time we try this it never goes
well.

26
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:20,177
{\an1}[chuckling] Not to worry! I
already have a plan!

27
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,310
What is it?

28
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,844
{\an1}Photographs!

29
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:25,846
{\an1}If we go through every single
photo Kakashi Sensei is in,

30
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,947
{\an1}there's bound to be at least one
without a mask.

31
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,950
{\an1}Actually, I never told you this,
but I already checked them out
once before.

32
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:35,385
{\an1}And he has a mask on in every
one!

33
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:39,720
{\an1}The photo submitted to the
Hokage for the Ninja
Registration Form.

34
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,689
{\an1}That should be a picture of him
where he isn't wearing a mask.

35
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:47,892
{\an1}But of course, it's an extremely
classified, top-secret document.

36
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,693
{\an1}Getting your hands on it won't
be an easy task.

37
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,895
{\an1}He overheard us!

38
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:56,298
{\an7}<i>Oh, who cares if he overheard us</i>
<i>or not!</i>

39
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,798
Who are you?

40
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,832
{\an1}I'm Sukea. I'm a photographer.

41
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,302
{\an1}I travel from east to west
looking for stories.

42
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,002
{\an1}Not north or south?

43
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,104
{\an1}Naruto! Stop getting hung up on
insignificant details!

44
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:11,640
{\an1}Well, anyway, I was on
the hunt for a scoop,

45
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:14,208
{\an1}and I happened to overhear your
fascinating conversation.

46
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:17,143
{\an1}He did hear us! Let's get
rid of him! Ready?

47
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,477
{\an3}Idiot!

48
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:19,844
Owie...

49
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:21,779
{\an1}This guy's right.

50
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:26,915
{\an1}That is the regulation. The
Ninja Registration Form photo
must show your face.

51
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,184
{\an1}It's so obvious, but none of us
even thought about looking there
before now.

52
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:35,887
{\an1}So listen, do you think you guys
would let me tag along with you
on this little adventure?

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,921
{\an1}And why would you want to do
that?

54
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:42,258
{\an1}It's simple! If I'm able to
capture this Kakashi guy without
a mask on,

55
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,393
{\an1}it'll be the biggest scoop since
the Leaf was established!

56
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:49,562
{\an1}Even if it were to get hushed
up, I'd be sure to make a lot of
money on this.

57
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:54,065
{\an1}Oh! Hey! Hey! Hold on! When you
get the money, you gotta treat
us to ramen! Promise?

58
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:57,033
{\an1}I'll even throw in some gyoza.
Does that sound good?

59
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,934
{\an1}Hm! Now this is getting
interesting.

60
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,904
{\an1}[sighs] I don't know you guys.

61
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:08,106
{\an1}Aw yeah! I'm getting excited
about this! [giggles]

62
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:18,679
This is where they
store secret documents.

63
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:25,216
{\an1}This'll be an infiltration
mission. Sukea, you think you'll
be able to keep up?

64
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,517
{\an1}I don't think it'll
be a problem.

65
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,653
{\an1}Before I became a photographer,
I was a rank-and-file ninja.

66
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:33,921
{\an1}All right! Let's get this
mission started!

67
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:38,857
[yawn]

68
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,532
{\an1}You're still not done, Sasuke?!

69
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:52,733
{\an1}Shut up! Just hold on!

70
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,568
{\an1}Can we switch places?
Just for a moment?

71
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,302
Hm?

72
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,274
Wow, it opened!
That's awesome!

73
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:10,443
{\an1}So, Sukea, what division
did you belong to before?

74
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:14,212
{\an1}Oh, I was in the Intel Unit that
reported to Lord Hokage.

75
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:16,079
Wait, he means the...

76
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:17,780
{\an1}ANBU Black Ops.

77
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:18,514
[gasps]

78
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,782
{\an1}Well some things happened,
and now I'm retired.

79
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:25,285
{\an1}Given your past, is it wise for
you to be doing this?

80
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,687
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) You'll be targeted by</i>
<i>the ANBU.</i>

81
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,490
{\an1}Don't worry about it, I'll be
just fine. C'mon, let's go!

82
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:40,227
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) We have to search all</i>
<i>these?</i>

83
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,662
{\an1}<i>(Sukea) Let's hurry.</i>

84
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:56,337
{\an1}Found it! This is it!

85
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,473
{\an1}All right, let's open it up!

86
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,344
{\an1}No way! The moment is finally
here!

87
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,752
{\an1}<i>(ANBU) Don't move!</i>

88
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,186
[gasps]

89
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:29,256
{\an1}We're taking you in. Make a move
and we'll assume you're
resisting.

90
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,557
{\an1}And we may have to take you
down.

91
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:34,993
Uh oh! I feel like
I'm gonna sneeze!

92
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:35,993
{\an1}Idiot! Hold it in!

93
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,530
{\an1}Damn it! And we were so close,
too!

94
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,871
{\an1}Really? An infiltration mission?

95
00:07:55,905 --> 00:08:00,542
{\an1}I know. I'm really sorry about
that. I tried to stop them, but
they insisted on doing it.

96
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:01,775
{\an1}What? You jerk!

97
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:05,110
{\an1}So right from the start, you
planned on blaming us if this
failed?!

98
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:08,346
{\an1}They just wanted to see what
your face really looked like!

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,448
You're a former ANBU
Black Ops, right?

100
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:17,317
{\an1}Honestly, it's ridiculous! Who
cares what I look like
underneath this mask, anyway?!

101
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,653
{\an1}[uncomfortable chuckle]

102
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:26,290
You've really got
some nerve blaming us!

103
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:29,858
{\an1}I thought it was pretty strange
that you wanted to join us.

104
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:33,794
{\an1}You're skilled and a former
ANBU, so you could've easily
done this alone.

105
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,962
{\an1}I can't stand handsome guys who
think they can get away with
awful things.

106
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,963
{\an1}Sorry, sorry!

107
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,898
{\an1}How about I make it up to you by
helping you photograph Kakashi's
face?

108
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:45,067
{\an1}Take advantage of my
photography skills!

109
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,068
{\an1}What? You still wanna do this?

110
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,436
{\an1}Why not? Are you gonna
give up already?

111
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,839
{\an1}Uh, all right. So what's your
plan?

112
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,072
{\an1}Let's go for Kakashi himself.

113
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:57,174
{\an1}We'll lure him out to a meal,
then photograph him while he
eats.

114
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,477
{\an1}We already tried doing that a
whole bunch of times, but
nothing we did ever worked.

115
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:06,646
{\an1}Every single time, right at the
very moment when we'd have a
chance to see his face,

116
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,980
{\an1}we'd get interrupted.

117
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:13,518
{\an1}Well, with this multi-exposure
camera I built, I bet we can get
at least one photo.

118
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,289
{\an1}Sensei! I need to talk to you
about something very important,
ya know?!

119
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:23,890
{\an1}What is it?

120
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:24,524
{\an3}Uhh.

121
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:28,059
{\an1}[chuckling] Actually, why don't
we eat some dumplings while we
talk?

122
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,961
{\an1}Okay, I'm ready to go.

123
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,530
Well all right, don't
mind if I do!

124
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,845
{\an1}Oh, hey, Naruto! You guys out
taking a little break, too?

125
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,045
[worried gasp]

126
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,782
{\an1}Don't bother us right now!
We're doing something really
important!

127
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,482
Like what?

128
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:09,150
[panting]

129
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:13,420
I was just about to
find that out.

130
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,821
{\an7}<i>What?! He already ate them?</i>

131
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:22,124
{\an7}<i>[giggling] But this time, we got</i>
<i>him on camera! [giggling]</i>

132
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:38,100
How can this be?
It's impossible!

133
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,968
{\an1}Are you kidding? Not a single
one?

134
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:44,004
{\an1}It feels like some divine
power's at work here.

135
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:47,740
{\an1}Yeah. that's a shame. Oh well, I
guess this means,

136
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:53,176
{\an1}we'll have to say that the
mission is over and
dismissed, huh?

137
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:03,782
All right! I guess it's
time for me to be...

138
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,082
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Hey, Naruto!</i>

139
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,320
{\an1}You wanna tell me what's really
going on out here?

140
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,255
{\an1}Oh, hey! What's up you guys?

141
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,530

drowned, right over there, on

you're ready!

{\an1}What the hell is going on here?

215
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,479
{\an1}Was Kakashi Sensei on to us
right from the very start?

216
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,420
{\an1}Well, it's too bad. But I really
am grateful to all of you.

217
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:56,657
{\an1}No way! We all had such an
awesome time! And it's actually
because of you, Sukea!

218
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,624
So thank you!

219

comes up!

223

{\an1}It was quite a coincidence that
Kiba happened to show up at the
dumpling shop.

224
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,249
{\an1}Huh, who would have thought that
all of them would team up?

225
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,851
{\an1}I think that something like this
is good for them, at least every
once in a while.

226
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:46,620
{\an1}Yeah, but I gotta say, this
really wore me out!

227
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:50,555
{\an1}It's tiring to use so many
Clones and Transformations.

228
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:56,324
{\an1}It was a really close call with
my mask because everyone had
such good teamwork.

229
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:01,162
{\an1}Of course, even if they did get
the mask off, there wouldn't
have been any real harm done.

230
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,765
{\an1}Because I'm wearing a back-up
mask underneath. [chuckles]

{\an1}[sighs] I still think food is
the best way.

00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,501
{\an1}Yeah, it probably
is our best chance.

233
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:17,738
{\an1}But the problem is, how do we
get Kakashi Sensei to eat with
us?
