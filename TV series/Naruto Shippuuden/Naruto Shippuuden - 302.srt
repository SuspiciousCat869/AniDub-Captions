I told you,
you fool...!

00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:16,802
...You're way too
old for this kind
of thing now...

Ohnoki with that this
entire time, weren't you?

00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:45,096
{\an5}You switched him out

13
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,890
{\an1}Alright! We've
got him!

14
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,391

working..!

{\an1}What the hell's that?

25
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,826
Could it be
another genjutsu?

26
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,728
{\an1}Genjutsu...?

27
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,896
No, that's no

28

{\an5}...that's the
Infinite Explosion
Ninjutsu of the
Misukage!

29
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:41,103
It gave my
predecessor Lord Mu
some real trouble.

30
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,971
<i>It's the Steam Imp!</i>

31
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:37,409
[gasps]

32
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:39,845
Hail...?

33
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:43,514
All the moist air that
was forced upward by the
steam explosion earlier

34
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:46,450
must have been cooled
in the upper atmosphere
and turned into hail!

35
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,831
{\an1}It's shirking!

36
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:08,605
<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

37
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:13,276
{\an1}It's a clone comprised
of oil and water taken
from the Misukage's body.

38
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:18,647
{\an5}The exterior surface of
its childlike form is
composed of oil, while
the interior is water.

39
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,617
It's special feature is
that it can both heat up
and cool down easily...

40
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:27,089
{\an1}When it moves around, the
oil on its surface increases
in temperature precipitously,

41
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:30,491
{\an1}which in turn causes rapid
vaporization of the water
inside...

42
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,860
...resulting in a
steam explosion!

43
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:39,200
{\an4}<i>And when the hail cools</i>
<i>it, it shrinks back down</i>
<i>to its original size and</i>
<i>is ready to explode again!</i>

44
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,237
{\an1}It's coming!

45
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,377
{\an7}<i>It's faster than</i>
<i>I imagined...</i>

46
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:54,247
[grunts]

47
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,215
{\an1}Are you alright!?

48
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,717
{\an1}Damn it! This
clone's a wily one!

49
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:07,859
{\an5}The real Misukage should
be nearby. Don't bother
with the Imp. Just go
after the original!

50
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:13,264
{\an4}Another feature of
this jutsu is that it
greatly weakens the
caster while in use..!

51
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:19,603
{\an7}<i>The brat Ohnoki! He</i>
<i>sure knows a lot...</i>
<i>Mu must've told him.</i>

52
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:26,243
{\an4}If it's not a mirage genjutsu,
and he can't make himself
disappear, then I should be
able to sense him...

53
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,680
{\an1}[gasp] He's
behind that rock!

54
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,916
{\an7}<i>Oh! Damn my back!</i>

55
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,386
{\an8}<i>Of all the times</i>
<i>for it to go out!</i>
<i>I can't move at all!</i>

56
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,328
Oh, found me, huh?

57
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:49,564
Before it stops
hailing...

58
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:52,466
{\an1}I shall seal you!

59
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,743
{\an1}What's happening!?

60
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:06,479
{\an1}Is it just me, or is
he getting bigger!?

61
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:09,049
{\an1}It's just as Lord
Tsuchikage said..!

62
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:14,087
{\an4}The more it moves around,
the faster the oil heats
up and vaporizes the water
inside...!

63
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,055
The hail's
stopped, too!

64
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,623
Another explosion of
steam is imminent!

65
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,961
{\an1}We've trapped
the original!

66
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,768
[gasp]

67
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,306
Hey there!

68
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,273
{\an1}Damn!

69
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,208
Uh oh!

70
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:41,746
This really is a
perfect hidey-hole!

71
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,220
{\an1}I was once one of
the five Kage, too...

72
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:54,391
{\an4}As long as I still have
my oil, your Sand Jutsu
simply won't be able to
touch me!

73
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,427
{\an1}Unless, of course,
you can seal me up
real quick!

74
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,764
{\an1}That does seem
to be the case...

75
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,634
Now...! How are
you going to take
me down, then?

76
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,270
{\an1}Honestly I was hoping
<i>you'd</i> tell us!

77
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,671
[groan]

78
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:13,075
{\an1}Nah, I've changed my
mind, I'm done with
that...

79
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,510
Sorry, everyone!

80
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,845
{\an1}You were cooperative
until just now!

81
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,314
{\an1}What, have you decided
to help the enemy!?

82
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,417
Nope! Wrong!

83
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,286
I mean I am a former
Kage after all...

84
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,391
And actually, I am still
helping you out! Only in
a different way...

85
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,225
{\an1}Which way is
<i>that</i> exactly!?

86
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:37,831
{\an4}If you can't beat me using
all of your abilities,
then you're worse off
than I am you old fool!

87
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,502
You'll never win against
the enemy boss this way!

88
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,643
{\an1}It's gonna explode!

89
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:52,378
Run!!

90
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,778
Retreat!!

91
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:59,684
{\an5}Just when I'd thought
that I'd found the
Golden Child of the
Five Kage...

92
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:03,121
Kazekage! You're just
an ordinary child!

93
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:04,322

{\an1}That's... a Sand Shield!

99
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,151
{\an1}Lord Kazekage has
protected us!

100
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,588
But where is
Lord Gaara?

101
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:56,470
{\an4}I'm impressed! You attacked
knowing you'd get hurt,
while protecting everyone
at the same time!

102
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:02,075
But if you don't stop
this, the same thing
will keep happening!

103
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:20,459
{\an1}Heh. THe hail's stopped.
Here comes the next round.

104
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:27,198
You mistimed getting
your guard up because
of its sudden expansion!

105
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,670
Another Sand Clone,
huh? Well, that's
within expectations...

106
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:47,117
The real one was hiding
below, just as I'd
guessed! What'll you do?

107
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,884
But what now..?

108
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,787
It's going to
explode again!

109
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:59,061
{\an1}The speed of your sand
is no match! You'll
never catch him! So-- huh?

110
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:09,704
{\an7}<i>How did he do that?</i>
<i>Is his sand getting</i>
<i>faster...?</i>

111
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:24,618
But either
way... Ka boom!

112
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,757
Even more smoke!

113
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,126
{\an1}that's gotta be where
they are! Let's go!

114
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:48,440
{\an7}<i>It stopped moving...</i>

115
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,678
{\an8}<i>Is that...</i>
<i>Gold...?</i>

116
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:59,783
{\an7}<i>Did he mix in that Gold</i>
<i>Dust his father left</i>
<i>behind and do something</i>
<i>to the Imp?</i>

117
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,491
{\an4}There was Gold Dust
hidden away within
that Sand Clone from
earlier...

118
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:12,362
{\an1}<i>I took advantage of that </i>
<i>thing's heat to melt and</i>
<i>then bond the gold to it.</i>

119
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,764
{\an1}<i>Gold is about 20</i>
<i>times heavier than</i>
<i>water....</i>

120
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:19,202
{\an1}...which is why
its movements has
become sluggish.

121
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:25,642
{\an7}<i>(Second Mizukage)</i>
<i>And why the sand</i>
<i>trapped it so easily...</i>

122
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:29,044
But still, why didn't
the Imp explode, then?

123
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:33,114
{\an4}The sand that I mixed
with the hail was
enough to cool this
thing down...

124
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:36,485
{\an1}Gold also has good
thermal conductivity

125
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,920
{\an4}...which came in
handy for chilling
its water vapor
and steam.

126
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:44,592
{\an1}That was well played.
Truly an act befitting
a current Kage!

127
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,861
I'm impressed you
came up with such
a strategy!

128
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:52,399
Wait a minute...

129
00:12:54,834 --> 00:13:03,108

{\an1}What an impressive
Sealing Jutsu!

143
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:13,696
{\an1}<i>If I remember correctly,</i>
<i>Mu's Jutsu is not cloning,</i>
<i>but fission...</i>

144
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:20,001
{\an4}<i>Because the real body</i>
<i>splits into two, it's</i>
<i>fast and he doesn't</i>
<i>need to use hand signs.</i>

145
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,069
<i>But his power</i>
<i>is halved.</i>

146
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:26,240
{\an1}<i>It's going to take this</i>
<i>one some time to summon</i>
<i>that one...</i>

147
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,209
<i>...given his</i>
<i>weakened state...</i>

148
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:35,450
<i>I'll have to buy</i>
<i>more time with </i>
<i>another tactic, then...</i>

149
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,485
Are you all
right, Gaara!?

150
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:40,454
{\an1}What's the news
on your end?

151
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:42,622
We sealed the
Third Raikage.

152
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:47,794
{\an4}I saw something had exploded,
so I raced here faster than
Temari and the others to see
of I could help out.

153
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:48,961
{\an1}I see.

154
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,263
{\an1}We're almost done, too.

155
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:55,167
Good. But hold on,
where is your enemy?

156
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,137
Look at that! So you
really do have friends!

157
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,306
{\an1}Huh? What!? What
is he!?

158
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,542
He's got a really
weird body!

159
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:06,077
{\an1}No, no, that's
my jutsu.

160
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,616
{\an4}[chuckle] Kazekage!
Well I see that you're
the smart one out of
your friends...

161
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,018
{\an1}<i>(Second Mizukage)</i>
<i>You make a </i>
<i>good pair.</i>

162
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,126
{\an1}Oh really?

163
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:28,064
{\an1}It's been a while
since I've had
this much fun...

164
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,827
Relay our current
battle status to HQ!

165
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,095
{\an1}Yes, sir!

166
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,864
{\an1}You fought well against
the former Five Kage,
everyone.

167
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,099
{\an1}The victory is ours
on this battlefield.

168
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,004
{\an1}Okay! Extract the
wounded! Get them
to the medical teams!

169
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:13,973
{\an1}All those who can still
fight, stand by for
further orders from HQ!

170
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:17,744
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage, you
should seek medical
attention, too...

171
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:21,014
No, I'm totally
fine. All right!?
[grumble]

172
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:23,615
{\an1}Listen, make sure you
don't overdo it, old man.

173
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:26,585
{\an1}Don't you treat me
like some doddering
old fool!

174
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,820
{\an1}I can still take
on you young
ones! Argh!

175
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:31,155
Here we go.

176
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,424
{\an5}We'll take you to
the Medical Corps
to get you all
checked out.

177
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,727
Let go of me,
you dolt!

178
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,395
I can walk fine
on my own!

179
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:40,798
{\an4}You really should just
accept that you're
old! There isn't
any shame in it!

180
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:43,467
How dare you! I am the
Tsuchikage, you know!

181
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,670
{\an1}Yes, I heard you say
that yesterday, too.

182
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,806
{\an1}Lord Gaara, why don't
you come by and visit
later, okay?

183
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,575
{\an1}Let me go I said!
Didn't you hear me!?

184
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:52,742
This way...

185
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,611
{\an1}Argh! My back!

186
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:56,245
<i>(Yukata)</i>
<i>Please stop squirming!</i>

187
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,714
<i>(Matsuri)</i>
<i>Seriously!</i>

188
00:17:57,747 --> 00:17:59,716
<i>(Ohnoki)</i>
<i>Owwww...!</i>

189
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:03,352
So, Naruto... You're
a clone, aren't you?

190
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,386
{\an1}Yeah.

191
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,755
Where is your original
to be found right now?

192
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:09,257
{\an1}[taken aback]

193
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,992
We can't take in any
more patients for a
while...

194
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,362
{\an1}We just received orders
to focus on the wounded
that we have here already.

195
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,633
{\an4}But, they keep bringing
in new casualties from
the battlefront. What
do we do about them!?

196
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:59,270
{\an5}I know. But there's
no way for us to
distinguish between
who's an ally...

197
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,272
...and who's an
enemy in disguise.

198
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,876
{\an1}[gasp] But that's...

199
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:21,624
{\an1}Even our chakra has
been copied perfectly.

200
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:28,931
{\an1}Which means I have to
consider everyone besides
myself an enemy...

201
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,767
{\an1}Man, what a drag!

202
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,842
{\an1}But... we have to
figure out a
solution soon...

203
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:51,952
{\an1}Where did they hide
that Bashosen fan,
anyway?

204
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:54,722
It'd be really
handy, and I can use
it really well!

205
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,130
Is there any
sign of them?

206
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:05,432
{\an1}No. Nothing yet.

207
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,968
{\an1}But then, White Zetsu
could be disguised
as any one of us...

208
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,004
{\an1}<i>Please be </i>
<i>careful, Hinata.</i>

209
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,239
I will. You do
the same, Neji.

210
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,783
{\an1}It's still blurry...

211
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:47,738
{\an1}The Sealing Corps just
reported in. They weren't
able to seal Pakura and Gari.

212
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,772
I see...

213
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:53,143
Two of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen remain...

214
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:57,046
Fuguki Suikazan, and
Mangetsu Hozuki.

215
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:09,758
{\an8}<i>Hang in there, </i>

<i>I'm coming!</i>

216
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:02,561

{\an5}<i>(Tayuya)</i>

<i>(Jirobo)</i>
<i>Enough, Tayuya! Women</i>

220
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,640
