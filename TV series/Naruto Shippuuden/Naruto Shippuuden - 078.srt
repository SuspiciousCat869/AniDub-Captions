Was it his jutsu?

What happened to Captain Asuma?

That fire jutsu engulfed
the Akatsuki, not him.

Although somehow
it looks like Asuma

That leaves five Akatsuki

We may not know who they

Obviously, you've got

But how do you handle
an unbeatable foe?

Discern what you can and
make a call, I guess.

Their ninjutsu,
taijutsu, and genjutsu

148
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:37,568
can tell you a lot about them.

149
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:40,718
Then get a feel for how they
work with their partner,

and their place in the
organization as a whole.

We'll have to make
snap decisions,

-Don't be so sure.

Once we've dug up a little
information on them,

165

Looking out for your

00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:46,708
That'll undo the

-What do you mean?

-That giant scythe of his.

228
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,638
It's got three blades.

229
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:55,638
By the shape of it, I'd say it
wasn't meant for mortal blows.

But extending the
wielder's range,

allowing him to
reach his opponents,

00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,708
and cause some degree
of external injury,

great or small.

234
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:10,528
In short, if he can inflict even
a single, shallow, abrasion,

235
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,628
his jutsu will lead to the
opponent's certain death.

236
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,558
-That's his curse then, huh?

237
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,538
But how in the world
does it all connect back

238
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:18,608
to the initial wound inflicted?

239
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,668
-Blood.

240
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:26,608
In order to link himself
to his intended victim,

241
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,698
he has to take his opponent's
blood into his own body.

242
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:38,498
-I saw him lick the blade, too.

243
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,558
So the blood.

244
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:41,638
I see.

245
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,678
If he could wound his opponent,
and get even the slightest

246
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:48,558
drop of it onto his scythe,
he's then able to curse them.

247
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,688
-So that's it.

248

-We he licked the blood
his body changed color,

249
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,678
so it was pretty easy
to figure that part out.

250
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,718
But that's not all
there is to it.

251
00:17:58,488 --> 00:17:59,678
There's one more
crucial step that

252
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,688
needs to be completed
to activate the curse.

253
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:05,488
-There's another one?

254
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,688
-What an impressive brat.

255
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,488
-That guy totally
ignored the fire style

at him earlier.

257
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,588
He didn't even
bother to avoid it,

258
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:16,638
just went straight
for that marking.

259
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:20,528
Then once inside it, he
said the ritual would begin.

260
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:23,628
Then barked about the
preparations being done.

261
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,498
So my guess is the
curse jutsu can only

262
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,608
be completed while he's
inside the diagram.
