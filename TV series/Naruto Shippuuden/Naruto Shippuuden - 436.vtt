of a few others...

00:12:07.696 --> 00:12:10.665 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:13.334 position:41% line:83% align:start
Anyway, what should
we do now, Shikamaru?

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:18.339 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, yeah! That's why we
rushed over here! To
find out the plan!

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:21.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'd like you to take
the lead, Shikamaru.

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:27.549 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ahem... Our first priority is to
get a report on the situation
back to the Leaf Village.

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:32.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
We need to get instructions from
Lord Fourth.  Of course...

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:37.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll do what we can to get
Asuma and the others back, too!

00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:47.101 position:13% line:77% align:start
Now, in order to allocate
the tasks, we'll join up
with Teams Kakashi and Guy.

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:52.473 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a drag, so... let's
wrap this up quickly!

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:59.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't waste any more
time with all of this.

00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:02.116 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll return to the village
and give them our report.

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:04.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't afford any more
losses or casualties.

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:10.525 position:10% line:77% align:start
What are you talking about,
Sasuke?!  We have already lost
Guy Sensei.  And now even Neji

00:13:10.558 --> 00:13:13.294 position:10% line:83% align:start
has gone missing! And Naruto
from your own team, too!

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:16.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, all of this happened just
because he acted on his own.

00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:19.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
After I warned him not to...

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:23.337 position:5% line:77% align:start
We are from the class
ahead of yours, so we do
not know Naruto that well...

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.575 position:5% line:77% align:start
But he is an important
friend, and besides that, a
member of Team 7, right?

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:31.078 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's a friend...?

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:35.517 position:35% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Rock Lee)</i>
 <i>And not only all of that he is</i>
 <i>also the precious son of the</i>
 <i>Fourth Hokage!</i>

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't care
about that at all.

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:42.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
It has nothing to
do with the mission.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:46.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
Argh! How can you be
so cold, Sasuke?!

00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:51.965 position:13% line:77% align:start
I see Guy Sensei as a dear
mentor! And Neji is an
incredibly precious friend.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
I cannot just turn
my back on them!

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.604 position:52% line:89% align:start
Lee, calm down!

00:13:56.638 --> 00:14:01.208 position:7% line:77% align:start
Anyway, I am going to look for
Guy Sensei, Neji, and the
others!

00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:07.181 position:7% line:77% align:start
They are bound to be somewhere
nearby.  I am completely certain
of it!

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:10.585 position:7% line:83% align:start
So I will not stop looking and
return to the village!

00:14:10.618 --> 00:14:14.789 position:5% line:77% align:start
I can't let you do that.  We
have no clue what the enemy
might do, so we can't split up

00:14:14.823 --> 00:14:18.325 position:5% line:83% align:start
our fighting power. We
have to stay together.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:23.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh! Neji! Guy Sensei! I
am coming to rescue you!

00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:28.435 position:13% line:77% align:start
Okay, Lee!  I get it!  You've
made up your mind!  I'll help
you!  So please, stop!

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.605 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're all idiots...

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:31.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but...

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.075 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you going to do?

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:49.356 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sniffing] It seems that the
other two teams did meet up...

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.863 position:13% line:83% align:start
But now, they're moving in
different directions...

00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:57.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you tell anything
more specific?

00:14:57.331 --> 00:15:03.937 position:5% line:71% align:start
Let's see... One group is moving
away from the village, and the
other is frantically scrambling
around the village.

00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:05.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's Lee...

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:08.375 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, then, Team Kakashi is
trying to leave the village?

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:11.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, could they be heading
back to the Hidden Leaf?

00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:12.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's plausible.

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:19.019 position:5% line:77% align:start
The reason is because Sasuke,
who is cool-headed and
rational, is on Team Kakashi.

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.922 position:30% line:83% align:start
Anyway, we'll join with
the closest ones.

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.825 position:44% line:83% align:start
That'd be group in
the village, right?

00:15:23.858 --> 00:15:26.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. If we're going to
rescue Asuma and the others,

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:30.832 position:13% line:77% align:start
the last thing we need is
someone making a fuss and
standing out!

00:15:30.865 --> 00:15:34.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to go and
calm Lee down...

00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:52.554 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:16.076 position:7% line:77% align:start
Now, follow me if you want to
discover the true nature of the
Hidden Leaf.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.131 position:78% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:49.711 position:47% line:83% align:start
What is this...!?
What's going on!?

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:54.883 position:19% line:77% align:start
Wait! That's Old Man Third!
But, uh... who are all of
those other guys down there?!

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Neji, do you know?

00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:58.085 position:55% line:89% align:start
Just be quiet!

00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can make all
the noise you want.

00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:06.226 position:10% line:71% align:start
What you're seeing are just
images of past events that
occurred in the Hidden Leaf
Village.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:12.266 position:7% line:77% align:start
It cannot be helped. With just
my one life, the entire village
can be saved.

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:20.975 position:35% line:83% align:start
Just hold on, Hiashi!
Please don't be so hasty!

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:26.714 position:5% line:77% align:start
The Hyuga family's Kekkei Genkai
is one of the most important
strengths of our village.

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:31.418 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>...It's the sworn duty of the</i>
 <i>head family to protect it</i>
 <i>forever no matter what.</i>

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:37.491 position:7% line:71% align:start
I know. But still, I must put
aside that duty if keeping it
means involving our village in a
desperate war!

00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:43.230 position:72% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Elder)</i>
 <i>I understand that, but...</i>

 <i>...We'll take Hizashi's</i>

[gasp]

00:17:55.043 --> 00:17:57.444 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's father...

00:17:57.477 --> 00:18:00.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what about that other guy?
Do you know who he is, Neji?

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:03.383 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hizashi Hyuga...

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.954 position:44% line:83% align:start
He is my father...
[gasp]

00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:09.122 position:41% line:83% align:start
It happened just as
Lord Hiashi told me...

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:14.294 position:5% line:5% align:start
What's wrong, Lord Hiashi?
You're usually so confident
and determined.

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:20.034 position:5% line:77% align:start
This is far too important for me
to act recklessly!  I'm afraid
it simply isn't that easy.

00:18:20.068 --> 00:18:21.669 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:27.008 position:10% line:89% align:start

But why?! Why do this?!
You have Neji!

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.182 position:5% line:89% align:start

 <i>Why do you choose death?</i>

00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:46.694 position:13% line:77% align:start
You must understand. I've
resented the head family
for a long time. And even

00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:51.866 position:7% line:77% align:start
right now, I'm bitter. I'm not
doing this because you're a part
of the head family.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:55.770 position:10% line:77% align:start
I want to die protecting you
because you're my brother,
Hiashi.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:59.172 position:7% line:77% align:start
It's the first time that I've
felt free enough to choose my
own path...

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:02.409 position:13% line:83% align:start
...the first time I have
truly had freedom.

00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:10.183 position:7% line:77% align:start
I've always only shown Neji my
ugly side, but this time will
be different.

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:14.522 position:16% line:83% align:start
I ask you... please give
Neji a message for me.

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:19.027 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:25.465 position:5% line:77% align:start
That I wasn't killed to protect
the head family, but to protect
my siblings, family, and village

00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:30.337 position:13% line:77% align:start
and by my own free will...
I chose death! And I chose
my freedom!

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:38.680 position:16% line:77% align:start
You think that choosing
death is the same...
as choosing freedom?

00:19:38.713 --> 00:19:44.952 position:7% line:77% align:start
Brother, I have become free. I
have defied the fate of the
Hyuga family

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:47.789 position:13% line:89% align:start
And now, this is goodbye.

00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:58.900 position:7% line:77% align:start
Do you see?  How he must have
felt?  Having no other choice
but to say those words?!

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:04.471 position:10% line:77% align:start
He had to die for the Hidden
Leaf Village!  It was a fate
that he could not change!

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:11.278 position:5% line:77% align:start
The one and only tiny sliver of
freedom that he was able to
find was choosing to die

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:14.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
in order to protect the
ones that he loved.

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:18.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're wrong!  The Hidden Leaf
Village isn't like that!

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.822 position:33% line:89% align:start
That was my hope, too.

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:21.823 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:27.562 position:13% line:77% align:start
This is now the era of the
younger generation, and I'd
hoped things were different.

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:29.097 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:35.670 position:5% line:77% align:start

hand and foot to the code of the
Hidden Leaf.

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:39.040 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have no real choice
over your future...

00:20:39.073 --> 00:20:41.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
...or over the
future of your village.

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:43.310 position:19% line:89% align:start
I recognize that now.

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not true, you-!

00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:49.349 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now that you know that
What will you do?

00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:56.323 position:5% line:71% align:start
If the village can't be changed

is to force a change from the
outside.
