165
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,197
{\an1}Hotaru has people
like that, too.

166
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:51,900
{\an1}Her grandfather and
Tonbei, and now Utakata.

167
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,169
{\an1}Your thoughts should have
reached her, Utakata.

168
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,837
{\an1}They should be within her heart.

169
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,106
She just wants a
friend, a master.

170
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,407
A bond.

171
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,777
{\an1}But you can't see that at all.

172
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,645
You don't know a
single thing about her.

173
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,447
{\an1}Don't pretend that you do!

174
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,848
{\an1}-Give me a break.

175
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:09,849
Word Bind Jutsu.

176
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:10,350
Split.

177
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:15,188
-Ah!

178
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:17,157
-I got you.

179
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,057
-Thanks a lot.

180
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,427
-Oh, no.

181
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:27,732
{\an1}I'd better escape before
the vessel explodes.

182
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:33,905
[sigh]

183
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:34,605
-Hotaru, no!

184
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,212
{\an1}-I'll bring Shiranami
back to stop it.

185
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,213
-I'll come too.

186
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,114
-No.

187
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:46,682
{\an1}You're Hotaru's master, Utakata.

188
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,585
{\an1}Your place is here with her.

189
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:50,986
{\an1}I'm counting on you.

190
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,487
-Very well.

191
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,534
{\an1}-NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Hotaru
has people like that, too.

192
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:11,272
{\an1}Her grandfather and
Tonbei, and now Utakata.

193
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:13,574
{\an1}Your thoughts should have
reached her, Utakata.

194
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,743
{\an1}-UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): My
feelings are within her.

195
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,345
{\an1}And in my heart as well.

196
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,450
Yes.

197
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,253
My anger.

198
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,754
{\an1}It prevented me from listening.

199
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:32,490
{\an1}But I did hear-- no.

200
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:35,760
{\an1}I felt my master's thoughts.

201
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,829
They were there.

202
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,897
{\an1}-All his thoughts.

203
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,866
{\an1}All his feelings for me.

204
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,335
They reached me.

205
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,803
And yet--

206
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,404
-Now, Utakata.

207
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:53,610
{\an1}Go live side by side
with this power.

208
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:56,913
{\an1}Back then, I swore that I'd
never use your power again.

209
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:59,648
{\an1}But now, for Hotaru, I must.

210
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,816
{\an1}Please, I need your help.

211
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,634
[crying]

212
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:58,602
-Hotaru.

213
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:02,072
{\an1}-I never wanted to hurt anyone.

214
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,374
{\an1}And yet, I hurt Naruto.

215
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:09,577
{\an1}And Sir Utakata with
my very own hands.

216
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,981
{\an1}-But look, I'm right here.

217
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:13,915
{\an1}Naruto and I are fine.

218
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:24,925
{\an1}-I saw it happen.

219
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,329
-But Hotaru--

220
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:28,929
-I'm sorry.

221
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:31,365
{\an1}I betrayed you, Sir Utakata.

222
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:36,370
{\an1}Somebody like me should just
disappear along with the jutsu.

223
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,304
-Don't say that.

224
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:39,339
{\an1}I will not allow it.

225
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:47,413
{\an1}A good student should
always listen to her master.

226
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,216
{\an1}-Did you say "master"?

227
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,118
-Come on.

228
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:53,884
Let's go.

229
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,292
-Thank you.

230
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,201
-What is it?

231
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,135
What's wrong?

232
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:12,736
-No!

233
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,503
You must leave.

234
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,772
{\an1}Sir Utakata, please.

235
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:17,873
{\an1}Just get away from me.

236
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:18,574
Go.

237
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,942
{\an1}Run as fast as you can.

238
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,810
-Hotaru.

239
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,178
{\an1}-I've done all I can.

240
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,980
{\an1}I can't suppress it any longer.

241
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,482
Anyone with the
forbidden jutsu is

242
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,583
going to tear me
apart and explode!

243
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,520
-It's all right.

244
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,522
-Sir Utakata?

245
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:36,656
{\an1}-Just trust your master.

246
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,605
{\an1}-Let the village be destroyed.

247
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,440
It deserves it.

248
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,475
{\an1}He'll be eradicated.

249
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:02,313
[laughter]

250
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:04,681
-You again?

251
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:05,984
-I got you.

252
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:09,787
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

253
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,456
{\an1}-You're a persistent bastard.

254
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,857
Word Bind Jutsu.

255
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:14,391
Flame!

256
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:26,502
Fool.

257
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,670
{\an1}You can't stop me.

258
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:29,172
Huh?

259
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:36,344
{\an1}-I won't let you get away.

260
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:37,945
No matter what!

261
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,081
{\an1}-Word Bind Jutsu.

262
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:40,081
Slice!

263
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:41,550
[shouts]

264
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:45,453
-What?

265
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:45,953
No!

266
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,454
Augh!

267
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:55,195
{\an1}-Now to get you back
to Hotaru right away.

268
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,796
-[gasp]

269
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,797
-What is that?

270
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:17,315
-Hey!

271
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:17,814
Utakata!

272
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,553
{\an1}Are you guys all right?

273
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:23,554
-We are.

274
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:37,800
-My Master.

275
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,236
{\an1}-My, what a troublesome
student you are.

276
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,437
-Wait, hold on.

277
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,138
{\an1}What happened to the jutsu?

278
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,773
{\an1}-It seems to have disappeared.

279
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,908
-Disappeared?

280
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,611
{\an1}Well, as long as Hotaru
is safe, I'm glad.

281
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:50,111
-Naruto!

282
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:52,012
-Huh?

283
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:52,946
Hey, Sakura!

284
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,627
-Right.

285
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,896
{\an1}The mission negotiated
between the Tsuchigumo Clan

286
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,064
{\an1}and the Hidden Leaf has
been completed successfully.

287
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,635
{\an1}-Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

288
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,969
{\an1}-Well, the forbidden
jutsu was destroyed.

289
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,037
However--

290
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,071
-Yes.

291
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,140
{\an1}I think that it's
for the better.

292
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,577
{\an1}Lady Hotaru is safe, and now
no one will come after her.

293
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,145
{\an1}-The townsfolk are
happy, finally.

294
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,713
{\an1}They'll welcome Hotaru
and not fear her.

295
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,249
At last.

296
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,318
{\an1}-Are you still going, Hotaru?

297
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,085
With Utakata?

298
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,287
-Yes, I am.

299
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,056
{\an1}I still have so much more
to learn from my master.

300
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:42,691
{\an1}But after I've trained
with him, once I've

301
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:44,661
{\an1}achieved the strength
I need as a ninja,

302
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,496
{\an1}and I can restore
our clan's glory,

303
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,564
{\an1}I promise to return here.

304
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,603
{\an1}-Hey, good for you, Master.

305
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:55,437
-Hold on.

306
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,238
{\an1}Are you trying to mess with me?

307
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,640
-No way.

308
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:01,209
{\an1}I'm just glad that you finally
accepted your role as a master.

309
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:04,345
{\an1}It took you long enough.

310
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,079
{\an1}Just take care of Hotaru.

311
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,048
Got it?

312
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,116
{\an1}-Well, everyone, take care.

313
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,191
{\an1}-It's nice to have a master.

314
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,059
{\an1}You know what I mean?

315
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:20,926
-Hm?

316
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,362
-To be honest, I
even find myself

317
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,829
{\an1}kind of missing the Pervy Sage.

318
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,906
{\an1}-This is it, Master.

319
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,675
{\an1}This is the place
where I first met you.

320
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,646
-Hotaru.

321
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,915
{\an1}Will you wait here for
me, for a little while?

322
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,917
{\an1}-Is there a problem?

323
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,219
{\an1}-I'm meeting the ANBU Black Ops.

324
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,188
{\an1}I'm tired of all this running.

325
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:55,824
{\an1}I want to get permission
