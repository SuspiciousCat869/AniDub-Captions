00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:16,599
{\an1}All right! I'm going to
start the ecological
survey now!

00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,507
{\an1}Huh? Hey!

3
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,448
Wait, come back!

00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:27,750
{\an1}Huh?!

5
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:33,158
{\an1}Hey, Octopops, I can't
tell whether this one's a
boy or a girl.

6
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,095
It's all curled up.

7
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,368
{\an7}This armadillo has always
been shy, and if you're
trying to check its
gender, I can see why.

8
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:41,838
{\an8}Who's to say if it's a
girl or a guy?

9
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:46,547
{\an7}We're speaking out
against this abnormality,
which reveals your
pervert personality.

10
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:51,956
{\an4}Hold on! I have to! This
is the top-secret S-rank
mission that I've been
given! I have to make the

11
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,825
{\an1}list for the Animal Unit
we're forming!

12
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:58,199
{\an1}And checking their gender
is crucial! You think
that I like doing this?!

13
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:03,307
{\an4}It don't really matter
which this one is, There
isn't a quiz. Say it's a
girl and finish this biz.

15

All of these markings
that are on its back make
the kanji that reads "male".

16
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:20,167
{\an1}It's coincidence, just a
pattern.

17
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,373
{\an1}I have a really bad
feeling about this
thing...

18
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,618
Look, could you just ask
the armadillo, please?
You're their boss, right?

19
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,023
Well, what's the story?

20
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:37,596
{\an1}Hm! Uh!

{\an3}Mm.

{\an1}It says that its privates
are private! Yo!

23
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:47,578
{\an4}Oh, really?! That's the
way it is?! Come on, how
am I supposed to finish
all this stuff up?!

24
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:51,652
{\an1}This mission's living up
to its rank... or is it,
really?!

25
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:57,027
{\an5}Well, male and female...
There are some species
that are able to switch
between them both, yo!

26
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:01,368
{\an4}But check it: the heavens
and earth can't switch
places, yo! Fool, ya
fool!

Mm-hmm!

142
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,246
{\an1}What? Quit
kidding.

143
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,286
{\an1}You know, what...? I
think I'll take a look
outside...

144
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,827
Uh... You can't! Because
you have to continue your
vital S-rank mission!

145
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,431
So... You gotta stay
focused!

146
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:05,638
{\an1}Yeah... Well, maybe I'll
just go up there and take
a quick little look-see...

147
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:10,346
{\an5}But it's a ninja's
sworn duty to see every
mission through until
completion, Naruto!

148
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:15,788
{\an5}And this particular
mission... is in your
hands. Only you can
accomplish it.

149
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:20,362
That's why you were
selected, Naruto.
Understood!?

150
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:25,737
{\an4}We'll go see what's
happening outside. That's
honestly the only way that
we can contribute here.

151
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,480
{\an4}But let me repeat it...
You are still right in
the middle of an
important S-rank mission!

152
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:35,419
{\an7}<i>Even Naruto's beginning</i>

ourselves just fine!
