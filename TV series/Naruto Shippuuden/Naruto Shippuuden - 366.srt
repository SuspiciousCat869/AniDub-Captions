1
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:55,212
{\an1}That's the First Hokage?

2
00:01:56,347 --> 00:02:00,182
{\an1}The real Hashirama touted
as a God of Shinobi?

3
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:06,018
{\an1}It's that shinobi
Orochimaru again!

4
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:07,886
What's going on?

5
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,721
{\an1}I suspect what's going
on is that he undid

6
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,755
{\an1}the Reaper Death Seal.

7
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,690
{\an1}The very same thing that
sealed us away, and then

8
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:18,559
performed the
Reanimation Jutsu.

9
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:20,059
No way...

10
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,262
{\an1}You solved how to
undo that Jutsu?

11
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,395
{\an1}How, Mr. Orochimaru?

12
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,597
{\an1}You underestimate
me, Minato.

13
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:33,034
{\an1}It was originally a Sealing
Jutsu of the Uzumaki Clan.

14
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,936
{\an1}I extensively researched
the ruins and scattered

15
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:39,372
documents of the
now-extinct clan

16
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,106
{\an1}since I lost my jutsu.

17
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,773
{\an1}Well, Lord First...

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,774
{\an1}It appears that we've
been recalled into the

19
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,175
{\an1}world of the living.

20
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:49,243
Hm...

21
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,211
{\an1}Who the hell are you?!

22
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,045
Wha-?

23
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,647
Oh, uh...

24
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,282
{\an1}The Fourth Hokage, sir.

25
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,084
{\an1}Oh ho! The Fourth
Hokage, huh?

26
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,751
Nice, nice!

27
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,486
The village has
remained stable, then!

28
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:11,123
{\an1}Uh, I'm not actually
sure if it has or not.

29
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:14,124
{\an1}Because, you see, I died and
was sealed away much earlier

30
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:16,059
{\an1}than the Third Hokage was.

31
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,927
Hm, is that so?!

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,128
{\an1}In a different incident
than when I was sealed

33
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,728
{\an1}away with Sarutobi?

34
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:25,530
{\an1}Yes, sir. Completely
separate one.

35
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,631
{\an1}So who is the Fifth, then?

36
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,600
{\an1}Your granddaughter,
Princess Tsunade.

37
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,969
Tsuna, huh?

38
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,405
{\an1}Is the village okay?

39
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,705
{\an1}Is there a reason to worry?

40
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:43,374
{\an1}She was my first grandchild!
I spoiled her rotten!

41
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,208
{\an1}In the end, she even
picked up my gambling

42
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:47,376
{\an1}habit, I'm afraid.

43
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,345
[laughing]

44
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,646
{\an1}<i>He's not quite what I</i>
<i>expected of someone</i>

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,349
<i>considered to be</i>
<i>a God of Shinobi!</i>

46
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:57,848
[laughter]

47
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:00,817
{\an1}<i>How do I put it? Uh...</i>

48
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,153
{\an1}It's the Reanimation
Jutsu again. The jutsu

49
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,553
I devised, used
so casually!

50
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:11,123
{\an1}Well, it really isn't all
that complex a jutsu.

51
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:14,758
{\an1}But, you shouldn't
have created it.

52
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:15,793
Hm?

53
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,527
Lord Second...

54
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,594
{\an1}Many of the policies that
you created and jutsu that

55
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:23,763
{\an1}you developed caused
problems down the line.

56
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,564
Even now...

57
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:28,633
{\an1}Why you! Are you planning
to attack the Leaf again?!

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,737
{\an1}I took away your jutsu in
exchange for my own life.

59
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:38,038
{\an1}Yet even now, you still-!

60
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:41,808
{\an1}And then, at this time you
revived me, your former

61
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,176
{\an1}master, to pit me
against the Leaf?!

62
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:47,211
{\an1}[sigh] Conflict no
matter what era, eh?

63
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,313
{\an1}For sure, it can't be
called a great jutsu.

64
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,881
{\an1}Tobirama, that's why I
told you that time to-

65
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:56,450
{\an1}Be quiet, elder brother.
I'm trying to speak

66
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,817
{\an1}to this stripling.

67
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,285
What?! But I...

68
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,684
Shut up!

69
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,786
[groaning]

70
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,588
<i>God of Shinobi?</i>
<i>So not dignified!</i>

71
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,590
{\an1}Please do not misunderstand.

72
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,624
{\an1}I do not have any
more leanings in that

73
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,026
{\an1}direction at all.

74
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:16,561
{\an1}That's why I didn't
suppress your personalities.

75
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:20,063
{\an1}Certain circumstances
are at play this time.

76
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,597
{\an1}I am merely creating
a stage for discourse

77
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,432
per his desire.

78
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:28,600
{\an1}I am Sasuke Uchiha. I
want to ask you Hokage

79
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,635
some things.

80
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,471
{\an1}[gasp] You, Sasuke?!

81
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,172
{\an1}You belong to the Uchiha, do
you? Of course you'd stick

82
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,272
{\an1}with a scoundrel.

83
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:38,773
Tobirama!

84
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,042
{\an1}I thought I told you to
stop saying things like that!

85
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,608
You're too soft,
elder brother!

86
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,143
{\an1}It doesn't matter.

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,711
{\an1}Third Hokage... Why'd
you make Itachi do it?

88
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,614
So I take it you
learned what happened.

89
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,217
Itachi's dead...

90
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,984
{\an1}I killed him to avenge
the Uchiha clan.

91
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,688
{\an1}Afterwards, I learned the
truth from Tobi and Danzo

92
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:08,391
{\an1}and I swore vengeance
upon the Hidden Leaf.

93
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,158
However...

94
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,826
{\an1}I want to hear it
straight from your mouth.

95
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:16,661
{\an1}Everything regarding Itachi.

96
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,530
{\an1}So it came to that...

97
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,635
{\an1}I not only had him kill
his brethren and bear the

98
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,470
{\an1}false charge of traitor.

99
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:34,905
{\an1}But also keep tabs on
the Akatsuki by himself.

100
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:38,041
{\an1}Since he was young, Itachi
paid attention to the

101
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,709
{\an1}teachings and signs of
our predecessors no

102
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,543
{\an1}one else gave heed to.

103
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,512
{\an1}He was a sensitive
child who understood our

104
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,579
{\an1}village's past and shinobi.

105
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,249
{\an1}Perhaps due to that,
the trappings of a clan

106
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,250
{\an1}never bound Itachi.

107
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,419
{\an1}He was able to think about
the future of shinobi and

108
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:59,019
the village, and
always had misgivings

109
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,853
{\an1}regarding those futures.

110
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:06,257
{\an1}Even at the age of seven, he
thought quite like a Hokage.

111
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,126
{\an1}We left everything to
Itachi, in his hands alone,

112
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,928
{\an1}and he executed his
missions perfectly.

113
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:18,330
{\an1}He slaughtered his entire
clan, stopped a revolt, and

114
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:21,266
{\an1}prevented a coming
war all by himself.

115
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,435
{\an1}He even infiltrated the
Akatsuki as a spy to

116
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,700
{\an1}protect the village.

117
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:30,870
{\an1}All on the condition that
I protect you, Sasuke.

118
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,372
[gasp]

119
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,541
{\an1}So all of it's true...

120
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:38,476
{\an1}This is all just part of the
Uchiha's cursed fate.

121
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,377
Though I can't
believe they're on the

122
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,011
{\an1}brink of extinction.

123
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:47,281
{\an1}They even plotted a
coup d'état, did they?

124
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,083
{\an1}I'd envisioned it might
come to something like that.

125
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,218
{\an1}The rebellious elements
bearing Madara's will had

126
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:55,952
been smoldering.

127
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,987
{\an1}But you're the one who drove
them to it, Lord Second.

128
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,556
It could be said
that the seeds were

129
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:05,024
{\an1}sown with the Uchiha-Leaf
Police Force you created.

130
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:06,492
What's that?

131
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:09,394
{\an1}Those who control
crime also tend to be

132
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,727
{\an1}very easily disliked.

133
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,062
{\an1}The more authority such
a group has, the more

134
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,263
{\an1}conceited it can get.

135
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,165
{\an1}By building the Police
Station next to the prison

136
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,967
{\an1}under the pretext of
monitoring criminals,

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,968
{\an1}you conspicuously shoved
the Uchiha Clan to the

138
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:26,769
{\an1}margins of the village.

139
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,872
{\an1}That helped foster
Madara's followers.

140
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:36,509
{\an1}Tobirama! Didn't I emphasize
to you many times not to

141
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,809
{\an1}slight the Uchiha?!

142
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:39,844
Huh?!

143
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,978
{\an1}I gave them posts they
were very qualified for.

144
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:44,380
{\an1}That if another Madara
emerged, I thought he

145
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,781
{\an1}could just be dealt
with right away.

146
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:50,584
{\an1}As you know, elder
brother, the Uchiha

147
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,886
are a clan
possessed by evil!

148
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,689
{\an1}It's like Madara left a
psychological scar on you,

149
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:03,290
to cause such
fear of the Uchiha.

150
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,327
{\an1}You stripling. You
do not know Madara.

151
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,461
Second Hokage, a
question for you...

152
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:14,197
{\an1}What is it about the Uchiha
Clan? What do you know?

153
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,833
[sigh]

154
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,401
All right...

155
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,669
{\an1}The Senju and Uchiha
Clans have a long history.

156
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,972
{\an1}That is, a long history
of battling with each other.

157
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:32,508
{\an1}In fact, the two clans
were once bitter enemies.

158
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,841
{\an1}I know that much!

159
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,043
{\an1}But how are the Uchiha
possessed by evil?

160
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,747
{\an1}It was said that in contrast
to the Senju Clan, who based

161
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,982
{\an1}their strength on love
the Uchiha Clan's

162
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,917
{\an1}strength was based on
the power of their jutsu.

163
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,419
However, the
truth is different.

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,989
{\an1}No clan feels deeper
love than the Uchiha.

165
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,390
And that's why
they suppressed and

166
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,891
sealed it away.

167
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,125
{\an1}What do you mean?!

168
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,594
{\an1}Once a member of the
Uchiha comes to know love.

169
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:09,828
{\an1}It's as if all their
previously checked

170
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,530
{\an1}emotions are released.

171
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:14,331
{\an1}Strong love and power
exceeding even the

172
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,732
Senju's awaken.

173
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,799
{\an1}But why is that a problem?

174
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:21,002
{\an1}It should help the bond with
the Senju, this super-strong

175
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,603
{\an1}power of love, shouldn't it?

176
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,138
{\an1}Except that it is
quite problematic.

177
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,574
{\an1}This great power hides
within it the possibility

178
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,542
{\an1}of losing control.

179
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,311
{\an1}When an Uchiha has known
love, then loses that deep

180
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,312
{\an1}love, it is replaced
by an even stronger

181
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,414
{\an1}hate that changes them.

182
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:45,815
{\an1}I've seen it happen quite a
few times. And that's when a

183
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,883
{\an1}special condition emerges.

184
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,851
{\an1}A special condition?

185
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,320
{\an1}When an Uchiha writhes in
agony over the loss of a

186
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,688
{\an1}great love or from
disappointment in

187
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,823
{\an1}themselves, a unique chakra
is released in their brain

188
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,991
and reacts with
the optic nerves.

189
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,826
Changes appear
in that person's eyes.

190
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,663
{\an1}This phenomenon is called
the Sharingan, eyes that

191
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,162
{\an1}reflect the heart.

192
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,031
{\an1}The Sharingan taps into
the power of that person's

193
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,699
{\an1}heart, rapidly increasing
their strength along

194
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,534
with the power
of their hate.

195
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,970
{\an1}There were many sensitive
people among the Uchiha, and

196
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,737
{\an1}nearly all exposed to strong
emotions were taken by

197
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,106
{\an1}darkness and fell to evil.

198
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,807
{\an1}The deeper the darkness
gets, the greater the Visual

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,210
{\an1}Prowess, till that
person can't be stopped.

200
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,344
{\an1}Just like Madara.

201
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,513
{\an1}Madara cared intensely
about his younger brother,

202
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:41,582
{\an1}likely even more so
than your brother.

203
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,517
{\an1}I thought I had arranged and
guided things such that the

204
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,685
Uchiha's power
could be harnessed

205
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,219
{\an1}to serve the village.

206
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:51,154
{\an1}Although, if their
self-destruction benefited

207
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,055
{\an1}the village, then so be it.

208
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,656
{\an1}Either way, in the
end, they were of use

209
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,023
{\an1}to the Leaf Village.

210
00:11:57,057 --> 00:12:00,125
{\an1}Tobirama, stop saying such
things! You are speaking to

211
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,427
{\an1}an innocent Uchiha child!

212
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,195
{\an1}What's all-important is the
village. The village is the

213
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,698
{\an1}keystone. I know you know
that, too, elder brother.

214
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,965
I don't care.
For I am neither

215
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,900
{\an1}innocent nor a child.

216
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,236
{\an1}<i>It's not the basic tomoe</i>
<i>pattern. He's got the</i>

217
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,070
{\an1}<i>Mangekyo Sharingan.</i>

218
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:24,406
First Hokage, I
ask you this...

219
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,808
{\an1}What does it mean to be a
village? And what does it

220
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:31,009
{\an1}mean to be a shinobi?

221
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:39,581
{\an1}A village? And what
a shinobi is, huh?

222
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,683
{\an1}My brother, despite
having been used by

223
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:46,418
{\an1}the Leaf Village, still
defended it with his life.

224
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:49,687
{\an1}And he died proud that
he was a Leaf shinobi.

225
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,556
{\an1}Just what is this village
that one strives to protect

226
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,590
even if it means
killing one's family?

227
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,525
{\an1}Or one's own death?

228
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:01,661
{\an1}And what are shinobi who've
created such circumstances

229
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,761
{\an1}and consider them
to be acceptable?

230
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,763
{\an1}I'll listen to your response
and find out the truth.

231
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:10,965
{\an1}And then I'll make
my decision.

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,636
{\an1}Whether to declare vengeance
on the Leaf. Or...

233
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:24,707
Orochimaru...

234
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,141
Yes?

235
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,875
{\an1}You once tried to destroy
the Leaf Village.

236
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,745
{\an1}At first, I believed it when
you said that it was on a

237
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,346
whim. But now I
know it wasn't.

238
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,047
{\an1}What was the real reason?

239
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,883
{\an1}Vengeance against the Leaf?

240
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,818
You brat full
of Uchiha evil!

241
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,353
In that case...

242
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,154
[groaning]

243
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,888
[gasp]

244
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,356
Lord Second!

245
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:55,458
Tobirama!

246
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:02,629
{\an1}Now we're talking presence!
Like, seriously!

247
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,332
{\an1}Lower your finger.

248
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:15,269
{\an1}Oh, all right. Don't rile up
your chakra, elder brother.

249
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:19,739
{\an1}[laughter] Sorry about that!

250
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,774
[sigh of relief]

251
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:24,908
{\an1}Wow, that's incredible!

252
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:28,243
{\an1}You haven't changed a
bit, Lord Hashirama.

253
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:29,744
[harrumph]

254
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:37,449
{\an1}Well then, Sasuke. You
had a good older brother.

255
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,784
A shinobi even
greater than I!

256
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,319
{\an1}I don't mind telling you
more about the village,

257
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:43,652
{\an1}but it'll take time.

258
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:46,721
{\an1}If possible, please tell the
child everything he wants to

259
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:50,056
{\an1}know quickly. We don't
really have much time.

260
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,223
{\an1}Why is there no time?

261
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,957
{\an1}There's a war going on.

262
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,593
{\an1}Madara Uchiha's been
revived and seeks to erase

263
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:59,394
{\an1}the world's shinobi.

264
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,631
[weary sigh]
Always conflict, no

265
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:06,098
matter what era.

266
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,102
{\an1}I definitely do sense
some powerful chakra.

267
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,003
{\an1}Over in the direction
of two o'clock.

268
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:20,073
{\an1}<i>That's Naruto and the Nine</i>
<i>Tails' chakra. I see...</i>

269
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,874
{\an1}You did it, Naruto!
And you're fighting

270
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,343
{\an1}together, even now!

271
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,078
{\an1}It seems to be the truth.

272
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,447
{\an1}I do indeed sense
Madara's chakra.

273
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,548
{\an1}Then we ought to head
right to the battlefield!

274
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,516
{\an1}As you're all under the
control of my Reanimation

275
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,051
{\an1}Jutsu, your movements
can be restricted.

276
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,886
{\an1}If you must, you may head
down to the battle after

277
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,020
{\an1}we're done talking.

278
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,655
{\an1}No, we can talk later!

279
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,757
Do you truly
understand this?!

280
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,424
{\an1}The gravity of Madara
being revived?!

281
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:54,460
{\an1}Still, I'm staying
with this child.

282
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:58,628
{\an1}If the explanations that you
give don't satisfy Sasuke, I

283
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:01,464
{\an1}may use all of you to
destroy the Leaf now.

284
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,499
The timing
couldn't be better.

285
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,902
{\an1}Agh! Curse this jutsu!

286
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,337
{\an1}Orochimaru, is it?
You seem to be

287
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:16,205
misunderstanding
something.

288
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,273
{\an1}The fact that you've made
the Reanimation Jutsu more

289
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:22,908
{\an1}precise since last time
shall be your downfall.

290
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,078
{\an1}Now that all of us here
been revived at nearly

291
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,681
{\an1}our original power,
this Reanimation Jutsu

292
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,415
{\an1}of yours will not
be able to bind me!

293
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,117
{\an1}Don't forget, I'm
the one who devised

294
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,752
{\an1}it in the first place.

295
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:41,120
{\an1}Brother, you must
agree there's no choice.

296
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,320
I have to act!

297
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,154
[gasp]

298
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,922
{\an1}Well, Sarutobi, you
certainly raised

299
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,224
quite a shinobi.

300
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,560
{\an1}To be praised by the God
of Shinobi is an honor.

301
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,161
[laughter]

302
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,330
He acquired my
cells and enhanced his

303
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:00,731
{\an1}power to bind us!

304
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,800
{\an1}Tobirama, your instincts
have dulled a bit.

305
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,034
{\an1}Damn him. Now that I take
a closer look, most of his

306
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,903
{\an1}body is composed of
my brother's cells.

307
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,505
Now, then...

308
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,773
{\an1}<i>First Hokage Hashirama.</i>

309
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,475
{\an1}<i>He's different. He could</i>
<i>undo my binding at any time.</i>

310
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,210
{\an1}<i>I'll have to be careful</i>
<i>not to let down my guard.</i>

311
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,746
{\an1}Listen, Orochimaru,
do not fret.

312
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,213
{\an1}I shall prioritize undoing
the ill feelings that are

313
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,681
{\an1}binding this child.

314
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,817
{\an1}Of course I can't know
what he'll decide after he

315
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,751
{\an1}finishes listening to me.

316
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:39,086
{\an1}But I do know that if we
ignore him now, he will

317
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,287
{\an1}definitely become
the next Madara.

318
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,922
{\an1}In that case, even if the
war ends and we win, it

319
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,424
{\an1}would be pointless.

320
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,427
{\an1}[annoyed sigh] Do as
you please, elder brother.

321
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:56,630
{\an1}Now then, where exactly
should I begin this tale?

322
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,564
Hm, yes...

323
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:04,801
{\an1}In order to tell you about
village and shinobi.

324
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,002
[angry growl]

325
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,969
Wood Style: Wood
Dragon Jutsu!

326
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:14,173
{\an1}I must first speak of the
Uchiha and Senju Clans.

327
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:16,741
[defiant roar]

328
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,242
<i>Wood Style!</i>

329
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:22,812
{\an1}Wood Golem Jutsu!

330
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,996
Wood Style, Wood
Expulsion Jutsu, was it?

331
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,498
{\an1}Perfect for taking
on difficult beasts.

332
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:01,966
Hm?

333
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,235
{\an1}<i>He wrapped his Susano'o</i>
<i>around the Tailed</i>

334
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,902
{\an1}<i>Beast like armor!</i>

335
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,771
{\an1}<i>Madara, you crafty fox!</i>

336
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,941
I can read your
swordsmanship!

337
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,776
{\an1}Wood Style: Laughing
Buddha Jutsu!

338
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,243
[growl]

339
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,151
{\an1}<i>At this rate, the land'll</i>
<i>be completely obliterated.</i>

340
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,419
{\an1}<i>It's best to move</i>
<i>this to the seashore!</i>

341
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,120
No, you don't!

342
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,093
There! Just try
grabbing ahold of that!

343
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:50,862
Now what?!

344
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,129
Summoning!
Five-Layer Rashomon!

345
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:58,867
With this!

346
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,033
<i>That'll change</i>
<i>the trajectory!</i>

347
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,271
All the way to
the other shore?!

348
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,309
Hashirama...

349
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,879
{\an1}It has been a while
since we've fought

350
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:21,112
{\an1}each other all-out!

351
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,213
{\an1}You can see that I have
changed, can you not?

352
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:28,583
{\an1}You're going to lay waste to
everything? To all we've

353
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,451
accomplished up
till now, Madara?

354
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,686
{\an1}Nothing will come of us
battling each other...

355
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,355
{\an1}This fight will only hurt
village and shinobi!

356
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,090
{\an1}This is disrespectful
toward our brothers

357
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,625
{\an1}and our comrades!

358
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,493
{\an1}You know nothing of my-!

359
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,127
I don't want to
have to kill you!

360
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,328
{\an1}Are you implying that
you could take me

361
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,029
{\an1}down at any time?

362
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,163
I'm not! I mean
we're friends!

363
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:57,432
{\an1}Enough of all this!
I've already reached it!

364
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,768
[angry roar]

365
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,669
Then so be it...

366
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,438
{\an1}Sage Art: Wood Style.

367
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:11,340
{\an1}Shinsu Senju Veritable
1000-Armed Kan'on!

368
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,809
{\an1}Here I go, Madara!

369
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:15,243
{\an1}Come on, Hashirama!

370
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:21,213
[attacking yell]

371
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,603
{\an1}<i>Just aim it a little</i>
<i>higher than you'd expect.</i>

372
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:00,937
{\an1}<i>That's the trick.</i>

373
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:03,505
{\an1}<i>Yeah, I know! It'll reach</i>
<i>the other side if I simply</i>

374
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,306
{\an1}<i>put my all into it! Who</i>
<i>the hell are you, anyway?</i>

375
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
{\an1}<i>First name's Hashirama.</i>
<i>But I can't tell</i>

376
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:09,775
{\an1}<i>you my last name.</i>

377
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,876
<i>Hashirama, huh?</i>

378
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,644
<i>That was...</i>

379
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:19,548
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Hashirama</i>
<i>and Madara."</i>

380
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,750
{\an1}<i>...my first encounter</i>
