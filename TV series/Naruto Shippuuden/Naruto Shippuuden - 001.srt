you've been out there?

167
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,754
-Yeah, but sensei, that cat
was faster than lightning.

168
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,822
-It was almost like
it had run off before.

169
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,224
-I don't want to hear it.

170
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,759
A mission of this
delicate nature

171
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,395
requires speed and precision,
which you three are sorely

172
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,396
lacking in.

173
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,164
You need more training.

174
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,266
-Well, how do you expect
me to push my limits

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,202
on a lamewad mission
like this one?

176
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:27,140
Hey, Iruka-sensei, don't you
have anything flashier for me?

177
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,742
-Uh, look, it's not that simple.

178
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,877
-Listen carefully.

179
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,813
You three screwups only
just make genin level.

180
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,416
No one's going to assign you
to high rank missions right out

181
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,483
of the gate.

182
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,485
-All you'll be getting
is D-rank for now.

183
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,320
-Pfft.

184
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,488
I'm not taking no for an answer.

185
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,591
After all, you're looking
at the Seventh Hokage.

186
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,392
-The Seventh?

187
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,328
What about the Sixth Hokage?

188
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,996
-That spot's taken.

189
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,698
Naruto's gonna get it.

00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:53,633
-Huh?

192
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,909
-Yeah, speaking of Naruto--

193
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,012
-I wonder where he
even is right now.

194
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,249
-I bet when he comes back, he'll
have become an awesome shinobi.

195
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,086
I believe in him 100%.

[music playing]

197
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,159
-Seventh Hokage, perhaps, but
definitely a second Naruto.

198
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,799
IRUKA: I hope you're doing
OK out there, Naruto.

199
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,568
-I don't care what it takes!

200
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,305
I'll get stronger and
bring Sasuke back!

201
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,875
-It's been quite a while
since he spoke those words

202
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,878
and left to train
with Master Jiraiya.

203
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,012
-Yes.

204
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,550
It's about time for him
to come home, isn't it?

205
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,553
-The Leaf Village
needs him to return.

206
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,156
There's too much happening
for him to be away now.

207
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,639
-Huh?

208
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,140
-Huh?

209
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,815
-Hey now, is that
who I think it is?

210
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,784
-Uh-huh, no doubt about it.

211
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,523
KONOHAMARU: Hey, Sakura!

212
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,458
-Hmm?

213
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,326
Oh, hi, Konohamaru.

214
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,162
-So where are you off to?

215
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,396
-The main gate.

216
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,899
I have to pick up this
morning's pedestrian traffic

Do you want to come along?

219
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,972
NARUTO: It's been
about 2 and 1/2 years.

220
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,509
JIRAIYA: So it has.

221
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,211
KONOHAMARU: Then
the cat went nutso

222
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,980
and started scratching
my face off.

223

gotten word or anything

226
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,721
from Naruto?

227

-Nope, nothing yet.

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,560
-Aw, too bad.

229
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,497

around here pretty soon now.

-Something's waiting
for you back in town.

-Yeah, you have to
see it to believe it.

-What are you guys
talking about?

-No way.

Mm-hmm.

taller than me, haven't you?

Yeah, I guess I have.

outside that's changed.

old Naruto, but you've

turned out pretty
well, haven't you?

We don't see each other
for over two years

to pull a stunt like that?

in the stronghold of
the Hidden Sand Village.

Since the shinobi appeared
not to have put up a fight,

00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,028
the crime may have
been committed

by someone they
were familiar with,

343
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,532
or by an extremely
skilled intruder.

There's also been reports

Glad you can make it.

If you're gonna visit the Leaf,
the first stop you gotta make

is at the Great Mountainside
Images of the Hokage.

Starting from the left, you'll
find the First Hokage, founder

357
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,147
of the village and master
of wood-style ninjutsu.
