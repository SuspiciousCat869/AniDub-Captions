00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.314 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am Hagoromo, founder of
Ninshu, the Ninja Creed...

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:17.752 position:10% line:83% align:start
also called the Sage of the
Six Paths.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.655 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Sage of the Six Paths?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.423 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, indeed.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:31.866 position:13% line:77% align:start
Naruto and Sasuke are the
current reincarnates of Ashura
and Indra's souls,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.102 position:10% line:77% align:start
...and right at this moment,
they're battling against my
mother Kaguya...

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.538 position:50% line:89% align:start
Ashura?

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:41.141 position:10% line:83% align:start
You called me the "previous
reincarnate."

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:46.346 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, that's right. You may
not know, but Ashura and
Indra are my sons.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.184 position:13% line:77% align:start
And Kaguya, the one Sasuke
and Naruto are fighting now, is
my mother.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
She's what?!

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:59.027 position:5% line:77% align:start
And I can see that there's a
connection to Ashura and Indra's
souls within you, as well.

 <i>Madara.</i>

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.005 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Hashirama) Inside me...?!

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mother was able to take
advantage of their souls...

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.979 position:5% line:77% align:start
...and after an extraordinary
length of time, she has now
been revived.

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:23.585 position:7% line:77% align:start
Right now, I know everything,
even the intentions of the
creature that is called Zetsu.

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:27.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
He is my mother's third son, who
influenced and tricked Madara.

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:38.032 position:7% line:83% align:start
Before I talk about Ashura and
Indra,

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:43.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
I must first explain the origin
of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.507 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>Back then, my younger brother</i>
 <i>Hamura and I sealed our mother</i>
 <i>Kaguya in the moon.</i>

[boulders crashing]

 <i>Hamura decided that he would go</i>

 <i>could watch over Mother.</i>

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks for your help, Gamamaru.

00:03:55.737 --> 00:04:00.208 position:19% line:77% align:start
Without the Sage Power that
you taught me, there's no way
we could have beaten Mother.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're still determined
to leave, brother?

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:06.814 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes. I must. There's something
that I have to do.

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:08.716 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just what are you planning?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.052 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Gamamaru) My journey has two</i>
 <i>purposes.</i>

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:12.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
The first is...

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:18.458 position:5% line:77% align:start
...to find dwellings for
the Nine Tailed Beasts I
extracted from Ten Tails.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:21.629 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Hagoromo) I want to make</i>
 <i>sure they don't fight amongst</i>
 <i>each other...</i>

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.532 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>...and that people don't use</i>
 <i>their powers for evil.</i>

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:28.669 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>I intend to choose their homes</i>
 <i>very carefully.</i>

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:33.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
And the second purpose...is to
restore this ravaged land.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.311 position:7% line:77% align:start
In our battle against Mother,
we caused terrible damage to
this place.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:43.551 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have to find a way to atone
for that crime.

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:44.986 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:51.125 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, you're right. That is
a good idea. But the road
ahead will be difficult.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.292 position:52% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm aware.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know, I had another
dream last night.

00:04:55.263 --> 00:04:56.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
A dream?

00:04:57.632 --> 00:05:01.334 position:7% line:77% align:start
Toads very rarely have dreams.
But the dreams they do have
always come true.

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:04.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's because a toad's
dream is destiny.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:05.606 position:41% line:89% align:start
What did you dream?

00:05:07.008 --> 00:05:10.178 position:7% line:77% align:start
I saw that far in the future,
there will appear a
blue-eyed youth

00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:13.648 position:10% line:77% align:start
who can name all nine Tailed
Beasts and who will frolic
among them.

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:16.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
I dreamed that he will
call forth a miracle.

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:19.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
Does that mean there'll be
another age of discord?

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:21.022 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:05:21.055 --> 00:05:24.759 position:7% line:83% align:start
So then, will everything I do
now be meaningless?

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:28.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't waste your time worrying.
You may try with all your might,

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:32.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
but your fate is something
that you cannot escape.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.371 position:5% line:5% align:start
Just go on your way, and if Fate
wills it, our paths shall cross
again one day, brother.

Farewell, friend.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.253 position:7% line:83% align:start

first test.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:27.822 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, hey hey!

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.335 position:50% line:83% align:start
Just what do you
think you're doing?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm going to fix the bridge.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:48.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
What?! But why?! No one
asked you to do that!

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:53.047 position:10% line:77% align:start

seems this bridge is essential
to everyone.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.385 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yeah, exactly! Everybody needs
it. So it's a problem for me if
it's there.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% line:89% align:start
Oh? Interesting.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:05.192 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just listen. Because the
bridge is broken now, everyone
has to stop right there.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.459 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's where I come in.

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:10.798 position:27% line:77% align:start
You see, I go to whoever
wants to cross, pick up their
belongings,

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:13.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
and offer to help them
get to the other side.

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.737 position:27% line:77% align:start
Then, without a moment's
hesitation, I run off
with their stuff!

00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:21.108 position:27% line:77% align:start
I may not look fast, but
these legs never fail! This
is what I do for a living.

[chuckle]

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:27.848 position:5% line:77% align:start

bridge to make a living
as a common thief.

00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:32.086 position:35% line:77% align:start
That's right! So just
leave well enough alone
and get lost, would ya?!

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:37.158 position:5% line:77% align:start
But as it stands, this
situation's only good for you.
And it harms everyone else.

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:39.994 position:38% line:83% align:start

alone. Don't you get it?!

gonna tear it down!

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.445 position:5% line:77% align:start
What do you mean? What's it
look like? I'm building a
bridge! Can't you tell?!

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.716 position:7% line:77% align:start
You're just a thief! Doing that
won't make all the bad stuff you
did go away, you know!

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shut up! Get lost, you brat!

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:32.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] It appears that
you've become just like me now!

00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:36.163 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm nothing like you. I'm not
doing this to atone for
anything.

00:11:36.197 --> 00:11:38.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
I told you. I'm destroying it
once it's done!

00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:47.576 position:33% line:89% align:start
[hammering]

00:11:58.553 --> 00:12:00.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
All that work and only
a third done.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:05.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
Breaking it is easy but building
it back up is a lot of work.

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:12.032 position:7% line:77% align:start
I don't know, It feels pretty
sturdy. It isn't gonna be easy
to break this one!

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:15.202 position:44% line:83% align:start
That's true. If we
make it too sturdy...

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:17.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
...you'll break your bones

(Futami) Hey, you! Get your

using those to fix the bridge!

00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:30.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Villager) We just thought we'd
help you out.

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:34.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, after all, we're going to
be using the bridge, too.

the effort to destroy.

Are you kidding me?! After all

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.311 position:7% line:89% align:start
Take care of yourself, Futami.

00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:39.587 position:58% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait up!

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:42.022 position:50% line:89% align:start
I'm coming, too!

00:13:42.056 --> 00:13:45.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh? I thought that bridge
was where you lived.

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it was, but with an
awesome bridge like that...

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.865 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, frankly, my business is
done for!

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:57.304 position:7% line:83% align:start
(Hagoromo) When you do a good
deed, people are grateful,

00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:59.641 position:13% line:83% align:start
...and that creates a nice
feeling inside you.

00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:03.477 position:5% line:77% align:start
And then, because it feels good,
that makes you want to do even
more good deeds.

00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:06.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
That repetition is the cycle of
goodness.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, you're right! It makes
sense when you put it like that.

00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:11.820 position:47% line:83% align:start
You really have a
way with words.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.723 position:38% line:83% align:start
By the way, I didn't
ask you before, but...

00:14:15.557 --> 00:14:17.458 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Futami) Who are you anyway?</i>

[gasp]

00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:26.066 position:10% line:77% align:start
Someone who once wreaked an
enormous amount of havoc upon
this world...

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
A bunch of years ago, there were
all these giant tsunami

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.506 position:7% line:83% align:start
... and volcanic eruptions here
and there.

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:34.375 position:5% line:83% align:start

you're the one who caused them!

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh come on, there's no way
one person could've done that!

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:44.284 position:13% line:77% align:start
And besides, if you were that
strong, you could've fixed that
bridge in an instant

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:47.154 position:33% line:77% align:start
 <i>...instead of working</i>

 <i>to do it!</i>

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:51.726 position:10% line:77% align:start
I decided that I would never
use excessive power like
that again.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.330 position:5% line:77% align:start

Whoa, what is this?!
Power's surging in me!

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
I passed some of my own
power on to you just now.

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:10.444 position:64% line:89% align:start
Your power?

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:13.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes. Rather,
let's call it chakra.

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:17.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a power that connects
people to each other...

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:20.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or at least that's the kind of
power that I want it to be.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.290 position:38% line:83% align:start
You passed something
like that on to me?

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:27.796 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, that's right. But it isn't
something that I can bestow to
just anyone.

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:31.533 position:7% line:77% align:start
As we've spent time together,
I've come to feel very close to
you.

00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you've learned what it
means to have a good heart.

00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.003 position:78% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:39.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing now?

00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.744 position:47% line:83% align:start
I beg you! Let me
be your apprentice!

00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:44.311 position:5% line:89% align:start
My apprentice...?!

00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:48.148 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah! I can tell that there's
something very special in you.

00:15:48.182 --> 00:15:53.220 position:38% line:77% align:start
Till now, I've lived
a meaningless life. Everything
I've done has been worthless!

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:57.892 position:16% line:77% align:start
But you're different! You're
someone who's able to do
truly great things!

00:15:57.926 --> 00:16:01.295 position:35% line:83% align:start
So if I stay with you
and learn from you,

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:04.732 position:41% line:77% align:start
...then maybe I can
bring some worth to my
insignificant life.

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.602 position:5% line:77% align:start
Are you saying that
you want to help
other people now?

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:09.336 position:7% line:89% align:start
After we finished that bridge,

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:12.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
...and I saw all those smiling,
happy people,

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:17.277 position:13% line:77% align:start
I have never felt prouder!
And I will never forget the
looks on their faces!

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:22.983 position:24% line:77% align:start
That's the bond you spoke
of! I mean, isn't that
right, Master Hagoromo?

00:16:27.187 --> 00:16:30.658 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, I believe that you've
just taught me something very
important.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:36.764 position:5% line:77% align:start
I think the journey I'm on
has uncovered another
significant purpose.

00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:41.468 position:10% line:77% align:start
A third goal to fulfill: to
help people create connections
through chakra.

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:43.070 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

 <i>Eventually the day will come</i>
 <i>when you will be united again</i>

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:36.077 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>...each of you with a unique</i>

 <i>before.</i>

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.615 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>And unlike when you were inside</i>

 <i>the right path.</i>

00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:44.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>I hope you learn what true</i>

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.055 position:13% line:89% align:start
Before that time comes...

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:57.999 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>Throughout this long history,</i>
 <i>men appeared one after another</i>

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:07.008 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>with the desire to use the</i>

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:17.552 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>Anyway, back to my story. We</i>
 <i>continued our long journey.</i>

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:23.758 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>When at last I had fulfilled all</i>
 <i>three of my goals, I returned to</i>
 <i>my village,</i>

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:27.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>...and made it the headquarters</i>
 <i>of Ninshu.</i>

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>I married, and in time, I</i>
 <i>fathered two sons.</i>

00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:38.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Their names were Indra and</i>
 <i>Ashura.</i>

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:42.977 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>Their mother had a difficult</i>
 <i>recovery after giving birth to</i>
 <i>Ashura,</i>

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.513 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>...and she passed away shortly</i>
 <i>afterword.</i>

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:52.252 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>But my two sons grew up strong</i>
 <i>and healthy, and they were very</i>
 <i>close to each other.</i>

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:54.822 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>The older one was especially</i>
 <i>caring,</i>

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:58.492 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>...and the younger one was</i>
 <i>always chasing after his</i>
 <i>brother.</i>

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>At the time, I didn't realize</i>
 <i>it, but...</i>

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>There was a dark force that was</i>
 <i>already at work.</i>

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:16.811 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>Trying to manipulate my sons.</i>

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:59.412 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Hagoromo) At the time, Ninshu</i>
 <i>did not yet have a practical</i>
 <i>application for fighting.</i>

00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:03.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>My original intent was for it to</i>
 <i>help bring souls together.</i>

00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:08.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>However, due to the innovations</i>
 <i>that Indra introduced,</i>

00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:11.726 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>...the course of Ninshu was</i>
 <i>changed drastically.</i>

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:16.664 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
 <i>"Ashura and Indra."</i>

00:23:16.697 --> 00:23:21.969 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>He was the one worthy of being</i>
