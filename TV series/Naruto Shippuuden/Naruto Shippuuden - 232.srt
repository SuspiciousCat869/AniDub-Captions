{\an1}Boy, it sure gets boring
when everything goes
right on a trip.

3
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:22,858
{\an1}Captain Yamato! You have
anything for me to do?

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,593
{\an1}<i>You, Aoba? </i>

00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,262
{\an1}[sighing]

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:34,966
{\an7}I wonder how everyone's
doing back at the Hidden
Leaf... Maybe one of
them'll come by again.

7
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:40,870

{\an1}[heavy breathing]

10
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,217
{\an1}Good morning. You're up
early.

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,019
Good morning,
Tenten!

12
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,855
{\an1}With this war on the way,
we have to make sure to
hone our skills.

13
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:10,222
{\an1}You're right...

14
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,056
{\an1}Huh!

15
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,859
Huh!

16
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:26,732
{\an4}They say that this war is
going center on Naruto,
but it's kind of hard to
imagine why that is...

17
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,535
{\an1}I wonder how he's doing
on his mission.

18
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,805
{\an1}<i>Probably eating some</i>
<i>local ramen special! He</i>
<i>didn't seem too worried. </i>

19
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:35,605
Uh!

20
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,140
{\an1}Lady Hinata! We'd best
be going soon!

21
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:40,875
{\an1}For what?

22
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:45,011
We have a big clan
meeting today. So, bye...

23
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:52,416
{\an4}We, the Hyuga Clan, will
play an important role
here in Hidden Leaf
Village.

24
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:58,887
{\an4}Expect to be given
Sensory-type duties
once the impending Fourth
Great Ninja War begins.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,991
{\an4}<i>Assignments will vary,</i>
<i>but in a crisis, we'll</i>
<i>need one person to unify</i>
<i>and lead the whole clan. </i>

26
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:10,895
{\an4}I can't. I've been
assigned to the rear guard.
And Hanabi's still too young
for real combat.

27
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:14,496
{\an1}<i>Neji, I want you to</i>
<i>command our clan on the</i>
<i>front lines. </i>

28
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,197
{\an4}(shocked, scandalized,
tittering about how
irregular this choice is
reax)

29
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,231
{\an1}Neji? From the Side
Branch?

30
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:19,801
{\an1}<i>But what of Lady Hinata</i>
<i>from the Main Branch? </i>

31
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:26,271
{\an1}The entire clan is well
aware of Neji's abilities.
Go, Neji. Do well.

{\an1}<i>Please! Reconsider! </i>

34
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:21,812
{\an7}Lord Hiashi, you're aware
how hard Lady Hinata has
trained these past few
years.

35
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,882
{\an7}<i>She proved her bravery</i>
<i>when she stood up to Pain</i>
<i>all by herself. </i>

36
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,484
{\an1}A favor to ask? What is
it, Hinata?

37
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,920
{\an1}Neji...

38
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:35,621
{\an1}Please, could you use your
help to train in the
Gentle Fist.

39
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:38,489
{\an1}Lady Hinata, you're the
Main Branch's-

40
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,557
{\an1}Hanabi is the Main
Branch's heir.

41
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:46,695
{\an1}Did you know, Neji? Naruto
left to train with Master
Jiraiya.

42
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,063
While he's gone...

43
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:51,565
{\an1}I want to train as much
as I can, too!

44
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:57,301
{\an4}I don't know if my
instruction will be too
strict or not, but
okay.

45
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,602
Oh, thank you!

46
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,905
[yelling]

47
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:29,556

[grunting]

50
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,104
{\an1}Quite excellent, Lady
Hinata.

51
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,071
[panting]

52
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,238
{\an1}Heh!

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,374
{\an1}<i>There's no doubt she has</i>
<i>the potential to develop</i>
<i>further. </i>

54
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,211
Then--

55
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:05,645
{\an8}This isn't just about
being a Hyuga. She does
not have the disposition
to lead shinobi.

56
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,279
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

57
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:10,082
{\an1}Lady Hinata is simply
far too kind.

58
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:17,720
{\an4}Since I can't serve as
captain anymore for
obvious reasons... Team
Eight has been disbanded.

59
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,655
You're all scattered on
separate missions.

60
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,592
I really feel quite bad
about that. You forgive me?

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,725
Of course.

62
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:27,827
Thank you.

63
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:33,597
{\an4}<i>It's so much easier to</i>
<i>talk woman-to-woman. It</i>
<i>wouldn't be as smooth</i>
<i>with Kiba and Shino. </i>

64
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,365
{\an1}It is, really?

65
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,800
Yes, of course!

66
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,601
{\an1}Huh? Oh, it's Hinata.

67
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,436
{\an1}Hello, Shikamaru!

68
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,970
{\an1}Sensei.

69
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,738
{\an1}You seem so busy.

70
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:49,674
{\an4}I was just on a mission,
but I don't have it as
rough as Lady Tsunade or
my dad.

71
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,576
{\an1}So you were out of the
village, then?

72
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,579
{\an4}Tenten and I went to
deliver supplies to Naruto
and the others out on the
ship.

73
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,480
{\an1}Really? To Naruto?

74
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:02,216
{\an1}That's right; and he's
doing just fine, don't
worry.

75
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,751
{\an1}Oh, that's why this
morning, Tenten was--

76
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:09,888
{\an1}<i>I guess Sakura, Ino and</i>
<i>Choji ran into him by</i>
<i>chance on a mission, too.</i>

77
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,057
{\an4}<i>Oh, that's right; I</i>
<i>almost forgot: Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade was looking for</i>
<i>you. </i>

78
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,792
{\an1}Is it for a mission?

79
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:16,892
{\an1}Who knows?

80
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:19,627
{\an1}I'll stop by again,
Kurenai Sensei.

81
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:23,663
She's always been like
that when it comes to
Naruto.

82
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,398
{\an1}So? Did you decide on a
name yet?

83
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,366
{\an3}Huh?

84
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,500
{\an1}<i>For the baby.</i>

85
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,137
{\an1}I've been giving that
a lot of thought.

86
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:36,571
{\an1}Lady Tsunade!

87
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,705
Oooinnnk.

88
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:41,574
{\an1}What were they thinking?
How could it end up like
this?

89
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,109
Where's Lady Tsunade?

90
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:48,979
{\an4}Oh, hi. She stepped out.
Let me see, where is
she supposed to be right
now...

91
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:54,917
{\an4}Um... Ah! She's scheduled
to be with the Cipher
Corps. But I doubt that
things are on schedule.

92
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,018
{\an1}I'll go there. Thanks.

93
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:59,120
Okay. Fine.

94
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,488
{\an1}Frankly, Lady Tsunade
left already.

95
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,455
Oh, I see; too bad...

96
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:09,358
{\an7}The Cipher Corps has been
very busy working on a
secret code that's going
to be used by the Allied

97
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:10,726
{\an7}Shinobi Force.

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,297
{\an7}We got chewed out because
we're running behind
schedule.  [giggling]

99
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,932
{\an1}<i>She said she's going to</i>
<i>check on the food supply</i>
<i>situation next. </i>

100
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,332
{\an1}Thanks, I'll go see.

101
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,201
{\an1}<i>Good luck. </i>

102
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,137
{\an1}No, Lady Tsunade's
already come and gone.

103
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,505
{\an1}<i>Hey! What's up, Hinata? You</i>
<i>here to help us out or</i>
<i>what? </i>

104
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:32,241
{\an1}Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry,
I'm not.

105
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:36,577
{\an8}I wish they'd send more
help. We can barely keep
with all these food
deliveries!

106
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,512
{\an1}We need 'em! We don't
know how long the war
will last!

107
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,080
Yeah. Whatever.

108
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:44,882
{\an1}Ya know, Lady Tsunade did
mention that she was going
to check on Ninja Tools.

109
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,951
{\an1}<i>Well, she was here, but</i>
<i>she left. </i>

110
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,019
{\an1}Um, Tenten...

111
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,987
{\an1}Did you see Naruto while
out on your mission?

112
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,789
Yeah, when I delivered
supplies to his ship.

113
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:59,525
{\an1}Are there any other
missions like that, do
you know?

114
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:01,826
Don't look at me; I
wouldn't know that!

115
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,662
Ask Lady Tsunade. She
said she was going to the
Medical Corps.

116
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,630
{\an1}Thanks, I'll try there.

117
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:12,900
[chuckling]

118
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,869
{\an1}No, Lady Tsunade couldn't
make it.

119
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:16,970
{\an3}Huh?!

120
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,504
{\an1}I was just told to submit
a report to her.

121
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,672
{\an1}<i>But everyone's been</i>
<i>helping out. </i>

122
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:25,008
{\an1}I have at least some
knowledge about
medicines.

123
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,910
{\an1}And they put me in charge
of the food pills, isn't
that great?

124
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,644
{\an1}<i>Oh, there you are! </i>

125
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:30,478
{\an1}Hmm?

126
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,578
<i>Hey! </i>

127
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,913
Tenten...

128
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,580
{\an1}What can I do for you?

129
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:37,716
{\an1}What do you say we get
together tonight and do
it up a little?

130
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:40,085
{\an1}We can all go to Barbe-Q!

131
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:42,686
{\an1}Barbe-Q?! You can
count me in!

132
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Sounds great.

133
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:46,222
{\an1}Sorry, boys, but you
men aren't invited.

134
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:46,889
Huh?

135
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,522
{\an1}Aw. But why not?

136
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:52,659
{\an4}Because I think it's time
that all of us had a
girls-only get-together.
Right?

137
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,560
It is...?!

138
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,161
{\an1}We're gonna have a girls'
night out!

139
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,563
{\an1}<i>For combat units one</i>
<i>through five... </i>

140
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:03,066
{\an1}...we will assign
personnel according to
their skills.

141
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,969
{\an4}The Commando Unit and
Support units are going
to handle surprise
attacks.

142
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:12,538
{\an4}Those units will be  reinforced
with shinobi from the
Hidden Leaf and the other
villages.

143
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:18,075
{\an4}You must slow down! We
can't keep up! You must
be more respect for the
elderly.

144
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:20,644
It's your age that I'm
counting on!

145
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:21,978
Oh...?

146
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:25,546
{\an1}You've managed to live
through two of the Great
Ninja Wars so far.

147
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,183
{\an1}I want you to pass on the
wisdom of your
experience.

148
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:33,152
Sometimes I feel that
perhaps I shouldn't have
lived so long.

149
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,020
{\an1}You two are lucky.

150
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:38,656
{\an1}I've quit drinking and
gambling and still can't
handle all this planning!

151
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:43,792
{\an4}And I've come to believe
that it's because I no
longer have any peers to
lean on.

152
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:47,594
{\an1}There's no doubt that
times were hard for your
generation...

153
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:51,530
{\an1}Your class in particular
lost so many.

154
00:10:56,633 --> 00:11:00,503
{\an1}These days, I even wish
for Orochimaru to be
here.

155
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:05,572
{\an1}If he were here,... I
seriously doubt he'd side
with the Hidden Leaf.

156
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,208
{\an1}Forgive me. I was just
venting.

157
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,609
{\an1}That's fine... that's what
I'm here for.

158
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,778
<i>Excuse me!</i>
<i>Pardon my intrusion! </i>

159
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,279
{\an1}What is it?

160
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,480
{\an7}The Feudal Lord would
like to speak with you
now, if it's not
inconvenient.

161
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:18,715
{\an7}Which it looks
like it is.

162
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,983
{\an8}This is why I can't
get any work done.

163
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:25,786
{\an1}Pardon me, Lady
Tsunade...

164
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,620
{\an1}Oh. Yes, Hinata?

165
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,454
{\an1}Do you have a mission for
me?

166
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,324
No.

167
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:37,294
{\an5}But I did receive
Hiashi's report that Neji
will be leading the Hyuga
on the front lines.

168
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,660
{\an1}That's right.

169
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:42,164
{\an1}Hinata. You must not take
this as a rejection of
your skills.

170
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,064
{\an1}Uh--

171
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:46,633
{\an1}Just keep doing what you
must do for now.

172
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,600
{\an1}It will suffice.

173
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,635
{\an1}<i>Lady Tsunade, we must</i>
<i>hurry.</i>

174
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,070
I know.

175
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,373
{\an7}<i>But... my Father--</i>

176
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,276
{\an7}<i>--doesn't believe that</i>
<i>I'm strong enough. </i>

177
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,146
{\an1}<i>So Barbe-Q reopened? </i>

178
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,248
{\an1}<i>I made us a reservation! </i>

179
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:11,882
Ooh! Beef tongue with
salt!

180
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,617
{\an1}The new menu has a
special Ladies Combo!
It's such a good deal!

181
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,253
{\an1}And I just can't resist
a good deal!

182
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,989
{\an7}Frankly, my favorite here
is the offal!

183
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,155
Mm--

184
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,257
Did you ladies
decide on drinks?

185
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,525
Great! Excuse me! We're
ready to order!

186
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,927
Thanks for coming!

187
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:33,596
{\an4}I figured if the girls
were having a get-together,
the boys should have one of
their own, too.

188
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,999
{\an1}So let's eat and drink
until our bellies are full!

189
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:40,968
{\an1}<i>So, what did the Feudal Lord</i>
<i>want to discuss? </i>

190
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,569
{\an1}That was no "discussion!"

191
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:49,673
{\an4}He only cared about what
might happen to him! What
if this? What if that?
Over and over!

192
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,074
{\an1}<i>I'm done for today! </i>

193
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:51,842
What?!

194
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,943
{\an1}Shizune! I'm going
drinking!

195
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,144
{\an1}But you swore off
alcohol!

196
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:57,912
I'm drinking tonight!

197
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,246
{\an1}Okay! Oh, no.

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,613
Here's to us!

199
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,382
Cheers!

200
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,450
So, why are we
all getting together?

201
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,519
Well, everybody's just
been so busy with getting
ready for the war...

202
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,520
We need some stress
relief, right?

203
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:14,023
{\an1}Yeah, all of us need to
unwind!

204
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:19,159
{\an5}There aren't any
ordinary missions anymore.
Everything's focused on
getting ready for the war.

205
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:24,896
{\an8}Frankly, I appreciate
being invited tonight,
but how does everybody
here know each other?

206
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,400
That's funny. Why do we
always end up hanging out
with each other, anyway?

207
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,235
{\an1}Maybe it's because we all
took the Chunin Exams
together or something...

208
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,568
[gasping]

209
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:36,570
{\an1}Oh, right; I bet that's
it.

210
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:40,739
{\an5}We're basically
classmates. And we sure
did go on a lot of
missions together!

211
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:43,509
{\an1}Boy, the Chunin Exam...

212
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:46,344
{\an8}You were such a nuisance
back then!

213
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,078
{\an1}You're sure one to talk!

214
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,379
Hmmph.

215
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,780
[laughing]

216
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:56,950
{\an1}To be honest, I still
don't get this Allied
Shinobi Force thing.

217
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:01,086
{\an1}It's like putting all
kinds of meat on one
plate...

218
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,190
{\an1}Nothing wrong with a
little variety!

219
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:10,325
But we're not talking
about food here, Choji!

220
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,593
The Hidden Leaf Village
just doesn't really have
any close ties

221
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:16,729
{\an1}with other villages aside
from the Hidden Sand Village.

222
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,999
{\an1}I've heard there have
been issues with the
Hidden Cloud.

223
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:23,468
{\an1}I'm sure it's not just
us. With the villages'
histories,

224
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,003
{\an1}there's bound to be
issues between and
inside all of them.

225
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:32,139
{\an5}I agree, every village
has one kind of grudge or
another against all the
other villages.

226
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,375
{\an1}And yet the Five Kage all
agreed to this alliance.

227
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,177
That means the Akatsuki
is quite formidable.

228
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,313
Well, when war breaks
out, we'll all just have
to fight our hardest...

229
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,748
Without really knowing
who's fighting on either
side of us.

230
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:48,317
{\an1}You've never been afraid
of strangers, Kiba.

231
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,020
{\an1}Hey, shut up! It's just a
big pain to remember
their scents.

232
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:57,989
{\an4}When all of us are
together like this, it
brings back memories of
that mission...

233
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:02,725
{\an1}But then, the Chunin Exam
was cancelled, When it
was only half way done.

234
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,261
{\an1}You mean when the Leaf
Village was attacked?

235
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:09,964
{\an4}So much has happened, but
we haven't lost anyone,
and we still get together
like this.

236
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,399
It must mean
our generation is
exceptional!

237
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:15,835
{\an1}Yeah, you're right. The
only one who's really
gone is Sasuke!

238
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,636
Oh, boy. Guess I
shouldn't have said
that...

239
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,805
{\an1}Hey, Sakura, come on
back; it's okay!

240
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,942
Are you talking about
that time we went to
get Sasuke back?

241
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,776
But we failed.

242
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,045
{\an1}The reason is because you
didn't take me along.

243
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,746
You're seriously still
upset about that?!

244
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,584
{\an4}Well, it certainly was a
tough battle, and yet
all of us made it through
okay somehow.

245
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,452
Yes. And it turned out
to be a good experience.

246
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,121
Uhhhh...

247
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,322
{\an1}<i>Now both of them are</i>
<i>depressed. </i>

248
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,155
Huh?

249
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,656
{\an1}That isn't true! I'm not
depressed!

250
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,024
{\an1}[gasping]

251
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,494
{\an1}<i>I'm glad...</i>

252
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:55,960
Huh?

253
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:58,095
{\an1}...that I took the Chunin
Exam.

254
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,464
{\an1}You lost to Neji, but you
gave it your all! That's
what matters.

255
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:05,501
{\an1}Mm-hm. It's because
he cheered me on back
then.

256
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:09,802
{\an1}<i>Because Naruto supported</i>
<i>me, I was able to do my</i>
<i>best. </i>

257
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,872
Naruto. He was
unpredictable even way
back then,

258
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:17,374
{\an5}but who ever
would've imagined that
he'd become the village
hero one day?

259
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,041
{\an1}Yeah!

260
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,411
{\an7}And this time it's now
our turn to protect
Naruto.

261
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,279
Uh!

262
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,516
{\an7}<i>Our turn... to protect</i>
<i>Naruto.</i>

263
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:33,017
That kid can still be a
real grade-A idiot,
though.

264
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,418
{\an1}I know!

265
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,420
{\an1}Oh, I think these are
good to go!

266
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,589
{\an1}Yeah, let's eat!

267
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,190
{\an1}So! Finally found your
appetite!

268
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:44,858
{\an1}Yes, I need to become
stronger.

269
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:50,996
The marinated pork jowls
you ordered are ready now!

270
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,565
{\an1}Yummy! Gimme!

271
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,132
{\an1}You'll turn into a pig!

272
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,468
{\an5}What are you talking
about? They're full of
collagen! It's good for
you!

273
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:03,104
{\an1}It kind of feels like
someone's missing without
Naruto...

274
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:06,906
{\an1}That is true. Naruto would
make our group feel more
complete.

275
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,608
{\an1}Man, I wonder what he's
doing out there...

276
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,976
{\an1}I'll bet that he's not
having barbecued meat!

277
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,344
No, not while he's at
sea.

278
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:19,915
{\an1}Fish again, huh? Why's it
always gotta be fish...?

279
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,017
[sighing]

280
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,152
{\an1}<i>Some barbecued meat would</i>
<i>be nice once in a while,</i>
<i>you know! </i>

281
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:33,156
{\an5}C'mon! I've got to have
meat when I'm drinking!
Meat! Meat! Get me some
meat!

282
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,257
{\an1}... slow down!

283
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,627
{\an1}Let go of me! And go find
me some food already!

284
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:40,195
[laughing]

285
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:43,497
Oh! What's all this? A
girls' night out?

286
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,864
Lady Tsunade!

287
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:46,831
Uhh--

288
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,334
{\an1}Uh, yeah! This is a
girls-only get-together!

289
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,969
Girls' get-together?

290
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:55,037
{\an1}Move over, move over!

291
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,705
{\an1}<i>But Lady Tsunade,</i>
<i>you're not really a</i>
<i>girl anymo- </i>

292
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:01,442
{\an1}Is it my chest? They're
too big now, aren't they?

293
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:03,109
{\an1}First, bring me a drink!

294
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:05,743
{\an1}Oh, you're way past your
first drink, milady.

295
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:12,882
{\an4}So, what are you up to?
Are all of you talking
about the boys that you
like?

296
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:15,384
{\an7}We were talking about the
Chunin Exam.

297
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:17,385
{\an1}We were just reminiscing.

298
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,021
{\an5}With things the way they
are now... we thought
having some fun together
would be a nice break.

299
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:24,523
{\an3}I see.

300
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,125
Please, eat!

301
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,594
{\an1}Sure.

302
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,730
{\an1}Hinata. What I said
before...

303
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,899
I'm fine...

304
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,067
I know what I must do
now.

305
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,770
{\an1}<i>Thanks to all of you! </i>

306
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:58,311
{\an7}You know, you
girls... are so lucky.

307
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,279
Mm.

308
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,649
{\an1}All right!

309
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:06,083
Who wants to do a little
gambling?!

310
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,818
{\an1}Time for the Princess
Game!

311
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,952
{\an1}Lady Tsunade--

312
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:12,487
Who's gonna be the
Princess?!

313
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:16,889
{\an1}Did Tenten really invite
Lady Tsunade to the
girls' gathering?

314
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,291
I know, talk about
daring...

315
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,226
{\an1}Lady Fifth must be
feeling pretty stressed
out.

316
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,429
{\an1}<i>Boy, did I eat! It's been</i>
<i>a while since I've had</i>
<i>that much barbecue! </i>

317
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,897
{\an1}<i>Okay, time for the</i>
<i>after-party! </i>

318
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:29,965
{\an7}What'll we do?

319
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,766
{\an7}<i>I'm going home. Gotta get</i>
<i>up early. </i>

320
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,799
{\an1}<i>Me too. </i>

321
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,602
{\an8}<i>Frankly, I have to go</i>
<i>back to work. </i>

322
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:39,572
<i>Oh yeah, I wanted to</i>
<i>finish up some stuff</i>
<i>tonight, too. </i>

323
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,540
{\an1}Sorry, Lady Tsunade, but
we're all gonna head home.

324
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:48,311
{\an1}[exchanging goodbyes]

325
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,545
What a dedicated bunch,
aren't they?

326
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:51,546
{\an1}Agreed!

327
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,447
All right! Let's drink
till dawn!

328
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,048
{\an1}What?! No!

329
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:58,050
That's what I'd like to
do, but let's get back to
work!

330
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,451
{\an1}Oh, right!

331
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,054
{\an1}<i>Neji...</i>

332
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:10,325
{\an1}I want to become much
stronger than I am right
now.

333
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,427
{\an1}I think you're strong
enough.

334
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:23,199
{\an7}But... this next war is
to protect Naruto...
So...

335
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,834
{\an1}<i>I must become much, much</i>
<i>stronger. </i>

336
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:28,169
{\an1}<i>I have to be strong! </i>

337
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,706
{\an1}Don't you see?

338
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,041
{\an1}It's because of Naruto
that I've come as far as
I have.

339
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:39,043
{\an1}<i>Lady Hinata,... I'm the</i>
<i>same... </i>

340
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,879
{\an1}It's all thanks to him
that I'm free.

341
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,914
{\an1}Ah! Welcome back.

342
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:48,784
It's good to be home.

343
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,252
{\an1}I'll be all right!

344
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,553
{\an3}Huh--

345
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,555
{\an1}Thank you, Ko.

346
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:06,061
{\an4}<i>You're from the Main</i>
<i>Branch. You should be</i>
<i>leading the clan on the</i>
<i>front lines. </i>

347
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:10,396
{\an4}No. You're suited for the
job, and there should be
no Main or Side Branch
now.

348
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:14,800
{\an1}Unless all of us stand
united, this war cannot
be won.

349
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,903
Huh!

350
00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,067
{\an1}<i>You're livelier than</i>
<i>usual Bushier Brow</i>
<i>Sensei! </i>

351
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,237
{\an4}<i>Of course! Nothing's</i>
<i>better than the feel of</i>
<i>solid ground under your</i>
<i>feet. </i>

352
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,405
{\an1}<i>Well, it's only till</i>
<i>the next harbor. </i>

353
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:11,141
{\an7}<i>Oh, by the way, I</i>
<i>overheard something back</i>
<i>there at the harbor, there</i>
<i>may be imposters here.</i>

354
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,743
{\an1}<i>Imposters...? What</i>
<i>imposters?! </i>

355
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:18,413
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: Naruto's
Imposter.

356
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:21,114
{\an1}What?! Who are you?
