Wouldn't it be better
to go by sea?

17
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:55,412
{\an1}Captain Yamato went outside

Both the Eight and
Nine Tails are safe.

saying he wasn't killed?

{\an1}Well that means the enemy
will have more intel on us!

00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:53,307
{\an1}Let's just get going.
I'll explain more inside.

104
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:07,717
{\an5}I'll have you
begin the process

Zetsu.

105
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:12,856
{\an1}Of course. But first we have
to extract intel from Yamato.

106
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,691
{\an1}Only, you can't
kill him, okay?

107
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:19,827
{\an1}I need him if you
want me to make the
Zetsu stronger.

108
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:26,300
{\an1}It would be very easy to
extract intel if I use the
Rinne Ningendo Jutsu.

109
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,802
{\an1}<i>But then of course he would die.</i>

110
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,639
Are you certain that
we need him alive to
make Zetsu stronger?

111
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,142

139
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:50,185
{\an1}Then have the main battle
regiment divided up into
companies as well,

140
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,219
{\an1}and have them run through
their formations.

141
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:53,320
Right!

142
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,424
{\an4}And make sure that the
logistics and medical
unit is well supplied
with medical ninja tools!

143
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:03,028
Shikaku, go and help the
intel unit check their
chain of communication.

144
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:04,163
{\an1}Roger that.

145
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,032
Find Ao and the
Sensory unit.

146
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,666
And tell them
to hurry up!

147
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:09,568
{\an1}Yes ma'am!

148
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:18,041
{\an1}Tsuchikage.

149
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,177
{\an1}These were just completed.
Here is yours.

150
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:23,412
Oh! They're
ready, are they?

151
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:24,879
Take it.

152
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:28,749
{\an1}<i>Oh! The headbands for the</i>
<i>Allied Shinobi Forces, eh?</i>

153
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,018
{\an1}They're great! Nice job!

154
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,654
{\an1}I designed the symbol myself.

155
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:38,724
{\an1}Former enemies who once battled
against each other have been
combined into one shinobi force!

156
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:44,762
{\an1}And we samurai shall team up
with you shinobi as well.
Now, let's get to work!

157
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,598
Mmm!

158
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,501
{\an3}Next!

159
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:51,535
Here!

160
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:03,412
{\an1}I'm Kankuro of the Sand,
and I've been named captain
of the Commando Unit.

161
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,947
So your name's
Kankuro, is it?

162
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,416
But what should we use
for your nickname?

163
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:09,584
{\an1}Huh?!

164
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,587
{\an8}<i>Are we really gonna</i>
<i>be okay with a young</i>
<i>kid as our Captain?</i>

165
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:16,121
{\an7}<i>What if... what if...</i>

166
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,458
{\an7}<i>What if because of</i>
<i>his inexperience, he</i>
<i>messes up and panics,</i>

167
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:22,695
{\an7}<i>and then I'm forced to</i>
<i>take over and become</i>
<i>the acting captain?!</i>

168
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:25,063
{\an7}<i>Oh man! What'll I do then?!</i>

169
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,931
{\an1}Augghhh!

170
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,633
{\an1}<i>The headbands have</i>
<i>all been distributed!</i>

171
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,669
We've double-checked all
the medical supplies.

172
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,870
Provisions all
accounted for.

173
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,005
<i>Oiink!</i>

174
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:37,839
Huh?

175
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,810
{\an1}Dgh! Who is in charge
of the livestock?!

176
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:44,445
{\an1}One of the pigs
has escaped!

177
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:47,414
{\an1}Huh?

178
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,250
<i>The Captain's arrived!</i>
<i>Everyone line up!</i>

179
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,156
{\an1}I've been ordered to lead the
logistics and medical unit.

180
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,092
{\an1}My name's Shizune.
It's very nice to
meet all of you.

181
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,928
{\an1}There's one thing that I want
you to remember, no matter what.

182
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,567
{\an1}This child is not for eating!

183
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,368
Ooo Ooo!

184
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,539
{\an1}Hi. You're Inoichi,
aren't you?

185
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,040
Who're you?

186
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,874
{\an1}My name is Tenga, sir!

187
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:22,744
{\an1}I've heard a great
deal about you!

188
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:25,012
{\an1}I was hoping I
could interview you
and record you.

189
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,113
I'm sorry that I'm late.

190
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,550
{\an1}Aoba. Boy, you sure have
had a rough time out there.

191
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,152
It's just...
Yamato...

192
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:37,622
{\an1}[sympathetic sigh]
Put it out of
your mind for now.

193
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,760
{\an1}We of the intel unit will
oversee all communications.

194
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,030
{\an1}Intel must be transmitted
accurately and quickly if
it's to be of any use.

195
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:53,568
{\an4}That means in order to do our
jobs well, we have to remain
calm at all times, no matter
what information we might hear.

196
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,403
Understood?

197
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,304
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

198
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,339
{\an1}A war. So this is it.

199
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:01,141
{\an1}You said that your
name was Cee, right?

200
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,243
{\an1}And this is your very
first war, isn't it?

201
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:04,544
{\an3}Yes.

202
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:08,414
{\an1}We are the "eyes" of the
Allied Shinobi Forces.

203
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:12,384
{\an1}So the performance of our
unit can greatly influence
the tide of battle.

204
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,585
{\an1}<i>Don't let your</i>
<i>guard down.</i>

205
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:18,523
{\an1}Right. I understand,
Captain Ao!

206
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,059
All of you stay
focused and alert!

207
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,160
Right!
Right!

208
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,341
{\an1}I heard that they were
going to split all of
us up into five units,

209
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:43,509
{\an1}but I figured that they'd
at least try to group us
together by village.

210
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,446
{\an5}No, that isn't
going to happen.
This is a war,
you know.

211
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,347
Yeah.
He's right.

212
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,183
This is no time to
be competing with
other villages!

213
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:52,818
Yeah.

214
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,052
{\an1}The main regiments are
made up of five units,

215
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:58,689
{\an1}each specializing in
different areas of warfare.

216
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:04,893
{\an1}<i>The First Company: Mid-Range</i>
<i>Battle Unit contains shinobi who</i>
<i>excel at mid-distance combat.</i>

217
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,496
{\an1}<i>It's mostly those who</i>
<i>specialize in weapons.</i>

218
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:13,568
{\an1}<i>The Second Company: Close-Range</i>
<i>Battle Unit specializes in</i>
<i>hand-to-hand combat.</i>

219
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,570
{\an1}<i>The shinobi in that unit will</i>
<i>be fighting on the front lines.</i>

220
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:23,109
{\an4}<i>The Third Company:</i>
<i>Intermediate-Range Battle</i>
<i>Unit provides support to the</i>
<i>close- and mid-range units.</i>

221
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:25,944
{\an1}<i>Its shinobi require</i>
<i>speed and strength.</i>

222
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:28,613
{\an1}We're the Fourth Company:
Long-Range Battle Unit.

223
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:32,716
{\an1}We'll provide the link
between the intel units and
those on the front lines.

224
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,520
{\an1}And in addition, we have
to shield the support
units behind the lines.

225
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,424
{\an4}<i>The Fifth Company:</i>
<i>Special-Range Battle Unit</i>
<i>uses specialized ninjutsu</i>
<i>and tactics.</i>

226
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,826
{\an1}They have a Special Unit?

227
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:48,929
{\an1}That's right. In war,
anything can happen, so
you have to be prepared.

228
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:51,699
{\an1}Sure, we were
organized into units.

229
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:56,102
{\an4}But it's just wishful
thinking to believe that each
team will operate without a
hitch all the time.

230
00:16:57,102 --> 00:17:01,939
{\an1}Also, some units may find
advantageous battlefield
positions while others don't.

231
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:06,310
{\an1}Situations like that are
when we'll rely on shinobi
with Secret Ninjutsu.

232
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,816
{\an1}Well, I can't say for sure that
they've thought of everything.

233
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:17,987
{\an4}But considering that
eighty thousand shinobi
have all been organized
into units this rapidly,

234
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,222
{\an1}Seems Shikaku Nara has
done an amazing job.

235
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,193
{\an1}You know, you'd better
not embarrass your dad.

236
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:30,864
{\an1}So this is it, huh?
The war's about to begin.

237
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:31,698
