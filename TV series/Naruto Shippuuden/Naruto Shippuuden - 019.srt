CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Sasori.

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,463
-Neji.

4
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,099
Are you seeing what
I'm seeing right now?

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,537
-Yes.

6
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,912
The same thing is
happening here.

7
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:23,183
GUY (ON RADIO):
Tenten, What about you?

8
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:23,917
-Me too.

9
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,887
Same on my end.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,222
-Lee.

11
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,058
-I see some kind of form here.

12
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,295
It sprang up as soon
as I removed the tag.

13
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:49,676
-I figured as much

14
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,346
NEJI: Team Kakashi's in.

15
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,046
Just as planned.

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,323
-What the-- What is it?

17
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,670
-Probably some
sort of enemy trap.

18
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,273
-I see then.

19
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,429
-So that's what the game is.

20
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,506
-Formidable, indeed.

21
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,510
I accept, then.

[theme music]

23
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,699
-You bastards!

24
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,508
Where the hell do you
think you're sitting?

25
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,442
-Well.

26
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,945
So much for that mystery.

27
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,748
This kid's the Jinchuriki.

28
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,285
He's the one who bursts in
and barks first, all right.

29
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,686
Seriously.

30
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,888
Itachi was right
on the money, huh?

CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Sasori.

00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,072
NARUTO: Gaara!

33
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,574
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,408
Come on!

35
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,676
Why are you just lying there?

36
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,383
Get up!

37
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,786
Gaara!

38
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,954
Answer me.

00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,523
What are you, deaf?

00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,924
Come on, knock it off already!

41
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,925
KAKASHI: Enough, Naruto.

42
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,634
You know full well that--

00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,743
-Your friend's right.

44
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,378
And you know it, too.

45
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,380
He's been dead for a while now.

46
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,590
-Well.

47
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,525
Oh yeah, that's him all right.

48
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,501
-Give him back.

49
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,737
Give Gaara back, you damn--

50
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,910
-Cool it.

51
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,612
Charge in without thinking
and we're done for.

52
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,401
-A shinobi squad is
always small in number.

53
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,304
A team of either three or four.

54
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,639
-But at least five people
are required in order

55
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,108
to destroy a five seal barrier.

56
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,645
-Which means that a basic
squad is never gonna cut it.

57
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,749
All you can do is wait around
for another team to show up.

58
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,419
-The barrier has slowed
us down considerably.

59
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,455
That alone was
enough to delay us.

60
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,492
GUY: And on top of that, they
rigged the barrier with a trap,

61
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,662
should anyone succeed.

62
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,198
-A replica of the person who
removes the tag appears nearby.

63
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,511
-So they've appeared to stop
us now that the barrier's down.

64
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,748
-In other words, we cannot
offer Naruto and the others any

65
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,884
support unless we
defeat ourselves.

66
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,386
Is that the situation?

67
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,722
GUY (ON RADIO):
Exactly right, Lee.

68
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,858
-They split up a four man
squad with their barrier

69
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,562
and made sure we'd be
tied up here indefinitely.

70
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,364
Very smart of them.

71
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,565
-Maybe.

72
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,570
But we can't just sit
here admiring their work.

73
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,137
-Come!

74
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,073

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,240
I'd expect no less
from my company of me.

He's good.

79
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,652
NEJI (VOICEOVER): They
don't just look the same.

80
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,621
They possess the same abilities.

81
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,139
-So they're armed the
same as we are, too, huh?

82
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,752
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
So everything about

83
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,754
them is the same, then.

84
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,123
That makes them even more
of a worthy opponent!

85
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,109
-What?

86
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,112
Something on your
mind, Sasori, my man?

87
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,481
SASORI: I'll hold onto him.

88
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,815
-Huh?

89
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,084
-Since it appears
that Jinchuriki

90
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,120
will stop at nothing
to get him back.

91
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,658
-Hm.

92
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,426
Yeah.

93
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,260
That's putting it lightly.

94
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,968
KAKASHI: OK.

95
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,569
It looks like the
guy on the left

96
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:40,561
is the one who infiltrated the
Sand and took Lord Kazekage.

97
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,749
Which means this
one is the puppet

98
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,051
master who wounded
Kankuro so badly.

99
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,224
Her grandson Sasori, huh?

100
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:06,166
DEIDARA: Well, my man, I doubt
that you want to hear this,

101
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,802
but I'll just go ahead
and say it anyway.

102
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,173
I think I'll take care
of the Jinchuriki.

103
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,040
-Look.

104
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,843
Our quota is one apiece.

105
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,680
Don't push your luck, Deidara.

106
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:25,718
-An artist must always seek
ever greater stimulation,

107
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:30,890
lest his senses go
dull on him, my man.

108
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,194
Rumor has it, the Nine Tails
Jinchuriki is pretty powerful.

109
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,701
A canvas truly worthy
of my artistry.

110
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,503
-What?

111
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,605
Those pyrotechnics of yours?

112
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,240
Art?

113
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:52,378
Art is a work of beauty,
captured and left

114
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,180
for posterity.

115
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,916
Art is eternal beauty.

116
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,567
DEIDARA: Eternal beauty?

117
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,603
Are you kidding me?

118
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,738
Look, don't get me wrong.

119
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,775
As a fellow artist, I
respect your point of view,

120
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,877
but true art is fleeting.

121
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,880
A flash of beauty burning
brightly, and then vanishing

122
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,148
in a heartbeat.

123
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,950
Heh.

124
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,085
-What did you say?

125
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,094
-I-- I don't get it.

126
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,929
What's with them?

127
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,565
SASORI: Apparently,
Deidara, one of us

128
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,835
doesn't understand
what true art is.

129
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,737
DEIDARA: That would
be you, my friend.

130
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,404
Hmph.

131
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,039
-You lousy, rotten--

132
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,607
SASORI: Nonsense.

133
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,944
Eternal beauty is what
constitutes real art.

134
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:58,978
DEIDARA: Don't be absurd.

135
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,947
True art only lasts a moment.

136
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,382
-Enough is enough!

137
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,497
-Are you trying
to make me angry?

138
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,631
-Hey, easy.

139
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,067
I told you he wouldn't
wanna hear it, didn't I?

140
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,403
Give me a break, will ya?

141
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:29,409
-I don't have to remind you what
happens when I get angry, do I?

142
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,177
SAKURA (VOICEOVER: He
blocked that shuriken

143
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,612
without even looking.

144
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,415
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): As I feared,
his handling of the puppet

145
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,250
remains unchanged.

146
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,721
-Why don't you explain
it to me again, Deidara?

147
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,928
-Art is one thing,
and one thing only.

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,108
The explosion itself.

149
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,294
It's not even in
the same league,

150
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,162
compared to your
grotesque puppet show.

151
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,975
See you around, my man.

152
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,128
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): Come
on, Nine Tails Jinchuriki.

153
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,729
Let's see if you can keep up.

154
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,475
-Deidara, you fool.

155
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,710
I don't believe this.

156
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,151
-Just where the hell do
you think you're going?

157
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,087
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): Perfect.

158
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,623
-Naruto!

159
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,058
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): As always,
he just can't help himself.

160
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,031
Naruto and I will
handle the one outside.

161
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,334
Sakura, Lady Chiyo,
take the one inside.

162
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:40,873
But please, don't do anything
rash until Team Guy gets back.

163
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:41,407
-Right.

164
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,475
You got it.

165
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,666
-Great.

166
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,303
He's tagging along, huh?

167
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,238
-Guy, do you read me?

168
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,806
The enemy has split up.

169
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,942
We're gonna need a hand.

170
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,578
Return immediately.

171
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,179
GUY (ON RADIO): I
don't think we can.

172
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,552
We've been caught
in an enemy trap.

173
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,301
We need a little
more time, Kakashi.

174
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,569
Huh?

175
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,170
Signing off!

176
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,479
GUY (VOICEOVER):
Those movements.

177
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,723
-He's good.

178
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,005
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Same
appearance, same power,

179
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,973
and even the same jutsu.

180
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,259
-This is almost as
if we were fighting

181
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,994
a mirror image of
ourselves here.

182
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,805
-If it were a mirror, we
could just shatter it.

183
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:57,710
Leaf Hurricane!

184
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,326
But I do not believe
this will be so easy.

185
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,044
-Give him back.

186
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,112
Give Gaara back!

187
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:39,919
-All right.

188
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,890
No time to waste here.

189
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,868
-The way I'd heard it, you
retired a long time ago.

190
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,105
-I suddenly longed to see
my grandson's face again.

191
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,320
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I can
tell just by looking at him

192
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,623
the incredible difference
in our battle experience,

193
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,494
and the number of
lives he's taken.

194
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,928
[swallow]

195
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,330
-Sakura.

196
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,064
Do not fear.

197
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,670
I am here with you.

198
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,205
You just step back now, dear.

199
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,254
Assault Blade.

200
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:06,343
-If you insist on interfering,
I guess I have no choice.

201
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,416
How would you and
that little brat

202
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,268
there like to be part of my
collection, eh grandmother?

203
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:32,293
[theme music]

204
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,103
MAN: It's the World
Puppet Master finals,

205
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:04,138
and only one event remains.

206
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,974
Will the illustrious title
of Puppet Master Champion

207
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,210
go to Sasori of the
Red Sand, who came out

208
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:12,246
on top during the first round's
talks and quiz challenge?

209
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,583
Or to the woman displayed
her years of experience

210
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:17,051
in the second round
puppet building

211
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,487
race, Elder Chito of the Sand?

212
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,125
Who will win the final showdown
in today's puppet battle?

213
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:27,495
NARUTO: Next time, Hiruko
Versus Two Kunoichi!

214
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,931

215

NEJI: Guide to the Clans of
the Leaf Village, Volume Two.

216
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:45,780
Today, we'll be covering
the Uchiha clan.

217
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:46,480
LEE: Oh!

218
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:47,848
This should be riveting!

219
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:51,018
NEJI: The Uchiha clan possesses
outstanding abilities, foremost

220
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:54,789
being the Sharingan, and their
Fire Style Jutsu are unrivaled.

221
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,924
Their symbol is a
fan, representing

222
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,893
their expert control
of the flame.

223
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:01,362
It was they who established
the police force,

224
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,864
ensuring the safety
of the leaf village.

225
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:05,733
LEE: Shinobi policing Shinobi.

226
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,501
They were truly the elite.

227
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,271
NEJI: It's said that
secrets of the Uchiha clan

228
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:13,674
are hidden within
the Nakano Shrine.

229
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,610
Perhaps that is why
Itachi and Sasuke

230
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:18,713
were both drawn to
leave the village.

231
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:21,816
-It seems there are still
many mysteries to the Uchiha.

232
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:25,586
-At any rate, in order to fight
the Akatsuki and Orochimaru,

233
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,923
we must all become much
stronger than we are at present.

234
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:29,890
In order to--

235
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,525
-In order to do
that we must train!

236
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,660
-What are you doing, Lee?

237
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:33,694
Put me down this instant.

238
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:34,428
-And away we go!

239
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:36,330
Dash of Towering Youth!

240
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:38,232
-Give it a rest, already!
