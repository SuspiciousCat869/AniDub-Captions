1
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:55,620
{\an1}If you want to know who
and what you are...

2
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:59,691
{\an1}You must reexamine and
acknowledge your true self.

3
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,328
{\an1}Those who cannot or
will not acknowledge

4
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,397
themselves are
sure to fail.

5
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:07,901
{\an1}The same way that
I have failed.

6
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,642
{\an1}From the start, I was
nobody and had nothing.

7
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:18,746
{\an1}I had nothing at all.

8
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,495
{\an1}Kabuto, are you okay?

9
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,097
Yes, Mother!

10
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,168
{\an1}I know it's for the
orphanage, but I don't

11
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,605
{\an1}see why we have to help
shinobi like these!

12
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,608
{\an1}Doing nothing brings
in no money--

13
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,809
It doesn't grow
on trees, ya know.

14
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,979
{\an1}Urushi, could you
get more bandages?

15
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,214
Yeah, all right!

16
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,422
{\an1}You're not a shinobi. but
you are quite skilled with

17
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,458
{\an1}your Medical Ninjutsu.

18
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,694
Mother taught me
everything that I know.

19
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,433
Kabuto... That's
your name, right?

20
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,835
You ought to
become a shinobi.

21
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,940
{\an1}I believe you would
make a very good one...

22
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,475
I'm sure of it.

23
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,810
No, but thanks
for saying so.

24
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:17,013
{\an1}I only want to earn some
money for the orphanage

25
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,617
{\an1}to stay open so that
I can stay and help

26
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,851
{\an1}Mother with the work
that she does there.

27
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,922
{\an1}She's just done so much for
me, and all I've done to

28
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,492
{\an1}repay her is buy her
some new glasses.

29
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,632
{\an1}Really... Well, that
is quite a shame.

30
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:39,105
{\an1}So, the Wandering Nun has
become little more than a

31
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,208
{\an1}glorified babysitter.

32
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,714
{\an1}It's been a while since I
last saw you, but you're

33
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:48,350
{\an1}looking tired, Nonou.

34
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,953
That's a name I
cast off long ago.

35
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,190
{\an1}I know that talks with the
Hidden Leaf for

36
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:56,993
{\an1}aid money have already
been concluded.

37
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:58,794
{\an1}So why are you here?

38
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:02,132
{\an1}It seems the Espionage
Unit's former top spy,

39
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,401
stopped knowing
things as soon as she

40
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,069
{\an1}departed the Foundation.

41
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,907
{\an1}We didn't come here only in
regard to the aid money.

42
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:13,612
{\an1}We are in a time of war, and
we've obtained intel that

43
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,314
{\an1}the Hidden Stone are
plotting a large

44
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,082
scale operation.

45
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,020
{\an1}We want you to infiltrate
the Stone and verify for us

46
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,890
{\an1}whether or not the
intel we have is correct.

47
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:26,459
{\an1}And if it does turn out
to be true, you are to

48
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:28,596
{\an1}investigate and uncover
what this operation

49
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,966
{\an1}entails and when and
where it will occur.

50
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,268
{\an1}And then report back to us.

51
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:37,639
{\an1}It will likely be a
long-term mission.

52
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,543
You've come to
the wrong person.

53
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,245
I'm no longer in
the business--

54
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,781
{\an1}You people just don't
understand how valuable

55
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,183
{\an1}Mother's presence is to
this orphanage and to

56
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,885
the children
who live here!

57
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,887
She has worked
desperately long and hard

58
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,656
to protect this
organization!

59
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,058
{\an1}Such a dangerous task!

60
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,661
{\an1}You Foundation people
ought to do it yourselves!

61
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,064
{\an1}Why must you come in
here and ask Mother?!

62
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,866
{\an1}Because the Wandering
Nun is the only person

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,171
{\an1}that we can entrust
this long-term mission to.

64
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,207
{\an1}Currently, there's no one in
the Foundation who possesses

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,078
{\an1}the espionage skills
that she does.

66
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,014
{\an1}Most either break or end
up switching allegiances.

67
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,453
{\an1}But I know that she's a
Kunoichi who would never

68
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,723
{\an1}sell out the Hidden Leaf...

69
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,226
{\an1}From your expression, I
can tell you've already

70
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,893
{\an1}guessed it, Nonou.

71
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,698
{\an1}Yes, if you refuse,
this orphanage will no

72
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,633
{\an1}longer receive funding.

73
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,804
{\an1}You can't! We've already
received assurances

74
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,673
{\an1}from the Third Hokage!

75
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:38,275
{\an1}There's no way you'd
be allowed to do that!

76
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,211
{\an1}This orphanage looks
quite easy to break

77
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:41,979
{\an1}into and plunder...

78
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,516
{\an1}You should hire some
guards to prevent all your

79
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,551
{\an1}money from getting stolen.

80
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:49,522
{\an1}That is, if you're
able to afford to do it.

81
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:52,558
{\an1}And also, you should take
care that your children

82
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:54,694
{\an1}don't get snatched, either.

83
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,330
{\an1}Children who don't
have any past or family

84
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:59,199
are worth quite
a lot, you know.

85
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,035
{\an1}You're vile! How dare you
call yourselves shinobi?!

86
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,205
{\an1}You're the ones who
don't understand at all!

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,307
[gasps]

88
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:11,380
{\an1}It's a small price to pay
to protect the Hidden Leaf!

89
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,784
I understand.

90
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:15,684
Wait, Mother!

91
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:18,187
{\an1}You realize that it's
come to this because

92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,055
{\an1}you couldn't kill
your emotions.

93
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,626
{\an1}You weren't suited for
the Foundation after all.

94
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,162
{\an1}How dare you speak that way!

95
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,934
{\an1}Also, I've already lost a
subordinate in the process

96
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,936
{\an1}of obtaining this intel...

97
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,539
{\an1}I'll be taking one
of the children here

98
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:34,940
to replace them.

99
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:38,678
{\an1}That's too far! I told you
that I'd accept the mission!

100
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,247
{\an1}This is a separate
matter from that.

101
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,884
{\an1}Your mission covers
subsequent payments.

102
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,721
{\an1}But this current one is to
be in exchange for the child.

103
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,826
{\an1}It's fine. Some children
actually wish to become Leaf

104
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,828
{\an1}Shinobi, after all.
You ought to ask

105
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,930
them to choose
for themselves.

106
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:56,933
I can at least
give you that.

107
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,369
{\an1}There may just be
such a child even here.

108
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,991
But why, Kabuto?

109
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,997
{\an1}I'm suited to be a ninja.

110
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,701
{\an1}And I want to hone
my Medical Ninjutsu.

111
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:30,972
{\an1}Kabuto! You're throwing
away three years with us?!

112
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:32,607
Come back here!

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,711
{\an1}Have all of you guys really
forgotten the house rules?

114
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,284
{\an1}It's way past lights-out.

115
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,963
{\an1}<i>It's no use. I'm surrounded.</i>

116
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,904
{\an1}<i>If I hadn't messed up, I'd</i>
<i>be in bed asleep by now....</i>

117
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:34,044
{\an1}<i>Five years since I</i>
<i>left the orphanage...</i>

118
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,312
{\an1}<i>I wish I could've seen</i>
<i>Mother and everyone</i>

119
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,981
<i>one more time...</i>

120
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:42,085
[gasp]

121
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,790
[grunting]

122
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,078
Mother!

123
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,481
No! Why-?! What
are you doing here?

124
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,819
[grunting]

125
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,756
We want you to
infiltrate the Stone

126
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,458
{\an1}and verify the intel.

127
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,995
{\an1}Because the Wandering
Nun is the only person

128
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:22,065
{\an1}that we can entrust this
long-term mission to.

129
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,835
{\an1}<i>Don't tell me, she's</i>
<i>been on the same</i>

130
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,803
{\an1}<i>mission all this time?!</i>

131
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,575
{\an1}Why are you healing me?

132
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:34,245
{\an1}Just who are you?

133
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,481
{\an1}What? It's me, Mother!

134
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,857
{\an1}It's Kabuto! Now don't you
worry, I'm gonna save you.

135
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,437
Who are you?

136
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,091
This way!

137
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:19,731
{\an1}Damn it! Nanigashi's
been killed!

138
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:31,644
{\an1}<i>Mother didn't know me...</i>

139
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,315
<i>Why?! Why didn't</i>
<i>she remember me?</i>

140
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,350
<i>How come?</i>

141
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:41,522
{\an1}<i>If she doesn't know</i>
<i>me, then who am I?</i>

142
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,592
{\an1}<i>What were all those things</i>
<i>I received from Mother?</i>

143
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:49,765
{\an1}<i>My name, being one of</i>
<i>Mother's children, even</i>

144
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,935
<i>these glasses...</i>

145
00:10:58,641 --> 00:10:59,609
Then who...

146
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:01,479
...are you?

147
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:08,687
This isn't me...

148
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,023
{\an1}Not the real me...

149
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,730
{\an1}It appears that you can no
longer see yourself clearly.

150
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,598
[gasp]

151
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:27,942
You've become
quite a fine shinobi.

152
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:32,514
{\an1}And I remember you
very well, Kabuto.

153
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:36,652
{\an1}Hey, aren't you?!

154
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:39,388
{\an1}I've been watching you
closely this whole time.

155
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,893
And Nonou, too.
Oh, I mean, Mother...

156
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,098
{\an1}Come with me, Kabuto.
And I will tell

157
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,500
{\an1}you everything that
you want to know.

158
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,603
{\an1}What I want to know?
What's that mean?

159
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,307
{\an1}Why Mother went after
you, for one...

160
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,180
{\an1}And why she didn't remember
you in the slightest.

161
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:04,984
{\an1}Don't you want to
know all that?

162
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:18,433
{\an1}This is my hideout.
No one knows about it.

163
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:22,205
In fact, you are
my first visitor.

164
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,177
Why did you
bring me here?!

165
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:29,213
What do you want
with me, anyway?

166
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,716
{\an1}It seems the number
of questions you

167
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,418
{\an1}have keeps increasing...

168
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,553
{\an1}But that's a good thing.

169
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,790
People can never
escape their desire

170
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,491
{\an1}for more knowledge.

171
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,362
{\an1}After all, that is why you
followed me here, isn't it?

172
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,999
{\an1}Then hurry up and
tell me, already!

173
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,769
{\an1}You know what I want to
know, isn't that true?

174
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,007
{\an1}Well, to be completely
blunt, the Foundation had

175
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,043
{\an1}decided they would
dispose of both you

176
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:57,278
and Mother.

177
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,212
Huh?

178
00:12:58,246 --> 00:12:59,714
{\an1}And what does that mean?

179
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:04,052
{\an1}You both were too brilliant
as spies to be kept alive.

180
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,454
Huh?

181
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:10,059
{\an1}You ended up knowing
too much. So...

182
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,996
{\an1}But they made us risk our
lives to gather intel for

183
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,898
{\an1}the Hidden Leaf Village,
and this is...

184
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,633
...what we get?!

185
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,336
{\an1}Sometimes information can
possess more might than

186
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,240
{\an1}intricate jutsu or
powerful weapons...

187
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:24,508
{\an1}At this point, you're
considered very

188
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,177
{\an1}dangerous entities.

189
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:29,714
{\an1}But your fate was
decided from the start.

190
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,918
{\an1}That you two would
end up this way.

191
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,487
{\an1}And the script called
for you both to

192
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,756
{\an1}kill each other in
a mutual strike.

193
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:41,929
{\an1}Right after you left the
orphanage, Danzo revealed to

194
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:45,233
{\an1}Mother the real reason
why you had left.

195
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,903
{\an1}That you sacrificed yourself
and joined the Foundation

196
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:51,206
{\an1}for the orphanage's money.

197
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,577
{\an1}Mother wished to liberate
you from the Foundation.

198
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:59,883
{\an1}As a condition of accepting
her wish, several years ago,

199
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,018
{\an1}Danzo ordered her
to assassinate a

200
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,486
certain person.

201
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,657
Ironically...

202
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,860
{\an1}The target of the
assassination...

203
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:12,596
...was you.

204
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,669
{\an1}But I thought that it was
the condition for my release!

205
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:20,273
{\an1}I don't get it! And why
didn't she recognize me?!

206
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:23,843
{\an1}As I told you, The
Foundation had always

207
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,880
{\an1}intended for the two of
you to take each other out.

208
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,950
{\an1}And there was other
trickery afoot, too.

209
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,653
What trickery?

210
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,693
{\an1}You and Mother were
sent into separate enemy

211
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,530
{\an1}territories so that you
two would never meet.

212
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,402
{\an1}And Mother was kept
informed of your well-being

213
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,337
{\an1}and progress via photos.

214
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,308
{\an1}And then, over time,
Mother was made to think

215
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:52,410
{\an1}someone else was you.

216
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,079
{\an1}The photos of you were
skillfully replaced with

217
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:58,317
{\an1}those of someone else
without her even noticing.

218
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,720
{\an1}It's called gradual
brainwashing.

219
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:04,790
{\an1}A common practice
of the Foundation.

220
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:07,994
{\an1}That right there is
the other Kabuto.

221
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:11,664
{\an1}That's why Nonou tried to
kill you. She never would

222
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,336
{\an1}have thought you were Kabuto
in her wildest dreams.

223
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,472
{\an1}She thought you were a
double agent who had

224
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:19,441
{\an1}betrayed the village.

225
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,076
[growl]

226
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,112
{\an1}And so the Foundation
dispatched you to take care

227
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,848
of whoever might
have survived...

228
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,018
{\an1}Is that what happened?

229
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,356
{\an1}For someone who knows
nothing about himself

230
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,957
{\an1}you're quite perceptive.

231
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,727
[growling]

232
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,371
{\an1}I always wanted an
explanation of who I was!

233
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,606
{\an1}And I thought that
I'd finally found it!

234
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,310
{\an1}But I've lost myself
again thanks to all of you

235
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,180
{\an1}Foundation bastards!

236
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,882
{\an1}These glasses were what
linked Mother and me!

237
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,252
{\an1}The name she bestowed on me
was mine and mine alone!

238
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,655
{\an1}Mother was supposed to
be the parent that didn't

239
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,225
{\an1}forget me, no matter what!

240
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:07,529
{\an1}But everything's wrong!
Then who in the world...

241
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,332
Am I?!

242
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,309
[scream]

243
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,550
You merely lack
sufficient intel with

244
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,252
which to define
yourself.

245
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,822
{\an1}Neither the glasses, your
name, nor the fact that

246
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,258
{\an1}you're a child were
things that denote who

247
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,759
you really are.

248
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,396
{\an1}And that's just fine.

249
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,666
{\an1}If you're dissatisfied with
what you've had in the past,

250
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,337
{\an1}you can just find other
things and then add them to

251
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,006
{\an1}yourself from here on out.

252
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,842
{\an1}If you're planning
on killing me, then

253
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,979
{\an1}why are you telling
me all this?

254
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:54,048
{\an1}I also want to know
who or what I am.

255
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,387
{\an1}So I've been collecting
all sorts of things.

256
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,024
[gasp]

257
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:05,262
{\an1}I repeatedly conduct
experiments on and

258
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:08,265
{\an1}inspect these things
I've collected.

259
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,734
{\an1}And store the gained
knowledge and abilities

260
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,103
within myself.

261
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:17,109
{\an1}And then, I undergo
rebirth, ever evolving

262
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:19,311
toward a more
perfect self.

263
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,815
{\an1}Afterward, I again obtain
even newer items, and so on.

264
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,418
This time...

265
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:28,121
...it's you.

266
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,928
{\an1}By gathering all of
the intel and things

267
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,197
that exist in
this world...

268
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:39,167
{\an1}There's no possible
way you couldn't derive

269
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:41,803
who you are and
what you are...

270
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:46,108
{\an1}But why?! Tell me, why am I
one of those things to you?

271
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,910
[chuckle]

272
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,515
{\an1}Because I recognize
and value your talent

273
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,150
{\an1}more than anyone else.

274
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,553
It would be a
waste to kill you.

275
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,656
{\an1}And I prepared this
medical experimentation

276
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,558
{\an1}facility just for you.

277
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,228
{\an1}Just what are you plotting?

278
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:05,830
To create an
organization, a

279
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,267
village that
celebrates the self...

280
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:09,902
Not erases it---

281
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:12,405
{\an1}Like the Foundation,
I'll form the Hidden

282
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,474
{\an1}Sound, which belongs
to no nation!

283
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,379
{\an1}From this moment, we will
desert the Foundation.

284
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:21,549
{\an1}And starting now, I shall
be your superior, your

285
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:24,051
{\an1}sibling, and even
your parent.

286
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,589
{\an1}And I will protect you
from Danzo, as well.

287
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,059
{\an1}Moving forward, this
will become your new

288
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,428
{\an1}personal history...

289
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:35,465
{\an1}You were found very
young and adopted by a

290
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:38,067
{\an1}Medical Corps Captain
who raised you

291
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,237
{\an1}following the Battle
at Kikyo Pass.

292
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:44,108
{\an1}After returning to work
under Danzo, That Captain,

293
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,311
Nonou Yakushi,
kept her cover

294
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,847
as a Captain of
the Medical Unit.

295
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:55,588
{\an1}As of today, you shall be
reborn as Kabuto Yakushi.

296
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,230
I am Orochimaru.

297
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,301
{\an1}If you want to know who
and what you are...

298
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:10,905
{\an1}Come and be by my side.

299
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,895
Kabuto, there's
another organization

300
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,764
I want to look
into next.

301
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,368
{\an1}Leave it to me. So,
what is this group?

302
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,870
The Akatsuki.

303
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:49,917
{\an1}Bring me Orochimaru's
human experimentation

304
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,456
{\an1}data and any intel on
the Reanimation Jutsu.

305
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:58,293
Yes, of course.
Understood, Lord Sasori.

306
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:04,266
{\an1}You are useful. You can
erase your sound, your

307
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,869
{\an1}scent, even yourself.

308
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:10,340
{\an1}You're almost like
one of my puppets.

309
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:59,730
{\an1}If you're not satisfied
with what you've had...

310
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:02,933
{\an1}Just find other things
and add them onto

311
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,769
{\an1}yourself from here on out.

312
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,741
[yell]

313
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:13,546
It's still...

314
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,549
{\an1}...not enough yet!

315
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:20,888
{\an1}This still isn't who I am!

316
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:00,100
{\an1}Are you sure it would
be bad to kill him?

317
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:02,270
{\an1}As it is, we're stuck
playing catch-up!

318
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:04,006
I told already
told you no!

319
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,376
{\an1}He controls the battlefield
right now. Be patient.

320
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,045
The Izanami's
still not ready?!

321
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,479
{\an1}He's about to attack!

322
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,515
{\an1}Don't worry, I'm on it.
It's just going to

323
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,051
{\an1}take a little more time.

324
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:19,489
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Izanami
Activated."

325
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,895
{\an1}Since I shut off my vision,
genjutsu won't work on me!
