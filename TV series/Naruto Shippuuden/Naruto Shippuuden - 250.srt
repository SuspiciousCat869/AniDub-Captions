1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,549
{\an1}Thank you so much for
letting me become a mother.

2
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:14,453
{\an1}And thank you for letting
Minato become a father.

3
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,557
Thank you for
being born to us!

4
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:21,225
<i>Thank you...</i>

5
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,528
<i>...so much.</i>

6
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:28,566
<i>Thank you.</i>

7
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:35,373
{\an8}<i>Mom...</i>

8
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,109
{\an7}<i>From now on...</i>

9
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:42,446
{\an7}<i>I promise that I'll eat my</i>
<i>veggies, and not just ramen.</i>

10
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:49,286
{\an7}<i>Don't worry about me bathing.</i>
<i>I like it! I go to the hot</i>
<i>springs a lot, too.</i>

11
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:55,125
{\an7}<i>And I'm getting plenty of sleep.</i>
<i>Tons, in fact! I probably sleep</i>
<i>too much, ya know!</i>

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,730
{\an7}<i>As for friends, I have lots of</i>
<i>them! Really good ones, too!</i>

13
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:03,098
{\an7}<i>I sure wish that you</i>
<i>could've met them, Mom.</i>

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,537
{\an7}<i>Although, there's one</i>
<i>that I'm not getting</i>
<i>along with right now.</i>

15
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:13,309
{\an7}<i>As for my studies...</i>
<i>well, you feared right, Mom.</i>

16
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:15,843
{\an7}<i>But I don't get</i>
<i>depressed over that,</i>
<i>ya know!</i>

17
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,949
{\an1}<i>A lot happened with my</i>
<i>teachers and upperclassmen</i>
<i>when I was in the Academy.</i>

18
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,985
{\an8}<i>But we respect</i>
<i>each other now.</i>

19
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:29,290
{\an7}<i>Master Jiraiya taught</i>
<i>me all about the Three</i>
<i>Shinobi Prohibitions.</i>

20
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:32,860
{\an7}<i>He was just like you</i>
<i>described him, Mom!</i>
<i>You sure were right about him!</i>

21
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:39,233
{\an7}<i>But, he also taught me how</i>
<i>a shinobi should live!</i>
<i>He was a truly great shinobi.</i>

22
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,473
{\an7}<i>I am Naruto Uzumaki,</i>
<i>ninja of the Hidden Leaf!</i>

23
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,909
{\an8}<i>My dream is to</i>
<i>become Hokage!!</i>

24
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,612
{\an7}<i>And to surpass all of the</i>
<i>Hokage who came before me!</i>

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,587
{\an1}And what's more, to become
an even cooler guy than dad!

26
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,624
{\an1}And also, To be a
stronger shinobi
than you, Mom!

27
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:51,258
{\an1}"Battle in Paradise!
The Odd Beast vs. The Monster!"

28
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:02,870
[gulp]

29
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:12,579
Yeah!

30
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,080
Heh!

31
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:15,949
{\an1}What happened?

32
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,218
{\an1}Did you do it?
How did it go?

33
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,653
A lot of this.
A lot of that.

34
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:23,823
{\an3}Yo!

35
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:24,524
Huh?

36
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,763
{\an1}I can see it! I get it!
And I totally understand!

37
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,398
{\an1}Your face is calm,
completely bland!

38
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,868
{\an1}So what about the
Nine Tailed fox?

39
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,469
{\an1}Were you able to
control it?

40
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,838
All right!
Good for you!

41
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:42,206
'specially when you used
it in that situation!

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,174
Heh ha ha!

43
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:50,716
{\an1}Whoa! No way! Don't tell me
that you mean you know what!

44
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:51,884
{\an3}Yup!

45
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,652
I sure do!
That's right, ya know!

46
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,822
{\an1}Listen, would somebody
just explain to me what
happened, already!

47
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:00,156
{\an1}Words like "this" and
"that" don't mean anything!

48
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:06,129
{\an1}I can tell! You guys're
doing this to me on purpose!
Don't you two try to deny it!

49
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,733
<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>What?!</i>

50
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,302
{\an1}<i>I had no idea Naruto</i>
<i>was undergoing such</i>
<i>strenuous training!</i>

51
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,473
{\an1}Well, I can't ignore a man
who's struggling in the
springtime of his youth!

52
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,742
{\an1}Take me to Naruto
right away!

53
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,611
{\an1}This man can be a
bit over the top.

54
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,747
{\an1}So, uh, sorry about that.

55
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:24,915
No problem.

56
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,251
It's okay. Relax,
Captain Yamato.

57
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:33,822
{\an1}I've stored Nine Tails' chakra
inside of me in a place
different from my own chakra.

58
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,226
{\an1}That way I'm not using
it all the time.

59
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,852
{\an4}This is how it is when
I tap into the Nine
Tails' chakra that I've
stored away in there.

60
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:11,224
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Wow! It's so full</i>
<i>of life energy!</i>

61
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,894
{\an1}Whoa.

62
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,663
It's even affecting
my Wood Style.
I can't believe it!

63
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,031
Huh?

64
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,199
{\an3}Hmm?

65
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,200
{\an1}What is it?

66
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,702
{\an1}You really think...

67
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,770
...that you can
hide from me now?

68
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,239
{\an1}You mean that... you're sensing
some other chakra here?!

69
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,843
{\an1}Yeah, he senses
another presence,

70
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,645
{\an1}that I didn't
was careless of me,
I must do penance.

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,281
{\an8}<i>[Kisame]</i>
<i>Impossible!</i>

72
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,717
{\an7}<i>My chakra's the</i>
<i>same as Samehada's!</i>

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,819
{\an7}<i>No one should be</i>
<i>able to sense it!</i>

74
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,187
{\an1}No, it's not chakra!

75
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:45,290
{\an1}It feels hazy, but
it's something else,
something sinister,

76
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,059
{\an1}and it's coming right
from your blade!

77
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:48,961
His blade?!

78
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,695
Hrh? Huh??

79
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:58,703
{\an1}<i>[Kisame]</i>
<i>It appears you can sense hate,</i>
<i>and other negative emotions.</i>

80
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,608
{\an1}That ability doesn't fit
any known Sensory Type.

81
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:08,747
{\an1}It must be a power of a
Jinchuriki who's achieved
control over the Nine Tails.

82
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:11,615
{\an1}Hold on! You're the
Akatsuki shark guy!

83
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:15,452
{\an1}But how? I thought
we chopped his head
off a while back.

84
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:16,920
Let's do it.

85
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,090
{\an1}Okay, my Brother.

86
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:23,360
{\an1}Water Style! Super Shark Bomb!

87
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,631
[Raikage & Bee]
Double Lariat!

88
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,706
{\an1}So how in the world did
you evade me and my
brother's tag-team attack?

89
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,779
{\an1}It was quite simple! I merely
switched places while we battled
inside the bubble of water.

90
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,249
{\an7}<i>It's ink.</i>
<i>A smokescreen, huh?</i>

91
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,318
{\an7}<i>He really is an octopus lout.</i>

92
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,354
{\an8}<i>However...</i>

93
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:59,695
{\an7}<i>With my body merged to</i>
<i>Samehada like this, I can</i>
<i>detect chakra through my skin.</i>

94
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,365
{\an1}You only cut off the
head of my clone.

95
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,575
<i>[White Zetsu]</i>
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>you're overdoing it?</i>

96
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:20,448
{\an1}No, I used just the
right amount of force
for the Eight-Tails.

97
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,249
All right.
Well, I guess
it's my turn now.

98
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,025
{\an1}Yes. The rest is
in your hands.

99
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,663
{\an1}But clones simply
disappear when you
hit 'em hard enough!

100
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:40,133
{\an1}And the corpse still remained
post-mortem, no question.

101
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:45,404
{\an1}If someone else had transformed
into you, then my buddy Cee
would have sensed it for sure.

102
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,073
{\an1}A perplexing
consternation.

103
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,943
It was a very special
kind of clone.

104
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:54,047
A Parasitic Clone that
can be operated remotely
by the caster.

105
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:57,217
{\an1}Well, we'll leave
it at that for now.

106
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,418
{\an1}But this situation.

107
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:03,188
{\an1}<i>To be facing two Jinchuriki</i>
<i>and a Wood Style user.</i>

108
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:06,024
{\an1}<i>That's tough, even for me.</i>

109
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,796
{\an1}No way! How'd you ever
figure out the way to open
the door to this room?

110
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:20,304
{\an1}Now that's a silly question!
After all, I did come here
to act as a spy, you know.

111
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:24,742
[gasp]

112
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,344
Uwaagh!

113
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:28,780
[gasp]

114
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:30,882
{\an1}Teleportation Jutsu?

115
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:35,253
{\an1}First up at bat, the
first smash, just like
the Yellow Flash!

116
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:38,555
Grrh!

117
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,491
{\an7}<i>So fast.</i>
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

118
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,359
[wet cough]

119
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:45,929
Uh?
Huh?!

120
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,031
{\an1}Agh! My leg!

121
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,067
{\an1}I hit the wall too hard!
Now I'm stuck here!

122
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,204
{\an1}Looks like, he doesn't have
Lord Fourth's skills yet.

123
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,007
{\an1}Please, go after the
spy, Master Bee!
I'll help Naruto.

124
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:58,707
Right!

125
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,077
{\an1}Just leave the chase to me,
and I'll catch him in a jiffy.

126
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,052
Auggh! Damn it!

127
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:20,562
{\an4}<i>[Guy]</i>
<i>What? Your true self appears</i>
<i>inside that waterfall when</i>
<i>you meditate here?</i>

128
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,531
Is that
for real?

129
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:24,766
Yes.

130
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,535
{\an1}And Naruto also
faced and defeated
his true self here.

131
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,437
Well, Guy? Why
don't you try it
out for yourself?

132
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:31,638
{\an1}Don't be foolish!

133
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:34,075
{\an1}We have to go help
Naruto first!

134
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,409
{\an1}That's much
more important!

135
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:38,112
{\an1}I came here as his
mentor, to try to
protect him!

136
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,981
All right, You don't
have to get so upset,
you know.

137
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:45,285
{\an1}or are you just too afraid to
step up to that waterfall and
face your true self, Guy.?

138
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, are you?

139
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,989
{\an1}Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
What?!

140
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,657
{\an1}Do you really believe
that I'm scared?!

141
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,162
No problem!

Oh, no, I was
only joking!

Although I have a
feeling that your true
self isn't even human!

144
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:05,838
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Lighten up!

<i>by wishing it so, old man.</i>

150
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:34,398
{\an1}Come out! Show yourself!
Don't just hide and say

151
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,634

that wasn't my true self?

{\an1}It is!
It's a puffer fish!

174
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,597
{\an1}No, wait, maybe it was
called a porcupine fish?

175
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:48,569
{\an4}Well, there sure are a
bunch of strange
creatures living here, so
I guess that it could be.

176

Is that really a puffer
fish? They're supposed
to be super tasty.

{\an1}Are all of you
deliberately pretending

He's that shark man!

He was the one teamed
up with Itachi in the
Akatsuki!

{\an1}I won't let it get away!

290
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,974
{\an8}<i>It starts out strong</i>
<i>and gets even stronger</i>
<i>by absorbing chakra.</i>

291
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,945
{\an7}<i>So the stronger my opponent is,</i>
<i>the stronger it gets.</i>

292
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:41,352
Wait, what's going
on?! I know the jutsu's
absorbed his chakra.

293
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,621
But it's not
getting stronger!

294
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:47,056
I'm certain that I
absorbed his chakra.

295
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:50,093
{\an1}Was that not a
chakra Energy Bomb?!

296

{\an1}Now my youth, roar!

297
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:02,806
Yeaaggghhhh!

{\an1}<i>one must overcome</i>

300

{\an1}<i>It really is</i>

301
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,860
{\an1}<i>Killing your comrades is</i>

302
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:16,365
