Sasuke was under a
Tsukuyomi, so why isn't he

51
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,988
down for the count?

-No.

53
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,788
He didn't get hit
with the Tsukuyomi.

54
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:55,154
He actually broke through it.

00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,554
Someone who only has
an ordinary Sharingan

57
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:02,288
isn't supposed to be able to win
against the Mangekyo Sharingan.

58
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,688
-Ah, but the ordinary
Sharingan is still a weapon,

59
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,954
and a weapon can either
be strong or weak,

60
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:11,288
depending on the ability of
the person who is wielding it.

61

Someone's shuriken might be
taken down by a mere pebble,

if it's thrown by a master.

63
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,721
The difference is in the power,
the variance in strength.

64
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,288
It means that
Sasuke's skills far

65

the genjutsu battle became
completely pointless.

[footsteps]

00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,540
-It seems Itachi is
the winner after all.

174
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:37,707
-He's put out the Amaterasu.

175
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,873
He's planning to
take Sasuke's eyes.

177

-Hmm?

178
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,173
-He escaped underground?

00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,640
[dripping]

180
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,892
-These wounds are nothing.

181
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,192
They won't slow me down at all.

182
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,892
Until he releases
the Amaterasu, I

183
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,658
can't use the
substitution jutsu.

been waiting for!

-Fire Style!

193
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:08,658
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

-Oh no.

-Nngh.

205
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:19,625
[labored breathing]
That Amaterasu of yours.

206
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,792
It seems to have taken
quite a lot out of you.

207
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:23,292
-Nngh.

208
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:25,258
[thud]

209
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,992
-They're both totally exhausted.

210
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,225
They're probably out of chakra.

211
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:36,025
-So it appears.

212
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:48,325
-(TO HIMSELF) This will
probably be my last jutsu.

213
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,225
[thunder rolling]

214
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:01,358
-The Sharingan can
assess your chakra level.

215
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:07,125
So stop bluffing.

216
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:09,492
I can tell just by looking
that you're out of chakra.

217
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,692
You used the
Orochimaru-style substitution

218
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,792
jutsu to evade my Amaterasu.

219
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,592
It's a good trick to
deceive your opponent,

220
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,892
but it uses up an
enormous amount of chakra.

221
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:23,858
-That's right!

222
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,958
Because Sasuke
absorbed Orochimaru.

223
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:28,825
-Ah, so that's it.

224
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,292
[thunder cracking]

225
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,492
-Yeah, you're right.

226
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,958
I don't have any
more chakra left now.

227
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:42,725
I used up every bit of it in the
last Fire Style Jutsu attack.

228
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:44,258
[raindrops]

229
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:51,425
-However, do you really
believe that I would come here

230
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,558
to kill you and be unprepared?

231
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,392
[thunder clapping]

232
00:19:57,425 --> 00:20:00,892
-It lasts only an instant, and
this jutsu cannot be blocked,

233
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,392
dodged, or evaded.

234
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,992
Just like the Amaterasu.

235
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:07,158
Now, Itachi.

236
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,058
You asked for it, so
here it is at last!

237
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:09,925
[lightning]

238
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,392
-I'll make your death a reality.

00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,558

241
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:02,839
WHITE ZESTU: Wow!

242
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:05,539
Am I glad we chose to
come see this battle!

243
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,573
I never imagined that
we'd get to witness

244
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:09,439
such an incredible fight.

245
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,606
BLACK ZETSU: Sasuke's
jutsu have been impressive,

246
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,506
but to think Itachi was hiding
a jutsu like that up his sleeve.

247
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,139
Looks like it will also come
with a heavy risk, though.

248
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:21,773
I wonder who will
win this battle.

249
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,606
MALE SPEAKER: Next
time, "The End."

250
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:27,239
WHITE ZETSU: Either
way, the next attack

251
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:30,239
will be the last
for one of them.
