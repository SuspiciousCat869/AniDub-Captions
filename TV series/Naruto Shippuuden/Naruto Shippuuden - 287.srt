1
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,157
{\an4}As I explained to you on
the way here, the mission
that our team has just
completed was to obtain

2
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,493
{\an1}a Hidden Jutsu from
the Cedar Village.

3
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:13,061
{\an8}Stealing Hidden Jutsu.
Up to your old tricks,
huh?

4
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,231
Well, go on.

5
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:21,033
{\an4}Sorry, but after getting
the Hidden Jutsu. I left
to go and tend to another
matter.

6
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,536
{\an1}I'll take over, I
was there, after all.

7
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,342
<i>Lord Raikage...</i>

8
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:31,977
{\an1}Hm?

9
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,144
Leave it...

10
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:37,814
{\an8}<i>Leave it...</i>

11
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,154
{\an1}<i>What?! A  smokescreen?</i>
<i>Do they think we're</i>
<i>a bunch of fools?!</i>

12
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:51,090
{\an8}<i>Leave it...</i>

13
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:54,225
{\an8}<i>Who are you? Are</i>
<i>you from the Cedar</i>
<i>Village?</i>

14
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,996
{\an7}<i>(sinister laughing)</i>

15
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:01,532
{\an7}<i>No, we are not shinobi</i>
<i>of the Cedar Village.</i>

16
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:05,735
{\an8}<i>We have no homeland,</i>
<i>nor a master other</i>
<i>than ourselves.</i>

17
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,170
{\an1}<i>People seek us out,</i>
<i>and we fulfill their</i>
<i>wishes.</i>

18
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:13,107
<i>The Cedar Village came</i>
<i>to us and their wish</i>
<i>is...</i>

19
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,443
<i>Death to those who</i>
<i>stole the Hidden Jutsu</i>
<i>of the Cedar Village!</i>

20
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,078
{\an1}They're mercenary
shinobi, huh?

21
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:21,780
{\an1}<i>Lightning Attack!</i>

22
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,314
(painful grunt)

23
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,019
{\an1}(sinister laughing)

24
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:28,818
(painful grunt)

25
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,520
{\an1}What's wrong, Karai?!

26
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:32,321
{\an1}Karai, are you okay?!

27
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:33,923
(angry growl)

28
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:35,925
{\an1}How dare you!

29
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:37,892
(evil laughter)

30
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,094
{\an1}<i>We are the wandering</i>
<i>phantoms of the forest!</i>

31
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:45,898
{\an1}Nokizaru!

32
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:48,000
{\an1}Nokizaru?! No way!

33
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:55,405
{\an7}<i>Nokizaru Troops, huh?</i>
<i>Shinobi who hunt other</i>
<i>shinobi...</i>

34
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:01,143
<i>Lord Raikage!</i>

35
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,076
{\an1}Huh?

36
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,579
Karai, he's in
no condition to-

37
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,314
{\an1}Stop it! I'm
fine! Let's go!

38
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,016
(laughter)

39
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,919
{\an1}<i>That's all it takes</i>
<i>to get them to run?</i>
<i>What cowards!</i>

40
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,353
(angry growl)

41
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:18,122
{\an1}Lord Raikage! Please,
sir, do not let the
enemy provoke you!

42
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,858
{\an1}There should be a
town ahead where we
can lose 'em.

43
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:25,127
{\an8}<i>That's the Raikage of</i>
<i>the Cloud?! Hmph! What</i>
<i>a disappointment!</i>

44
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,864
{\an7}(taunting laughter)

45
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:31,800
{\an1}Do not underestimate us!

46
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,501
{\an1}Lightning Rat Tremor!

47
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,403
(painful grunt)

48
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,172
{\an1}No! Nigai!

49
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:41,440
{\an1}Ahhh!

50
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,774
{\an1}Just get away!

51
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:45,409
{\an1}Please, listen!
Don't come any
closer!

52
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:51,414
{\an1}Nigai!

53
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:53,749
{\an1}<i>You bastards!</i>

54
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,451
{\an1}I won't let you
get away with this!

55
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,754
{\an1}(powerful grunts)

56
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:04,457
{\an4}No, Lord Raikage!
Don't do it! Nigai
and I both used jutsu,
and it caused something

57
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,660
{\an1}strange to happen inside
our bodies! If you use
one, too-

58
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,127
<i>Step back, Karai!</i>

59
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,898
{\an1}Ahhhh!

60
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:21,070
{\an5}Perhaps they realized
I meant business that
time and were scared
off. But whatever their

61
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,939
reasons for leaving
were, they did not
appear again.

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,644
{\an4}<i>Strange, I wonder why</i>
<i>they backed off. They</i>
<i>were the ones who</i>
<i>instigated the fight.</i>

63
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:37,049
{\an4}<i>Also, Nigai used his</i>
<i>jutsu, and it caused</i>
<i>him to explode. Karai</i>
<i>used a jutsu as well</i>

64
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:42,152
{\an4}<i>but apparently noticed</i>
<i>the change in his body</i>
<i>and quickly suppressed</i>
<i>his jutsu to prevent an</i>

65
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:48,189
{\an4}<i>explosion. The bomb-like</i>
<i>chakra mass on his chest</i>
<i>is still absorbing his</i>
<i>jutsu's chakra and</i>

66
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,624
{\an1}<i>causing him pain.</i>

67
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:53,527
{\an4}And Lord Raikage
manipulated his
chakra to create the
most power of all

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,896
<i>and yet he remains</i>
<i>safe and sound!</i>

69
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,831
{\an1}You sure about that?

70
00:05:58,865 --> 00:05:59,899
{\an3}What?!

71
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:04,436
{\an5}<i>You can't tell by</i>
<i>looking at him, but I</i>
<i>sense that the same</i>
<i>type of chakra in that</i>

72
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,637
<i>lump is also inside</i>
<i>the Raikage.</i>

73
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,141
{\an1}What are you talking
about? I mean, I feel
perfectly fine!

74
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,142
(surprised gasp)

75
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:12,676
Yes, for now...

76
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:18,513
{\an4}<i>I'm pretty sure this</i>
<i>lump is an Exploding</i>
<i>Bug. Something only the</i>
<i>Nokizaru Troops have</i>

77
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,348
{\an1}<i>been successful</i>
<i>in creating.</i>

78
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:26,318
{\an4}<i>You've seen what it</i>
<i>does. Once it finds a</i>
<i>host, it keeps absorbing</i>
<i>chakra and growing until</i>

79
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,186
{\an1}<i>it inevitably explodes.</i>

80
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,990
<i>And the size of this</i>
<i>larva merits grave</i>
<i>concern.</i>

81
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:32,824
{\an1}Huh?

82
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,728
{\an5}<i>Huh? Did you feel</i>
<i>something? The larvae</i>
<i>start out invisible</i>
<i>to the naked eye, as</i>

83
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,530
<i>tiny as the cells</i>
<i>in your body.</i>

84
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:41,698
{\an1}You mean?

85
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:47,668
{\an4}Yes... You fell into
the enemy's trap from
the moment that you first
made contact with them.

86
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:51,571
{\an1}<i>Larvae scattered into</i>
<i>the atmosphere with</i>
<i>that explosion of light.</i>

87
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:55,674
{\an1}<i>You breathed them in,</i>
<i>completely unaware.</i>

88
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:57,743
(gasp)

89
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:00,378
{\an1}So then why does the
Raikage seem okay?

90
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,679
{\an7}<i>Yeah!</i>

91
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,781
{\an1}Why don't I have one of
those chakra lumps like
Karai and Nigai?

92
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,917
{\an1}I was in the exact
same situation as
them!

93
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,387
{\an7}And also, I cannot deny
that I've been manipulating
chakra quite a bit.

94
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,158
{\an7}Especially earlier when
we were arm-wrestling, I
used a good amount of
my chakra.

95
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,525
(chuckle)

96
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:22,929
{\an1}So the unruly brat of
the Cloud grew bigger
but didn't grow up, huh?

97
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:24,730
{\an1}How dare you say that!

98
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,131
<i>Oh, relax!</i>

99
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:29,834
At least just hear me
out before you start
yelling at me again.

100
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,234
(calming sigh)

101
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,905
{\an1}<i>First of all, we shinobi</i>
<i>activate our jutsu by</i>
<i>manipulating chakra.</i>

102
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,175
{\an1}The amount of chakra
that we need for any
given jutsu...

103
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,178
{\an4}Well, this is just a
generalization, but
it's largely dependent on
the level of that jutsu.

104
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:48,481
<i>We adjust the amount</i>
<i>for each jutsu we use.</i>

105
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,616
{\an1}The stronger the jutsu,
the more chakra we need.

106
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,119
{\an1}<i>So we store up chakra</i>

107
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:57,354
{\an1}inside of our bodies
so that we can use it
at another time.

108
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:03,092
Hold on...You mentioned
that earlier, you and the
Raikage were arm-wrestling.

109
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,895
Don't you also use up
chakra when you use your
physical strength?

110
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:12,332
{\an1}Yes. However, in that
case, the Raikage didn't
use his chakra for strength.

111
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,703
{\an1}<i>Instead, to counter my</i>
<i>physical power, he used</i>
<i>speed to push me back.</i>

112
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:26,342
{\an1}<i>Naturally, one uses</i>
<i>chakra to create</i>
<i>speed, too.</i>

113
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:31,513
{\an1}<i>However, converting chakra</i>
<i>into speed consumes that</i>
<i>chakra instantly.</i>

114
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:35,083
{\an1}<i>So there's not enough</i>
<i>time for the Exploding</i>
<i>Bug to absorb it.</i>

115
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:38,886
{\an1}I get it, but does that
mean I'm going to end up
like Karai or doesn't it?

116
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,553
{\an1}Yes, exactly.

117
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:45,224
{\an1}We all use a little
chakra even for normal,
everyday activities.

118
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,160
{\an1}Until the Bug's removed,
you must remain inactive.

119
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,661
{\an1}But you're saying that
it's possible to get
rid of it?

120
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:55,430
<i>Of course! A simple</i>
<i>surgery should be</i>
<i>able to remove it.</i>

121
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,399
<i>Shizune, get</i>
<i>ready to operate.</i>

122
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,367
Got it.

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,668
<i>And...</i>

124
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,703
<i>Please wait! I'd</i>
<i>like to assist</i>
<i>if I could!</i>

125
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,703
{\an1}<i>Thank you.</i>

126
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:07,808
{\an1}<i>What is it?</i>

127
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:12,244
{\an5}Oh...Um...We'll have
to operate on your
subordinate first. He's
facing a greater risk

128
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:14,679
since the Bug in him
is closer to detonation.

129
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:18,916
{\an1}Hm. That's fine by
me. I want you to
save Karai first.

130
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:23,786
{\an1}No! Please, wait! You
have to let Lord Raikage
go before me!

131
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,320
{\an7}<i>Impossible!</i>

132
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:28,823
{\an7}The surgery itself is
simple, but if the
Exploding Bug has
wormed its way too

133
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,457
{\an7}far into the Chakra
Network...

134
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:34,994
{\an1}...it'll take considerable
skill and experience to
remove it! And don't forget,

135
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:37,529
{\an1}that thing could explode
at any moment now!

136
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:41,332
{\an1}That means the surgeon
is going to be taking
a risk of dying as well!

137
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,334
{\an1}<i>So I won't listen to</i>
<i>anymore of your nonsense!</i>

138
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:50,239
{\an7}All right, Tsunade,
enough. I'm fine with
this choice. Please just
tend to Karai first.

139
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:56,144
{\an5}Hmmh, I'm sorry. I
got worked up. But
there's still another
reason why we can't

140
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,511
do your surgery yet.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,782
{\an4}<i>The Exploding Bug that's</i>
<i>infiltrated your system is</i>
<i>too small for the human</i>
<i>eye to see.</i>

142
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,851
<i>Until it grows larger,</i>
<i>there's nothing we can do.</i>

143
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:09,620
<i>And yet at the same</i>
<i>time, we can't have</i>
<i>you just wait.</i>

144
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:14,357
{\an5}<i>We don't know how much</i>
<i>chakra it takes for the</i>
<i>Exploding Bug to grow to</i>
<i>maturity and detonate.</i>

145
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,026
<i>It could take very</i>
<i>little for all we know.</i>

146
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:22,730
{\an7}You must promise me,
Raikage! You'll let us
handle this surgery as
we see fit.

147
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:25,465
{\an7}Also, that you won't
exert yourself at all.

148
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,434
{\an1}All right, Tsunade.
I give you my word.

149
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:30,736
(attack yell)

150
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:31,402
(shocked gasp)

151
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,045
{\an1}<i>Huh! Well, it looks like</i>
<i>you'll be able to keep</i>
<i>that promise!</i>

152
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,881
<i>What is it?</i>

153
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,084
{\an1}<i>Just a bug.</i>

154
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,619
(shocked gasp)

155
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,255
What's the matter?

156
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,956
{\an1}It's nothing to
worry about.

157
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,459
{\an4}In any case, our target
is definitely inside that
abandoned building over
there.

158
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:05,629
Sounds good. And what's
the status on the Raikage?

159
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,163
{\an1}<i>No change.</i>

160
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,667
{\an1}<i>Are you sure he actually</i>
<i>inhaled the Exploding Bug?</i>

161
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,304
{\an4}Yeah, no doubt about it.
Both the timing and the
distance were completely
spot on.

162
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,604
{\an7}<i>Then why?</i>

163
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,409
{\an1}Why isn't the Exploding
Bug inside him maturing?

164
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:27,479
{\an4}Well, if I knew that,
then none of us would
have to be out here
spying on them, would we?

165
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,681
{\an1}<i>Enough of this, I</i>
<i>say we just attack</i>
<i>them.</i>

166
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:33,650
{\an1}Waiting around like
this is more boring
than I can stand!

167
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:38,154
{\an7}Don't be stupid. One
of those guys in there
could explode at any
moment now!

168
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:43,124
{\an7}So if we all just go
rushing in there, then
we could end up being
killed as well!

169
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:48,395
{\an4}Don't lose sight of what
our goal is. We were
hired to get that scroll
back, but it must be

170
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:49,662
{\an1}returned undamaged.

171
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:55,301
{\an4}Alright, I think it's
easiest to negotiate
a trade. The scroll in
return for removing

172
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,533
{\an1}the Exploding Bug.

173
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:02,239
{\an4}And if the enemy dies,
that doesn't matter, as
long as we retrieve the
scroll intact.

174
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:06,208
{\an1}Because it means
that we'll all get
paid in full.

175
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:11,578
Now listen, it seems
that some newcomers are
here to help the enemy.

176
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:17,616
{\an5}As a safeguard, we'll
plant Exploding Bugs, once
all of our enemies have
gathered in one location.

177
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,391
{\an1}I've brought the
antiseptic wash.

178
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,591
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

179
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,394
{\an4}<i>Can I help with the</i>
<i>surgery? I'd like to</i>
<i>learn for future</i>
<i>reference.</i>

180
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:34,495
<i>Sure, I'd</i>
<i>appreciate that.</i>

181
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,132
Are you able to perform
hemostatic jutsu?

182
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,067
{\an1}Yes. You can
count on me.

183
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,501
Good, that'll be
very helpful.

184
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:45,938
<i>Please, go around to</i>
<i>his other side. You</i>
<i>can assist from there.</i>

185
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:50,841
{\an5}This will save a lot of
time over controlling
the bleeding and doing
the extraction myself.

186
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,543
I owe you, Amai.
Thank you.

187
00:12:53,978 --> 00:13:00,549
{\an4}You bet. Don't worry,
these guys are the best.
Lady Tsunade will get every
trace of that Bug out.

188
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:04,952
{\an4}All right, now, We're
going to start the
anesthesia, so please
just relax.

189
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,027
{\an1}<i>Are you finally ready</i>
<i>to begin the surgery?</i>

190
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:19,896
We are. We've just given
him the anesthetic. It
should begin to take full

191
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,564
effect in just a
minute or two.

192
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:25,701
All right, Tsunade
Karai's in your
hands now.

193
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:29,938
{\an1}Shizune, take
care of it.

194
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:34,707
{\an4}What was that?! You
won't be wielding the
scalpel?! But I thought
you would be the one-

195
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:37,410
{\an1}Silence, Raikage!
Shizune will be
doing this!

196
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:42,546
{\an7}Don't you tell me to
shut up! I recognize
that you're the best
Medical Ninja around,

197
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,349
{\an7}and that's why I
came to you!

198
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:50,153
{\an7}Look, don't worry.
She's a highly skilled
Medical Ninja! And
besides, you gave me

199
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,720
{\an7}your word, remember?

200
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,356
{\an7}<i>That you'd let us do</i>
<i>this as we see fit.</i>

201
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,993
{\an8}<i>You're right, I did.</i>
<i>But you'll be sorry</i>
<i>if anything happens</i>
<i>to Karai!</i>

202
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:04,663
{\an4}<i>Don't worry, I'll</i>
<i>step in if I have to.</i>
<i>Listen, why don't you</i>
<i>go downstairs and take</i>

203
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,065
{\an1}<i>a nap while you're</i>
<i>waiting?</i>

204
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:07,832
<i>How's it coming,</i>
<i>Shizune.</i>

205
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,235
Good. We're
ready anytime.

206
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,069
<i>Alright, begin.</i>

207
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:18,908
{\an7}Very well, then. We'll
start the procedure to
open the chest cavity and
remove the Exploding Bug.

208
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,176
{\an7}Please start your
hemostatic jutsu.

209
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,010
<i>Right!</i>

210
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:33,986
{\an1}<i>What's wrong?!</i>

211
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,389
{\an1}<i>It's okay! The Exploding</i>
<i>Bug just started to grow</i>
<i>for a second there.</i>

212
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:42,526
{\an4}My god! How am I supposed
to keep my word to stay
still with all this
going on?!

213
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:45,094
Huh? What is
it, Tsunade?

214
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:16,385
<i>What's wrong,</i>
<i>Tsunade?</i>

215
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:21,322
{\an1}Blood?

216
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:23,490
{\an1}Oh, I see...

217
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,593
{\an5}So you suffer from
hemophobia. You're
afraid of the sight
of blood.

218
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,031
{\an5}<i>It all makes sense</i>
<i>now. That's why you</i>
<i>left the surgery up</i>
<i>to your subordinate.</i>

219
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:37,166
{\an1}Excuse me, I'm
going outside to
get some air.

220
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:47,875
{\an1}What a truly debilitating
condition for a Medical
Ninja to be afflicted with.

221
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,803
{\an1}Nawaki...

222
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,176
{\an1}<i>Dan...</i>

223
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,945
{\an1}<i>Shizune, tell</i>
<i>me something.</i>

224
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,548
<i>I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of surgery!</i>

225
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:45,352
{\an1}<i>I know that! I'm not</i>
<i>asking you to stop,</i>
<i>just to talk.</i>

226
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:51,856
{\an4}Tsunade is right up there
with Jiraiya and Orochimaru
as one of the Legendary
Sannin of the Leaf.

227
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:55,659
{\an4}<i>What on earth could</i>
<i>have happened to</i>
<i>make her fear blood</i>
<i>this way?</i>

228
00:16:55,692 --> 00:17:00,496
{\an5}<i>I confess, I'm curious</i>
<i>too. Even though Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade isn't from the</i>
<i>same village as we are,</i>

229
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,665
<i>she exemplifies what</i>
<i>Medical Ninja strive</i>
<i>to be.</i>

230
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:07,268
{\an7}But the suffering that
we all witnessed in
her earlier...

231
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:10,737
{\an1}I understand.

232
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:17,075
{\an4}What you must understand
is Lady Tsunade's had
two important people in
her life. The first one

233
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,043
{\an1}was her younger
brother, Nawaki.

234
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:24,948
{\an4}<i>But on the day after</i>
<i>his birthday, after she</i>
<i>had just given him his</i>
<i>present, he was killed</i>

235
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,950
{\an1}<i>in battle during the</i>
<i>Third Great Ninja World</i>
<i>War.</i>

236
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:36,789
{\an7}And the second was the
man she promised to share
her life with, Dan Kato.
He was my uncle, too.

237
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:47,064
{\an7}<i>Tsunade, I don't want</i>
<i>to die yet. There are</i>
<i>so many things left</i>
<i>to do.</i>

238
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,333
{\an1}Don't try to talk!

239
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:55,471
{\an7}It can't be. I
can't die here.
Not this way.
Not yet.

240
00:17:55,804 --> 00:18:00,308
{\an4}Please, don't worry,
Dan. I've stopped the
bleeding. Just save
your strength.

241
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,976
<i>You're going to</i>
<i>be all right.</i>

242
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:06,346
{\an1}Thank goodness.
That's a relief.

243
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:19,489
{\an1}Come back, Dan!
Don't go! <i>Don't</i>
<i>leave me!</i>

244
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:22,425
{\an1}Don't go!
Don't go!

245
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:26,328
{\an1}Don't go!
Don't go!

246
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:39,271
<i>(screaming)</i>

247
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:44,774
{\an1}<i>And ever since that</i>
<i>day. Lady Tsunade has</i>
<i>been traumatized.</i>

248
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:51,347
{\an5}Well, then, I suppose
that I too, must have
been in shock from
seeing Nigai die.

249
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,950
{\an4}<i>Otherwise, I never</i>
<i>would've gambled our lives</i>
<i>a Medical Ninja who has</i>
<i>completely lost it.</i>

250
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,286
Lady Tsunade
hasn't lost it!

251
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:00,786
(shocked gasp)

252
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,225
<i>The Exploding Bug's</i>
<i>been entirely removed.</i>

253
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:10,427
<i>The surgery's finished.</i>
<i>Please, close him up.</i>

254
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:11,794
{\an8}Yes, ma'am!

255
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:15,764
{\an5}Also, Lady Tsunade
hasn't lost her
Medical Ninjutsu
abilities.

256
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:21,636
{\an4}So I'll continue to carry
on for her until she gets
back on her feet, and she
will, because she has to!

257
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:25,305
{\an1}For her sake and
for my late uncle,
too!

258
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,010
{\an1}<i>I won the bet</i>
<i>back then.</i>

259
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,245
What's that?

260
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,548
{\an4}The reinforcements that
Amai called up quickly
rushed over, and the
Nokizaru Troops seemed

261
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:39,750
{\an1}to have given up.

262
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:42,551
Hmph! It was
all merely
dumb luck!

263
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:46,887
{\an4}Well, then what's the
connection between
overcoming your
hemophobia, and

264
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,090
{\an4}Naruto winning the
bet that the two
of you made with
each other?

265
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:51,991
<i>It's...</i>

266
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,827
{\an1}<i>No! Don't die!</i>

267
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,863
{\an1}Don't die!

268
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,031
{\an1}<i>Don't die!</i>

269
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,634
{\an1}<i>Naruto's tenacious</i>
<i>life force.</i>

270
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,203
{\an1}...To be Hokage...

271
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:11,173
To be Hokage,
that's my dream!

272
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:15,610
{\an1}<i>And that intense drive</i>
<i>to become Hokage.</i>

273
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:21,480
{\an1}<i>Once more, one</i>
<i>last time...</i>

274
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:24,784
{\an1}<i>I just felt like</i>
<i>betting on Naruto</i>
<i>again.</i>

275
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:33,923
{\an4}Huh?! Are you telling me
I went along with a silly
bet that had no stakes
whatsoever?

276
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:37,959
Hnnh! It's too late
to complain now. You'll
just have to suck it up.

277
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:45,031
{\an7}What?! Don't be ridiculous!
I've been prepared for this.
Ever since the Allied Shinobi
Forces was formed!

278
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,033
Oh, that's right!
Of course!

279
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:52,304
{\an4}<i>The First Hokage's</i>
<i>pendant is what I</i>
<i>want to see! C'mon</i>
<i>Naruto, show it to me!</i>

280
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,605
I don't have it
anymore.

281
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:54,238
{\an1}What?!

282
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:05,614
{\an5}Ha! I think that when
the Nine Tails got
called out before, I
ended up destroying it.

283
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,249
{\an1}Yeah, but, wasn't
that thing super
important?!

284
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:12,219
{\an4}It's okay. Granny and
I don't really need
something like that
anyway.

285
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:15,388
{\an1}'Cause we keep our
promise to each other
deep down in our hearts.

286
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,423
{\an1}Yeah!

287
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:18,190
{\an1}Let's hurry!

288
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:20,425
{\an1}<i>I bet everyone's</i>
<i>waiting for us!</i>

289
00:22:57,365 --> 00:23:01,368
{\an1}<i>You revel in killing.</i>
<i>I hate to think we're</i>
<i>both called shinobi.</i>

290
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:06,037
{\an5}<i>Stop being so full of</i>
<i>yourself. Who gave you</i>
<i>permission to wield the</i>
<i>Executioner's Blade?!</i>

291
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,941
{\an4}<i>That blade belongs to the</i>
<i>Seven Ninja Swordsmen of</i>
<i>the Mist! An outsider</i>
<i>wielding it?!</i>

292
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,476
<i>I don't like it</i>
<i>one bit!</i>

293
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:15,712
{\an1}<i>Going up against these</i>
<i>two alone is going to</i>
<i>be rough, but...</i>

294
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:21,049
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Danger:</i>
<i>Jinpachi and Kushimaru!"</i>

295
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,518
{\an1}<i>Looks like you're</i>
<i>backed up against</i>
<i>a wall, buddy!</i>
