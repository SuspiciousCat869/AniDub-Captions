1
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,715
-Look how both of
the are smiling.

2
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,283
NARUTO: I know.

3
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,186
I saw him smile for the
first time when he threw it.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,257
I mean a real smile,
from the heart.

5
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,225
-What's this doing here?

6
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,461
[theme music]

7
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,264
[door unlatching]

8
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,234
[door squeaks opens]

9
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,399
YAMATO: This was in Sai's pack.

10
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,734
This is an ANBU black
ops list of targets

11
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,104
that obviously Sai's been
assigned to assassinate.

12
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,440
In other words,
it's a bingo book.

13
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,975
NARUTO: An assassination list?

14
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,014
-Why have those faces
been crossed off?

15
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,151
-It can only mean
that those are targets

16
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,153
that have already
been assassinated.

17
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,422
NARUTO: What's Sai doing
with something like that?

18
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,127
YAMATO: Look at this.

19
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,429
SAKURA: But hold on.

20
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,329
That's--

21
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,297
NARUTO: Sasuke!

22
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,265
But why?

23
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,702
-Ninja art.

24
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,503
Super beast scroll.

25
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,007
This entry doesn't
have an X through it.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,277
[gasps] (WHISPERS) Of course.

27
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,546
So that's what
this was all about.

28
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,082
-What are you saying, Captain?

29
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,452
YAMATO: Sai, acting as a
go-between for Orochimaru

30
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,654
and Danzo wasn't his
mission after all.

31
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:57,965
This entire time
Sai's real mission

32
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,714
it's to assassinate Sasuke.

33
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:15,417
[both gasp]

34
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,227
-No way!

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,262
That just doesn't
make any sense!

36
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:28,078
Come on.

37
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:31,047
He said before that he
wanted to save Sasuke!

38
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:36,486
His face, that smile was
from the bottom of his heart!

39
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,155
-This is what I
wanted to show him.

40
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,659
It's the picture of our dreams.

41
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,095
NARUTO: He was acting different
from the way he was before.

42
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,563
-But that's just it.

43
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,565
-Huh?

44
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,134
-What if it was all just an act?

45
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,703
Just an act to draw you out?

46
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:54,671
-I'm no one.

47
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,873
A tool for Lord Danzo.

48
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,776
I don't even exist.

49
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:03,013
So no matter what you say
or do, it's meaningless.

50
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,621
-The owner of this
bingo book would

51
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:14,190
be capable of such deception.

52
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,191
Take a look.

53
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,530
See the man next to Sasuke?

54
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,136
He was from the Hidden
Mist, a [? joni ?] who

55
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,639
took a hard-line stance
against The Leaf.

56
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,876
-And Sai just got rid of him?

57
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,077
-Yes.

58
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,113
And he couldn't have been
an easy opponent to defeat.

59
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,849
If Sai did away
with him, that means

60
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:43,820
he would do anything to
accomplish his goals.

61
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,689
Pretending to be somebody
he isn't? [scoffs]

62
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:49,592
That's all in a
day's work for him.

63
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:53,663
-He was using his smile
to get what he wanted.

64
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,899
SAI (THINKING): That smile
of yours looked so sincere.

65
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,838
Well, it would appear
I've just learned

66
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:04,774
another use for a fake smile.

67
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:06,743
I'll remember that.

68
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,144
-Ugh! (YELLING) How
can you just sit

69
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:11,648
there grinning after she
knocked you into next week?

70
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:14,451
-The best way to defuse
a troublesome situation

71
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:15,585
is by smiling.

72
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:23,493
[grunts painfully] Even
if it's only a fake smile.

73
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:26,763
It will fool more
people than you think.

74
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:30,934
At least, that's what
it said in the book.

75
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,470
--[sighs] And judging by
the kinds of people listed

76
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:37,640
throughout this bingo
book, it's clear.

77
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:41,111
Sai's mission was to dispose of
those who threatened The Leaf.

78
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:44,114
And what's more,
they consider Sasuke

79
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:45,615
to be one of those threats.

80
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:52,489
[quiet hissing]

81
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:06,035
Danzo's ultimate goal is to
find Orochimaru's new host

82
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,506
and destroy it
before it's too late.

83
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,444
That's the reason Sai sought out
Orochimaru in the first place.

84
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,013
They weren't going
to betray The Leaf.

85
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:20,950
No, in fact, It's
quite the opposite.

86
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,853
[huffs] It's just
the kind of tactic

87
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,488
a hard-liner would think up.

88
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,462
-Well, there's no
point in standing

89
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,898
around here complaining
about it now.

90
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:35,999
-Uh.

91
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,600
-To be honest, I
don't really care

92
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,502
what Sai was ordered
to do, or what

93
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:41,838
that Danzo guy
might be thinking.

94
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,674
Right now, we just got
find Sai and keep going.

95
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,242
Because the only thing
that really matters

96
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,243
is finding Sasuke!

97
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,214
-Naruto's right.

98
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:54,517
That's exactly
what we should do.

99
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,986
I felt Sai's chakra earlier.

100
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,088
We need to move fast.

101
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,056
[receding footsteps]

102
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:00,890
-All right.

103
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,459
Back on the trail!

104
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:12,635
SAKURA (THINKING): If Sai is
planning to target Sasuke,

105
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:13,870
I will stop him.

106
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:14,871
No matter what!

107
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,482
SASUKE: Who's there?

108
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,183
-Uh?

109
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,487
So you do know I'm here.

110
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,024
Well, regardless, I
still have the advantage.

111
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:36,593
SASUKE: (WEARILY)
What do you want?

112
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,633
-Well, if you mean Lord Danzo,
his objective is to bury you.

113
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,906
But me, I have come here--

114
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:52,976
-(THINKING) Sai!

115
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,547
--to take you back to The Leaf.

116
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:06,723
When I first started
out, I did so

117
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,159
with the sole intention
of ending your life.

118
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,795
-After all, Sasuke's
the person who

119
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,764
accepted me more
than anybody else.

120
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:22,939
-It's because Sasuke's more
than a teammate to Naruto.

121
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,841
He's like a brother.

122
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:30,446
-If you mean saving a comrade,
I'll do whatever it takes.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,617
Even if that means
teaming with you.

124
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,053
Even if I get
chopped into pieces,

125
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:40,523
I'm going to beat Orochimaru
and take my friend

126
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:43,192
Sasuke back (YELLING)
once and for all!

127
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:47,730
Sasuke is my best friend.

128
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:52,502
It took a while, but now
we have a special bond.

129
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:55,672
SAI: You share something with
him, a bond of friendship

130
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:58,942
that Naruto is
desperately holding onto.

131
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,843
And I'm here to protect it.

132
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,687
SASUKE: A bond?

133
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,622
[running footsteps]

134
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,892
[hissing]

135
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:20,997
Is that really your
excuse for waking me up?

136
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,966
SAI: Ugh!

137
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,901
[begins chakra]

138
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:40,016
-Huh, ah!

139
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,084
What was that?

140
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:46,756
-That's Sai's chakra.

141
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:47,757
-And it's up ahead!

142
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:57,667
-What was that?

143
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,036
-(THINKING) Well, I
guess Sasuke's awake.

144
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,940
He's always so grumpy
when he first gets up.

145
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,943
[debris rumbling]

146
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,201
-Uh.

147
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:33,803
Unh.

148
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:36,205
(THINKING) Pretty impressive.

149
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:39,809
He broke my jitsu
with sheer power.

150
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:47,750
[wind rises]

151
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,123
[running footsteps]

152
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:35,203
-[gasps]

153
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,145
-(THINKING) There he is!

154
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:57,125
-Sakura!

155
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,101
-Ugh!

156
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:07,927
(ANGRILY) All right, enough!

157
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,494
Tell us what you're
really up to!

158
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:10,695
How many times were going to betray us before you...

159
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,863
SASUKE: Sakura.

160
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:17,736
(THINKING) That voice!

161
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,869
(WHISPERS) It's you!

162
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:51,723
Sasuke!

[panting] Uh.

00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:43,828
Unh!

173
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:15,493
(WHISPERS) Sasuke!

174
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:36,848
-Well, Naruto.

175
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,255
(IN MONOTONE) You came, too.

176
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:52,564
I assume Kakashi is here?

177
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:55,433
-Unfortunately, Kakashi
couldn't make it,

178
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:58,270
so I'm here in his place.

179
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,573
Team Kakashi has come to
escort you back to The Leaf.

180
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:09,080
SASUKE: Team Kakashi.

181
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,191
[metallic clink]

182
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,227
-Uh!

183
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,561
I knew it!

184
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:24,529
Sai don't!

185
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:28,763
-[gasps]

186
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,511
SASUKE: So that
guy's my replacement?

187
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:42,554
I thought the team
already had a weakling.

188
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,189
He was saying
something about wanting

189
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:47,459
to protect the bond
between Naruto and me.

190
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,661
-Uh.

191
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:50,762
Sai?

192
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:52,130
I thought your mission
was to assassinate

193
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:53,665
-It's true.

194
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:57,602
I was given a classified mission
to find and eliminate Sasuke.

195
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,704
But I'm through
following orders.

196
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:02,974
From now on, I think for myself.

197
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:07,078
Naruto, I think you can help
me remember, and bring back

198
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:09,848
those old feelings
I thought were lost.

199
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,851
Things that were
once important to me.

200
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,724
I really don't know that
much about you, Sasuke.

201
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,860
But I do know that
Naruto and Sakura would

202
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:26,698
be willing to risk just
about everything for you.

203
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:29,934
They don't want to lose
their connection with you.

204
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:33,838
They would give anything
to protect those bonds.

205
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:36,508
I still might not
understand it that clearly.

206
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:41,682
But you, Sasuke, you
must understand it.

207
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,147
-You're right.

208
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,392
I did understand.

209
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,500
And that's why I severed them!

210
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,901
-[gasp]

211
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:13,819
-Ahh!

212
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:16,422
(YELLING) You're
out of your mind!

213
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,390
[punch impacts]

214
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,502
--[coughing and choking] Uh
[sobbing] And now, finally!

215
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:39,503

216
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,103
Uoh!

217
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,075
[sigh]

218
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:46,476
[strikes land]

219
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,077
Uh!

220
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:52,282
(THINKING) All these years,
and nothing has changed.

221
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,364
-(CALM VOICE) You're
still too weak.

222
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:08,899
-Uh.

223
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:11,368
-You don't have enough hate.

224
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,370
And you know something?

225
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,971
(WHISPERS) You never will!

226
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:28,251
[? howl. ?]

227
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:31,221
-Unh!

228
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:35,792
[scream]

229
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:42,182
You see, I have a
different bond now,

230
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,207
between my older brother and me.

231
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,982
It's the bond of hatred.

232
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,782
[ending theme music]

233
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,242
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So you
severed our bonds, huh?

234
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:05,111
If I'm supposed to
believe that, how

235
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,313
come you couldn't kill me
when you had the chance?

236
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:10,183
Don't you think that would
have done the trick, Sasuke?

237
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:12,151
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Sparing your life back then

238
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:15,254
had nothing to do with
some kind of silly bond.

239
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:17,089
My decision to let
you live was made

240
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:19,892
on a passing whim, an impulse.

241
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:21,928
But now I have a different whim.

242
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:25,865
And this impulse says,
you're about to die, Naruto!

243
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,968
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, The Power of Ochiha.

244
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:31,971
[ending theme music]

245
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:46,385
-The theme for today's episode
was the bonds Naruto shares

246
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,120
with others.

247
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,256
Due to his
background, Naruto was

248
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:52,225
an outcast in his early life.

249
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:54,927
Nobody in the village
acknowledged him, that is,

250
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,829
until Iruka Sensei.

251
00:22:56,863 --> 00:23:00,299
This was Naruto's first
important bond in life.

252
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,903
And then, Team Kakashi was
formed, which gave Naruto

253
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,340
the chance to establish
new bonds of friendship.

254
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:10,009
As time passed,
everyone in the village

255
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:13,379
began to acknowledge Naruto
for his unstoppable tenacity

256
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,382
and his feisty spirit.

257
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:18,384
The circle of bonds
keeps growing.

258
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:21,254
The threads that connect people
grow thicker and stronger

259
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,389
with the passage of time.

260
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,124
Once someone becomes
with another,

261
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,961
they will never abandon
them in good times or bad.

262
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:31,097
It's a sentiment borrowed
from Iruka Sensei,

263
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:34,233
but it's one I
will never forget.

264
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:38,337
And I hope you will seek out
your own bonds in life, too.
