1
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:23,701
{\an1}-Who would've thought that you
and I would both die so young?

2
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,076
{\an1}Though, not as young
as your mother.

3
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,182
-Father.

4
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,885
{\an1}I had always wanted
to ask you something.

5
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,565
{\an1}I wanted to know why you,
the White Fang of the Leaf,

6
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:48,003
{\an1}willingly chose to
ignore the village code,

7
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:52,845
{\an1}to abandon a crucial mission
in order to save your comrades.

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,216
{\an1}You knew if you let them
die, no one from the village

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,353
{\an1}would have condemned you.

10
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:03,428
{\an1}Instead, you were dishonored
and committed suicide.

11
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,397
{\an1}It made me so bitter.

12
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,972
-I see.

13
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:15,679
{\an1}Seems you had your fair
share of trouble too, huh?

14
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:16,180
-Yeah.

15
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,556
{\an1}But you know, father?

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,863
{\an1}Now I realize that you did
what you thought was right.

17
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:29,901
{\an1}You knew what the
consequences would be,

18
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:34,373
{\an1}yet you chose your friends'
lives over the code,

19
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:36,076
{\an1}and I'm proud of you for it.

20
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:49,163
-Thank you, son.

21
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,456
-What is that?

22
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:21,679
{\an1}-What is green light
all around him?

23
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,094
-Where am I?

24
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,497
{\an1}What happened to me, ma?

25
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:37,937
{\an1}-What is going on, Guy-sensei?

26
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,875
-I-- I-- I--

27
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,978
-I-- I see.

28
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,516
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I know
that Lord Fukasaku is dead.

29
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,952
{\an1}I can't believe it.

30
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:49,421
{\an1}Can this really be happening?

31
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,297
-No way.

32
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,768
{\an1}How can--- This can't be.

33
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:10,686
{\an1}-What is happening here?

34
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,928
-Iruka-sensei!

35
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:16,996
-Konohamaru!

36
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,465
{\an1}Thank goodness you're safe.

37
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,266
{\an1}-Glad you are too, Sensei.

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,402
-Ebisu-sensei.

39
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,771
Are you hurt?

40
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:26,209
{\an1}-It's nothing to worry about,
only because Konohamaru here

41
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:29,414
saved me.

42
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:31,417
{\an1}But never mind about
that right now.

43
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,320
{\an1}What is this strange phenomenon?

44
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:33,821
-Yeah.

45
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,502
-What is this?

46
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:49,011
{\an1}-It appears to me that Naruto
has settled things with Pain.

47
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,982
[theme music]

48
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,444
{\an1}-What's he doing?

49
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,279
{\an1}What just happened?

50
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,520
-Naruto.

51
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,355
{\an1}More and more villagers
are coming back to life.

52
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,225
-What?

53
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:48,725
Seriously?

54
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,171
{\an1}-I'm gonna stay here and look
after these three for awhile.

55
00:05:57,204 --> 00:06:00,542
{\an1}Only until they're truly able to
take better care of themselves.

56
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,112
Poor kids.

57
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,780
{\an1}It's the least that
I can do for them.

58
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:13,161
{\an1}-I still have time
to revive those

59
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:16,567
{\an1}I killed since I arrived
in the Leaf village.

60
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,007
{\an1}It's the least that
I can do for them.

61
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,344
-What's this?

62
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:28,351
{\an1}-Well, my guess is, it was just
too soon for you to come here.

63
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:29,754
You must have
unfinished business

64
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,958
{\an1}waiting for you back home.

65
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,460
-Father.

66
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,933
-I'm grateful we
had time to talk.

67
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,370
{\an1}And for your forgiveness.

68
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:43,908
At long last.

69
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:45,978
I'm free.

70
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,380
{\an1}I can move on peace.

71
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,677
{\an1}And finally see your mother.

72
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:08,678
-Pa!

73
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,149
-What?

74
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,953
{\an1}-Kakashi too, huh?

75
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:15,423
-What happened?

76
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:17,460
{\an1}-Oh, thank goodness.

77
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:19,929
{\an1}I'm so glad, Kakashi-sensei.

78
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,832
{\an1}-I'll explain everything
as clearly as I can.

79
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:33,484
-Did you just--

80
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,955
{\an1}-War inflicts death, injury,
and pain on everyone.

81
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:41,061
{\an1}The truth is, the more
precious someone is to us,

82
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,000
{\an1}the harder it is for us to
accept that they might die.

83
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,737
{\an1}Sometimes you actually
convince yourself there's

84
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,241
{\an1}no way they could die.

85
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:56,651
{\an1}This naivete can't
be helped, especially

86
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,788
{\an1}with a generation like yours.

87
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:02,528
{\an1}A generation that
does not know war.

88
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,265
You might try to
find meaning in war,

89
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:09,237
{\an1}but all there is is loss
and unbearable pain.

90
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,043
{\an1}All that senseless death,
it unleashes a cycle

91
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,781
{\an1}of violence and hatred
that never ends.

92
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:19,753
{\an1}War creates only more war.

93
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,690
{\an1}And those are the
things you will

94
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:24,427
{\an1}face in the coming days, Naruto.

95
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:33,140
{\an1}The parallels between
you and that book,

96
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:37,279
{\an1}it almost feels like
someone set it all up.

97
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,784
{\an1}Like it was all the
work of an actual god.

98
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,433
{\an1}Seems this is it for me.

99
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:54,405
{\an1}Naruto, I believe you,
of all people, can.

100
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:28,223
-Him as well?

101
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:30,293
{\an1}You're taking him too?

102
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:31,662
-Yes.

103
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:35,134
{\an1}This Tendo Pain was created
from the body of our dear friend

104
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,335
Yahiko.

105
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,507
{\an1}It's something that's
very precious to us both.

106
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,775
-Yahiko.

107
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:41,843
{\an1}Guess I understand, then.

108
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,124
{\an1}What are you gonna do now?

109
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:55,030
{\an1}I'd hate to think you're
going back to the Akatsuki.

110
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:55,798
-No.

111
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,968
{\an1}I'm leaving the Akatsuki.

112
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,807
{\an1}Yahiko and Nagato
meant everything to me.

113
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,683
{\an1}Yahiko's dream, and
then Nagato's dream.

114
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:11,021
{\an1}Both of their dreams have
been entrusted to you.

115
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:14,159
{\an1}You now embody those dreams.

116
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:20,535
{\an1}Nagato chose to put his faith in
you, so now I will do the same.

117
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,572
And we of the
Hidden Rain village

118
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,543
{\an1}will continue to pursue our
dreams together with you.

119
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,021
{\an1}If I can't find the
solution to this problem,

120
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:37,428
{\an1}then perhaps I'll entrust you
to find it instead, eh Naruto?

121
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:42,636
{\an1}-I think I shall believe in
you after all, Naruto Uzumaki.

122
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:53,952
{\an1}-The name Naruto, the
guts to never get up,

123
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,953
{\an1}and now more pain.

124
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,996
{\an1}They're the things I've
inherited from my master

125
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,566
{\an1}and from my sibling student.

126
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,666
{\an1}-This time I wish that you will
be the blossom of hope that

127
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:25,867
{\an1}will never wilt away.

128
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:34,948
{\an1}NARUTO: Just you watch, master.

129
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:31,266
-Good job.

130
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,869
-Kakashi-sensei.

131
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:33,703
-Stay still.

132
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:34,638
I'll carry you.

133
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:57,439
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
He's gotten heavier.

134
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,410
[cheering]

135
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,353
{\an1}-Glad you made it back OK!

136
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,289
{\an1}-We knew you could do it, yeah!

137
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,260
[cheering]

138
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,407
{\an1}-They've all been waiting
for you to return.

139
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,050
{\an1}-To be the greatest Hokage.

140
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,152
{\an1}That is my dream.

141
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:30,622
{\an1}And then, someday I'm
going to be respected

142
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,592
by everybody in
the entire village.

143
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,237
-Naruto.

144
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,872
You did well.

145
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:48,917
-What's this?

146
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,421
{\an1}-I've already relayed to the
others every detail of what

147
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:53,724
{\an1}transpired between you and pain.

148
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,194
{\an1}-What was the enemy like anyway?

149
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,164
{\an1}Did you get any cool--

150
00:13:58,197 --> 00:13:59,165
-Ow!

151
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,636
{\an1}Hey, come on, stop
pushing me around.

152
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,606
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER):
I'm so glad, Naruto.

153
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,758
{\an1}-Hey, you guys, cut
it out, would you?

154
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,759
-Huh?

155
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,194
Hey, Sakura.

156
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:19,663
{\an1}-You're just so reckless.

157
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:20,263
You idiot!

158
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:37,556
Thank you.

159
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,300
{\an1}-You really did it, Naruto.

160
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,973
{\an1}-Yes, now that's what
youth is all about.

161
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:51,111
{\an1}-I can't believe he
pulled it off by himself.

162
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,147
-Mm-hm.

163
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:54,249
{\an1}-You know, I could
almost fall for him.

164
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:55,584
-Huh?

165
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:56,686
-That Naruto.

166
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,188
{\an1}He's something, all right.

167
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:00,324
{\an1}He was my classmate, you know?

168
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,862
-But he really
outclasses us all.

169
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:03,830
{\an1}-Can it, will you?

170
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,231
We'll just work
harder from now on.

171
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:11,975
{\an1}-Let's go down there and
join them, Iruka-sensei.

172
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,412
{\an1}-I'm fine right here.

173
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,181
-Yeah, but--

174
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,884
{\an1}-Don't you worry.

175
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,022
{\an1}Naruto is amazing,
wouldn't you agree?

176
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:26,798
{\an1}At first, everyone thought
he was only a big nuisance.

177
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:29,836
{\an1}And I was certainly
no different.

178
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,973
{\an1}We feared what he might
become, so we just

179
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,541
{\an1}kept him at arm's length.

180
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,913
{\an1}We treated him like
nothing but a bother.

181
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,649
{\an1}-And that fox brat.

182
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,351
{\an1}He shouldn't be a ninja.

183
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:41,187
{\an1}-That's for sure.

184
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,389
{\an1}What is Lord Hokage thinking?

185
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,093
{\an1}MAN: That team Kakashi.

186
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,629
{\an1}I hear they defeated
the terrorist Zabuza.

187
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,634
{\an1}MAN: Seems that Nine Tails
boy was at the center of it.

188
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,635
WOMAN: No way.

189
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:52,670
{\an1}That kid's a total loser.

190
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:55,742
I bet it was all
Kakashi's doing.

191
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,577
{\an1}-You know that Nine Tails kid?

192
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,315
{\an1}Well, he made it to the
finals of the Chunin exam.

193
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:01,785
-Wow, he did?

194
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:04,088
Guess he's more
skilled than I thought.

195
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,223
-Heh.

196
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,059
{\an1}Just hope the demon fox
doesn't go on a rampage.

197
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,253
-Whoa.

198
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,024
{\an1}That's the Nine Tails kid?

199
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,161
{\an1}I can't believe he
defeated a Hyuga.

200
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,097
Awesome match.

201
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:32,798
-Wow.

202
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,301
{\an1}I never expected that.

203
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,737
{\an1}I didn't think the fox
brat had it in him.

204
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,073
{\an1}-Yeah, he's not bad at all.

205
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,350
-Determined.

206
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,585
{\an1}He never gave up.

207
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:48,989
{\an1}He always followed his
heart and tried his hardest,

208
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,692
{\an1}and he stayed true
to his ninja way

209
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,527
{\an1}no matter what he was facing.

210
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,698
{\an1}And slowly but surely,
we couldn't help

211
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:55,632
{\an1}but acknowledge him.

212
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:04,746
-Damn.

213
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:09,586
Damn it all!

214
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:24,509
{\an1}WOMAN: Word is that he defended
the village from the Sand

215
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,177
Junchuriki.

216
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,247
WOMAN: Who did?

217
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:28,782
{\an1}WOMAN: Naruto Uzumaki.

218
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,018
You know.

219
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:30,718
That child.

220
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:44,273
{\an1}MAN: I'm glad the Fifth
Hokage's been decided.

221
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:46,343
Now we can all
breathe easier, thanks

222
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,478
{\an1}to Lord Jiraiya and Naruto.

223
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,181
{\an1}WOMAN: Did they really
battle Orochimaru?

224
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,106
{\an1}MAN: I heard he couldn't
bring Sasuke Uchiha back.

225
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,679
MAN: Boy, I hope
Naruto's doing OK.

226
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,782
{\an1}MAN: And now, a group
called the Akatsuki

227
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:38,154
{\an1}is going after all
of the Jinchuriki.

228
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:41,292
{\an1}MAN: Does that mean
Naruto's a target, too?

229
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:42,994
Is he all right?

230
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:43,963
{\an1}MAN: Don't worry.

231
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:47,734
Lord Jiraiya's
watching over him.

232
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:48,936
{\an1}MAN: Hey, did you hear?

233
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,806
{\an1}They say that Naruto
rescued the Sand's Kazekage

234
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,809
{\an1}from the Akatsuki.

235
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,178
MAN: Wouldn't it
be great if this

236
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,615
{\an1}results in an alliance
between the Leaf and the Sand?

237
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,035
{\an1}MAN: The Akatsuki
killed Lord Jiraiya!

238
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:11,304
{\an1}How's Naruto taking it?

239
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:18,348
{\an1}MAN: Naruto's inherited
Lord Jiraiya's Will of Fire.

240
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,184
{\an1}MAN: He hasn't lost heart.

241
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,489
{\an1}He'll keep forging on, as usual.

242
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:25,959
{\an1}-And now everyone trusts
Naruto completely,

243
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,428
{\an1}and they carry him
in their hearts,

244
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:30,567
{\an1}expect great things of
him, and wish him the best.

245
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,604
{\an1}Naruto has truly changed
the minds of everyone

246
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:36,209
{\an1}whose lives he's touched.

247
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,046
{\an1}-It's because he never gave up.

248
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,989
-Iruka.

249
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,527
{\an1}-What is it, Lord Hokage?

250
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,563
{\an1}-I know how you feel.

251
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:53,468
{\an1}You grew up just like
Naruto, without knowing

252
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,737
{\an1}the love of a mother and father.

253
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,208
Because of the
Nine Tails attack,

254
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:00,645
{\an1}most people won't
even look at him.

255
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:03,583
{\an1}That's why he gets into so
much trouble all the time,

256
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:06,754
{\an1}so that people will be
forced to notice him.

257
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,559
{\an1}He just wants his existence
to be acknowledged,

258
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,127
{\an1}no matter what form it takes.

259
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,745
{\an1}The final wish that
the Fourth Hokage

260
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:26,652
{\an1}made before he sacrificed
himself to save our village

261
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,957
{\an1}was for Naruto to one
day be seen as a hero.

Lord Fourth.

265
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:06,744
There is a hero,
right before our eyes.

to think about this.

269
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,819
{\an1}I don't know about becoming
Naruto's homeroom teacher.

270
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:05,658
{\an1}-As you know, everyone is
troubled by Naruto's mischief.

271
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:07,260
{\an1}No one wants to take him on.

IRUKA: But sir--

273
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:11,032
{\an1}-If Naruto isn't able to
graduate from the Academy,

274
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:13,503
{\an1}he cannot become a shinobi.

{\an1}If he cannot find a
teacher, I'll have no choice

276
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:17,609
{\an1}but to expel him.

277
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,880
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on
"Naruto Shippuden."
