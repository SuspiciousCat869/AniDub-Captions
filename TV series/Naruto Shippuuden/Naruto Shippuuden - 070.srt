1
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:18,831
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

2
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,000
The third tail.

3
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,598
[theme song]

4
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:35,220
-Sora.

5
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,386
No!

6
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,855
Soray!

7
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:57,623
-Naruto, no!

8
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:58,391
Be careful!

9
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,360
-Naruto, don't!

10
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:10,044
Naruto!

11
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,152
-That idiot!

12
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:15,920
-Is he OK?

13
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:24,800
-That's Sora.

14
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:25,702
He's in there.

15
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,583
It might not seem like him,
but the real Sora is there.

16
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:34,917
He's just gotta be!

17
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:43,264
-From the sound of things,
Sora has finally transformed.

18
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,468
Nobody can stop that boy now.

19
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,369
-Kazuma.

20
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,838
You fool.

21
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,797
-Wood style jutsu!

22
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,460
Such destructive power.

23
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,163
-Sora, that's enough!

24
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:40,325
-Shadow strangle jutsu!

25
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,055
I knew it wouldn't work.

26
00:04:59,089 --> 00:04:59,856
-Let me try!

27
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,607
-Choji!

28
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,508
-Don't worry.

29
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,844
I can heal him.

30
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:19,789
-Darn it.

31
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:22,394
For crying out loud,
snap out of it!

32
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,444
-Kazuma.

33
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:35,547
Why on Earth did you do this?

34
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,983
You're his father.

35
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,620
So why?

36
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:41,591
The Nine-Tails-- you
put it inside him

37
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,928
to turn your son into a weapon?

38
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,100
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

39
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:53,277
-Of course I do.

40
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,114
And I'd do it again
if I had the chance.

41
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,685
It's all for the cause.

42
00:05:58,718 --> 00:05:59,620
-I've heard enough!

43
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,169
-Let me give it a try!

44
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:09,670
Hiya!

45
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,149
-That jerk.

46
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,585
Fang over fang!

47
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:26,331
Dammit.

48
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:34,611
-You're mad.

49
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,580
What cause are
you talking about?

50
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:37,983
-A very worthy one.

51
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:41,121
To make sure the Land
of Fire stays as it is.

52
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:44,828
And I'll do anything for
the sake of that cause

53
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,064
-Then what about your child?

54
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,236
Mizura died for it as well?

55
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,277
-When you were young, growing up
as the son of the Third Hokage,

56
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,813
wasn't your cause
the same as his?

57
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:58,149
-That's not--

58
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:01,988
-I am protecting my king,
just as you have sworn to do.

59
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,791
How dare you question that?

60
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:08,266
-It's true.

61
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,238
I have indeed sworn
to protect my leader.

62
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:15,477
But that's not the kind of
king you've got in mind.

63
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:16,546
-There you go.

64
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,049
We're both the same, you and me.

65
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:21,221
You see, it doesn't
matter who your king is.

66
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,990
When all is said
and done we're just

67
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:26,362
pawns who only exist to
shield them from harm.

68
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,267
But a pawn is too weak
to protect a king.

69
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,838
Which is why I made
Sora what he is.

70
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:33,841
A pawn deep enough
in enemy ground

71
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,944
to be promoted to a
more powerful piece.

72
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,755
-You just don't get it.

73
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,527
Children aren't pawns
to protect the king.

74
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,398
-I don't care.

75
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,302
We're all merely pieces.

76
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:53,540
All we can do is try and
take out the other's king.

77
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:57,179
It doesn't matter how it's done.

78
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:00,818
Even if the game was
reversed, I would still win.

79
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:13,005
-Wood style jutsu!

80
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,238
-Dammit.

81
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:33,739
-No!

82
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:42,086
-Why?

83
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,455
He's an outsider.

84
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,423
-No he's no.

85
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,958
He's Team Kakashi.

86
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,429
He's a comrade now!

87
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,699
-You and me are the same.

88
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,200
Sora.

89
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,377
Hey, Sora, remember?

90
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,346
We thrashed around
like this then

91
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,449
and tried to stop each other.

92
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,152
I guess we were
pretty dumb, huh?

93
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,460
That's just the way we are.

94
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:17,344
-Did he get him?

95
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:17,778
-Naruto.

96
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:41,183
-Sora!

97
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,694
Sora.

98
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,530
Come back to us.

99
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,534
I know you're still in there!

100
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,035
Sora!

101
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:07,692
Sora.

102
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,168
-Don't do this!

103
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,071
-Get away from Sora, now!

104
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:15,571
Naruto!

105
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,678
-Sora!

106
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:28,827
Come on.

107
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,563
Snap out of it.

108
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,965
You gotta try.

109
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,268
Listen to me!

110
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,343
Sora.

111
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,045
What is this?

112
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,152
-What's happening?

113
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:54,969
-What-- what the
heck is going on?

114
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:58,274
Did it-- did my Nine-Tails
awaken on its own?

115
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:02,915
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Now.

116
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,253
-Hokage style, elder jutsu.

117
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:06,689
Tenth edict on enlightenment!

118
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:21,913
What's happening here?

119
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,349
It's never like this.

120
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,485
It's coming from the outside.

121
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,429
-Naruto.

122
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:31,930
-No.

123
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:32,965
Not now.

124
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,068
I can't let it come out.

125
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:44,416
Why?

126
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,118
Why now?

127
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,663
-Fate sure has a funny way
of causing coincidences,

128
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,934
doesn't it?

129
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,336
Fuka pointed it out.

130
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:03,013
-Furido.

131
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,384
About that kid I fought
against back there

132
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,254
with the pointy hair.

133
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,058
I wonder-- he and
Sora seemed alive.

134
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,638
-She thought Sora an the
boy might be connected.

135
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,808
The chakra is the same
in both Nine-Tails.

136
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,782
So of course Sora's
rage is resonating

137
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:26,785
with the original
nine-tailed fox.

138
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:27,287
-What?

139
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:30,992
-It's perfect.

140
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:35,601
Isn't this so interesting?

141
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:38,739
We'll get to see the
true jinchuriki-- no,

142
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:42,144
the nine-tailed fox spirit--
set loose to once again destroy

143
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,113
the Leaf Village.

144
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:47,385
[laughter]

145
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:47,887
-No!

146
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,305
[ominous laughter]

147
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:11,592
Dammit!

148
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,377
You don't want to do this.

149
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,512
Come on.

150
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:24,881
Stop it, Sora.

151
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:25,382
Sora!

152
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:41,007
No-- it can't--

153
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,284
What is that?

154
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:48,820
-This does not look good.

155
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:49,754
-Guys, run!

156
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,088
-Naruto!

157
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:35,763
-Sakura-- come on.

158
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:38,768
Sora, for the last time.

159
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:39,803
Wake up!

160
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,155
-That's my boy, Sora!

161
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:54,860
Smash the Leaf where it stands!

162
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,862
-No way.

163
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,349
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sora--

164
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:07,849
-Naruto!

165
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,059
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Can't let it happen.

166
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:17,698
I'm not gonna let that
nine-tailed monster take over

167
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,434
so easily.

168
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,603
-What the--

169
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,471
-Nice work.

170
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,272
Keep it up, Sora!

171
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,720
-I-- I didn't call on you.

172
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,257
So get lost, you dumb fox.

173
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,560
You think you can
just show up like this

174
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,265
whenever you feel like it?

175
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,300
Beat it!

176
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,606
-Captain Yamato,
can't you do anyhing?

177
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,673
-No.

178
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,045
My jutsu won't work
on Naruto like this.

179
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,680
We have to just
hope his willpower

180
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,749
is enough to hold it back.

181
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,552
-Oh no.

182
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,021
-No.

183
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,959
Darn it.

184
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:56,896
-Go ahead.

185
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,331
Leave it to me, boy.

186
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,819
-I'm not letting you out.

187
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,138
I won't back down!

188
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,843
No monster fox is
gonna take over me!

189
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,221
-Naruto.

190
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,657
-What did he--

191
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:35,626
-This is bad.

192
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,535
-That's right.

193
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,605
I made a vow.

194
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:46,676
I will not be overtaken by you.

195
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,181
That-- that's a promise.

196
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:51,151
I won't succumb.

197
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:55,158
I can't do the things
I warned Sora against!

198
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:56,660
[laughter]

199
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,630
-Why hesitate?

200
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:01,635
Just say what you're dying to.

201
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,604
I'm in your power.

202
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,309
Say it.

203
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:09,915
-Why don't you shut up?

204
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,817
Don't worry, Sora.

205
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:13,954
I'll bring you back
with my own hands.

206
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:16,493
You hear?

207
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:16,993
-Naruto?

208
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,523
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sora.

209
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,429
SORA (VOICEOVER): Who's that?

210
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:41,567
-Come on!

211
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,468
Sora!

212
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,705
Come back!

213
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:47,409
I know you can hear me, Sora!

214
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,546
Get out of there!

215
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,716
Are you gonna stay
asleep forever?

216
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,854
Well, I won't let you.

217
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:55,623
Wake up!

218
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,112
Sora!

219
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,004
SORA (VOICEOVER): Who's there?

220
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,576
Who is that person?

221
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,349
What-- it's me.

222
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,218
As a boy.

223
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:38,426
When I was little I
was always crying.

224
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,395
I was always so alone.

225
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:42,565
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sora--

226
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,837
-Who's that?

227
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,440
Whose voice is that?

228
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,507
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sora--

229
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,894
-I knew it.

230
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:03,166
It's just as I expected.

231
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,304
Nothing's changed.

232
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:08,843
I'm still alone.

233
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:09,910
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sora--

234
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,957
-Fight it, Sora.

235
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,195
Hang in there.

236
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:02,095
I'm gonna save you.

237
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,281
Come on, Sora.

238
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:13,782
Hang on!

239
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:20,893
-Whose voice is that?

240
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:29,173
[music playing]

241
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,221
-Sakura.

242
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:02,292
My medical ninjutsu isn't strong
enough to heal Choji's wound.

243
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:03,628
-I was worried about that.

244
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,032
It's just like when
Sakura was hurt.

245
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,603
-Wounds from the Nine-Tails
chakra take longer to heal.

246
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:09,671
-What?

247
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:10,911
-Even after proper
treatment the patient

248
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,014
might experience
long-lasting pain.

249
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,350
-So what then?

250
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,127
Does this mean Naruto's the
only one who can control him?

251
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,863
-Unfortunately that would
seem to be the case.

252
00:22:19,897 --> 00:22:20,931
-No way.

253
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,933
-All we can do is
have faith in Naruto.

254
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,302
-Next time-- My Friend.
