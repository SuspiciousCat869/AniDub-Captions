{\an4}I had to work fast, but I

underwater, it can't
propel itself.

00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:37,777
{\an1}The only reason we're
moving is that the current
is still pulling us.

And that means there
could be a path that
leads up to the surface.

{\an1}and wait for the

{\an1}Hmm...

inhabitants.

{\an1}Are they... pirates?

{\an1}But what happened to all

{\an1}It says here that several
decades ago, those pirates

00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:03,006
{\an1}So they all just lived
down here quietly for
decades. How very sad.

153
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,517
{\an1}What are you doing?

154
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:21,657
{\an1}I, Naruto Uzumaki, will
get justice for their
pain and suffering!

155
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,061
{\an4}Captain Yamato! We don't
have a choice, here. We
have to go confront that
pirate.

156
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:28,664
Mm.

157
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,806

158
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,576
{\an1}It won't work. The wire
is frayed. It's not
functioning.

159
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:47,614
{\an5}We need some way up.
We're in a volcanic
crater. It's a long
way to the top.

160
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:49,949
{\an1}Aw, man.

161
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,686
{\an1}Hmm? What's this?
The rock's warm.

162
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:59,558
{\an4}It seems that beneath
here... there's an
underground hot
spring system.

163
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:03,829
{\an1}That's right! Captain
Yamato was soaking in it
a while ago!

164
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,497
{\an1}It's pretty massive!

170
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:21,944
{\an1}Not now! The hot
springs... and floating...

171
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:26,616
{\an1}And... wood style
submarine...

Huh?!

173
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,786
{\an1}I've got it!

174

{\an1}Uh... You've got what...?

175
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,891
{\an1}Just hear me out. And
don't laugh, okay?

176
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:37,526
{\an1}Right... now, this
is my plan.

All right!

188
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,165
{\an1}It's time to set sail!

all the islanders.
