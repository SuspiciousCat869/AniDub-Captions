00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,268
{\an1}I'm not like you guys.

2
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:19,974
{\an1}I don't wanna sever
any of my bonds or have

3
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,809
{\an1}them cut off, either!

4
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:25,679
{\an1}Shouldn't have cut
my link to Ten Tails.

[roar]

00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,787
Now disappear!

11
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,563
{\an1}Hey, we're safe!

12
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,800
{\an1}If we didn't have Naruto's
Chakra Cloak, we'd be

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,268
{\an1}crisper than a roast pig!

14
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,479
The next round!

15
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:04,881
{\an1}[attacking yell]

00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,265
{\an1}Huh!? He's gone!

20
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,935
{\an1}But where did he go?!

21
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,404
{\an1}He just disappeared!
Escaped right out of here!

22
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,873
{\an1}That's impossible! Find him!

{\an1}Naruto, above you!

24
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,916
{\an1}Naruto, you're only
fighting defensively

25
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,817
{\an1}now, protecting everyone.

26
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,057
Is there any
meaning to all of this?

27
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,793
{\an1}You okay, Naruto? It's too
much for you to control the

28
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,229
chakra I gave
you all at once.

29
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,063
You'll wear out
right away!

30
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:05,199
{\an1}Plus it looks like Ten Tails
is changing its chakra!

31
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,767
Be careful!

32
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,239
{\an1}You're only growing weaker.

33
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:15,274
{\an1}I bet that you can't
understand, since

34
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:17,375
you just wanna
be alone.

35
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:20,212
{\an1}But the truth is, it
actually makes me feel super

36
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:24,082
{\an1}happy to have everybody with
me, right here by my side!

37
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,018
{\an1}Just seeing them all
gives me strength!

38
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:31,855
He ran off?!

39
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:35,324
{\an1}If the pain of your
comrades' deaths

40
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,794
{\an1}is part of your bond
then there's really

41
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:40,096
{\an1}no need to protect
them, is there?

42
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,632
{\an1}What the hell, you sniveling
bastard?! That's exactly the

43
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,700
{\an1}kind of thing that
I hate about you!

44
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:48,435
{\an1}That's not what I'm
talking about, idiot! I'm

45
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,471
{\an1}saying I can endure
any amount of pain if it

46
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,338
{\an1}involves my comrades.

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,875
{\an1}I mean that I don't
want to give them up!

48
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,510
{\an1}It might seem selfish of me.

49
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,315
{\an1}But still, it's even more
painful for me not to have

50
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,984
{\an1}my comrades in here!

51
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,585
Get it?!

52
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:13,124
{\an1}Obito, what are you trying
to confirm through Naruto?

53
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,625
[chuckle]

54
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,032

55
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,102
{\an1}There's no mistake.

56
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:30,572
This chakra!

{\an1}Dad, it's collapsing!

[defiant roar]

63

{\an1}Damn it! It fought off the
Mountain Jutsu enhanced

64
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:01,098
{\an1}with Naruto's chakra!

65
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,633
{\an1}But there's no other
jutsu that can stop it any

66
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,168
{\an1}better, right, dad?

67
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:13,308
{\an1}Bad news, Naruto! Ten Tails
is planning a Cataclysm!

68
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,143
{\an1}Huh?! Cata-what now?

69
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,377
What's that?!

70
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,647
{\an1}Stop wasting time! The
land will be ripped apart!

[angry roar]

72
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,622
{\an1}Because you've severed the
link between the Ten Tails

73
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,858
and me, it can't
be controlled now.

74
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,560
Though I suppose
it's about time to

75
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,428
{\an1}become its Jinchuriki.

76
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,382
Now the real
fun begins!

77
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:07,087
{\an1}This time, I'll make
Ten Tails disappear!

78
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:08,789
Kamui!

79
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,392
You were waiting
for your chance.

80
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,159
{\an1}But then, so was I...

85
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,935
Here it comes!

[angry roaring]

00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,090
It's fading!

94
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:55,465
{\an1}Nice try acting tough, but
this is your limit. You've

95
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,366
{\an1}given me something
to look forward to

96
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,835
{\an1}but now I think it's
time you made your exit.

97
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,009
{\an1}Everyone! Let's join
together and fight as one!

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,577
Thanks, Hinata!

103
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,473
{\an1}[chuckle] So there is
still doubt in your

104
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,573
{\an1}heart, is there?

105
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:47,342
{\an1}You've had several
chances to kill me if

106
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,843
{\an1}you'd wanted to.

107
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,177
Here's another!

108
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:55,349
{\an1}It's pathetic that you
of all people would feel

109
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:59,685
{\an1}compassion toward an enemy
in the midst of battle.

110
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:02,054
Is it your
guilty conscience?

111
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:05,224
{\an1}Are you feeling remorse
because you couldn't

112
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:10,194
keep Rin safe or
your promise to me?

113
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,034
{\an1}Are you hoping I'll
have a change of heart?

114
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:22,905
{\an1}Obito, won't you stop this?

115
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:27,176
{\an1}Your dream long ago
was to become Hokage.

116
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:30,513
{\an1}Naruto has the same dream.

117
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,284
{\an1}Naruto's words are exactly
what you used to say.

118
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,585
[chuckle]

119
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,987
{\an1}I'm the future Hokage!

120
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,787
Obito Uchiha!

121
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,824
I'm gonna get my
trademark goggles as

122
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:45,892
{\an1}well as my Sharingan
carved into my Great

123
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:49,094
{\an1}Stone Face for all to see!

124
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,097
{\an1}My dream is to be
the greatest Hokage!

125
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,665
{\an1}Then the village will stop
disrespecting me and treat

126
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:57,201
{\an1}me like I'm somebody!
Somebody important!

127
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,837
{\an1}You've unconsciously been
trying to merge your past

128
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,139
self with the
current Naruto.

129
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:07,477
{\an1}You've been hearing the
old you in Naruto's words.

130
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,581
{\an1}Perhaps you secretly
wish to be repudiated

131
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,115
{\an1}by your old self?

132
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,050
I'm certain you
must understand

133
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,419
{\an1}Naruto's feelings!

134
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:22,123
{\an1}You can still go back
to the person you were!

135
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,690
[chuckling]

136
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,726
[laughter]

137
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:32,431
{\an1}It's because I understand
Naruto's mind very well that

138
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:37,268
I want to negate
everything that he desires!

139
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,937
Obito...

140
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,072
{\an1}And one more thing...

141
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,975
{\an1}What you're feeling guilty
about in regards to me is

142
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,244
{\an1}itself presumptuous.

143
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,680
{\an1}If you think I started
this war over just

144
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:53,015
{\an1}you and Rin, to call
you misdirected would

145
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,884
{\an1}be a big understatement!

146
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,057
{\an1}I already know everything.

147
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,725
[gasp]

148
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,797
{\an1}I know Rin deliberately ran
into your Lightning Blade.

149
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,499
{\an1}That she chose to die.

150
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:20,339
{\an1}Back then, Rin was kidnapped
by the Hidden Mist and

151
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,708
{\an1}forced to become the
Three Tails' Jinchuriki.

152
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:26,777
{\an1}You successfully rescued Rin
and got her out, but that

153
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:30,214
{\an1}was part of the Hidden
Mist's plan all along.

154
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,550
{\an1}They even pretended to
pursue you in order to drive

155
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,884
{\an1}you home faster.

156
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,855
How did you...

157
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:47,495
{\an1}[grunt] Damn it!

158
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,299
{\an1}All of you stay here.

159
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,801
{\an1}Captain, let's wait
for reinforcements.

160
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,370
{\an1}There's no time...

161
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,473
{\an1}The Hidden Mist kidnapped
Rin to use her as some kind

162
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,806
{\an1}of test subject...

163
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,975
{\an1}If she's taken to the Blood
Mist Village, we'll never

164
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,077
{\an1}get her back out again.

165
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,313
{\an1}But you can't do this alone.

166
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,780
{\an1}I won't be alone.

167
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,349
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu!

168
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,254
{\an1}Can you pick up Rin's scent?

169
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,956
{\an1}I remember it. I'm on it.

170
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,759
{\an1}When the reinforcements
arrive, tell them that we

171
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,960
went after Rin.

172
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,462
Of course, sir.

173
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:36,637
{\an1}Hang on, Rin! I will
protect you, I promise!

174
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,120
It's a shinobi
from the Leaf!

175
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:15,270
{\an1}You three just wait here.

176
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:17,938
She's this way!

177
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,084
Rin!

178
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,056
They put her
under a genjutsu.

179
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,057
Release!

180
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,562
Kakashi!

181
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,565
C'mon, Let's
get out of here!

182
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:53,370
[gasp]

183
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:54,937
Leaf shinobi!

184
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,438
{\an1}They have the captive!

185
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,905
Hurry!

186
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,108
{\an1}Don't let them get away!

187
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,920
{\an1}Go! We'll create a
diversion to distract

188
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:15,888
{\an1}the enemy from you.

189
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,790
Thank you.

190
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:17,757
Save it.

191
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,393
If we're driven
into a corner, we'll

192
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:21,359
{\an1}make a run for it, too.

193
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,195
{\an1}Now let's go, Rin.

194
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:25,896
Kakashi...

195
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,999
{\an1}I feel very strange.

196
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,236
{\an1}We'll deal with it
after we escape.

197
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:33,370
Scatter!

198
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,940
{\an1}I can feel something...

199
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,711
{\an1}It feels as if there's
someone, or something

200
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:43,078
else inside me.

201
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,080
{\an1}What do you mean?!

202
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,448
I don't know...

203
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:47,616
There they are!

204
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,116
Stop them!

205
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,451
[gasps]

206
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:52,319
{\an1}We have to get past them!

207
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:01,226
{\an1}Those Mist shinobi
tried to perform some

208
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,662
{\an1}kind of ritual on me.

209
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,831
{\an1}It was a special ritual.

210
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:07,433
But then I lost
consciousness and I...

211
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,201
[gasp]

212
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,772
{\an1}They sure are persistent!

213
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:16,774
Huh?!

214
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,608
{\an1}I can't return to the Leaf!

215
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,343
{\an1}What are you talking about?!

216
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:23,245
{\an1}Kakashi, you have
to kill me now!

217
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,947
{\an1}What are you saying, Rin?!

218
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,183
{\an1}The Hidden Mist is using me.

219
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:30,418
{\an1}At this rate, I might end up
attacking the Hidden Leaf!

220
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:33,354
{\an1}I promised Obito that I
would protect you! I can't

221
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,789
{\an1}do what you're asking!

222
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,425
{\an1}There's got to be
some other way!

223
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,327
We just need to
reach the village!

224
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,862
No, Kakashi...

225
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,429
I'll stop them!

226
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:45,565
Go!

227
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,033
I can't!

228
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,408
{\an1}Once Rin made it back inside
the Leaf the Hidden Mist

229
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:59,977
{\an1}intended to make the
Three Tails rampage

230
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,445
{\an1}and attack the village.

231
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,117
[gasp]

232
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,392
{\an1}Rin knew about this and took
advantage of the Lightning

233
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,294
Blade you aimed
at the enemy...

234
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:22,964
{\an1}...to commit suicide.

235
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,802
{\an1}She decided to die at the
hands of someone she loved

236
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,437
{\an1}to protect the Hidden Leaf.

237
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:37,108
{\an1}No matter what words you say,
to me, the you who could not

238
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,577
{\an1}protect Rin is an imposter.

239
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:43,581
To me, Rin is
someone not meant to die.

240
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,885
{\an1}So the dead Rin is
also an imposter.

241
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,086
{\an1}Rin is only Rin, alive!

242
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:55,791
{\an1}The shinobi system, the
village, shinobi themselves.

243
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:58,426
They created
these circumstances.

244
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,430
{\an1}What caused me to despair
is this world itself, this

245
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:03,932
{\an1}counterfeit world!

246
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,569
{\an1}Don't you remember
Naruto's words?

247
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:11,772
{\an1}That it's most painful not
to have real comrades

248
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:13,640
{\an1}inside one's heart?

249
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:18,410
{\an1}I quoted to him exactly
what you said long ago.

250
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:21,380
I know that the
old you would have

251
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,915
{\an1}resonated with that.

252
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:25,583
{\an1}I still believe the
current you, can as well--!

253
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:26,751
Look at me!

254
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:30,253
{\an1}There's nothing in my heart!

255
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:33,256
I don't feel
pain any longer.

256
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,758
[gasp]

257
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,360
{\an1}There's no need to feel
guilty, Kakashi. This hole

258
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,964
was opened up by
this world of hell.

259
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:46,936
{\an1}I only had pain inside here
before. But really, what's

260
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,336
{\an1}the meaning in that?

261
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,438
{\an1}So I abandoned it all.

262
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:54,408
{\an1}Meanwhile you have
suffered all this time.

263
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,009
{\an1}At Rin's grave...

264
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:57,844
{\an1}...and mine as well.

265
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,481
Kakashi...

266
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,617
It's okay now.

267
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,519
{\an1}You don't need to
suffer anymore.

268
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,254
{\an1}Rin's right here.

269
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:11,556
{\an1}And I love you, Kakashi.

270
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:15,726
Along with your
ideal version of me.

271
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,828
{\an1}I'm the future Hokage!

272
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,563
{\an1}Wish for whatever you want.

273
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:24,000
{\an1}Anything is possible in
this Genjutsu World.

274
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:27,302
{\an1}That hole in your heart
can be filled immediately.

275
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,741
Rin is gone. And
you're still alive!

276
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,813
{\an1}Do you think such things can
fill the hole in your heart?

277
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,417
Don't erase the
memories of the real Rin!

278
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,519
Rin sacrificed
herself in order to

279
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:48,787
{\an1}protect the village!

280
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:53,224
{\an1}You can try all you want to
fill it with delusions...

281
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:56,095
{\an1}But that hole in your
heart won't go away!

282
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,061
{\an1}[determined roar]

283
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,647
{\an1}It's transforming again!

284
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,034
{\an1}What's your issue with a
Genjutsu World? Reality is

285
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,870
{\an1}cruel. This hole is
only going to get bigger.

286
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:08,607
{\an1}Things don't always go the
way you want them. Nor does

287
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,209
{\an1}help always arrive in time.

288
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:13,678
{\an1}Just like how it was
with me! How I couldn't

289
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:14,545
{\an1}get there in time!

290
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:18,548
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Something to
Fill the Hole."

291
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:21,651
{\an1}Don't you agree, Kakashi?
