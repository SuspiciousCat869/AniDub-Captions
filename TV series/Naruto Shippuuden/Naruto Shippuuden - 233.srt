1
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,980
{\an1}It's been so long since
we traveled by land.

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,919
{\an1}Nothing's better than
solid ground under your
feet.

3
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,889
{\an4}There's no doubt about
it, this hot blood of
mine is bonded to the
land.

4
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,525
{\an1}Hey, Guy! It's only till we
reach the next harbor.

5
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:32,233
{\an4}Uh... About that... Can't
we change our plans and
go to the Land of
Lightning by foot?

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:37,439
No, I don't think so.
Because right now we're
in the Land of Water.

7
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:42,244
{\an4}<i>This area is made up of</i>
<i>islands, both large and</i>
<i>small. They aren't</i>
<i>actually connected to the</i>

8
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,447
{\an1}<i>Land of Lightning. </i>

9
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:49,754
Oh... It's just... the
thought of getting on a
boat again...

10
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:51,122
{\an1}[laughing]

11
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:54,258
{\an1}Are we still that far
from the Land of
Lightning?

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,663
{\an1}Mm-hmm. We've only
traveled a quarter of
the way there.

13
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:03,002
Oh, by the way, I
overheard something back
there at the harbor.

14
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:05,570
{\an1}There may be
impostors here.

15
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:08,708
{\an1}Impostors...? What
impostors?!

16
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:09,509
[gasping]

17
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:21,488
{\an4}Hold it right there! I
have nothing against you.
You can just call this a
twist of fate, if you like.

18
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:25,694
But I'm going to be
taking everything that
you own!

19
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,696
{\an1}What?! Who are you?!

20
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:28,998
{\an1}Huh?!

21
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,432
{\an1}<i>That headband...</i>

22
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,668
{\an1}That's right!

23
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:36,372
{\an1}I'm the great ninja who
kicked the Akatsuki out
of the Leaf Village!

24
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:41,578
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki! That's
who you're lookin' at
right here!

25
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,149
[chuckling]

26
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,354
{\an1}It looks like he
just arrived.

27
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:53,726
{\an1}Who did? You mean the
impostor you talked
about?

28
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,694
{\an1}Yeah. That's right.

29
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:58,397
<i>He's supposed to</i>
<i>be Naruto? </i>

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,937
[laughing]

31
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,805
He looks just like you!

32
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,041
{\an1}He does not!

33
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:10,343
{\an1}Hey! How dare you ignore
me! It's not funny!

34
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,213
{\an1}Oh, good grief...

35
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:16,852
{\an4}Listen, if you're Naruto
Uzumaki of the Hidden
Leaf, then who the hell
am I supposed to be?!

36
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,186
{\an3}Huh?

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,124
You mean that... you
don't even know your
own name?

38
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,060
{\an3}Hm?

39
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,929
{\an1}<i>How come you have Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf headbands, too? </i>

40
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,999
Don't tell me...

41
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:33,203
{\an1}I'm the real deal! I am
Naruto!

42
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,071
{\an3}No!

43
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:35,839
{\an1}Really! It's true!

44
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:40,577
{\an4}This is hilarious. Someone
impersonating Naruto. I
guess that's the price
you pay for fame!

45
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,981
{\an1}So who exactly are you,
impostor?

46
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,883
I'm... well, you see--

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,923
{\an7}<i>Hold on... If I can beat</i>
<i>this guy right here and</i>
<i>now... </i>

48
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,925
Right! Let's do this!

49
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:57,730
{\an1}You and I are going to
duke it out now to see
who the real Naruto is!

50
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,900
{\an1}Quit talking nonsense,
would ya?!

51
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:04,038
{\an1}Hey, Naruto, do your best,
'cause if you lose, we're
gonna make him the real Naruto.

52
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:05,273
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,610
{\an1}Guess I have no choice.

54
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:10,878
[growling]

55
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,338
{\an1}"Naruto's Impostor"

56
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,075
[grunting]

57
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:10,179
You're all talk! That
didn't even count as a
warm-up in my book!

58
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:12,115
{\an1}We'll be taking this.

59
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:17,387
{\an4}But what'll we do with
him? After all, you know,
we are in a hurry to get
where we're going.

60
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:20,624
{\an1}What, this guy? Let's
just toss him and forget
about it!

61
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:25,596
{\an5}If he gets away and
starts trouble again,
then your reputation
will take a hit.

62
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,933
{\an1}You're right, that is a
problem...

63
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,169
<i>Hey! </i>

64
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:33,405
Wait, wait!
[panting]

65
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:35,941
{\an1}And... just who are you?

66
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:39,511
{\an1}My name's Iggy and I've
been after this thief for
a while now.

67
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:40,981
What, really?

68
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:42,383
{\an1}Yeah.

69
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,752
{\an1}The only ones who've been
brave enough to stand up
to him are myself...

70
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,755
{\an1}And maybe you
guys, I guess.

71
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,396
{\an4}Do you know who this is? He's
Naruto Uzumaki, the thief
that everyone's afraid
of!

72
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:57,432
{\an1}No! He's not Naruto
Uzumaki!

73
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,800
{\an3}Huh?

74
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,802
And how would you know
that?

75
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:03,505
{\an1}Why do you think?!

76
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,610
{\an1}'Cause I'm the real me! I
am Naruto Uzumaki!

77
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:09,380
{\an1}You're... the real
Naruto?!

78
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:13,550
{\an1}Yeah, and that guy's
some jerk using my name
and robbing people.

79
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:17,688
{\an4}If you're chasing the
thief, then does that mean
you're an officer of the
law?

80
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,191
{\an1}I suppose you could say
that...

81
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:24,662
{\an1}Then why don't we just leave
this to him. We should be
on our way, anyway.

82
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,499
Okay. Sounds good.

83
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:31,471
{\an1}Listen, you sure you
can handle that guy?

84
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,806
{\an1}<i>You don't really</i>
<i>look strong enough.</i>

85
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,344
I don't appreciate
what you're implying. I
may not look it,

86
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:41,081
But I am Iggy, the ninja
master!

87
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:49,324
{\an5}Are you serious? You're
actually that strong? I
guess looks can be
deceiving...

88
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,592
{\an1}Great! We'll leave it to
you, then.

89
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,295
Okay, let's
get going.

90
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,134
{\an1}Real nice.

91
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,735
I'm sorry, partner.

92
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:00,837
{\an1}[grunting]

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,939
{\an1}You idiot!

94
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:07,044
{\an1}What if you were killed,
huh? What then? Are you
stupid or something?!

95
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:11,682
{\an1}At first I was just gonna
beat him up. But you
heard, right?

96
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:15,053
{\an1}Of all the luck! The real
Naruto Uzumaki.

97
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:20,158
{\an1}Yeah. I never expected
to encounter the real one
here, of all places.

98
00:07:20,393 --> 00:07:25,765
{\an4}But! You're still an idiot!
And no more excuses,
Banna! Just stick to the
plan!

99
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:30,070
{\an7}<i>You play the</i>

<i>you up to build up my</i>
<i>reputation! </i>

100
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:35,809
{\an4}War is about to break
out! And I have to do all
this to make everyone see
that I'm a great ninja!

101
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:40,348
{\an4}And by beating Naruto
Uzumaki, I'll make a name
for myself without a
doubt!

102
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:43,519
{\an1}[panting]

103
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:47,590
I already know all
that... But, Iggy...

104
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:51,193
Shouldn't we just stop
doing dangerous stuff
like this?

105
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:52,562
{\an1}You jerk!

106
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:55,198
{\an1}Have you forgotten what
you owe me?

107
00:07:55,232 --> 00:08:00,070
{\an4}If it weren't for me,
you'd still be all alone,
crying your eyes out,
isn't that right?

108
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,639
Yeah... I'm sorry.

109
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:06,978
{\an1}You know, Iggy, you're
really my only friend in
the whole wide world.

110
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:11,150
{\an7}But next time, let's find
someone weaker that even
we can defeat.

111
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,784
[grunting]

112
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:13,652
[grunting]

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,490
{\an1}Someone that even we can
defeat?!

114
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:22,695
{\an4}A Naruto Uzumaki or
even two of them would
be a piece of cake for
me!

115
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,232
{\an1}Aw, I'm sorry, Iggy...

116
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,235
{\an1}Mmm? Hmph.

117
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,806
{\an1}Just forget it... It's
okay.

118
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:41,183
{\an4}So is it really true that
Naruto Uzumaki has been
robbing people around
these parts?

119
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,352
Yep, it's true.

120
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:47,957
{\an8}There have been quite a
few victims. They say
he's a giant with a
reddish face.

121
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,462
{\an7}But why would Naruto
Uzumaki stoop to robbery
here?

122
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,500
Isn't he some kind of
hero in his village?

123
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:03,374
{\an4}I don't know the details,
but there are also rumors
that his village considered
him a nuisance.

124
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,877
{\an1}Maybe he's become a Rogue
Ninja...

125
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,416
{\an1}If he's a deserter, then
the Hidden Leaf must be
after him too.

126
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,720
{\an4}If we capture
him, they're sure
to pay us very
handsomely.

127
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:18,225
Yeah, but can we do it?
They say he's good.

128
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:23,231
{\an1}Relax. From what I hear,
he didn't even pass the
Chunin Exam.

129
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:26,567
{\an1}That hero stuff's
probably just
exaggeration.

130
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:32,574
{\an4}Gotcha. But what it boils
down to is this: for
Mercenary Ninja like us,
he means money.

131
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,009
Exactly.

132
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:44,187
{\an4}You know, considering how
strong I am as a ninja, I
really shouldn't even
have to do this...

133
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,228
{\an4}Come one, come all! Try
your luck! I'll preserve
the peace for my people
and for the entire world!

134
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:54,633
{\an1}I'm called the great
Iggy! I'm the best on
the earth!

135
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,002
That's right, Iggy!
You're so cool!

136
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:02,007
{\an5}When you get serious,
you're really strong! I
bet you could fight in
any war anytime!

137
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,076
{\an1}Damn right I can!

138
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,280
{\an1}Forget farming. I'm going
to be a war hero!

139
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:09,915
{\an1}Here, put this on.

140
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,022
{\an1}Now you're Naruto Uzumaki
again.

141
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,335
{\an1}<i>Look there, Banna. I</i>
<i>mean, Naruto. </i>

142
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:32,041
{\an1}Our next targets. There's
no way you can lose to
peddlers like them.

143
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,242
{\an1}Nope.

144
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:36,146
{\an1}Okay! Here I go!

145
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:41,719
Huh?

146
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,555
Hold it right there!

147
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:49,293
{\an5}I have nothing against
you. You can just call
this a simple twist of
fate.

148
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:55,500
{\an4}But I, Naruto Uzumaki, am
gonna be taking
everything that you guys
own!

149
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,605
{\an1}You said Naruto Uzumaki?

150
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,177
{\an1}Good! Just put everything
down like that and leave!

151
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,182
{\an1}Wha-?!

152
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:09,650
{\an1}What the hell??

153
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:12,520
{\an1}Those guys aren't
peddlers! They're some
kind of ninja!

154
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,356
{\an1}This is just perfect!

155
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,023
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki...

156
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:18,360
{\an1}I can't believe he came
to us!

157
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:19,627
[grunting]

158
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,730
{\an1}Capture him!

159
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,331
{\an1}Oh, no!

160
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,068

164
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:36,913
{\an5}Wait! You've got it
wrong! He's not Naruto
Uzumaki! He's just Banna,
a petty thief!

165
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,483
{\an3}What?

166
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:42,887
{\an4}But he looks just like
the rumors describe him.
And has a Hidden Leaf
headband.

167
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,557
{\an1}Oh. That's because...
Uh...

168
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:48,394
{\an1}Who are you? His partner
or something?

169
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:51,363
{\an1}Interfere and we'll get
rid of you, too.

170
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,733
{\an1}No, I, uh...

171
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,200
<i>He's lying! </i>

172
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:59,172
{\an1}I am Naruto Uzumaki! That
guy's no my partner of
mine!

173
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,676
{\an8}He's just a low-class
farmer from a small
mountain village!

174
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,580
{\an8}He hates farming, so he
pretends to be a ninja!

175
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:10,918
{\an1}<i>He thinks capturing me is</i>
<i>his ticket to fame!</i>
<i>That's why he's here! </i>

176
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,154
{\an7}<i>Banna...</i>

177
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:14,589
Heh. A ninja wannabe.

178
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:18,260
{\an1}Just stay out of the way.
Or we'll take care of
you, too!

179
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:19,529
Uh--

{\an1}What do I do?

184

{\an1}What do I do?!

185
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:46,927
Ahhhhh...

186
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,563
{\an1}Finally, I'm not hungry
anymore!

[chuckling]

188
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,133
Well, we'd better get
going.

189
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,936
{\an1}Wait, wait! Please wait!

190
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:55,937
{\an1}Hmm?

191
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:02,510
{\an1}Thank goodness I found
you.

192
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,646
What's the matter now?

193
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,619
{\an4}Well, I hate to say
this,... but some other
thieves took the thief
you left in my custody.

194
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:12,187
They did what?!

195
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:16,992
{\an1}So I have to ask you...
Can you do me a huge favor
and get the thief back?

196
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:21,164
{\an5}I thought you were a
master ninja! Can't you
just get him back
yourself?

197
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:26,570
{\an1}Oh, yeah, sure, normally
I could... I'm just kinda
out of shape right now.

198
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:29,206
{\an1}A ninja's always supposed
to be in shape.

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,477
{\an1}I'm sorry, but we have
urgent business to attend
to.

200
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:38,584
{\an4}Besides, aren't you an
officer of the law? Why
not go back to your
headquarters and get backup?

201
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,720
{\an1}Uh! Well, I--

202
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,859
{\an7}Does it really matter if
a thief has caught a thief?
Sounds to me like they're
birds of a feather.

203
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,494
You reap what you sow,
after all.

204
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:50,264
{\an1}No, you don't understand;
it's not like that!

205
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:55,403
{\an7}He may've done some bad
things, but he really
isn't a bad person.

206
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,704
What?

207
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,406
{\an1}<i>You see...</i>

208
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:03,111
{\an4}Because of his looks and
size, people never really
liked him; they were
scared of him.

209
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:07,216
{\an1}He was such a weakling,
too, but kind-hearted.

210
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,619
{\an1}He's good at taking care
of people.

211
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,622
You sure do know a lot
about this guy.

212
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,324
{\an1}Huh...? Oh, yes, I...

213
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:17,327
{\an1}Look, are you actually an
officer of the law at
all?

214
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,097
{\an1}I've had my suspicions
about you from the very
start.

215
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,567
Mmm.

216
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:27,940
{\an1}All right. I'll be honest
with you. I'll tell you
everything...

217
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:34,948
{\an1}So that's it...

218
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,449
What were you thinking?

219
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:38,618
How could you do
something so stupid?

220
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:44,090
{\an4}Please! Just help me!
You're the hero who saved
the Hidden Leaf Village,
right?

221
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:48,830
{\an5}You know what I don't
get? If you're his
friend, how could you let
him do this?

222
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:53,468
{\an4}I mean, if you're truly
his friend, then why didn't
you give more thought to
his well-being?!

223
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,403
{\an1}If he's my friend...?

224
00:14:55,437 --> 00:15:00,610
{\an7}Come on, give me a break.
He's hardly someone that
I'd call a friend.

225
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:05,782
{\an7}That brainless oaf... We
only stayed together
because it was
convenient.

226
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:07,584
{\an1}He's not a friend at all.

227
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,622
{\an1}"He's not a friend at
all," huh?

228
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,597
{\an1}What's the big idea?

229
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:24,003
All right, then tell me:
just what is he to you?

230
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:28,908
{\an5}Because I don't buy it.
Maybe you really don't
believe that he's that
smart.

231
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:34,147
{\an7}But still... haven't
the two of you been
together since you were
both just children?

232
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,285
{\an7}All that time, you've
survived together! Don't
you consider that being
friends?!

233
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:41,756
{\an1}Mmm.

234
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:42,957
Naruto...

235
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,659

00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,668
Right... Got it...

240
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:57,473
{\an1}If we had time, we'd help
you. But that's not
possible right now.

241
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,308
{\an1}Huh?!

242
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:04,180
{\an4}And besides, at this
time, we cannot afford to
have our identities and
our whereabouts known.

243
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,284
You're going to have to
forget that you ever saw
us here.

[sniffling]

287
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,803
{\an1}Come out, Naruto Uzumaki!

288
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,840
{\an1}There's no escape, now!

289
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:29,010
{\an1}Come on, Banna, let's
show them what we can do
one last time.

290
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:29,878
{\an1}Yeah!

291
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:33,348
{\an1}Wherever you go, I'll
go, Iggy!

292
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:33,715
{\an3}Now!

293
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,251
{\an1}All right!

294
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,522
[grunting]

295
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,024
You losers!

296
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:44,027
{\an1}You really think skills
that lame will beat us?!

297
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:47,865
{\an1}Take Naruto Uzumaki
alive! Kill the other
one.

298
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:53,238
{\an4}I'm sorry, Iggy. If I
were strong like the real
Naruto, I could keep you
safe...

299
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:54,973
No, Banna.

300
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:57,542
{\an1}Go on! Run!

301
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:59,211
{\an3}Banna!

302
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:00,880
{\an1}Thank you...

303
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,217
{\an1}...for saying that I'm
your best friend.

304
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,584
[crying]

305
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,287
{\an1}Die!

306
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,256
Banna!

307
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,393
{\an1}What?

308
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:14,794
Heh-heh.

309
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,164
{\an1}What a pair you are.

310
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:17,932
What...?!

311
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,167
You came back!

312
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,669
We should apologize.

313
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,707
{\an4}But we simply didn't
believe you earlier when
you told us your story,
Iggy.

314
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:28,810
{\an1}So we decided to put you
to a test.

315
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,013
What? A test?

316
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:34,350
{\an1}And you passed it! Right
now, I am completely
moved!

317
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:38,855
You stuck by your best
friend! You put all your
faith in friendship!

318
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,027
{\an1}Hey, listen up! Don't you
recognize who this person
is standing here?

319
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,867
{\an1}This guy is the hero who
saved the Hidden Leaf
Village! Naruto Uzumaki!

320
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,801
[gasping]

321
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:53,838
{\an1}Better shape up! You're
Naruto Uzumaki now.

322
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:54,974
{\an1}Naruto...

323
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,844
{\an1}Yeah! You are the hero of
justice! Naruto Uzumaki!

324
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:05,752
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki is gonna
go on the rampage of a
lifetime!

325
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:06,920

<i>[yelling]</i>

327
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:19,134
{\an4}You can have your name
back, Naruto. It's way
too heavy a burden for me
to bear.

328
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,970
{\an1}Thank you, Naruto.

329
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:25,941
Don't mention it. But
what are you guys going
to do now?

330
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,045
Are you still gonna
try to become a
ninja for hire, Iggy?

331
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,848
{\an1}Nah. I doubt it.

332
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:35,353
If this is how scary it
is, I don't think this
is for me.

333
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:38,356
{\an1}I'm gonna go home and earn a
more honest living.

334
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:41,926
{\an7}Yeah, and I'm going to go
wherever Iggy is going to
go.

335
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,428
{\an1}I see.

336
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:47,632
{\an1}Well, I hope you stay best
friends forever!

{\an1}Thank you
for everything!

340
