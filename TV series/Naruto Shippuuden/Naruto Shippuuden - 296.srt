<i>(Announcer)</i>
<i>Ninja Network News!</i>

2
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,765
Good evening. I'm
Mabui of the Cloud.

3
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,903
I'm Shikaku Nara.

4
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:23,681
And today we'll be bringing you
the latest updates & breaking
news from the various
battlefronts via satellite.

5
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:29,793
But first, here are some
highlights from the battles
that continue to rage on
the frontlines:

6
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:35,304
<i>On the desert front, the stand</i>
<i>off continues between Gaara's</i>
<i>4th Company & the reanimated</i>
<i>Kage.</i>

7
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:41,917
<i>On the coastal front, Darui &</i>
his 1st Company sustained heavy
<i>losses when the enemy summoned</i>
<i>a giant humanoid.</i>

8
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:44,990
<i>But they eliminated most</i>
<i>of the enemy force.</i>

9
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:49,533
The Third Company under Kakashi
is sealing away the Ninja
Swordsmen one after another.

10
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:55,812
The Company has split into
smaller units and expanded
their range to take down
the remaining enemies.

11
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:59,352
<i>Mifune's Fifth Company</i>
<i>has joined up with the</i>
<i>Commando Unit.</i>

12
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:04,529
<i>Deidara's escape was</i>
<i>unexpected, but they</i>
<i>were successful in</i>
<i>recapturing him.</i>

13
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:08,003
Next, we have news
about White Zetsu.

14
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:12,478
His jutsu, with which
he mimics not only
someone's appearance but
also their charkra-

15
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:14,917
-has created chaos
within the Allied
Forces.

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,027
However, thanks to the
keen observations of
Sakura Haruno, a shinobi
with the Medical Unit...

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,937
Our genius strategist,
Shikaku, has been able to
draw up a strategy to
counter thst jutsu.

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,846
I'm, uh, refining the
strategy now... please
be patient just a
little longer...

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,486
Meanwhile, at the front,
Sakura has just begun a
press conference...

20
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:37,862
The purpose of which
is to get the word out
about White Zetsu.

21
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:41,837
<i>(Reporter)</i>
<i>I understand you received</i>
<i>a love letter, but rejected</i>
<i>it right away? Is that true?</i>

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,208
Uh, that's not what
this is about...

23
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:47,147
Is that the only
declaration of love
you've received?

24
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,418
Please, if we could
just focus....

25
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:52,391
<i>(Reporter)</i>
You reportedly said that you're
already in love with someone, so
<i>who is it you're in love with?</i>

26
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:55,832
<i>(Reporters)</i>
<i>[shouting out questions]</i>

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,539
What the hell does that
have to do with this
press conference!?

28
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:03,948
Wow, okay. Well, we were
supposed to run the
"Kosuke Kills" segment
in this time slot...

29
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,052
But we've received
an update just now.

30
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:11,162
According to this latest
news bulletin, the key
figures in the Fourth
Great Ninja War:

31
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:17,341
Killer Bee the Eight Tails, and
Naruto the Nine Tails, have
managed to persuade Lady
Tsunade and Lord Raikage...

32
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:20,047
...and at long last,
they are headed towards
the battle feild.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,386
<i>(Shikaku)</i>
<i>I'm amazed Naruto and</i>
<i>Bee convinced those two.</i>

34
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,326
The satellite link with
Naruto and Bee is ready.

35
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,966
We'll find out if
they're both excited
about joining the
war effort.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,672
Can you hear me,
Naruto? Are you there?

37
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:36,346
What just happened? Did
we lose the connection?

38
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,553
I wonder if the
equiptment could
be malfunctioning.

39
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:43,059
I'm not certain. Wait,
what was that? Okay.

40
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:46,366
Well, it seems we're
connected now.

41
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,171
Let's try this
again, are you
there, Naruto?

42
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:52,679
So, do I just talk
into this while I'm
running? Argh!

43
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:58,056
Hold on, stay put so the
camera can focus, and I'll
plant a kiss on ya, like
this! Mmmmmm!

44
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,293
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Hey! Outta my way!</i>

45
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,534
What in the world
are those two doing!?

46
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,573
Don't they know we're
still on the air!?

47
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:09,451
If Kisame's intel is correct,
Naruto now has the same
ability as Mito Uzumaki,

48
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,959
the wife of the First
Hokage, to sense the enemy.

49
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:17,635
Naruto will have no
choice, he'll have to
battle White Zetsu.

50
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,775
It's all going
according to plan...

51
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:26,152
Today, the Senju's Will of
Fire shall be extinguished.

52
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:30,895
(Lady Katsuyu)
The 2 Kage who block their
path and refuse to let
them by are:

53
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:33,333
Lord Raikage and
Lady Tsunade!

54
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,174
Demanding that they
let him pass Naruto
makes his move...

55
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:41,617
The indomitable Killer
Bee is quick to react,
as he jumps in to assist.

56
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:51,570
Then, shockingly, Lady Tsunade
...steps in to let them pass!
Causing Lord Raikage to bellow
out a roar of disapproval!

57
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:55,545
But then, the two suns
inside of Naruto
soften his heart...

58
00:05:55,578 --> 00:06:01,557
The lights of brotherly and
parental love burn so bright,
that they make the Raikage
squint!

59
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,965
And so, he relents and
lets Naruto and Killer
Bee go...

60
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:12,679
In an intense touching moment
between men, Lady Tsunade and
Lord Raikage agree to support
Naruto's decision!

61
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:16,152
Oh, wait, sorry!
Lady Tsunade
isn't a man.

62
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,691
I really don't know
what to say, I just
can't believe it!

63
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:21,964
To think that Lord
Raikage could be
persuaded like that...

64
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:23,466
Hmm.

65
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,172
Well, honestly I'm
not that surprised.

66
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:30,247
There's just
something about Naruto
that somehow makes the
impossible seem possible.

67
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,921
But, we might be playing
right into our enemy's
hands with this move...

68
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:38,396
Consider the enemy's
use of White Zetsu's
Transformation Jutsu.

69
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:42,170
It almost seems
deliberately chosen
to try to lure
Naruto out...

70
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:45,176
You're right. It
surely could be a
trap...

71
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,451
However, we have no
choice but to leave
this in Naruto's hands.

72
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:54,596
(Medical Ninja)
No one may approach
Lady Shizune's tent
right now!

73
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,271
Anyone making a move
toward it will be
considered an enemy!
So just stay put!

74
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,409
[groaning]

75
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,528
[grunt]

76
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:27,528
Everyone, stay put!
You must not move!

77
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:31,870
Sakura, come here for
a minute please. Take
a look at this genetic
profile data!

78
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,139
You got something?

79
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:38,282
It's even more like
Captain Yamato's than
it was at the Five
Kage Summit.

80
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:44,128
In other words, by now,
it's almost completely
identical to the First
Hokage's genetic profile.

81
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,232
So it has to
be true...

82
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,236
What are you
talking about?

83
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,510
How are all these
white things related
to the First Hokage?

84
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:56,285
All these white
Zetsu creatures are
essentially clones of
the First Hokage.

85
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,695
<i>Or, rather, since there</i>
<i>are so many of them, they</i>
<i>must be like plants.</i>

86
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,938
<i>Harvested and cultivated</i>
<i>from the First Hokage's</i>
<i>cells in order to make</i>
<i>mobile botanical clones.</i>

87
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:09,044
<i>They even use a weak</i>
<i>version of Wood Style!</i>

88
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:12,084
I still don't
get it.

89
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:17,227
But even if I don't, what
you're saying is that I'm
supposed to guard you against
plants, is that right?

90
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,801
Well then, how about you
two just use some termites.

91
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:26,412
Looking at this data, I think
Captain Yamato is being used
to make these clones stronger!
I'm sure of it!

92
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,650
<i>I'll notify HQ</i>
<i>immediately!</i>

93
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:35,397
I'm back. Those white beings
impersonating our troops are
causing havoc among them!

94
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,873
Perhaps it's too big a
coincidence, but I think
it's perfect timing to
let Naruto go.

95
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:41,409
I agree.

96
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:45,283
Sorry to jump in,
but we've received
a report from the
medical team.

97
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,054
It's data on those
white beings.

98
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:48,524
Let me see that!

99
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:56,238
Unbelievable! Madara and
Orochimaru's obsession
with the First Hokage has
created this?!

100
00:08:56,272 --> 00:09:00,548
Botanical Ninja created
from Grandfather's body.

101
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:05,591
This is proof that Madara
has posession of the First
Hokage's cells!

102
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:10,901
He's cultivated them and
developed a way to replicate
them, which means he's probably
used them on himself, too.

103
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:14,041
It's no wonder that
he's lived so long.

104
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:17,882
Well, do we have
any idea of how to
destroy him, then?

105
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,053
No, the opposite.

106
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:22,625
Now we have no idea
what will defeat him.

107
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm afraid it appears
that Madara really is
...immortal!

108
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,452
<i>(Shikaku)</i>
An immortal leader, his army of
<i>mobile plants and reanimated</i>
<i>zombies...</i>

109
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:40,293
There isn't a single
normal human being
among them!

110
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:45,638
We must notify Naruto and
Bee immediately about this
Transformation Jutsu.

111
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:53,787
<i>(Shikaku)</i>
<i>Naruto, Lord Bee,</i>
<i>please listen!</i>

112
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:58,129
<i>I am speaking telepathically</i>
<i>to you both at the same time.</i>

113
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:02,471
<i>Now, listen to me, I've</i>
<i>got intel for you on the</i>
<i>enemy's battle strategy.</i>

114
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,007
<i>Pay close attention.</i>

115
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:12,491
Oh. So that's what's
up with all the weird
fuzzy things that I've
been sensing...

116
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,698
Well, I guess that
I've got no choice
but to step up.

117
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:23,814
<i>Yes, but remember Madara needs</i>
<i>the Tailed Beasts that you and</i>
<i>Lord Bee host in order for his</i>
<i>project Tsuki no Me to work.</i>

118
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:27,555
<i>That means you two</i>
<i>are still his main</i>
<i>targets.</i>

119
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:31,897
I know, but trust me,
he won't capture me!

120
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,773
<i>Then don't even think about</i>
negotiating with him. You can't
<i>reason with him, Naruto.</i>

121
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:41,550
<i>(Shikaku)</i>
<i>Madara is different than</i>
<i>Nagato, he has no interest</i>
<i>in peace whatsoever!</i>

122
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,490
<i>He's a truly evil man</i>
<i>who covets the whole world.</i>

123
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:53,707
To control others, you
must possess the ability
to manipulate the
darkness in their souls.

124
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,748
Nagato just happened to
be easily influenced,
that's all.

125
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,386
Never compare
yourself to Nagato!

126
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,161
His methods were different
than mine, but he truly
wanted peace!

127
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:07,367
But you...
you're different!

128
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,973
[chuckle] No doubt.

129
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,643
[grunt]

130
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:16,318
That's really your
goal? To validate the
existance of the Uchiha?

131
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:20,828
Then why collect the
Tailed Beasts? What's
your true purpose, really?

132
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,965
Just what do
you want?!

133
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:31,716
Well, if I wanted
anything it would be,
to be a complete form.

134
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,662
And he's gonna control everyone
everywhere using genjutsu, isn't
that right? That's what this
project Tsuki no Me's all about?

135
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:42,905
<i>Yes. So make sure that</i>
<i>you don't hold back.</i>

136
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:49,586
A while ago I talked to
Madara in the Land of
Iron. He told me all about
the Uchiha Clan's destiny.

137
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:56,265
I know that he understands all
about hatred. He used Nagato and
he's the one who's manipulating
Sasuke's hatred, too.

138
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,503
(Naruto)
I know how
evil he is!

139
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:03,346
<i>He doesn't act upon hatred,</i>
<i>he simply takes advantage</i>
<i>of hatred.</i>

140
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,722
<i>He's different from other</i>
<i>enemies you've faced.</i>
<i>Be careful.</i>

141
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:12,765
It doesn't matter! I'm
stopping Madara, and I'm
stopping this war!

142
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:12,832
I'll act first, and
talk afterward.

143
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:19,979
<i>(Shikaku)</i>
<i>I don't know about</i>
<i>Kabuto, but Madara is</i>
<i>apparently immortal.</i>

144
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:25,023
<i>Also, there are those</i>
<i>mobile plants augmented</i>
<i>with the First Hokage's</i>
<i>cells...</i>

145
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:31,335
<i>And those otherworldly</i>
<i>zombies... Nothing works</i>
<i>against them except sealing.</i>
<i>It's an army of the undead.</i>

146
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:34,074
<i>Beware of them too!</i>

147
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,579
That's actually the
best news you can
give me, ya know?

148
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:39,652
'Cause it means that
I don't have to hold
back at all!

149
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,796
Huh? That's... Eff!

150
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:51,241
It's chaos out there
on the battlefield!
We've gotta get back and
defend the headquarters!

151
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:52,545
Rasengan!

152
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:53,446
Naruto!?

153
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:57,287
[groan]

154
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,938
Leave it all to
Naruto, here!

155
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:09,779
You tell me which ones
to attack and I'll get
on it just like that!

156
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,852
Everyone's an enemy!
Attack them all!

157
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,901
Let's do this,
Octopops! Come on!

158
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,878
Rasen-Rampage!

159
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,267
Rasen-Absorption!

160
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:49,759
(Thinking)
Naruto's attack is affecting
their Wood Style, they're
turning into trees!

161
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:53,199
(Thinking)
It's just like before.

162
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:12,170
You won't stop me that
easily! Now I won't be
so vulnerable to the
effects of your attack!

163
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,946
<i>(Thinking)</i>

Argh!!!

168
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,479
Alright! Yeah!!

169
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:37,320
You learned from the training
drills! Can I take some
credit for the kills?

170
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:43,633
My Shadow Clones and Mr.
Gamahiro can stay here
and stand watch over this
area! Now let's go!

171
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,906
I'm gonna hit every
one of the battlefields
at the same time!

172
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,714
All right! Multi-shadow
Cone Jutsu!

173
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,601
[running breaths]

174
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,611
It's no good! He
caught up to us!

175
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:08,416
Th- that's...!

176
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,923
That guy is a Cloud
Ninja who possesses
Kekkei Genkai!

177
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,494
Magnet Style Toroi!

178
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,902
You're telling me the
Hidden Cloud has a
Magnet Style user?

179
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:22,310
If and when he attacks,
you have to-- Argh!

180
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:23,914
[grunt]

181
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:26,953
You fool! I said you
have to get out of
the way!!

182
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:28,657
What!? You didn't
say that!

183
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,627
I just didn't have
time to finish!

184
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:36,138
Don't you see!? His
Magnet Style puts a
magnetic charge onto
anything he touches!

185
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:40,079
And those things can
then transfer a magnetic
charge to anything they
touch!

186
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:45,356
The charge weakens with
each transfer. You're the
first tranfer point that
touched the shuriken...

187
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,595
...so the magnetic
power in your body...!

188
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,699
So, what's gonna
happen to me then!?

189
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:53,372
Right now, your whole
body is magnetized...

190
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:56,145
And the shuriken he
possesses are too!

191
00:15:56,178 --> 00:16:00,286
Your body and his shuriken
are going to be drawn
directly towards each other!

192
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,023
[gasps]

193
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,664
Which means that you
won't be able to dodge
his next attack!

194
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:11,241
No way! You're telling
me I'm about to die!?

195
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,951
No! I don't
want to die!

196
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,088
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Rasengan!</i>

[gasps]

198
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:28,175
Are you guys okay?
Have you been injured?

199
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,985
Huh? What was
that?

200
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:35,089
What's going
on out there?

201
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,397
(Cloud Ninja)
Lord Bee! What are
you doing here?!

202
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,435
Not much! You okay?

203
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:46,513
Yes, but you shouldn't
be here, sir! Those white
beings are disguising
themselves as us!

204
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,517
Yeah, I know.

205
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,125
(Thinking)
So, this is one of those
zombie guys controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu, huh?

206
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:56,533
And sealing them like
this is the only way
to stop them...

207
00:16:56,566 --> 00:17:02,443
We were running back to HQ
with Eff to tighten the
security there, but we got
separated...

208
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:05,851
(Killer Bee)
Eff and his team were
actually white beings.

209
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,355
(Killer Bee)
You gotta be careful
what you're seeing...

210
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:10,794
[frightened gasp]

211
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,467
Time to go, Octopops,
we gotta catch up to
everybody else now.

212
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,673
Yeah!

213
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:21,215
Hold on, if Eff and
the others were all
imposters... you!

214
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:27,060
No! Come on! I mean, both
of us were attacked and
almost killed by the
enemy, so we're okay!

215
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,630
We're both who
we're supposed
to be!

216
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,765
Oh yeah! Right!

217
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:37,113
[laughing]

218
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,184
I've got you!

219
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,435
Are you trying
to kill me!?

220
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,241
It's your own fault!
Now's not the time
for jokes!

221
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,146
(Tsuchikage)
We really can't
retreat any further.

222
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,851
It's time to make a
stand right here and
right now!

223
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,622
Yes...

224
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,697
The first thing the
two of us should do
is launch long-range
offensives.

225
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,769
<i>We'll see how the</i>
<i>enemy responds...</i>

226
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,339
Hm?

227
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:28,516
They were slowly
retreating... but
it seems that they've
made up their minds.

228
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,893
Fighting those from other
villages is understandable,
but I don't care to battle
my own village's shinobi.

229
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,735
Curse that Orochimaru
brat for controlling us
with this loathsome jutsu!

230
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,505
He will regret
doing this to us!

231
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:45,116
You and I have never
seen eye to eye, but
for the first time ever,
I think I agree with you.

232
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,220
Do not lament. It
is not all bad.

233
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:50,292
I'm sure that our
children have grown
and surpassed us.

234
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:52,865
They will make a
stand and they
will stop us.

235
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,537
I really hope
you're right.

236
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,042
Hm?

237
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,714
Incomming.

238
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,250
There are two
of them.

239
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:07,895
[grunt]

240
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:11,168
Woah, look! Now
that is a whole
lotta sand!

241
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,577
(Thinking)
It's the power of the
Shikaku, the One Tail!

242
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,017
So, he's kicking
off with the
Playing Possum Jutsu?

243
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,033
Gold Dust...?
I see...

244
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:31,676
You were the shinobi
who controlled Gold
Dust with Magnet Style.

245
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,094
You stopped it.
Nice.

246
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:44,100
Gold Dust is much
heavier than sand.

247
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:48,743
So if I simply mix
some Gold Dust into
this sand, then I'm
able to slow it down.

248
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:52,885
I'm impressed that you
knew how to counter it
so quickly and effectively.

249
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:58,630
When Shukaku the One
Tail would run amok,
I would stop his sand
just like this.

250
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,466
[gasp]

251
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:11,154
(Thinking)
It's not Shikaku...
It's Gaara?

252
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,400
[struggling grunts]

253
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:21,141
From above.

254
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:30,326
You're an old man,
Ohnoki! Do you owe
your long life to
Particle Style?

255
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,535
Patrticle Style! Atomic
Dismantling Jutsu!

256
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:48,028
This Particle Style of
his... my predecessor's
as powerful as ever.

257
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:51,602
His sand is even more
powerful than before.

258
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,552
Just wait for
the signal!

259
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:04,595
Tht was Particle
Style. Don't tell me
that's your former pupil
that brat Ohnoki!

260
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:08,302
Oh man. Now I really
do feel like I've
travelled through time.

261
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:11,007
Father, it's
been a while.

262
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,615
Yes, Gaara. But
where is Shukaku?

263
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,184
He is long gone...

264
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:25,604
And I... I am no
longer the Jinchuriki
that you've created,
father.

265
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,733
(Gaara)
I've become the
Kazekage!

266
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:07,741
(Gaara)
It is a leader's duty
to eliminate threats
against one's village.

267
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:10,012
(Gaara)
We must protect it.

268
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:13,820

It seems this Reanimation Jutsu
may actually have something of
merit to it after all...

269
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,692
(Fourth Kazekage)
Let me determine what
you may be worth!

270
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:19,632

Can you defeat me,
or can't you!?
