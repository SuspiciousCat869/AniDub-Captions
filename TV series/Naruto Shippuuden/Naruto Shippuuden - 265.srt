1
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,250
{\an1}<i>[Messenger]</i>
<i>Captain Mifune! We've just</i>
<i>received word from HQ!</i>

2
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,787
{\an1}The enemy force appears to
be marching right past us,
deep underground!

3
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:20,455
{\an1}The shinobi in the
Sensory Unit weren't
able to detect them?

4
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,990
{\an1}That can only mean that
they must not be human.

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:27,494
{\an1}Well then, considering
our elongated
deployment formation,

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,929
{\an1}we'll have to mobilize
a few of the platoons.

7
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:35,266
{\an4}<i>Take some from our Fifth</i>
<i>Company closest to Kitsuchi's</i>
<i>Second Company and send them</i>
<i>over as reinforcements.</i>

8
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:37,668
{\an1}And hurry!

9
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:50,544
{\an1}I'll keep them coming!

10
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,379
{\an1}The flare, now!!

11
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,546
Okay!

12
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:01,018
A red flare.
It's the Commando Unit.
Let's go!

13
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:01,920
{\an1}Mm.

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,622
{\an1}Are you all right after that,
Master Zabuza?

15
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,925
Looks like you
wasted a jutsu,
Haku.

16
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:13,995
{\an1}This Reanimation Jutsu.
We can't die;
we're already dead.

17
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,097
{\an1}I don't like this jutsu..

18
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:23,101
{\an1}<i>That was a good catch, Haku.</i>

19
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:27,871
{\an1}That species of giant
bird really does fly
in pairs like that.

20
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,306
{\an1}<i>They work together</i>
<i>to catch their prey.</i>

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,109
{\an1}However, that's only in
winter when raising young.

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,378
{\an1}<i>Plus there's that beacon</i>
<i>that looks like a cloud.</i>

23
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:41,114
{\an1}I have no doubt that the enemy
who attacked us is up there.

24
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,983
{\an1}Please leave them to me.

25
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:46,118
Huh?

26
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:48,720
Snow?

27
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:50,588
Cold air?

28
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,424
Huh?

29
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,160
{\an1}Secret Jutsu:
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

30
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,228
Waagh!

31
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,263
Yahhhh!

32
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,709
[groans]

33
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:22,578
{\an1}Wait...

34
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:23,779
Isn't that...?

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,315
{\an1}What is this? What's going on?
They're just children!

36
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:31,351
{\an1}Our bodies are immortal now.
A mutual strike will be
sufficient.

37
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,220
{\an1}Damn it! All of our
enemies are shinobi who
possess Kekkei Genkai!

38
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,756
Well, except me.

39
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,191
{\an1}We don't have anything
personal against any of you.

40
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,694
{\an1}But we're not in
control of our
actions right now.

41
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:46,362
Here they come!

42
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:54,201
Huh?

43
00:02:58,605 --> 00:02:59,639
{\an1}<i>[Haku]</i>
<i>Kakashi?!</i>

44
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:44,015
"An Old Nemesis Returns"

45
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,051
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>Kakashi!</i>
<i>You're a lifesaver!</i>

46
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:52,487
{\an1}Don't start celebrating yet.
All of these guys are going to
be difficult shinobi to defeat.

47
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:58,425
{\an1}I knew we'd have to fight,
but I never imagined it would
be against you, Kakashi.

48
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:00,026
Hrm.

49
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,198
Lightning Blade!

50
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,539
{\an1}That day back on the bridge,
you were supposed to finish
me off and send me to hell.

51
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:21,341
{\an1}When I came to, I was in
the same place as Haku.

52
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:25,211
{\an1}It seems that this is
neither heaven nor hell.

53
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:31,717
{\an1}This is the world of the living.
You shouldn't be here. You're
under the Reanimation Jutsu.

54
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,552
{\an1}The... Reanimation Jutsu?

55
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:39,122
{\an5}That's right.
The Akatsuki brought
you back from the
world of the dead.

56
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,356
What? They know
each other?

57
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,524
Wait for Captain
Kakashi's signal.

58
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,393
Zabuza. Haku.

59
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:52,031
{\an1}Oh! You've grown
up, Kakashi's
little kunoichi.

60
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,867
<i>And is the other</i>
<i>lad doing well?</i>

61
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:56,534
Ah!

62
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:58,502
Yes.

63
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,345
Uhhn.

64
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:16,281
{\an1}<i>[Naruto] [half asleep]</i>
<i>Who the heck are you?</i>

65
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:22,019
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Wait, is this it? Is this one</i>
<i>of the ones I should pick?</i>

66
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:23,054
<i>[Haku]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

67
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:25,022
That's a medicinal
herb, huh?

68
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:27,023
{\an1}Thank you again
for helping me.

69
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:30,258
You start work
early, huh, sis?

70
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,562
{\an1}I like the calm of the
morning. I didn't think
I'd find someone sleeping.

71
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,330
I'm training!

72
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,732
{\an1}I'm developing skills
so I can get stronger!

73
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,832
{\an1}Mm?

74
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,035
{\an1}To me, you seem
pretty strong now,
isn't that enough?

75
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,771
{\an1}No, no, I need to get
stronger and stronger!
I have to keep practicing!

76
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,273
{\an1}How so?
Why's it so important?

77
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:54,144
{\an1}So I can become the
very best ninja in my
whole entire village!

78
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:56,912
{\an1}And then everyone will know
who I am and respect me!

79
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:00,447
{\an1}There's also a certain person,
a kid, that I have to prove
something to.

80
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:03,483
{\an1}So are you doing it for
this "certain person",

81
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:06,052
{\an1}Or are you doing
all this training
for yourself?

82
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:07,352
Huh?

83
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,487
{\an1}[chuckle]

84
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:11,689
Why are you laughing,
what's so funny!?

85
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:16,226
{\an1}Tell me, is there anyone
who is precious to you?

86
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:17,827
Huh?

87
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:23,831
{\an1}So you see, when a person
has something precious
they want to protect,

88
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:27,634
{\an1}that's when they
become genuinely strong.

89
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,668
Hmm?

90
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,502
Hmm...

91
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:34,206
Yeah! I hear you.
I know exactly what
you're saying!

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,406
Huh?

93
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:40,343
{\an1}You will get strong.
And we will meet again.

94
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,912
Hm!

95
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,382
<i>[Zabuza]</i>
<i>He defeated us.</i>

96
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,785
{\an1}He must be all grown up now.
And probably famous too.

97
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:56,555
Yeah, they named that
bridge after him:
the Great Naruto Bridge.

98
00:07:56,756 --> 00:08:01,458
{\an4}To everyone in our
village, he's a hero.
They call him the kid who
makes miracles happen.

99
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,227
{\an1}[giggle]

100
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,894
{\an3}Hmm?

101
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,664
Thanks to both of you,
Naruto was able to
find his Ninja Way.

102
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:16,670
{\an4}He pledged to follow it at your
graves. He's quite the splendid
shinobi now. And he's grown
into a fine young man, too.

103
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:20,439
{\an1}Then, he will become
even stronger.

104
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:26,978
{\an4}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Have you reminisced enough?</i>
<i>Because now we need to get to</i>
<i>work. It's time to get serious!</i>

105
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,478
Power's
flowing
into me!

106
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,181
{\an1}The main act starts now!

107
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:37,953
Kakashi...
You must...
stop us.

108
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:42,989
Retreat!

109
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,659
Kakashi...
Aren't those two...

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,594
Yeah. There's
no mistake.

111
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:53,563
{\an1}The Demon Zabuza Momochi!
And Haku of the Ice Style!

112
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,466
Kakashi Sensei!

113
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,269
{\an1}I am your opponent, Naruto!

114
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:01,203
Haku!

115
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,605
{\an1}Let's finish this. Now!

116
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:11,576
{\an1}I wanted to see your face
when you realize that your
Sharingan's worthless.

117
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,378
{\an1}Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!

118
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,317
{\an1}<i>Too late!</i>

119
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:27,289
{\an1}This is his Silent Killing,
which brings down a foe
only with sound.

120
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,325
{\an1}Why, Zabuza?! You were known as
the Demon of the Hidden Mist!

121
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,627
{\an1}How could you stoop so low
as to become a hired thug?!

122
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,364
{\an1}Stop kidding yourself!
Don't be so naïve!

123
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:42,432
{\an1}In this shinobi world,
the choices are either
to use or be used!

124
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:46,435
{\an1}Shinobi like us are
merely tools, weapons
in the hands of others.

125
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,837
{\an1}We cannot afford to
stand on principles!

126
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:54,508
{\an1}A weak ninja has no
place at all in
this world of ours.

127
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,610
Zabuza. Why
that guy,
anyway?!

128
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:00,380
{\an1}I live only to protect
and serve him.

129
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,414
{\an1}Do you know what it's
like to feel unwanted?

130
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,216
Do you?

131
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,519
{\an1}Zabuza. He came along and
made me necessary again.

132
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:10,320
Nh!

133
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:14,290
{\an1}When I grew into my powers,
my father tried to kill me.

134
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:21,427
{\an4}After years of the horrors
of civil war, nearly all
of the people who still
lived in my homeland,

135
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:26,831
{\an4}had come to harbor great fear
and hatred against anyone who
carried the Kekkei Genkai
in their blood.

136
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:31,435
{\an1}And back then, at that time,
I thought of myself thusly:

137
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:36,372
{\an1}In the entire world, no one
needed me. I was unnecessary.

138
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,307
[gasp]

139
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,374
{\an8}<i>Just like... me!</i>

140
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:44,145
{\an1}But Zabuza. When he looked
at me, his eyes weren't
full of hate or fear.

141
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,280
{\an1}<i>He made me necessary again.</i>

142
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,017
I was happy.

143
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,121
{\an1}<i>[Young Haku]</i>
<i>I am yours, Zabuza.</i>

144
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:03,025
{\an1}Think of me as a weapon
to be kept at your side
and used as you see fit.

145
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,128
But that isn't what
it's all about!

146
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:11,698
{\an1}And there are other ways of
showing strength than just by
beating someone in battle.

147
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,737
{\an1}Nh... My mind's...
growing foggy.

148
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,938
{\an1}(disoriented reax) Damn...

149
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,041
{\an1}The inside of my head,
it- it's burning!

150
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:27,443
Dgh!

151
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:32,080
{\an1}That aura.
So that's the
Demon Zabuza!

152
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,081
{\an1}And that
Ice Style
child!

153
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:37,750
Prepare yourselves!
Don't let your
guard down, Guy.

154
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,052
He is unparalleled
at silent killing.

155
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,488
{\an1}Please, Kakashi.
I'm begging you now.

156
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,258
{\an1}You must stop us once again.
You must!

157
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,596
{\an1}My dream was always to be an
instrument of Master Zabuza's,
a weapon for him to use.

158
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,398
And to die
protecting him.

159
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:02,901
{\an1}However, The fact
that Master Zabuza is
now under this jutsu,

160
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:08,940
{\an1}<i>means that not only did I</i>
<i>fail to protect him from</i>
<i>you that day, long ago,</i>

161
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:14,144
{\an1}But also means, that I
can't protect him now.

162
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,180
{\an1}And worse, I can't even
do his bidding anymore!

163
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,915
{\an1}No. you did indeed
protect Zabuza.

164
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,557
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>No. you did indeed</i>
<i>protect Zabuza.</i>

165
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,228
{\an1}He died from a
different cause. Plus,

166
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,097
{\an1}<i>Zabuza never thought that</i>
<i>you were merely a tool.</i>

167
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:44,999
{\an1}Uh!

168
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,702
Kakashi. just shut
your mouth, already.

169
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,606
Naruto. He dug deep
into Zabuza's heart and
carved out the truth.

170
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:00,110
{\an1}Hmpf. He talked big,
and this is how he
ends up, huh?

171
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,612
{\an1}Turns out you're
just a weakling!

172
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,579
Haku!

173
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,516
You scum!

174
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:08,450
{\an1}Get away!

175
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,751
Stop!
Use your head.

176
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,119
We're outnumbered!

177
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,220
{\an1}But...

178
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,155
{\an1}Are you really gonna
let him do that?!

179
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,224
Be quiet, you fool;
Haku's dead, what
does it matter?

180
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,527
{\an1}Gato's right; he died
'cause he was weak.

181
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,028
What?! How can
you say that?!
He saved you!

182
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:27,364
How can you let him
be treated that way?!

183
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,499
{\an1}You don't understand
the Way of Shinobi.

184
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,735
{\an1}I merely used him,
just as Gato used me.

185
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:39,473
{\an1}<i>I thought I'd told you:</i>
<i>in the shinobi world,</i>
<i>it's either use or be used.</i>

186
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:42,275
{\an1}<i>We Shinobi are</i>
<i>tools, mere weapons.</i>

187
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:47,546
{\an1}<i>The loss of his strength</i>
<i>and skill, yes, that</i>
<i>means something to me.</i>

188
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,382
{\an1}<i>But the boy? Nothing.</i>

189
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,150
{\an1}If you really mean that,
you're just a rat.

190
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,385
Naruto, stop!

191
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,854
Why you ungrateful...
After all he did
for you?!

192
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,355
Haku lived for you!

193
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,958
{\an1}Tell me, is there anyone
who is precious to you?

194
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,260
{\an1}You were the most
important thing to him!

195
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:13,465
{\an1}So you see, when a person
has something precious
they want to protect,

196
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,765
{\an1}that is when they become
genuinely strong.

197
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:20,136
{\an1}He meant nothing? He seriously
meant nothing at all to you?!

198
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:24,772
{\an1}Really?! He gave
everything for you, and
you felt nothing for him?!

199
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:31,377
{\an1}But I will do anything to see
that his dream is fulfilled.
Even become Shinobi if I must.

200
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:37,215
{\an1}And if I become stronger, does
that mean, I'll become as
cold-hearted as you are?

201
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,550
{\an1}He threw his life away.

202
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,551
{\an1}For you and your dream!

203
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:44,386
{\an1}You never let him have
a dream of his own.

204
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,989
{\an1}And you just toss him
aside like he was nothing.

205
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,059
A broken tool.
that's so wrong,
so wrong!

206
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:53,893
{\an1}<i>Kid...</i>

207
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,364
{\an1}That's enough. You talk
too much, you know that?

208
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:04,168
{\an1}<i>While he fought you,</i>
<i>his heart was breaking.</i>

209
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:08,737
{\an1}<i>You see, Haku was always</i>
<i>too soft and too kind.</i>

210
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:14,242
{\an1}I've known that all along.
I'm glad he fought you
in the end.

211
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:18,612
And kid,
it's as you said.

212
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,114
{\an1}Even Shinobi are human.

213
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:25,116
{\an1}No matter how hard we
try to escape that fact,

214
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:28,752
We always fail.

215
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:31,321
Zabuza, you...

216
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:33,855
{\an1}You guys stay out of this.

217
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,592
{\an1}This fight is for me alone!

218
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,895
Raaaaggh!

219
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:54,971
{\an1}Snowing, at this time of year?

220
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,307
Haku?

221
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,376
{\an1}Is that you weeping?

222
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,877
{\an1}You were always at my side.

223
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,615
{\an1}The least I can do is to
be beside you at the end.

224
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,522
{\an1}I know it cannot be,

225
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:21,624
{\an1}but I wish that I could go
to where you have gone.

226
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:23,393
{\an1}How I wish.

227
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,999
{\an1}You never know, Zabuza.
Maybe you will join him there.

228
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,579
{\an1}Zabuza and Haku, huh?
They're both being
quite stubborn.

229
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:52,047
{\an1}I can't believe they
still aren't bound.

230
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,381
[chuckle]

231
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,016
{\an1}But have no fear, I'll make
you mere killer puppets soon!

232
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,686
{\an1}Because both of
you are MY tools!

233
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,989
Kakashi. Don't
hesitate or hold back.

234
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,325
Use whatever means
necessary... to stop me.

235
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,828
{\an1}<i>Remember, I</i>
<i>already died once.</i>

236
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,764
{\an1}And, I died human!

237
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,834
Yes. I know.

238
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,174
Master Zabuza.

239
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,874
I thank you.

240
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,146
{\an1}Here they come!

241
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,249

{\an1}All Kekkei Genkai users, huh?

The mist is getting thicker.

00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,209
{\an1}Visibility is low.

252
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:22,979
{\an4}It is okay! Do not be
afraid, Sakura!

this formation's blind spot,

254
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,150
So watch your
backs, everyone!

Aggh!

260
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,226
It's begun!

261
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,827
{\an1}It's different than the
last time, after all.

262
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:49,733
{\an1}I can bind them so much
more tightly, now that I
have Orochimaru's chakra.

263
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:53,468
{\an1}<i>Though it's overwriting my</i>
<i>personal control tags.</i>

264
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:01,141
{\an4}However, I deliberately
kept their emotions
intact to psychologically
shake up the enemy.

265
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,211
{\an1}<i>That left the binding weaker, so</i>

{\an1}<i>This time, I will</i>
<i>suppress their emotion.</i>

{\an1}Right now, I don't know how many
pawns I can actually affect.

268
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:18,219
{\an1}Well, at least this war
will show me my limits.

269
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:26,626
{\an4}<i>As for the rest of the pawns,</i>
<i>I'll bind them to the point</i>

270

{\an1}[pain]
Hnggh!

289
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,443
It's okay. Hang on.

290
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,445
{\an1}I'm beginning to understand
the enemy's strategy.

291
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,614
{\an1}But now it's gonna
be my turn!

292
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:47,151
{\an1}[chuckle] I'm not so naïve
as to allow the enemy time
to catch their breath.

Summoning Jutsu!

294
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:00,927
Huh?

295
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,668
{\an1}This is unbelievable.

296
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,103
No way!
Is that?!

299

{\an1}<i>He told me that when people</i>

300
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:05,787
{\an1}<i>that's when they can</i>

{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
