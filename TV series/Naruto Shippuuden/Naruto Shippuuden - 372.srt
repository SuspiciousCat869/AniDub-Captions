1
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,018
{\an1}Everyone! Let's join
together and fight as one!

2
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:56,887
[cheering]

3
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,221
{\an1}Thanks, Hinata!

4
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:00,557
{\an1}Time for you to recover!

5
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:05,729
<i>You guys...</i>

6
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,933
{\an1}A futile display.

7
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,802
[growl]

8
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,952
{\an1}It's transforming again!

9
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:31,489
{\an1}No, just reverting
to its original form.

10
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:35,160
That was only
its attack form.

11
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,796
{\an1}However, it's only
one stage short of

12
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,866
{\an1}its final transformation.

13
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:46,772
{\an1}Naruto's still recovering,
and Nine Tails is infusing

14
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,842
{\an1}chakra. It's all up
to us right now, Bee!

15
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,811
{\an1}I heard that! We'll
show everyone the way

16
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:54,079
{\an1}and where it's at!

17
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:57,049
{\an1}Listen Bee, if we let
it undergo its final

18
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:58,884
{\an1}transformation, we've lost.

19
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,954
We have to stop
it right now!

20
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,969
Ten Tails isn't
holding back.

21
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:19,605
{\an1}He must have gotten
irked after seeing his other

22
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,441
{\an1}Tailed Beasts inside Naruto!

23
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:26,613
{\an1}The fun is just about to
begin, but it appears that

24
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,481
I'm going to
need to move soon.

25
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:35,655
{\an1}Whoa. It's still
growing bigger.

26
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,992
Yeah, is that
meant for Naruto?!

27
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:43,898
{\an1}Honestly, how're we
supposed to deal with that

28
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,431
{\an1}without Naruto's chakra?

29
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,710
{\an1}We have to remain strong,
everyone! We can't waver

30
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,279
{\an1}after coming this far!

31
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,815
{\an1}Naruto is putting
his all into doing

32
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,383
{\an1}what has to be done.

33
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,387
{\an1}But still, it's even more
painful for me not to have

34
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,122
{\an1}my comrades in here!

35
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:11,792
{\an1}The words Naruto just
said made it clear!

36
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:15,396
{\an1}Yeah, he's been going
out of his way even

37
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,264
{\an1}to protect shinobi like us.

38
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,967
{\an1}That's not what I mean!

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,436
{\an1}He's told us he considers
all of us his comrades from

40
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,306
{\an1}the bottom of his heart.

41
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,107
Comrades.

42
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,642
Comrades.

43
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,984
We're...

44
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:38,287
{\an1}Yeah, we're all...

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,892
Comrades!

46
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:47,462
{\an1}I'm going to fully
heal Naruto now!

47
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,199
We must each
do what we can.

48
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:56,638
{\an1}If we're going to die
anyway, we might as well go

49
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,877
{\an1}down fighting to the very
best of our abilities.

50
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:04,881
[chuckle]

51
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:06,716
Ino!

52
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,052
{\an1}I want you to link
me with someone!

53
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,821
{\an1}You have a plan, huh?

54
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,823
{\an1}I knew you'd come through!

55
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,559
{\an1}There must be something
we can do, right, dad?

56
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:17,960
{\an1}I'm low on chakra.

57
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,463
{\an1}Master Kitsuchi!
Please, hear me out!

58
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:23,233
You're
Shikaku's child, right?

59
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,870
{\an1}Teach me the signs to an
easy Earth Style Barrier

60
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:28,872
{\an1}ninjutsu that even
non-Hidden Stone

61
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,506
{\an1}shinobi can perform!

62
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,210
{\an1}One that anyone could
instantly master would be

63
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:35,279
too feeble! It'd
be better to-

64
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,848
{\an1}No, it's crucial
that everyone be able to

65
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:40,851
{\an1}reproduce it. If the
enemy has quality,

66
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:41,818
{\an1}we've got quantity.

67
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:44,788
{\an1}But these walls'll get
blown away immediately.

68
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:47,057
Then we just
keep building more.

69
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,558
{\an1}They'll act like a shield.

70
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,028
{\an1}We'll slow that thing's
momentum with many

71
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,197
{\an1}weak walls, rather than
try to stop it with

72
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:54,765
{\an1}one powerful wall!

73
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,969
{\an1}Of course, I also plan to
have all of you Hidden Stone

74
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:01,105
shinobi build me
a super wall.

75
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,442
{\an1}I see, your idea might
indeed be worth a try.

76
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:08,279
{\an1}All right, these
are the hand signs!

77
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,781
Before that...

78
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:11,549
Master Bee!

79
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:12,617
Huh?

80
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,919
{\an1}While everyone else is
building barriers, I want

81
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:17,423
{\an1}you to hit that thing with
tons of Tailed Beast Bombs

82
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,791
and shift its
trajectory upwards.

83
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,927
Ino...

84
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,497
{\an1}Next thing I want you
to link me with every

85
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,233
{\an1}shinobi on the battlefield.

86
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,867
Can you do it?

87
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,670
That doesn't
matter! I'm gonna do it!

88
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:33,738
[chuckle]

89
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:42,948
{\an1}What's your issue
with a Genjutsu World?

90
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,850
{\an1}Reality is cruel.

91
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,421
{\an1}This hole is just
going to get bigger.

92
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:53,525
{\an1}Things don't always go the
way you want them. Nor does

93
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,195
{\an1}help always arrive in time.

94
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,832
Just like how
it was with me!

95
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,802
How I couldn't
get there in time!

96
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:09,776
{\an1}Right, Kakashi? Don't you
agree? How will you seal

97
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,179
{\an1}this hole by living
in a world like this?

98
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:20,720
{\an1}I may be scum as a shinobi,
but I've still learned a

99
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,122
thing or two.

100
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,402
{\an1}The hole in one's
heart gets filled by

101
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,137
{\an1}others around you.

102
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:40,274
{\an1}But people won't flock to
someone who abandons the

103
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,277
{\an1}memory of his friends
and gives up on the world

104
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,782
{\an1}just because things don't
go the way he wants them to.

105
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:51,018
{\an1}That will do nothing
to help fill the

106
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:52,219
{\an1}hole in your heart.

107
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:57,224
{\an1}And people don't help those
who run away and do nothing.

108
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,594
{\an1}As long as you don't
give up, there will

109
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,663
{\an1}always be salvation.

110
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,782
No matter what
you say or do...

111
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:26,121
It's over!

112
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,957
{\an1}Earth Style Barrier!

113
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,793
{\an1}Here it comes, Bee!

114
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,695
{\an1}Yeah! Let's go!

115
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:37,233
Its power is
off the charts!

116
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,879
{\an1}It's more powerful than I
thought. At this rate...

117
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,085
{\an1}The last barrier!

118
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,158
[grunting]

119
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,428
Lord Bee!

120
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,198
{\an1}Tedious whitewashing.

121
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:12,668
{\an1}True happiness is only
achieved by abandoning

122
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,705
{\an1}reality and purging the
memories of your comrades!

123
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,511
{\an1}In the ninja world, those
who break the rules are

124
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,279
{\an1}scum. That's true.

125
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:30,120
{\an1}But those who abandon their
friends are worse than scum.

126
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,925
{\an1}And those who don't cherish
their comrades' memory are

127
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,895
{\an1}even worse scum than that!

128
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:47,838
It vanished?

129
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:56,047
{\an1}I won't abandon my
memory of the old you.

130
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:01,219
{\an1}Even if it's the current
you who's repudiating it!

131
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,494
Am I too late?

132
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,462
No way.

133
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:13,064
You got here
right on time, dad!

134
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,436
Huh?! Who's?!

135
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,071
Whose dad?

136
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:31,550
{\an1}I'm Minato Namikaze.
Brace for an explosion.

137
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,385
Huh?!

138
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:35,354
[gasp]

139
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,691
{\an1}Huh? What is that?

140
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,391
Whoa, what-?!

141
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,397
{\an1}I sent Ten Tails' attack
over there into the sea.

142
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,235
{\an1}Whoa, watch out!

143
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:53,106
What the hell's
going on now?!

144
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,374
{\an1}What's to stop it?!

145
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:01,147
{\an1}Oh, come on! That shockwave
came out of nowhere!

146
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,215
{\an1}What's up with that?!

147
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,850
{\an1}Look, quit complaining!

148
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:07,087
Honestly, we're
lucky. We got off easy.

149
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,159
{\an1}Reanimation eyes!

150
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:17,163
{\an1}So? Talk! Who are you?

151
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:20,800
{\an1}It's okay, don't worry.
I'm an ally of yours.

152
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,205
{\an1}It looks like I owe you
thanks for healing Naruto!

153
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:25,539
So, uh...

154
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,941
Are you
Naruto's girlfriend?

155
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,477
Huh?!

156
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:34,282
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, yeah! I
guess you could say that!

157
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,050
{\an1}You shut your trap!

158
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,787
{\an1}Don't waste your
energy talking!

159
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,224
{\an1}You're supposed to be
healing me, not hurting

160
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:44,693
me even more!

161
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,429
{\an1}Oh, I'll just heal
the extra damage, too!

162
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:49,398
[chuckling]

163
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,601
{\an1}She kinda reminds
me a bit of Kushina.

164
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:56,405
{\an1}So, uh. Please, could
you go easy on my son?

165
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,873
[chuckle]

166
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,276
This is such a
sudden surprise.

167
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,779
Although, it
seems like you knew.

168
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:07,416
{\an1}Yeah, I sensed his
chakra in Nine Tails Mode.

169
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,685
{\an1}The others should be
arriving soon, too.

170
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:12,521
{\an1}[gasp] Something's coming!

171
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,362
{\an1}Well, Minato...

172
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,998
It seems you're
as fast as ever!

173
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,867
[gasp] L- Lord
Third Hokage?!

174
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,404
{\an1}And also aren't they--?!

175
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,506
{\an1}Well, Lord Fourth...

176
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,275
{\an1}I must say you're
even better at

177
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,043
{\an1}teleporting than I!

178
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:37,313
{\an1}All right, then.
Let's do this!

179
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,582
No way!

180
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,384
{\an1}I don't believe it...

181
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,090
Lord First, Lord
Second, Lord Third,

182
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:49,258
{\an1}and even Lord Fourth!

183
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,762
{\an1}It's really Minato!

184
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:55,399
{\an1}Oh, so you're the ones
who stopped the attack

185
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,999
{\an1}just now, Lords Hokage!

186
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,001
{\an1}But who reanimated you?

187
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,039
{\an1}Orochimaru's the
one who summoned us.

188
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:06,008
{\an1}We need to put a stop
to this war quickly.

189
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,277
What?!

190
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,946
{\an1}Orochimaru died, didn't he?

191
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,283
{\an1}Amazing! The previous
Hokage joining us in battle!

192
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:15,219
{\an1}Now that's reassuring!

193
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,354
{\an1}[sigh] I'm totally lost.

194
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:20,859
{\an1}The other reinforcements
are coming, too.

195
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,762
{\an1}But I guess they're
lagging behind a bit.

196
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,870
{\an1}It's about damn time!

197
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,037
I've been
waiting, Hashirama!

198
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,741
{\an1}I'll deal with you later!

199
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,346
First I have to
stop the Ten Tails!

200
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,847
[chuckle]

201
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,682
{\an1}He hasn't changed a bit.

202
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,353
{\an1}We were never on
the same page.

203
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,789
After all...

204
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:53,124
{\an1}...he's charging
right towards us.

205
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,230
{\an1}Naruto, you've done
really well today.

206
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:02,367
Why don't you
take a little break?

207
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:05,438
{\an1}That friend of yours
will be here soon.

208
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,440
{\an1}He's our ally, too.

209
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,545
[gasp] He is?

210
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:16,949
[gasp]

211
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:22,823
{\an1}This presence... It's
Minato! What's going on?!

212
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,490
{\an1}Fellow Hokage...

213
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,991
Let's go!

214
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,833
{\an1}Please, Lord Second
and Lord Third

215
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,668
{\an1}stand in front of me.

216
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,605
That's exactly
like Naruto's...

217
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:43,710
{\an1}I never imagined
that Minato would, too!

218
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:44,845
See?! See?!

219
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:47,414
{\an1}Is my dad totally
amazing or what?!

220
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:50,517
{\an1}I know that even
better than you do!

221
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:56,356
{\an1}Reaper Death Seal!

222
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,603
{\an1}Let's believe in him!

223
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,640
After all this
child is our son!

224
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:13,674
Seal!

225
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,444
[angry roar]

226
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:27,455
{\an1}He's the one who split me
up before sealing me away!

227
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,293
{\an1}Have you already
placed your markers?

228
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:33,261
I have.

229
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:36,264
{\an1}It appears that you're
quick at striking, too!

230
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:44,973
They vanished!

231
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,512
{\an1}Let's go! Ninja Art...

232
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:53,682
Four Crimson
Ray Formation!

233
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,430
{\an1}And I think. I'm
going to add on.

234
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:12,167
Sage Art:
Gracious Deity Gates!

235
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:20,577
Ten Seals!

236
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,850
{\an1}A red barrier?!

237
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,521
{\an1}It is said to be more
powerful than the Four

238
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:32,923
{\an1}Flames Formation!

239
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:36,026
{\an1}It's a barrier that
requires four Hokage-class

240
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,028
shinobi working
together to create!

241
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:40,030
[angry roar]

242
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:43,634
{\an1}Now it won't be able to
move about so easily.

243
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:02,020
{\an1}You sure took your time
getting here, Sasuke.

244
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:08,158
[gasp] Sasuke?!

245
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,594
Sakura, huh?

246
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,697
S... Sasuke?!

247
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,665
Why?!

248
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,466
[gasps]

249
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:16,701
{\an1}[angry growling]

250
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,805
{\an1}Huh? S- Sasuke, you-?!

251
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,507
{\an1}Hey, Ino! Stop!

252
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,009
{\an1}He's still an enemy!

253
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,412
{\an1}Yeah, Ino! You probably
shouldn't go near him. Just

254
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,847
{\an1}keep your distance!

255
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,686
{\an1}You guys are still
as annoying as ever.

256
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,757
{\an1}Why the hell are you
here, you bastard?!

257
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,992
He's right.

258
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,995
What are you
doing here, Sasuke?

259
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,767
{\an1}A whole lot has happened.
But I've decided to protect

260
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,769
{\an1}the Hidden Leaf Village now.

261
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,736
Then, after...

262
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,872
I will...

263
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,109
{\an1}...become Hokage.

264
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,447
What?!

265
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,852
What?!

266
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,789
{\an1}Long-time-no-see Rogue
Ninja, you can't come back

267
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,491
{\an1}suddenly and crack lame
jokes! You even get what it

268
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,592
{\an1}means to be Hokage?

269
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,063
{\an1}I don't know everything
that's happened to you, but

270
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,998
that's just an
impossibility.

271
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,834
{\an1}I mean, do even know
what you're saying?

272
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,137
{\an1}Do you really believe
we can forgive and

273
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,072
{\an1}forget all you've done?

274
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,575
{\an1}I know. I realize
you probably can't.

275
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,778
{\an1}But then it doesn't
really matter what any

276
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,380
{\an1}of you think of me.

277
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,052
{\an1}The previous Kage
caused these circumstances.

278
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:43,290
{\an1}So I will become Hokage
and change the Village.

279
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,129
{\an1}Becoming Hokage isn't
about getting people to

280
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,696
{\an1}acknowledge you.

281
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,066
{\an1}Only those already
acknowledged will ever

282
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,233
become Hokage.

283
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,705
You'll have to
take care of Sasuke.

284
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,746
{\an1}Leave it to me.

285
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:14,422
{\an1}I'm going to be the
one who'll be Hokage!

286
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,892
{\an1}It does please me to see
you guys so infatuated with

287
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,628
becoming Hokage,
but speed it up!

288
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,396
{\an1}Start infusing chakra!

289
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:26,235
{\an1}We'll take down Ten Tails
with an all-out attack!

290
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:31,439
Thanks, Sakura.
For healing me!

291
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:33,809
{\an1}Now it's your turn
to get some rest.

292
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,611
{\an1}Let's go, Sasuke!

293
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,987
Sakura?

294
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,023
{\an1}You think I'm some
weak woman who can't

295
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,925
{\an1}keep up with you two?

296
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,296
{\an1}Is Lady Tsunade the only
Sannin to give inadequate

297
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,865
{\an1}training to her student?

298
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,700
{\an1}I'm almost there...

299
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:03,239
{\an1}I'll be at full capacity in
a little bit. Then I can put

300
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:04,607
{\an1}out my true power.

301
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,945
{\an1}I'm a part of Team 7,
too! And a student of

302
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:10,513
{\an1}a Legendary Sannin!

303
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:18,222
[chuckle]

304
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,557
All right!

305
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:25,862
{\an1}Team 7 is finally back
in action once again!

306
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,900
Sakura! Sasuke!
Let's go!

307
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,268
Right!

308
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,336
Yeah!

309
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,339
{\an1}That sight sure brings back
memories! Right, Shikamaru?

310
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:40,978
{\an1}Well, okay. I guess that if
he's willing to help us take

311
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,914
{\an1}down the enemy, I
won't turn him away.

312
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,983
{\an1}But I don't accept him...

313
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,352
{\an1}It's been a while since
our whole class was together

314
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:51,455
{\an1}like this. Kinda feels
like the Chunin Exams!

315
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,724
{\an1}I'm the one who's
gonna be Hokage!

316
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,626
Hey, are you
even listening?!

317
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,696
Kiba, no one's
paying attention.

318
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,432
Frankly, it's
pitiful. Quit it.

319
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:05,203
{\an1}The reason is because the
impact of Sasuke showing up

320
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:07,706
{\an1}suddenly and declaring his
intent to become Hokage is

321
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:08,773
much too great.

322
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:12,711
{\an1}Um, Kiba? Well, I
heard you loud and clear!

323
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,881
{\an1}All of us should
aspire to be Hokage!

324
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:20,485
All right, come
on, you guys!

325
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:23,256
{\an1}Let's show 'em what
we're made of, y'know!

326
00:22:57,685 --> 00:23:01,189
{\an1}<i>Back during the Chunin</i>
<i>Exams, I thought I was a</i>

327
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:02,458
{\an1}<i>full-fledged kunoichi.</i>

328
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,461
{\an1}<i>But I ended up hiding</i>
<i>behind Sasuke and Naruto.</i>

329
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,795
{\an1}<i>I hated the way I was.</i>

330
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:11,400
{\an1}<i>I swore that next time,</i>
<i>I would make them</i>

331
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,134
{\an1}<i>stare at my back!</i>

332
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,636
{\an1}<i>And now finally, I...</i>

333
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,143
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Team 7,</i>
<i>Assemble!"</i>

334
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,411
<i>Cha!</i>
