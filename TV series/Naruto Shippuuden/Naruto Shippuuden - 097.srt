1
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,186
-This is the parasitic insect
we got from Shino, right?

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:19,686
-Yeah.

3
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,274
-Wait.

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:24,942
What's this?

5
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:35,744
-What do these strange
hexagonal patterns mean?

6
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,830
-Well, according to the
researchers' report,

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,792
they mean that even the bodily
fluids of Shino's insect

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,626
were crystallized.

9
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,882
-I see.

10
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,843
-What's the matter,
Lady Tsunade?

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,429
-I never imaged
it really existed.

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,224
-You know something
about this, milady?

13
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,601
-Mm.

14
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,854
There have long been
stories, rumors, about

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,024
a ninjutsu that
crystallizes all it touches.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,988
It was said that it could
even crystallize human blood.

17
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,865
The technique was
called crystal style.

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,618
It was reported that an
entire village was wiped out

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,245
overnight because of it.

20
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,414
But there were no
witnesses, so it

21
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,249
was dismissed as just a rumor.

22
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,502
-But now you're saying this
crystal style might exist,

23
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,628
after all?

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,754
-Yes.

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,424
The time that's elapsed
would be about right.

26
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,884
Between what happened in
that village and Kakashi

27
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,429
making contact, I
think we're dealing

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,889
with one of Orochimaru's
collections.

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,935
-Do you really think this
means Orochimaru's on the move?

30
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,147
-It's three years since
Sasuke left the village.

31
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,732
Now would be right
about the time

32
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,985
for Orochimaru's transference.

33
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,487
We have to assume that
Orochimaru is preparing

34
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,698
for his reappearance,
and we have

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,285
to use this crystal style
ninja, whoever it is,

36
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,328
to lead us to Sasuke.

37
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,294
[theme music]

38
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,445
-Hold it.

39
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,369
According to procedure,
Kakashi should

40
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,913
have left signs
for us to follow.

41
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,707
-Well, I don't know
about anyone else,

42
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,709
but I haven't seen any signs.

43
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,877
-That's great.

44
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,336
You think maybe he
forgot that we're

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,963
supposed to be following him?

46
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,631
-No, he's not like you.

47
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,093
We have to assume something
happened to his team.

48
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:20,886
-Sai.

49
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,137
-Yes?

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,556
-Get airborne and take a
look around for me, will you?

51
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,726
-Right away, Captain.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Well, it looks

54
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,989
like I got a little
free time on my hands.

55
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,282
I'll be right back, OK?

56
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,784
-What are you talking about?

57
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,118
Where do you think you're going?

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,662
-Nature calls!

59
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,580
[sigh]

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,254
-Curious.

61
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,424
I don't see the search squad,
or any signs of their trail.

62
00:04:59,424 --> 00:04:59,925
Ah?

63
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:11,937
Camellias?

64
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,450
-Gotta take every chance I
get to review my training.

65
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,536
I'm already forgetting
what I learned so far.

66
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,581
What the heck is this?

67
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,253
Huh?

68
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:40,632
Ah?

69
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,977
It's the hot springs kid!

70
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:57,983
Heh.

71
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,733
Yeah, it is you.

72
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,151
What do you know?

73
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,530
What in the world are
you doing here, kid?

74
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,867
-I've learned that not all
camellia bushes are short.

75
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,495
Camellias in the wild can grow
to be as tall as that tree.

76
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,830
-What are you talking about?

77
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,956
Kid, it's me.

78
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,584
From the hot springs?

79
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,503
-Everybody has a place
they can go home to.

80
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,215
Wherever somebody is thinking
of you, that place is home.

81
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,467
-I think I was the one
that told you that.

82
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,720
Right?

83
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,804
Well, never mind.

84
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,848
Anyway, are you on your own?

85
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,268
No family or friends?

86
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,189
-The white camellias,
they turned red.

87
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,151
After that, they
all disappeared.

88
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,154
They're all-- they're gone.

89
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,407
-So like I thought,
you're all alone.

90
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,200
Hey, listen.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,746
Why don't you come with us?

92
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,872
That's right, why not?

93
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,415
You should come back with us.

94
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,751
Right now we're on a mission,
but as soon as we finish,

95
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,377
we'll come back and get you, OK?

96
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,884
-I have something
to take care of.

97
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,929
You wait here.

98
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,889
-I have to wait.

99
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,766
-Huh?

100
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,809
-Wherever someone's
thinking of me,

101
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,062
that's where I
should go home to.

102
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,646
-Yeah.

103
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,148
That's right.

104
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,445
-I wonder if that could be--
maybe there really is someone?

105
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,655
-Sure there is.

106
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,406
There must be someone
thinking of you.

107
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,292
-When I was sick, there was
someone who took care of me.

108
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,502
-See?

109
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,005
Whoever that was is
definitely thinking of you.

110
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,091
-I hope so.

111
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:52,931
-Listen, follow the person,
and never let them go.

-Huh?

116
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,312
Sorry.

117
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,940
I've gotta be-- huh?

118
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,274
-That's weird.

119
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,110
Where'd he go?

120
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,319
It doesn't matter.

121
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,114
At least the kid's got
somewhere to go home to now.

122
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,115
-Naruto, come on.

123
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,741
We've found some
of Shino's insects.

124
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,993
We need to follow them.

125
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:13,952
-Coming!

126
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,287
-What have you been
doing out here?

127
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,664
-Sorry.

128
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,040
I ran into someone.

129
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,292
We were, uh, talking.

130
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,293
-Hm?

131
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,295
-Never mind, he's
just making it up.

132
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,589
Look, there's nobody
around here for miles.

133
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,008
-Hey, I'm not making it up.

134
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,844
He was here, I'm tellin'
ya, just a second ago.

135
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,345
I don't know where he went.

136
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,187
-What a pitiful bunch of losers.

137
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,522
-Yeah, we blew it.

138
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,899
But those guys are
tough, I'm tellin' you.

139
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,404
-Well, at least we got a look
at what our enemy is capable of.

140
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,157
Kakashi's the one we
need to worry about.

141
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,118
The first thing we need
to is get rid of him.

142
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,328
We can't allow these
fools to interfere

143
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,373
with Lord Orochimaru's plans.

144
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,417
Leave the rest to me.

GUREN (VOICEOVER): The
trap is almost ready.

The seed of the
octangular jade crystal

147
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,523
is placed in the eight trigrams,
eight square formation.

148
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,525
When it shines, the
light inside the crystal

149
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,402
will be trapped
for all eternity.

-Bloom, Crystal Style,
Jade Crystal Labyrinth.

-Shino, can you tell
which direction?

152
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,392
-No problem.

153
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,317
That's the spot where my insects
were interrupted, before they

154
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,111
could complete their net.

155
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,070
There, at 10:00.

156
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,282
-That's right, boy.

157
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,536
It's time we found out just
what these guys are up to.

158
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,328
-All right.

159
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,954
Let's go.

160
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,372
-No Wait.

161
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,165
-What is it now, Shino?

They can't find their way out.

00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,339
-What does that mean?

166
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,049
-It's hard to explain.

167
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,593
It's as if they'd suddenly
lost their sense of direction.

168
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,387
They're confused.

169
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,973
-Some sort of genjutsu?

170
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,141
-Not them.

171
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,934
Their only type of attack
was straightforward.

172
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,269
-Perhaps.

173
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,522
Or perhaps that was the only
type they'd chose to show us.

174
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,233
-You mean they kept
their powers hidden?

175
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,987
-Hinata, find out if there's
a sealing jutsu or barrier.

176
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,446
-Right.

177
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:55,947
Byakugan!

178
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,587
Hinata, what is it?

179
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,965
-I saw us, over and over.

180
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,091
Endlessly.

181
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:15,967
-The Byakugan failed?

182
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,059
-Crystal Style,
Jade Crystal Mirror.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,654
Lovely as ever, aren't you?

184
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
Jade Crystal Clone Jutsu.

185
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,673
-Looks like they've been sealed
in by some kind of barrier,

186
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,133
along with us.

187
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,719
-We thought we had them
surrounded with my insects,

188
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,055
but it seems they had
an outer perimeter

189
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,016
we didn't take into account.

190
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:05,558
[bark]

191
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,434
-Here they come!

192
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:09,854
Move!

193
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,250
-Jade Crystal Blade!

194
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,905
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
A crystallizing jutsu.

195
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,992
It can crystallize
any kind of moisture,

196
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,078
which means it can create an
infinite variety of weapons,

197
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,830
literally out of thin air.

198
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:14,085
Best if we don't let this
be a long drawn, out battle.

199
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,420
-Kakashi the copy ninja.

200
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,797
So that's your Sharingan, is it?

201
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,717
It won't do you any good.

202
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,927
My crystal style
can't be copied.

203
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:31,936
-No use.

204
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,439
I can't use my Byakugan.

205
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,108
-I've heard about
those eyes of yours.

206
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,235
But inside my Jade
Crystal, light

207
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,322
is refracted, so your
keen eyesight is actually

208
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,282
a liability.

209
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,284
-The Byakugan's
not my only weapon.

210
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,789
-Oh, please.

211
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,583
You're going to take
me on head to head?

212
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,127
How are you going to do that
when you're fighting blind?

213
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,628
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
All the training

214
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,590
I've put in, for
Naruto, to get him

215
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,801
to acknowledge my abilities.

216
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,012
-Are you that anxious to die?

217
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,972
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I
might not be at my cousin

218
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,309
Neji's level, but--
focus on your opponent.

219
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,117
-Gentle Fist!

220
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,994
Eight Trigrams, 32 Palms!

221
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,499
2 Palms!

222
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,501
4 Palms!

223
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,001
8 Palms!

224
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,966
16 Palms!

225
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:44,467
32 Palms!

226
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,892
I did it.

227
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,609
Wha--

228
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,861
-Crystal Style,
Jade Crystal Prison.

229
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,463
-What's going on?

230
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,382
[bark]

231
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:24,882
-Huh?

232
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,220
What happened?

233
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,388
-She just left.

234
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,305
I don't know why.

235
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,306
[bark]

236
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,392
-The same thing
happened with mine.

237
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,476
-Where's Hinata?

238
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,311
GUREN: Your little
friend is right here.

239
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,692
-Hinata!

240
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,151
-Dammit!

241
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,910
-What is that?

242
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,912
-It's a crystal.

243
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,582
This is the enemy's jutsu.

244
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,918
But on such a massive scale.

245
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,919
OK, Sai.

246
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,503
-Right.

247
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,838
I'm already on it.

248
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,192
And as I thought.

249
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,861
SAI: It's at least
a kilometer across.

250
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,529
-A kilometer.

251
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,157
This is the work of a
highly skilled opponent.

252
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,782
-Whatever.

253
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,075
Let's break it down.

254
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,119
-Hold on, Naruto.

255
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,787
We don't know this
barrier isn't rigged

256
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,081
with some kind of lethal
self defense system.

257
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,384
All right.

258
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,638
It doesn't respond to
contact from the outside.

259
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,348
I suspect that
Kakashi and the others

260
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,100
are trapped inside of it.

261
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,561
-If it's just holding them like
a prison, that's one thing.

262
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,648
But if it's some kind of giant
trap, that could be trouble.

263
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,442
-Captain Yamato, can't we
just bust this thing down

264
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,570
like we did to the wall
at Orochimar's hideout?

265
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,572
-It's not the same, I'm afraid.

266
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,115
This crystal is much tougher.

267
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,619
It has an incredibly
dense molecular structure.

268
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:21,791
Unlike that clay wall, the
crystal has no weak spots.

269
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:35,596
But perhaps if we tunnel
under it-- As I said,

270
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,224
there are no weak
spots anywhere.

271
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,142
Not even underground.

272
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,479
-Because of its density, a jutsu
concentrated on a single point

273
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,939
won't do any current.

274
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,940
-That's right.

275
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,358
The force of the
attack would just

276
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,904
be dispersed over the whole
surface, weakening its impact.

277
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,489
-For an attack to
work, it would have

278
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,617
to be both wide ranging
and extremely powerful.

279
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,702
-Sounds like fun.

280
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,745
-No way, Naruto!

281
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,998
-It's all right,
Sakura, don't worry.

282
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,584
It isn't that jutsu.

283
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,543
It's a different one.

284
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,545
One I've been working
on in private.

285
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,045
-Naruto.

286
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,387
-Summoning Jutsu!

287
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,308
-Yo.

288
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,726
-You called?

289
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,227
-You summoned them?

290
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,103
-Whoa.

291
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,855
When did you learn to do that?

292
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,981
Impressive.

293
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,568
-So what exactly are you
going to do with them?

294
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,987
-You'll have to wait and see.

295
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,947
We, uh, don't have
it perfected yet,

296
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,741
but we're going to
give it a shot, anyway.

297
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,913
-Don't bother.

298
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,876
Light sealed inside the Jade
Crystal can never escape.

299
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,668
Oh, I wouldn't.

300
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,427
Leave me and my followers alone,
or else your little friend

301
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,721
will end up as shattered
shards of glass.

302
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,977
-Say the word, I'm
all ready to go.

303
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,978
-OK.

304
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,521
Now, remember our
timing and focus,

305
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,981
just like we worked on before.

306
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:09,982
-Hm!

307
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,860
-What in the world
are they gonna do?

308
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,864
-All we can do is sit back
and see what they've got.

309
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,909
-Let's do it, Gamatatsu!

310
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,163
-Firstly, breathe in
deep through the nose.

311
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,292
-Now, hold it in, and
spit it out all at once.

312
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:28,793
-Now!

313
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,968
-What made me think this
time would be any different?

314
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,762
-What's wrong with
you, Gamatatsu?

315
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,180
What was that?

316
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,473
-I forget.

317
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,934
Infuse the chakra.

318
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,269
-Shape up, Gamatsu,
or no snacks for you!

319
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,396
-OK.

320
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,898
Pull yourself together,
and let's try it again!

321
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,151
-Infuse the chakra in
the tummy and focus it,

322
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,822
and take a deep breath
in through the nose.

323
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,409
-Hold it in, and let
it out all at once!

324
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
-Wind Style, Toad Water Pistol!

325
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,341
-Heh, heh, heh.

326
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,180
-What do you know about that?

327
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,181
We did it!

328
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,981
[theme music]

329
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
YAMATO: Naruto,
what was that jutsu?

330
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,572
-The collaboration ninjutsu
I made with Pervy Sage.

331
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,449
YAMATO: You're in a bit
of a tricky situation,

332
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,575
aren't you, Kakashi?

333
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,618
KAKASHI: I'll say.

334
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,454
As you can see, Hinata's
been taken hostage.

335
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,332
-Gamatatsu, ready for one more?

336
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,250
-Sure.

337
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,459
What's the plan?

338
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,919
NARUTO: I've got an idea.

339
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,504
All right, let's do it.

340
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,463
GAMATATSU: Right.

341
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,840
-Wait, Naruto!

342
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,968
-Collaboration Ninjutsu, Wind
Style, Toad Water Pistol!

343
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,509
Next time, The Target Appears!
