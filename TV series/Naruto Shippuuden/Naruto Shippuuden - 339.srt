1
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,045
[scream]

2
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:14,946
[gasp]

3
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,664
{\an1}They're too strong!

4
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:35,267
Just how are we
supposed to--

5
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,404
{\an1}Yes, you're right. At
this rate, we'll...

6
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:41,641
[battle cry]

7
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,649
{\an1}Hokage! You're getting
sloppy with your fighting!

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,950
[grunting]

9
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,953
{\an1}You keep it up, and soon
you'll have no stamina left.

10
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:59,793
{\an1}I've put my life on the line
here! No saving strength;
I'll give it my all!

11
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,594
[wet cough]

12
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,962
Hokage!

13
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,601
No!

14
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:17,311
{\an7}<i>Damn! How could I have let</i>
<i>this happen?! I've fallen</i>
<i>prey to the Sharingan's</i>
<i>Genjutsu?</i>

15
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,598
Release!

16
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,166
{\an1}Thank you, Tsuchikage.

17
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:41,770
Damn Ohnoki...

18
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:45,039
{\an1}His wisdom in battle is
beginning to show...

19
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:51,246
{\an4}He stopped the Susano'o
with the Weighted Boulder
Jutsu...and managed to
save the Raikage.

20
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:57,653
{\an1}Get up, fellow Kage! We
fight a battle to the end,
no whining, no complaining!

21
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:07,062
{\an4}We are the Five Kage! So
choose final words that will
not shame the title you
hold!

22
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,400
{\an1}We entrusted Naruto
to fight his battle!

23
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:16,806
{\an4}And we swore to win this
fight that he entrusted to
us, no matter what! Don't
forget that!

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,279
{\an1}And there is one more thing...
Each and every shinobi has
entrusted us with one duty.

25
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:31,954
{\an1}All of us have to be worthy
of the title of Kage!

26
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:43,902
So Ohnoki is the
problem, after all.

27
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:47,438
{\an1}I have no choice but
to break his will.

28
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,216
{\an1}Princess! I need more!

29
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,653
{\an1}You don't have to tell me!

30
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:41,423
{\an1}There's not much chakra in
me! This could be our last
stand.

31
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,929
{\an1}Particle Style! Boundary
Dismantling Jutsu!

32
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:54,871
{\an1}My Susano'o kept me from
absorbing the Particle Style
properly!

33
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,747
{\an1}I told you that only
physical attacks will work
against me.

34
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:09,619
{\an1}You think you've eliminated
my clones and distracted me
with Particle Style?

35
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,895
{\an1}You can't hold us
off for long!

36
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:27,004
{\an7}<i>If you don't like the</i>
<i>sand, just stop absorbing</i>
<i>the jutsu! Although then,</i>
<i>you'll be zapped by</i>

37
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:30,374
{\an7}<i>the Lightning Water Dragon</i>
<i>and be immobilized.</i>

38
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:34,845
{\an1}Once that happens, I'll get
you with Particle Style for
sure! And that'll give us

39
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:36,881
enough time to
seal you away!

40
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,515
Don't you see?!

41
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,920
{\an1}This is the full power
of the Five Kage!

42
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:48,359
{\an1}I see... Indeed, this is truly
worthy of the shinobi who
bear the name Kage.

43
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:53,465
{\an1}Then I, Madara Uchiha, shall
also respond with full
power!

44
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,504
{\an1}Even the Five Kage are
nothing compared to the
power that I wield!

45
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:09,414
{\an1}This is it! Meet the
Perfect Susano'o!

46
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:15,988
It's huge!

47
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,231
Is- Is this...?!

48
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,367
{\an1}...the True Susano'o?!

49
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,738
Not quite...

50
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:33,472
Settle!

51
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:58,166
{\an1}The big one's chakra has
stabilized... [gasp]

52
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:04,372
{\an1}He's just so strong! I can't
believe Grandfather fought
someone like him!

53
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:09,410
{\an1}I already explained this to
all of you... Only Hashirama
could stop me.

54
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:12,613
{\an1}And he is no longer with us.

55
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:20,455
{\an1}Though in a way you could
say that actually works out
better for you. Because...

56
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:30,298
[screaming]

57
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,392
It's just me...

58
00:07:57,026 --> 00:08:01,030
{\an1}So after all this, the maps
will only need to be redrawn
a little bit.

59
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:05,802
{\an1}Impossible! He split
the mountain!

60
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:10,340
{\an1}This is... Madara
Uchiha's strength?!

61
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,542
{\an1}Then why earlier?

62
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:23,587
{\an1}Why did you hold back
against us?

63
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:29,227
{\an1}What adult would go
full-force when fighting
mere children? But anyway...

64
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,729
{\an1}Are you finished now?

65
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,598
{\an1}It may be true that we're
stumbling in the dark right
now, but we're also close to

66
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,067
the light at the
end of the tunnel!

67
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,436
{\an1}Here, of all places!

68
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:18,010
{\an1}My Susano'o is destruction
incarnate.

69
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:23,449
{\an4}A single stroke of the blade
contains enough power to
smash all things in this
universe.

70
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,384
{\an1}It rivals even the
Tailed Beasts!

71
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:31,592
{\an1}Be crushed and begone, Kage!
You and your pathetic
philosophy!

72
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,594
Ne Ushi...

73
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,429
Saru...

74
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:36,730
Tora...

75
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:39,032
Tatsu...

76
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,202
I...

77
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,243
{\an8}<i>That's it, huh?</i>

78
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,411
All right... Ne...

79
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:54,514
Ushi...

80
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:58,353
Saru...

81
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,794
{\an1}I guess... it won't matter
what I say, will it?

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,170
{\an1}As soon as I saw you... I
tailed you because I wanted
to confirm whether or not

83
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:18,374
Tobi and Danzo
told me the truth.

84
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,378
{\an1}But that wasn't the only
thing that I was able to
verify.

85
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:27,583
{\an1}When I'm with you, I
remember things.

86
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:31,654
{\an1}Childhood feelings, of
adoring my big brother....

87
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:39,029
{\an1}That's the reason why...

88
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,934
{\an1}...the closer I get to you,
the closer we become to how
we were before, as brothers...

89
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,569
{\an1}...And the more I
understand you.

90
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:52,410
{\an1}The more that I come to hate
the Hidden Leaf Village for
causing you so much pain!

91
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,745
{\an1}I hate it more now than I've
ever hated it before!

92
00:10:57,348 --> 00:11:01,385
{\an1}I know what you want me to
do, how you want me to be.

93
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,757
{\an4}You're my big brother,
so I know you're going
to disapprove. But it's
because I'm your

94
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,162
{\an1}brother that no matter what
you say, you're not going to
stop me!

95
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,864
{\an1}Even if you protect the
village now...

96
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,600
...I will still
destroy it someday.

97
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,035
Tora...

98
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,341
Tatsu...

99
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,112
So it's goodbye...

100
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,413
{\an8}I...

101
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,452
{\an1}Reanimation Jutsu, Release!

102
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:37,789
Big Brother!

103
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:28,443
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage...It's
unfortunate, but I think
this is the end.

104
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:30,412
{\an1}Silence, Mizukage!

105
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:33,180
I'm not going
to give up yet!

106
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,225
{\an1}What is going on?

107
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:53,502
{\an1}Something has happened
to the jutsu caster.

108
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:08,117
{\an1}There is still time.

109
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,195
{\an1}I can feel myself slowly
losing consciousness now...

110
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:25,968
{\an1}I must tell you everything
before I say goodbye and we
part for good.

111
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,040
There is no need
to lie anymore.

112
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,009
{\an1}The night I left you...

113
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:40,150
{\an1}I did everything Danzo and
Tobi told you I did.

114
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:41,685
[gasp]

115
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:45,590
I'll show you...
the entire truth.

116
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,337
{\an7}<i>These are Itachi's</i>
<i>memories!</i>

117
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:04,342
{\an1}It seems we can't prevent
the Uchiha coup-d'état.

118
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:11,282
{\an4}And if civil war erupts in
the Leaf, the other villages
will invade for sure. True
war will break out.

119
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:18,190
{\an5}When I tried to
stop all this with
the Koto Amatsukami,
Danzo stole my right eye.

120
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,026
That man doesn't
trust me at all.

121
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,998
{\an4}He intends to protect the
village his way, no matter
what it takes or how it
looks.

122
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,536
{\an4}I suspect he'll come after
my left eye, so I'll give it
to you before he has a
chance.

123
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,573
{\an8}<i>Shisui...</i>

124
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,875
{\an1}You're the only one I can
count on, my best friend.

125
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,247
{\an1}Protect the village. And the
Uchiha name. Both of them.

126
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,784
{\an1}We cannot condone
this any longer.

127
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:50,256
{\an1}If they're going to start a
revolution and use it to try
to usurp our power.

128
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,928
{\an1}Then we have no choice but
to judge the Uchiha as
traitors to the Hidden Leaf!

129
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,530
{\an1}Please wait, Koharu.

130
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,765
{\an1}Don't rush to conclusions.

131
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:03,236
{\an1}However, Hiruzen, the Uchiha
Clan will not be dissuaded.

132
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,741
{\an4}And since that is, in fact,
the case, we must take
measures to avoid any
mayhem.

133
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,681
{\an1}That includes innocent
children, too.

134
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,219
{\an1}Don't say such things in
front of Itachi!

135
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:23,224
{\an1}Besides which, a battle
against the Uchiha will be
far from an easy task.

136
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,960
{\an1}We must plan our strategy
very carefully.

137
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,363
{\an1}We're in a race against
time, here.

138
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:33,101
{\an1}We ought to strike them
preemptively, before they
can make their first move.

139
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:37,472
{\an1}If we join forces, and use
our respective Black Ops to
launch a surprise attack

140
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,642
{\an1}from behind, we'll
end this fast.

141
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:44,546
The Uchiha are
comrades in arms.

142
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:48,016
{\an1}I would like to use words
first before violence.

143
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,919
I will come up
with a strategy.

144
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:52,787
Itachi...

145
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,993
{\an1}It doesn't have to be long
But buy me as much time as
you can.

146
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:05,167
{\an4}Despite what Lord Third
said, he will move to
protect the Leaf if push
comes to shove.

147
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,370
That's the kind
of man he is.

148
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:08,971
In which case...

149
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:15,244
{\an1}As the Hokage, even Hiruzen
will have to take decisive
measures.

150
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,484
{\an4}Whether it starts a war or
not, once the coup d'état
happens, the Uchiha will
lock themselves

151
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:23,186
{\an1}into a fate of getting
annihilated.

152
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,157
{\an1}Including your innocent
little brother, who knows
nothing.

153
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,029
{\an1}However, there is a way to
spare just your brother
prior to any revolt.

154
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:36,333
{\an1}If things come to pass, your
brother will likely come to
know everything.

155
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:40,804
{\an1}And if he witnesses a Leaf
Shinobi slaughtered his
entire clan, he will develop

156
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:43,508
a vengeful heart
towards the Leaf.

157
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:49,180
{\an1}And then I'm afraid that he,
unfortunately, he will have
to die as well.

158
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:50,948
{\an1}Is that a threat?

159
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:55,820
{\an1}No, I'd just like you to
make a choice...

160
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:05,163
{\an4}Either align yourself with
the Uchiha, launch the coup
d'état, and die along with
the rest of your clan...

161
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:10,001
{\an1}Or side with the Leaf, save
your little brother before
the revolt, and then help us

162
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:13,205
{\an1}eliminate all the
other Uchiha.

163
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:19,144
{\an4}But no matter what happens,
to protect the Leaf, this
must be quelled before
mayhem arises.

164
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:25,884
{\an4}The only one that can handle
this mission is you, a
double agent for both the
Uchiha and the Leaf.

165
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,119
Itachi...

166
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:29,154
{\an1}There is no one else...

167
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:37,197
{\an1}Itachi this will likely be
the most painful mission for
you...

168
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,267
{\an1}But on the other hand, it
will allow your little
brother to be spared.

169
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,706
{\an1}I know you care about the
village as much as I...

170
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:49,943
Will you accept
this mission?

171
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,794
{\an1}How did you know about me?

172
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:10,898
{\an4}You slipped through
the highest level of Leaf
Security and went to
examine the Nakano

173
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,434
Shrine's secret
stone tablet.

174
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,672
{\an1}Only the Uchiha are
aware of its location.

175
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:25,614
{\an4}After that, I studied your
movements, and looked into
what kind of character you
are and what your ideology is.

176
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,816
Well, that saves
me much time.

177
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:34,857
{\an4}For then you already know
that I am an Uchiha myself
and bear hatred toward both
the Leaf and my own clan...

178
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,325
I have terms...

179
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:43,231
{\an4}I'll help you exact revenge
upon the Uchiha Clan. But
you are not to harm the
village itself.

180
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:45,333
Nor...

181
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,136
Sasuke Uchiha.

182
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:55,211
{\an7}<i>Now I regret not telling you</i>
<i>everything before it had</i>
<i>come to this.</i>

183
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:07,524
{\an1}I see... So you've aligned
with the other side?

184
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:10,494
Father...

185
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:11,662
Mother...

186
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:13,897
I just...

187
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,799
{\an1}We already know, Itachi.

188
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,536
Itachi, just
promise me this.

189
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:24,007
That you'll take
care of Sasuke.

190
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,549
I will.

191
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,619
Do not fear it.

192
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,388
This is the path
you have chosen.

193
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:41,960
{\an1}Compared to yours, our pain
will be over in an instant.

194
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:46,966
{\an1}Our philosophies may differ,
but I'm still proud of you.

195
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,705
{\an1}You are truly a kind child.

196
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:02,982
{\an1}There's nothing more to say.

197
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,921
I have told you
the whole truth...

198
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,858
{\an1}I won't have to ever again...

199
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,765
{\an1}I have always lied
to you and asked....

200
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:23,770
{\an1}...for your forgiveness while
keeping you at a distance.

201
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,706
{\an1}Because I wanted to
keep you out of this.

202
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:29,843
{\an1}But now, I think...

203
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:37,784
{\an4}That perhaps you could have
changed Father, Mother, and
the rest of the Uchiha as
well.

204
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:45,525
{\an4}If I had only come to you
from the start, looked
straight into your eyes and
told you the truth.

205
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,998
{\an4}Then I wouldn't have to
stand before you as a
failure, telling you all of
this.

206
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:56,470
{\an1}But I want to impart at
least this much truth to
you...

207
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,647
{\an1}You don't ever have
to forgive me.

208
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:11,285
{\an1}And whatever you do from
here on out, know this...

209
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:18,427
{\an1}No matter what, I will
love you always.

210
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:02,234
{\an1}<i>Naruto! The Jinchuriki are</i>
<i>gonna quit it! Looks like</i>
<i>Itachi did it!</i>

211
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:07,339
{\an1}<i>Thanks, Itachi! Then this</i>
<i>means that the other battles</i>
<i>are...</i>

212
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:10,010
{\an1}<i>Curse Kabuto. He has failed.</i>

213
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:13,279
{\an1}<i>Hey, what do you think</i>
<i>you're looking at? We're</i>
<i>still fighting!</i>

214
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:16,348
{\an1}<i>It looks like the</i>
<i>Reanimation Jutsu</i>
<i>has been released.</i>

215
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:21,154
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Reanimation</i>
<i>Jutsu: Release!"</i>

216
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:23,457
<i>And? What of it?</i>
