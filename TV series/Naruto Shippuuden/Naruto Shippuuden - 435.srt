{\an1}Deities supposedly live in those
shrines, so you know what you're
asking for...?

150
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:58,569
{\an1}...For divine punishment!

Hm?

153

{\an1}Okay... C'mon, let's go and meet
this Lord Mashima.

00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,884
{\an1}Come on! Bring it!  I'll filet
you into three pieces!

157
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,488
Nagato! Now!

159
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,505

{\an1}What!? There's another one?!

162
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,387
{\an1}Leave us alone!

163
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,261

HUman Boulder!

Argh!

167
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,308
{\an1}Oh, no!  Komichi, look out!

168
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,713
Huh?

169
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:39,290
{\an1}Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
Now complete!

170
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:45,126
So you guys....

171
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,993
{\an1}You actually came.

172
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:56,199
Heh.

173
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,734
{\an1}What do you think has happened
to Neji and Naruto?

174
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,135
{\an1}And what was that thing?!

175
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:05,736
{\an1}It's probably some
time-space ninjutsu.

176
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,371
{\an1}But who's able to use a ninjutsu
that's as high-level as that
one?

177
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:13,675
{\an1}Damn it. Thanks to him, we just
have more trouble to deal with.

178

180
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,882
Where are we?

181
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,217
I don't know.

182
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,288
Are you the one who's
responsible for all of this?

183
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:43,357
{\an1}Listen up! Return Kakashi
Sensei and everyone else
from the Leaf!

184
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,059
{\an1}Or else you're gonna get it,
seriously big time!

185
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,197
{\an1}Naruto, you need to get away
from him right now.

186
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:58,465
{\an7}Look, stay out of this, all
right?!  I'm about to settle
this whole thing right here and
right now!

187
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,833
Just listen,
look at his eye...

188
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:09,538
[gasp] The Byakugan!

189
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:13,506
{\an1}You're no match for someone
who possesses that.

190
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,641
Hmph.

191
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:19,843
{\an1}Who exactly are you? How do
you possess the Byakugan?

192
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:25,080
{\an1}Hold on... Don't tell me you
have ties to the Hyuga!

193
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,848
{\an1}Look at the cloud of dust...

194
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:31,650
{\an1}Your comrades are the ones...
who are responsible for that.

195
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:35,852
What happened?

196
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:40,188
{\an1}They put the rules of their
village ahead of the lives of
children.

197
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:47,424
{\an1}So many years have passed... and
yet the Hidden Leaf hasn't
changed one single bit.

198
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,194
And what would you know
about the Hidden Leaf?

199
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:56,030
{\an1}Oh, I know plenty. In fact, I
know more than anyone who's
here at the moment.
