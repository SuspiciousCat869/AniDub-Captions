-Lord Hokage, what is this?

-Oh, what luck
that you found it.

12
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:45,742
A white snake must have shed
that skin when it molted.

They're extremely rare.

You're lucky to have found it.

18
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,775
Not many get to see one.

19
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,042
-Why was its skin so white?

20
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,942
-I don't really know.

21
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,975
As far as I'm aware, no one
has ever bothered to find out.

22
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,375
I know that since ancient
times, the white snake

23
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,142
has been viewed as a symbol
of both good luck and renewal.

24
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:14,009
-Good luck and renewal--

25

[music playing]

26
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,775
-It was your karma that led
you to discover it today.

27
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,509
Perhaps this snake skin
is a sign telling you

28
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,209
that your parents have
been reborn somewhere.

29
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:29,409
And if that's true, perhaps
you could meet them again

30
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,175
when you're grown up.

31
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,709
-How long until that
happens, Hokage?

32
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,109
-I can't say.

-Why are humans such
fragile creatures?

49
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,709
The human body contains
an abundance of power.

50
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:02,075
What remains unused in a
lifetime stays trapped inside.

51
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,809
If we could just
release all that power--

52
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:09,709
-Orochimaru Sensei, what
is this thing in here?

53
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,175
-That is an amulet.

54
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,409
-An amulet?

55
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,809
This thing?

00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,709
[laugh]

57
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,809
-Yes, it's quite rare.

58
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,542
I've never seen another like it.

59
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:23,775
It symbolizes both
good luck and renewal.

60
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,175
-Renewal, really?

61
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,875
Well OK.

62
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,775
But Orochimaru Sensei, no
matter how hard you research,

63
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,309
you can't really bring
back the dead, can you?

64
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:34,542
[chuckle]

65
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,142
-Well, no.

66
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:39,509
It's far too difficult to
bring the dead back to life.

67
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:44,309
But Anko, my research has given
me clues about regeneration.

68
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:47,175
By activating the full
potential locked in our bodies,

69
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,375
we can become
incredibly powerful.

70
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,642
And in addition, we'll
be able to heighten

71
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,242
our regenerative powers.

72
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,042
And someday very
soon, Anko, I'll

73
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,742
be able to share that
power with you, as well.

74
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:04,875
-Yes, I'd like that very
much, Orochimaru Sensei.

75
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,242
-The key must be
the body activating

76
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,675
jutsu known as the curse mark.

So this is the power
of the Sharingan.

No matter how hard
a ninja trains,

86
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,309
they could never
surpass the Uchiha clan.

I understand the staggering
power of this jutsu formula.

91
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,609
But it would take me a
month, at the very least,

92
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:56,875
to master this forbidden jutsu.

93
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,009
And what of all these others?

94
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:03,742
How many years would it take
to learn all the jutsu that

95
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,642
is stored here in
these musty tomes?

96
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:10,509
It's simply impossible to
master even a fraction of all

97
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:15,342
the jutsu within the limited
time of a human lifespan.

98
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,375
I could never learn it all,
even if I could extend my life

99
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:21,509
with the reanimation jutsu.

100
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:27,842
Once I died, all my knowledge
and skill would be lost.

101
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,209
The only way to master
every jutsu would be to--

known I'd find you.

106
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,242
Now speak.

107
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:44,642
Tell me exactly what
you were doing here.

108
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,475
[laugh]

109
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:51,342
-Even if I did tell you, you
probably wouldn't understand.

110
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,609
You foolishly put the
needs of the Village

111
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:56,709
ahead of unlocking all of
the mysteries of nature.

112
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:01,342
To me, the lifespan of the
human body is too short.

113
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,675
Even if I did rise to
the position of Hokage,

114
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,109
once I died, everything
I'd learned and mastered

115
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,542
would be lost forever.

experimenting with that jutsu

here?

-Yes, the very one.

I want the immortality jutsu.

How foolish do you think I am?

Stop now, when I'm
so close to seeing

124
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,875
my research come to fruition?

125
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,809
Impossible.

126

Everything will be mine.

00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:44,009
I won't be contained by the Leaf
Village or even by my own body.

To achieve my goals, I'll

they meet the air.

167
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,889
They have a numbing
effect, and I

168
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,956
see they're already
weakening you.

169
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,356
I am immortal.

170
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,056
I am eternal.

171
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,156
Even your most powerful jutsu
can't come close to killing me.

172
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,889
Now, let me take you!

173
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:40,956
[bubbling]

174
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,022
-Where am I?

[laugh]

176
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,722
OROCHIMARU: This is the
universe inside of me.

177
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:52,689
This is where the transference
ritual will be held.

-What remarkable visual prowess.

183
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,222
This is magnificent.

184
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:22,922
It's as if I'm living
that moment all over.

OROCHIMARU: Those eyes-- this
time, those eyes are mine.

189
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,256
-No medicine will help him now.

190
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,756
Tomorrow, or better
yet today-- the

191
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,089
sooner we perform the
ritual, the better.

192
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:02,122
It's funny, I can't
imagine Sasuke

193
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,522
will go along without a fuss.

194

[laugh]

195
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:15,256
-Hm, still it's not like he
could do a thing about it, not

196
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,089
against that ritual.

197
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,156
Huh?

Oh, the giant snake
has shed its skin.

202
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,489
So, has the ritual
already taken place?

-Is that Kabuto?

210
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,189
Exactly which one are you?

211
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:57,289
[eerie music playing]

212
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:00,722

[music playing]

00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:22,056
-This is the
transference ritual.

215
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,422
He's showing me what happened.

216
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:29,656
This is it, the moment where
the outcome of the ritual

217
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:30,889
is decided.

-But how?

223
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,122
This can't be.

224
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,622
I created this universe.

225
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:07,256
I control all here.

226
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,522
No, it's impossible.

227
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,722
This is my own space.

[growl]

00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:31,922

[gasp]

233
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,656
-How terrifying.

234
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:38,022
Sasuke's will alone is
eroding this universe.

[growl]

236

OROCHIMARU: No, I will
not allow this to happen.

237
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:49,756
I am the immortal Orochimaru.

238
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,422
I am invincible.

239
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,489
I will not die here.

240
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:58,589
This will not happen to
me, especially not here.

241
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:03,056
I-- I am the one who will
unlock the mysteries of nature.

242
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:05,622
I am the one who will
receive everything.

have absorbed him completely

and nothing at all remains.

NARRATOR: Three long
years have passed

267
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:09,121
since he severed all
ties, buried his feelings,

268
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,921
and focused solely on
training for his goal.

269
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,721
Now, with Orochimaru's
power in his hands,

270
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:16,821
it's time for him
to take action.

271
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,354
But what awaits him when
he achieves his goal?

272
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:22,521
What will he find on the other
side of the path he's walking?

273
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,854
Will he find light or
will he find darkness?

Next time, "Zabuza's Blade."
