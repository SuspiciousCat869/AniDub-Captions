00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,536
Was I really ever that young?

00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:46,787
-Congratulations on delivering
the Feudal Lord safely.

8
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,667
-What do you disapprove of now?

9
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,144
I protected the Feudal
Lord as you asked.

10
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:02,015
I saved the King's life.

11
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,918
Why won't you acknowledge
what I've done?

12
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,394
-The King, eh?

13
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:12,132
-You refuse to give me
even a little credit, Dad?

14
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,872
-You still don't understand
how long and difficult

15
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:19,244
it will be-- the struggle
to protect the King.

16
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,950
You still don't see
how important it is.

17
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,420
-I admit we lost many
men on the mission.

18
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:28,862
But such sacrifice is
part of being a Shinobi.

00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,264
-Huh.

20
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,171
It will be a long time, I
foresee, before you understand.

21
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:37,744
Before you grasp what it really
means to protect the King.

I'm finally starting

28
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,453
to understand what you meant.

29
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:05,025
I'm sorry I used to duck
out of the village the way

30
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,962
I did, going off on my own.

31
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,409
Not that I regret any of it.

32
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,497
Maybe it wasn't
so bad, after all,

33
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:30,870
being born into
the Sarutobi clan.

34
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:34,277
You fulfilled your duty
as leader of the village.

35
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,345
I see that now.

36
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:43,859
I see how good a
father you were.

take a little break now?

00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:02,370
-Yeah, we're not used
to this kind of work.

you know that?

just went through.

53
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,987
Naruto and the others just
put their lives on the line

to save our village

-Well, this isn't
like you, my lady.

94
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:37,169
You never used to take your
work quite so seriously before.

troubles has spread

to neighboring lands
and the Feudal Lord.

102
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,173
We're a laughing stock.

103
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,544
And it's all because of you.

104
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,815
Your orders were
slow and confused.

105
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,019
-Your lack of
leadership jeopardizes

106
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,956
the safety of the Leaf village.

107
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:10,462
Along with the title of
Hokage comes responsibilities.

108
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,270
It's time you started
taking them seriously.

to me like that?

Who knows what they would have
said if they'd walked in here

00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:24,653
and seen all that work
piled up on my desk.

00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,394
Almost forgot.

116
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,864
A report just came in
from the-- uh-- man

117
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,934
you sent to look
for Master Jiraiya.

118
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:33,703
Here.

119
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,904
-Huh?

120
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:35,906
His report?

121
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:36,674
So he's back?

Sneaking out like that before
your injuries had healed.

124
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:54,705
And what did it get you?

125
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,543
Right back in the hospital.

Oh, boy.

You're acting really
random these days, Sai.

-Hmm?

135
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:15,876
What's wrong?

136
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,648
-It also says, when
a woman feeds you,

137
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,453
it's a sure sign
that she likes you.

138

It's not like I'm
testing you, or anything.

-For goodness' sake.

140
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,698
Give me a break, will you?

141
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:28,632
-Ahh, Sakura.

142
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,034
-Huh?

143
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,570
-I'm already stuffed.

144
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,309
I couldn't eat
another bite, really.

145
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,312
Oh, well, if you insist, Sakura.

146
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:37,013
OK.

147
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:40,720
For you, maybe I can--

148
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:43,893
-I hope you choke on it!

149
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:45,929
-Hey, guys.

150
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:46,831
Huh?

151
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,468
[muffled shouting]

152
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:53,376
-The manner in which Sakura
fed Naruto that apple--

153
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,978
it must mean that she--

154
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,182
-Aaaah, help me!

155
00:09:57,216 --> 00:10:00,021
Why do I have to be on a
team with these morons?

156
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:00,788
-Huh?

157
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:02,692
Uh-- what's going on?

158
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:14,246
-I've confirmed that attacks
on seven different villages

159
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,349
in five neighboring lands
have been carried out

160
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,152
by the same pair of Shinobi.

161
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,792
While there's been no incursion
into the Land of Fire as yet,

162
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,229
I have to believe that
it's only a matter of time.

163
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,007
-Lady Tsunade?

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,743
-Hmm.

165
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:34,781
(VOICEOVER) So the Akatsuki
have finally shown their hand.

166
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,076
-Let's finish it.

167
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:52,980
-Not yet.

168
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:57,222
Before doing that, you know that
I have to confer with my lord.

169
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,200
-You can be such a pain
in the neck sometimes.

170
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,704
-It's a pain in the neck
for me as well, you know,

171
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:09,376
but the commandments are
strict, so I have no choice.

172
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,226
-Ha.

173
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,395
You idiots.

174
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,699
You think you have me
trapped, don't you?

175
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,103
Well, you haven't.

176
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:27,575
In fact, I'm the
who's trapped you.

177
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,451
Ha.

178
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,670
Now that I know you're both
members of the Akatsuki,

179
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,340
I can't let you escape.

180
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,478
-Well, look at that.

181
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,217
We walked into a trap, Kakuzu.

182
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,284
-No matter.

183
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,522
This makes things even easier.

184
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:58,462
-I'm Yugito Nii of
the Hidden Cloud.

185
00:11:58,495 --> 00:11:59,664
And you're dead.

186
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,634
-Hey, hey, careful.

187
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,571
You want to watch making
threats like that.

188
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:05,908
When people get all
full of themselves

189
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,811
and start throwing around
a lot of tough talk,

190
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:09,815
it really gets me annoyed.

191
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,788
And when I get annoyed,
pretty soon I get mad.

192
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:14,557
And then I lose my temper!

193
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,927
-Shut up, Hidan.

194
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,329
-OK, OK.

195
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,100
I'm just saying.

196
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,969
When I lose my
temper, I sometimes

197
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:24,541
get an overwhelming urge to
forget about the objective

198
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,678
and smash everything in my path.

199
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,647
-Knock it off.

200
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,852
Our mission is
clear and absolute.

201
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,222
-Heh.

202
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:35,394
Yeah well, this whole mission
goes against all my beliefs.

203
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:38,632
The way of Jashin
is total slaughter.

204
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,068
There's even an
actual commandment

205
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:42,639
that prohibits half-killing.

206
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,710
I don't really feel
like doing a job that

207
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,415
requires me to
break a commandment.

208
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:51,455
I may not look it, but
I'm a very pious person.

209
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:56,631
So to have to resist killing
you is a huge struggle for me.

210
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,736
Perhaps we can resolve
this through negotiation.

211
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,307
-Through negotiation?

212
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:03,376
(VOICEOVER) Is he insane?

213
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:07,316
-Hmm.

214
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:11,624
[laughter]

215
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,792
-Come on.

216
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,595
Why don't you just
surrender and come with us?

217
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,777
-You must be joking.

218
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,947
-I guess I'll take
that as a no, then.

219
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,149
-Are you an idiot?

220
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:38,304
[roaring]

221
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:50,559
-Oh, come on.

222
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:51,727
Are you kidding me?

223
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,634
[growling]

224
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,406
-What kind of
Jinchuriki is this?

225
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,378
She's completely turned herself
over to the tailed beast.

226
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:02,880
[growling]

227
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:05,885
-Oh!

228
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,386
-Uh-oh.

229
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:27,390
Ah.

230
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,960
This stupid thing.

231
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,831
It must like its supper hot.

232
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,100
[growling]

233
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:36,206
-So that must be the Two-Tails
Cat Spirit, also known

234
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,541
as the Wraith.

235
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:41,014
Well, I guess this means I'm
the mouse in the trap, huh?

236
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:41,848
Ha, ha.

237
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,951
I am not amused.

238
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:46,792
-So.

239
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,628
I hear you guys did all
right for yourselves

240
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:49,963
while I was gone.

241
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:53,536
-Speaking of which, where were
you, anyway, Kakashi-sensei?

242
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,444
-Eh, nowhere special.

243
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,213
-Asuma-sensei.

244
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,347
-Huh?

245
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,051
-I thought you'd be here.

246
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,987
I need to talk to you, Kakashi.

247
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,791
-Really?

248
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:08,529
-I mean, if you've got a minute.

249
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:10,400
Oh, Naruto, Sai.

250
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,801
I brought a get-well present.

251
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,405
-No, no, no!

252
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:15,241
I don't even want to
see another apple.

253
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,417
-So.

254
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,220
I hear you went out to
get a look at what's

255
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:23,822
going on out there.

256
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,858
-Something like that.

257
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:35,910
-Beautiful day, huh?

258
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:37,379
-Hmm?

259
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:40,452
Yes, it is.

260
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:44,592
-Naruto and Sakura are
certainly coming a long well.

261
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:45,761
-Yeah, they are.

262
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:48,533
But so are Shikamaru,
Choji, and Ino.

263
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:52,005
The next generation
is growing up fast.

264
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,443
They'll be leaving us in
the dust before you know it.

265
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,380
-Hey, wait a minute.

266
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,484
I'm not ready to
pack it in just yet.

267
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,754
[laughter]

268
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:06,197
-Still, their progress is
good news for the Leaf.

269
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,167
-Hmm.

270
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,341
Well, what did you
want to talk about?

271
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,378
-Eh-- well, it's like this.

272
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,419
-There you are.

273
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,821
Just who I was looking for.

274
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,125
-Hello, Kunani.

275
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,861
What's going on?

276
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,297
-I just came here to find Asuma.

277
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:30,005
-I see.

278
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,410
So anyway, what
was on your mind?

279
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,018
-Oh, that's all right.

280
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:38,754
It's something that can wait.

281
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:39,556
No big deal.

282
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,972
-(VOICEOVER) Now he's
really got me wondering.

283
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,315
-Huh?

284
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,418
What do you think
you're doing, Naruto?

285
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:59,691
-I don't have time to be lying
around here in a hospital bed.

286
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:01,395
I've got to get
back to my training.

287
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:02,997
The clock's ticking.

288
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:05,501
-Well, that may be,
but you're still not--

289
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,178
-You don't have to say it.

290
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,281
I'm still not strong enough.

291
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:14,985
But that's why.

292
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:17,289
That's my whole point.

293
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:20,060
I have to make
myself strong enough

294
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,732
to master this power
of mine so that I

295
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:27,773
can use it to protect
people, not hurt them.

296
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,076
-Naruto--

297
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:29,977
-Woah.

298
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:31,280
Hold your horses.

299
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,615
-Hmm?

300
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:35,688
-For right now, healing those
injuries is your training.

301
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,991
-Oh, come on, sensei.

302
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:38,993
-Listen up.

303
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:41,732
And this goes especially
for you, Naruto.

304
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,134
-Huh?

305
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,140
-The next phase of your training
will be so severe, so intense,

306
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,710
that if you leave this
hospital before you're ready,

307
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,246
you'll wish you hadn't.

308
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,415
[gulp]

309
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:54,186
-I was only-- OK, OK.

310
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,122
I understand.

311
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,491
-(VOICEOVER) Hmm.

312
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,325
There.

313
00:17:57,358 --> 00:18:00,197
That ought to make him stay put.

314
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,265
-Sakura.

315
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,635
-Um, yes?

316
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,204
-I have some things
to take care of,

317
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:06,574
so I leave their
supervision to you.

318
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,511
-Uh--

319
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,715
-Just make sure they
don't overdo it.

320
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:10,983
You know what I mean.

321
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:11,884
See you.

322
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,361
-He's so slick, the
way he does that.

323
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,941
-I've read your report.

324
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:27,912
Are you sure that Naruto
can learn this new jutsu?

325
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,859
Well, Kakashi?

326
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:35,459
-No.

327
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,495
I'm not sure.

328
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,498
-What?

329
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:41,203
-I can't say for certain.

330
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,907
But I think he probably can.

331
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:46,110
The new training
regimen is working well,

332
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:54,292
and more importantly, he'll have
a clear and powerful objective.

333
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,227
-Sasuke Uchiha.

334
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:33,294
-It's been 30 minutes already.

335
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,131
Aren't you done yet?

336
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:36,400
-Will you shut up?

337
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:39,838
You're interrupting the ritual.

338
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:40,674
Ow.

339
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:42,878
Ugh.

340
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:46,284
-You perform that vulgar
prayer each and every time.

341
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,721
Can't you abbreviate it at all?

342
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,124
Let's get going.

343
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,728
-I find it tedious, but a
commandment is a commandment.

344
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,966
It must be obeyed.

345
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,937
And how dare you
suggest I abbreviate it?

346
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:58,906
Blasphemous unbeliever!

347
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,286
-We still have one
assignment left.

348
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:14,265
It's like finding a
needle in a haystack.

349
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,936
The Land of Fire is next.

350
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:31,397
[theme music - in japanese]

351
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,617
-Good grief.

352
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,487
Naruto has gone back
into training again,

353
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,558
even though he's still not 100%.

354
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:04,893
Well, no surprise.

355
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,564
He always was headstrong.

356
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:09,635
But he doesn't get that
willpower isn't enough anymore.

357
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,205
Even if he's not
physically ready,

358
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:12,941
this training could
have the reverse effect

359
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,210
of what's intended.

360
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:16,480
On top of that, because
of his special abilities,

361
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:19,399
he's always in danger of pushing
it to the limit, and beyond.

362
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,951
I've got to do whatever
I can to help him out.

363
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:23,152
-Next time.

364
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,388
Akatsuki's Invasion.
