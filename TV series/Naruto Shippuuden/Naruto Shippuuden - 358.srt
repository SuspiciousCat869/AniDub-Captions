1
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,866
You're part of
the ANBU now.

2
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,769
{\an1}And this is one mission
that you can't avoid.

3
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:12,270
{\an1}What is this mission?

4
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:15,740
{\an1}Six years ago, after the
Nine Tails incident the

5
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,709
{\an1}village higher-ups
suspected that the Uchiha

6
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,445
Clan was behind
the entire thing.

7
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:22,781
{\an1}Since then, the Uchiha
district has been under

8
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:24,816
twenty-four-hour
surveillance.

9
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,085
[roaring]

10
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:33,358
Lord Third! It's
the Nine Tails!

11
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:35,460
{\an1}The Nine Tails is
inside the village!

12
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:40,598
{\an1}Yes, I know that.
I'll go restrain him.

13
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,099
{\an1}You and the others
go protect all the

14
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:43,400
{\an1}people of the village.

15
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:44,168
Yes, sir!

16
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,471
Huh?

17
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,306
{\an1}You should have ordered the
Uchiha Police Force to guard

18
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:52,710
{\an1}the civilians and kept them
back with the rear guard.

19
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,847
{\an1}Why? We can use the Visual
Prowess of the Uchiha to

20
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,816
{\an1}suppress the Nine Tails!

21
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,984
{\an1}The Uchiha can also
manipulate Nine Tails!

22
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,187
{\an1}Which means if they were to
betray the Leaf and take

23
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,456
{\an1}control of the Nine
Tails for themselves.

24
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,090
It would be like
the second coming

25
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,660
{\an1}of Madara Uchiha!

26
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,564
[angry roar]

27
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,902
{\an1}I'm going to leave it to you
to protect the civilians.

28
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,905
{\an1}You may command the
ANBU and security units.

29
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,573
{\an1}And make sure that
you guard the youth

30
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,341
{\an1}of the village, as well.

31
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,509
I understand.

32
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,312
[angry roar]

33
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,980
This way! Hurry!

34
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,454
Just stay calm!

35
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:39,756
{\an1}You'll be safe here!

36
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,827
{\an1}Captain, shouldn't we go
and provide assistance?

37
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:45,729
{\an1}The Police Force will stay
and guard the civilians.

38
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:46,965
{\an1}But Captain, sir!

39
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:49,666
{\an1}That is the order the
village has given us.

40
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:55,940
Over there!

41
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:10,120
[baby crying]

42
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:12,956
There, there. I
know that was scary.

43
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:16,126
{\an1}Now's our chance.
Let's get to safety.

44
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,470
{\an1}There are too many
unanswered questions

45
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,672
surrounding this
Nine Tails incident.

46
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:32,276
{\an1}I thought that Kushina's
seal had come undone...

47
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,678
{\an1}However, that wouldn't
explain why Biwako and

48
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:36,613
{\an1}the ANBU had been killed.

49
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:39,449
{\an1}Which means that someone
is behind all this.

50
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,084
Perhaps someone
from the Uchiha...

51
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:43,720
Why them?

52
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:47,558
{\an1}If Nine Tails broke free,
it would've just run wild.

53
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,126
{\an1}With no one controlling it,
it wouldn't have attacked

54
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,962
{\an1}and caused this incident.

55
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,063
You think that
the Sharingan...

56
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,533
{\an1}The Uchiha can control
the Nine Tails with

57
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,267
{\an1}their Visual Prowess.

58
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,870
{\an1}But for what purpose?!

59
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,873
{\an1}To regain their position
of power in the Leaf.

60
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,675
Ah, I see...

61
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,778
{\an1}This is nothing more
than conjecture!

62
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:10,948
{\an1}To be sure we must
increase our surveillance

63
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,281
on the Uchiha.

64
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,985
{\an1}We need to keep the Uchiha
District under watch

65
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,054
{\an1}twenty-four hours a day!

66
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,823
{\an1}That's only going to
provoke them unnecessarily!

67
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:22,726
{\an1}It's simple enough for the
ANBU to do it secretly.

68
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,094
{\an1}Well, it is better to
be safe than sorry...

69
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,630
Wait!

70
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,933
{\an1}We don't know if the
Uchiha are responsible!

71
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,535
{\an1}That's why this must
be done! If nothing

72
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,103
comes of it,
it would only

73
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:35,806
{\an1}benefit the Uchiha!

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,208
Hmm...

75
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,446
{\an1}[moans and groans]

76
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,492
Kushina...

77
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:00,897
Shift change.

78
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,966
{\an1}Nothing to report, sir.

79
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,567
Is this?

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,669
Just one of many
surveillance centers.

81
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:09,171
{\an1}Lord Danzo's ANBU are
watching them, too.

82
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:13,910
{\an1}What are you gonna do? Are
you gonna tell your clan?

83
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,345
{\an1}What will my job be here?

84
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,847
Just keep watch
through that.

85
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:21,051
Okay, Captain.
We're gonna go.

86
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,122
{\an1}Make sure that you
stay alert, Itachi.

87
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,359
{\an1}This is just another
part of our job as ANBU.

88
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,863
{\an1}It's not assassination,
but it's still dirty work.

89
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,699
{\an1}A mission is a mission.

90
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,402
{\an1}You'll be spying on
your friends and family.

91
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,437
In a way, it's
even worse...

92
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,440
I can take this
shift, if you want.

93
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:47,043
{\an1}That's not necessary.
Besides...

94
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,811
Besides what?

95
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,213
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan is
already aware that

96
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,115
{\an1}we're under suspicion.

97
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:56,819
{\an1}I suppose you would be...

98
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,158
How dare you?!

99
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,293
Come on! Get up
on your feet!

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,595
{\an1}Hey! What the hell was that
for?! You're the one who-

101
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,031
Why you-!

102
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,933
This whole thing
is all your fault!

103
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,802
Please, you two,
stop fighting!

104
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,537
{\an1}What's going on here?!

105
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,175
[arguing]

106
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,977
{\an1}Who even cares about the
Police Force, anyway?!

107
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,580
{\an1}Yeah, just hide like you
did with the Nine Tails!

108
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,214
{\an1}What did you say to us?!

109
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,818
Ow! Ow! Ow!

110
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,619
{\an1}We're taking you both in!

111
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,589
{\an1}Quiet! Just walk!

112
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,125
It was just a
drunken argument...

113
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,993
{\an1}They should've just
broken it up...

114
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,733
{\an1}The number of complaints
about harsh treatment

115
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,602
{\an1}by the Police Force
continues to rise.

116
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:50,573
{\an1}People have started to
distrust them more and more.

117
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:53,441
{\an1}It seems the Uchiha
are growing impudent.

118
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,376
{\an1}No, it's backlash.

119
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,780
{\an1}They haven't forgotten
about the Nine Tails

120
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,749
{\an1}incident six years ago.

121
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,184
{\an1}But the Uchiha didn't
suffer any losses during

122
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,886
{\an1}that horrible attack!

123
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,189
{\an1}Yes, and that was the cause
of even further suspicion.

124
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:10,226
{\an1}Back then, during that
turbulent time, the Uchiha

125
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,660
{\an1}saw our decision to
keep them at a distance

126
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:15,430
{\an1}from the Nine Tails as a
sign of our distrust of

127
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,298
{\an1}their entire clan.

128
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:20,602
{\an1}Our tactic of isolating the
Uchiha is a core Leaf policy

129
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,637
{\an1}begun by Lord Second.

130
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,672
Why do they
raise a fuss now?

131
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:27,642
{\an1}Lord Second's intention
wasn't isolation!

132
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,079
He was concerned
for each clan.

133
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:34,250
{\an1}Have you forgotten about our
friend Kagami Uchiha, Danzo?

134
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:37,685
{\an1}No, of course not.
He saved me many times

135
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,621
{\an1}with his Visual Jutsu.

136
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:43,025
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan's a friend
of the Hidden Leaf. And we

137
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,327
must ensure that
they stay that way.

138
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,730
If that is still
within our power...

139
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:54,636
[groans]

140
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,338
[screaming]

141
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:58,306
What's wrong?!

142
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,608
A genjutsu?!
But when did-?!

143
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:05,747
Byakugan!

144
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:17,492
{\an1}We're retreating!

145
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,960
But, Captain!

146
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,664
{\an1}We're in grave danger.
It's Shisui the Teleporter!

147
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:25,099
And we're no
match for him. Go!

148
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,573
{\an1}That ought to keep
the Hidden Mist Village

149
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,974
{\an1}quiet for a while.

150
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:39,848
{\an1}Team Shisui has returned,
sir. Mission complete.

151
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:44,219
{\an1}Thank you. It was a long
mission, and you did well!

152
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:46,721
{\an1}You and your team
should get some rest.

153
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,957
First, I have a
request, Lord Third.

154
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,991
Hm?

155
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,133
{\an1}I've been very troubled
by all the suspicion cast

156
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,935
{\an1}upon the Uchiha Clan.

157
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:03,004
{\an1}Hm. I feel the same...

158
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,439
{\an1}But I'm hopeful that the
clan and the village will

159
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,108
{\an1}find a way to be able
to trust each other

160
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,643
again soon.

161
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:12,313
{\an1}I'd like to ask you to
assign this mission to me.

162
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,848
{\an1}And do you want to
be released from

163
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,783
{\an1}your regular duties?

164
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,286
{\an1}Yes. And I'd like to be
given a certain amount

165
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,021
{\an1}of autonomy as well.

166
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:22,757
All right...

167
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,127
{\an1}We shall say that I ordered
you to go on a top-secret

168
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,629
{\an1}investigative mission,
and if anyone should

169
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,464
{\an1}raise any objections.

170
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,969
{\an1}Give them my name, and I
will take full responsibility.

171
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:36,838
{\an1}Thank you, Lord Third.

172
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,941
{\an1}You know, Shisui, you remind
me a great deal of my dear

173
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,110
{\an1}old friend, Kagami Uchiha.

174
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,578
{\an1}I'm not near his equal.

175
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,655
Big Brother!

176
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,690
Are you done
with your mission?

177
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,227
{\an1}If you are, you can
come and help me train!

178
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,496
{\an1}Sorry, Sasuke. I've
been summoned...

179
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,065
[angry snarl]

180
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,144
We played here
a lot, remember?

181
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,012
I didn't know
you were back!

182
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,846
{\an1}That's right. Now
that we finally chased

183
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,049
{\an1}the Hidden Mist away.

184
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,185
What is it?

185
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,920
{\an1}I want to get your
honest opinion.

186
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,489
{\an1}How serious do you
think Fugaku is?

187
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,924
{\an1}What do you mean?

188
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,727
{\an1}The coup d'état...

189
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,198
The Uchiha are
growing dissatisfied

190
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,899
{\an1}with the Village.

191
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,034
{\an1}If the village doesn't
change, the Uchiha

192
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,303
{\an1}won't stand for it.

193
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,374
{\an1}If the village changes,
so will the Uchiha.

194
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,642
{\an1}But if the Uchiha
don't change, neither

195
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,110
{\an1}will the village.

196
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
{\an1}As long as the two sides
distrust each other, things

197
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,847
{\an1}will only get worse.

198
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,651
{\an1}I want to clear up
this uncertainty.

199
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,286
Can you?

200
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,424
{\an1}Honestly, I don't know, but
I have to try. If the Uchiha

201
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,759
attempt a coup
d'état, it will end

202
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,494
{\an1}badly for both sides.

203
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,598
I am against a
coup d'état as well.

204
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,168
{\an1}But trying to stop it,
will take something big.

205
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,439
{\an1}I'm well aware, but I don't
want you to do anything.

206
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:19,873
Why's that?

207
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,377
{\an1}Some members of the Police
Force are suspicious of you.

208
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,279
{\an1}I've actually been
ordered to spy on you.

209
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,259
{\an1}What?! Do you know
what day tomorrow is?!

210
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,428
{\an1}I don't really think
you really understand

211
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,763
your position!

212
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,532
{\an1}I'm setting out on
a mission tomorrow.

213
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,502
What are you
talking about?

214
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,604
{\an1}I can't tell you that...
The mission is covert.

215
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,712
{\an1}Itachi you also serve as the
Uchiha Clan's pipeline to

216
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,113
{\an1}the Village nerve center.

217
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,749
{\an1}You know that, don't you?

218
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,519
Yes...

219
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,687
{\an1}Well make sure you don't
forget it! You will be at

220
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,390
{\an1}that meeting tomorrow.

221
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,532
{\an1}The Uchiha have plans to
assemble again tonight.

222
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,035
Yes, I know
about it as well.

223
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,304
{\an1}However, we cannot
interfere with the

224
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,306
{\an1}rituals of their Clan.

225
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,941
Rituals indeed!

226
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,944
{\an1}This so-called ritual is
just a thinly-veiled effort

227
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,013
{\an1}to fan the flames of
distrust against us and

228
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,549
{\an1}thereby unite the clan!

229
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,616
They preparing
for a coup d'état.

230
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,488
{\an1}There is one who can nip
it in the bud. Shisui!

231
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,392
Shisui Uchiha?!

232
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,762
{\an1}Shisui will attend the
assembly. If Fugaku Uchiha

233
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,433
{\an1}incites a rebellion,
Shisui's orders are to-

234
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,101
{\an1}Use my Koto Amatsukami.

235
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,037
You'll use your
Visual Jutsu?

236
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,341
{\an1}Fugaku will have absolutely
no clue Shisui is using a

237
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,009
{\an1}genjutsu to control
his actions.

238
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,513
{\an1}I will make Fugaku
think about co-existence

239
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,581
{\an1}with the village.

240
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,049
{\an1}I doubt that controlling
only Fugaku will bring an

241
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,586
{\an1}end to the Uchiha's
dissatisfaction.

242
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,921
{\an1}No. If the Uchiha will
change, then we of the Leaf

243
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,957
{\an1}must change, as well.

244
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,726
{\an1}We must improve our
treatment of the Uchiha.

245
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,562
{\an1}That's what I'm hoping for.

246
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:26,366
{\an1}I will assign one ANBU
behind the scenes.

247
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,867
{\an1}I'm counting on you.

248
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,235
Yes, sir!

249
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,078
{\an1}Itachi still isn't here.

250
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,887
He's late.

251
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,757
{\an1}What is it, Lord Danzo?
It's almost time for

252
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,092
{\an1}the assembly to begin.

253
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,863
{\an1}What if your Visual Jutsu
gets Fugaku and the clan to

254
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,032
{\an1}cooperate, but then
the Leaf Village

255
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,367
{\an1}refuses to change?

256
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,069
{\an1}Lord Hokage has given
me his word that he

257
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,504
{\an1}will make it change.

258
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,574
{\an1}Even if he's satisfied that
the Uchiha have reformed,

259
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,645
{\an1}the distrust among
the Leaf won't go away.

260
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,580
{\an1}I realize that. But in time...

261
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,816
{\an1}Besides, people like me,
people who are always

262
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,685
suspicious, will
never truly change.

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,821
{\an1}What will you do then?

264
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,657
But Lord Danzo?

265
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,560
{\an1}When the time comes,
will you use your Koto

266
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,828
Amatsukami on
me, as well?

267
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,063
I...

268
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,666
{\an1}Your Sharingan shall
be in my safekeeping!

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,034
Forgive me.

270
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,140
{\an1}It's only genjutsu.
You'll snap out of it soon.

271
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,113
[groaning]

272
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,694
Sharingan?!

273
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,896
{\an1}I'll take yours to
replace this eye.

274
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,032
Now give me the
other one, too.

275
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,269
Fire Style!
Fireball Jutsu!

276
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,004
Water Style!
Raging Waves!

277
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,977
{\an1}Teleportation Jutsu!

278
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,512
Go!

279
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:27,620
Shisui?

280
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,221
Come with me.

281
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,163
{\an1}It seems we can't prevent
the Uchiha coup-d'état.

282
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,700
{\an1}And if civil war erupts in
the Leaf, the other villages

283
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,770
{\an1}will invade for sure.
True war will break out.

284
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,440
{\an1}When I tried to stop
all this with the Koto

285
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:52,010
{\an1}Amatsukami, Danzo
stole my right eye.

286
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,113
That man doesn't
trust me at all.

287
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,683
{\an1}He intends to protect the
village his way, no matter

288
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,817
what it takes or
how it looks.

289
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,755
{\an1}I suspect he'll come after
my left eye, so I'll give it

290
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,856
to you before
he has a chance.

291
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,559
<i>Shisui...</i>

292
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,962
{\an1}You're the only one I can
count on, my best friend.

293
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,366
{\an1}Protect the village. And the
Uchiha name. Both of them.

294
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,155
{\an1}All right, I accept it.
What will you do now?

295
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,092
If I die, many
things will change.

296
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,194
{\an1}I've left a note...

297
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,262
Shisui, wait!

298
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,963
Don't try to
stop me, Itachi.

299
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,771
{\an1}<i>If you're truly my friend...</i>

300
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,607
Shisui!

301
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,979
Shisui...

302
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,820
{\an1}Hey! What am I even
being accused of?!

303
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,421
Shut up. I'll
do the talking!

304
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,090
Don't be so
rough with him.

305
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,224
Captain!

306
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:16,294
{\an1}All you need to know is
that you're a suspect.

307
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,229
You're coming
to HQ with us.

308
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,797
Oh... Uh...

309
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,367
{\an1}Remember to follow all
investigative procedures.

310
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,234
Sir!

311
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,069
C'mon, move it!

312
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:31,209
{\an1}Shisui Uchiha was a core
member of the Uchiha Clan.

313
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,978
{\an1}His loss demoralized them
and lessened their fighting

314
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:36,547
{\an1}power all at once.

315
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,016
So it seems the
coup d'état has

316
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,619
{\an1}been averted, then.

317
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,555
{\an1}I wish that there had been
some other way than for

318
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,592
{\an1}Shisui to give his
life to stop it.

319
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,395
{\an1}I should not have
pushed him like I did.

320
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:53,765
{\an1}Among the Uchiha there
are still a few who believe

321
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,867
{\an1}that you killed Shisui.

322
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,737
{\an1}But the ones who believe
that, did not know that

323
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,540
{\an1}Shisui and I were
both working towards

324
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:04,007
the same goal.

325
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,044
{\an1}He never met me at
our rendezvous point.

326
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:11,281
{\an1}He kept secrets, so
he was suspected.

327
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,183
{\an1}I'll make a statement
from the ANBU that

328
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,085
{\an1}it was a suicide.

329
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,421
Agreed, Hiruzen?

330
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:17,889
Hm...

331
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:29,667
[gasp]

332
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:48,952
[groans]

333
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,793
{\an1}Ah! The Lightning Blade!

334
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:59,362
{\an1}Then you're the Copy
Ninja of the Leaf!

335
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:02,934
Kaka...

336
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:04,601
Shi...

337
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,805
{\an1}You've become quite
well known, Captain.

338
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:10,875
{\an1}Do this long enough
and you're bound

339
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,142
{\an1}to become famous.

340
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,811
{\an1}Clear the area. Leave
no trace that the

341
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,545
{\an1}Hidden Leaf was here.

342
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,815
{\an1}Yeah, yeah. I know.

343
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:21,853
{\an1}All this dirty work is just
a part of the ANBU's M.O.

344
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,227
{\an1}You said that a friend
gave you the Sharingan

345
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,429
{\an1}that you possess.

346
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,865
{\an1}Yes. Along with a vow.

347
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,935
{\an1}And is this vow something
you plan to honor?

348
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:40,570
{\an1}Yes. I intend to.

349
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,910
{\an1}I know about the incident
with Shisui Uchiha.

350
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,545
{\an1}Is everything okay?

351
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,280
Yes, I'm fine.

352
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:51,448
I see...

353
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,584
{\an1}Anyway, there's not a
lot I can do, but let me

354
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,018
{\an1}know if there's anything.

355
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,220
Of course...

356
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,162
{\an1}You're the only one I can
count on, my best friend.

357
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,767
{\an1}Protect the village and the
Uchiha name. Both of them.

358
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:16,640
{\an1}<i>Shisui. Things have</i>
<i>gotten much worse.</i>

359
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,943
{\an1}<i>I don't think that I can</i>
<i>protect everyone...</i>

360
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:00,376
{\an1}<i>It seems someone's been</i>
<i>getting through the barrier</i>

361
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,244
<i>and infiltrating</i>
<i>the village.</i>

362
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:04,346
{\an1}<i>The only thing we can really</i>
<i>do is ask the Police Force</i>

363
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,215
{\an1}<i>to step up their patrols.</i>

364
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,683
{\an1}<i>What's bothering you?</i>

365
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:10,152
{\an1}<i>I went to the Uchiha</i>
<i>District for the first time</i>

366
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:12,221
{\an1}<i>in a while. It felt like</i>
<i>they didn't want any </i>

367
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,156
<i>outsiders there.</i>

368
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:17,960
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: " The Night</i>
<i>of the Tragedy."</i>

369
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,195
<i>I see...</i>
