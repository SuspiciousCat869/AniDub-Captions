1
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,351
Yes, Kinoto?

2
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,953
{\an1}Lord Danzo, there's
an urgent matter...

3
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,928
Hiruzen himself
is leading them?

4
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,396
{\an1}Damn that meddling
old fool...

5
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:20,263
{\an1}He has gone too far.

6
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,299
Kinoe, you here?

7
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,770
[scoff]

8
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,111
What are you
planning to do?

9
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,644
Kill me, Sensei?

10
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,685
{\an1}But can you go through
with it, I do wonder,

11
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,719
Sarutobi-sensei?

12
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,254
Hm?!

13
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,660
{\an1}Even with that...

14
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,063
No actually,
because of it...

15
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,463
{\an1}Hiruzen simply won't
be able to kill his

16
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,398
{\an1}student Orochimaru.

17
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,719
{\an1}Sarutobi! Kill him!

18
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,458
{\an1}For times just like this, we
have another secret meeting

19
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:55,261
{\an1}place. Kinoe, go and wait
there for Orochimaru.

20
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,311
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

21
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,713
Lightning Blade!

22
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:54,800
You... [chuckle]

23
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,535
I like the look
in your eye.

24
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,038
However, I
don't want a fake.

25
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,744
[chuckle]

26
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,413
{\an1}Aren't you cute one.

27
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,015
{\an1}So, do you want to
taste his blood as well?

28
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,962
{\an1}So, Lord Third, was it
you who set this all up?

29
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:41,130
[grunting]

30
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:50,604
Don't move!

31
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:30,364
[grunt]

32
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:39,402
{\an1}So that's Orochimaru...

33
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,216
{\an1}This emergency summons
has been issued for the

34
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,684
{\an1}immediate capture of
Orochimaru, who

35
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,985
{\an1}escaped during the
previous mission.

36
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,687
{\an1}According to the intel that
we have received, he is

37
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,721
{\an1}seriously wounded.

38
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:11,723
{\an1}He won't be able to exit the
Land of Fire easily in his

39
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:13,191
{\an1}current condition.

40
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,161
{\an1}Listen carefully. The
knowledge, data, and jutsu

41
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:19,729
that Orochimaru
possesses are valuable

42
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,964
{\an1}assets to the Hidden Leaf.

43
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,831
{\an1}If it is possible at
all, we must bring

44
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,499
{\an1}him back here alive.

45
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,268
{\an1}If he's allowed to leave the
Land of Fire, it would be a

46
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:31,871
{\an1}dire and perhaps even
fatal blow to the Leaf!

47
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:33,272
Therefore...

48
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:36,640
{\an1}This has to be settled
before he crosses the

49
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:40,509
{\an1}nation's borders. All of
you must do your very best.

50
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,843
Go!

51
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,981
{\an1}You must still have a
lot of affection for

52
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,283
{\an1}your former pupil.

53
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:51,951
{\an1}It's hard to believe
that you of all

54
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,451
{\an1}people would fail...

55
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:57,688
Of course, I'm
happy to cooperate.

56
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,424
{\an1}For the sake of the Leaf,
I'll do all that I can.

57
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:03,491
{\an1}Thank you for the offer.
I do appreciate it.

58
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,214
{\an1}<i>Against those eyes, I...</i>

59
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,019
{\an1}<i>Next time I won't fail.</i>

60
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:48,655
Summoning Jutsu!

61
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,826
What's going
on, Kakashi?

62
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:59,595
{\an1}I need you to follow a
scent. It's Orochimaru.

63
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:02,264
{\an1}Snakes can be very
difficult. The thing is,

64
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:03,664
{\an1}they don't sweat.

65
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,833
But you just
leave it to me!

66
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:20,749
{\an1}Who are you? How do you
know about this place?

67
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,084
{\an1}Lord Danzo sent me here!

68
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:26,086
{\an1}I've come on urgent business
regarding Lord Orochimaru!

69
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,266
{\an1}Here. This is the
message from Lord Danzo.

70
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:53,603
{\an1}There's no mistake.

71
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,906
{\an1}This is Lord Danzo's
seal, all right.

72
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,076
What?! Lord
Orochimaru? The Leaf?!

73
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,414
That wasn't a
transformation!

74
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:10,348
His flesh was
really smoke?!

75
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,557
{\an1}Give me the details.

76
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,891
I am Gotta of
the Iburi Clan.

77
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,093
Oh...

78
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,928
And I, well, my
name is Kinoe.

79
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:30,662
Tenzo!

80
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:31,396
Huh?

81
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:34,698
Yukimi!

82
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,337
{\an1}Tenzo! Welcome home!

83
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,312
{\an1}If Lord Danzo or Lord
Orochimaru were ever to find

84
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,780
{\an1}themselves in unforeseen
circumstances, it was

85
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,781
{\an1}previously agreed upon
that they would come to

86
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,050
{\an1}this place to get help.

87
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,750
{\an1}So Lord Orochimaru
will come here?!

88
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:05,852
Most likely.

89
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:10,621
[chatter]

90
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:25,098
{\an1}We can control the
pursuit of the ANBU.

91
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:27,233
{\an1}I'll be able to take
Lord Orochimaru out of the

92
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,867
{\an1}country without fail.

93
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:32,903
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru gave
us the gift of life.

94
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:34,904
We would do
anything for him.

95
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,743
{\an1}Everyone, get ready to
welcome Lord Orochimaru!

96
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:50,882
[giggle]

97
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,221
{\an1}Come with me, Tenzo!

98
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,456
{\an1}What?! But, um... I...

99
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:08,026
{\an1}Stand here for a second!

100
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,264
You see!

101
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:14,998
It's the same!

102
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,666
{\an1}Since you were young...

103
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:21,735
{\an1}I've been making these
marks to measure your height!

104
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,504
Oh I see, but...

105
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,305
Yukimi, enough.

106
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,073
{\an1}That boy is not Tenzo...

107
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,441
He is, too!

108
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,910
But, um...
Who is "Tenzo?"

109
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,344
He's Yukimi's
younger brother.

110
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,148
{\an1}But he's no longer here.

111
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,183
We placed him in
Lord Orochimaru's

112
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,883
{\an1}care three years ago.

113
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,817
"In his care..."

114
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,053
Three years ago?

115
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,388
{\an1}Then this mark is...

116
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,690
{\an1}Even though we've both
been apart for such a

117
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:56,926
{\an1}long time, I remember
what you looked like.

118
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,662
And finally,
you've come back!

119
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,729
{\an1}I just can't believe
you've returned from

120
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,531
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru's!

121
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:17,674
[gasp]

122
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,543
I'm sorry...

123
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,178
Yukimi...

124
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:27,812
Show him around.

125
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,713
Sure...

126
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:40,754
{\an1}We use this whole area
as our clan's graveyard.

127
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,156
The trees?

128
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,693
Instead of using
headstones, we plant trees.

129
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,129
{\an1}They say that the soul
finds refuge in the tree and

130
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:54,598
{\an1}provides us with protection.

131
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,066
The soul?

132
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,401
Yes. The souls
of the dead...

133
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,737
Our ability to
transform our bodies

134
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,772
{\an1}used to be incomplete.

135
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,274
{\an1}We didn't have total
control over our

136
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,275
{\an1}metamorphosis into smoke.

137
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,578
{\an1}Sometimes, we'd just
transform without warning.

138
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,313
{\an1}Or dissipate without
turning back into flesh.

139
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,382
{\an1}Members of our clan
never lived for very long.

140
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,084
{\an1}You didn't see many
elders, did you?

141
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,351
No...

142
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,254
So many died...

143
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,522
That's why we
planted these trees.

144
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:36,024
{\an1}So many have died?

145
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,460
{\an1}But then something
amazing happened:

146
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,427
Lord Orochimaru
found our Clan.

147
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:42,730
This symbol of
his, the Curse Mark,

148
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:44,497
{\an1}stabilized our ability.

149
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,167
{\an1}But unfortunately
the Curse Mark wasn't

150
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,636
{\an1}a perfect fit either...

151
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,971
{\an1}He said it was necessary to
do much more research.

152
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,040
{\an1}That's why Tenzo had to go
away, he had to be sent to

153
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:02,676
Lord Orochimaru
to be a test subject.

154
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,278
<i>Test subject...</i>

155
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,315
{\an1}The younger you are,
the stronger our

156
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,349
{\an1}power manifests itself.

157
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,817
So he needed a
young test subject.

158
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:18,085
{\an1}But that left you
as the only child

159
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,687
{\an1}in your whole Clan.

160
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,022
{\an1}It wasn't like he was
gonna die or anything!

161
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,591
{\an1}At least, that's what
Lord Orochimaru said.

162
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,292
{\an1}And even if I were to be
called up, too, I'd be able

163
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:30,662
to see everyone.
Including Tenzo.

164
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:34,130
{\an1}<i>To see... everyone?</i>

165
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,807
Everyone...

166
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:52,742
What is this?!

167
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,010
What happened?!

168
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:56,245
This is...

169
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,378
What's wrong?!

170
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:02,182
{\an1}It's so strange...
Who planted all these?!

171
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,083
{\an1}Those children...

172
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,084
{\an1}Tenzo is still...

173
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,822
[grunting]

174
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,891
We don't need
this one!

175
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:17,592
[gasp]

176
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,294
Or this one!
Or this one!

177
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:35,203
[crying]

178
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,766
Let's go.

179
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,667
Huh?

180
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,506
{\an1}It seems I've nearly
reached my limit.

181
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,241
{\an1}Just a little more...

182
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:53,522
What is this?

183
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,090
{\an1}See how the roots twist
around to form the ceiling

184
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:58,091
{\an1}and walls of this passage?

185
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,861
{\an1}The whole interior is
a maze of hollow caves

186
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:01,894
{\an1}just like this one.

187
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:06,865
{\an1}It gets a bit tight
from here on out,

188
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,465
{\an1}but we can still fit.

189
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,166
{\an1}Where are we going?

190
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,568
{\an1}Tenzo and I had a
secret hideout here!

191
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,237
[grunting]

192
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:22,141
{\an1}[outside noise chatter]

193
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,209
You can hear
really well here.

194
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:28,111
{\an1}That crevice up there leads
straight to the outside.

195
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,045
{\an1}We used to come here
all the time to listen

196
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,882
{\an1}to that sound together.

197
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:35,216
{\an1}We'd talk about what the
outside world might be like.

198
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:38,652
{\an1}Why don't you just
go out yourself?

199
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,019
{\an1}Because there's wind.

200
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,521
There's wind?!

201
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:44,423
{\an1}If we were to transform into
smoke while we're outside

202
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:47,558
{\an1}and if a breeze blew at the
same time, then our bodies

203
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,125
{\an1}would be dispersed.

204
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,428
{\an1}We have to stay where
there's no wind,

205
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:52,594
like in caves.

206
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,798
{\an1}More than anything, we
loved coming here to listen

207
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,766
{\an1}to the strange and
wonderful sounds outside.

208
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,133
{\an1}We'd try to guess what
we were hearing...

209
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,769
{\an1}And what was going
on out there...

210
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,304
{\an1}Tenzo and I would imagine
all kinds of stuff!

211
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:37,191
[gasp]

212
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:41,727
What's wrong?!

213
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,296
{\an1}It's serious! Someone has
come down into our village!

214
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,564
{\an1}Is it Lord Orochimaru?

215
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,699
Don't know. We
haven't been able to

216
00:20:48,732 --> 00:20:50,200
{\an1}confirm who it is yet.

217
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:55,169
{\an1}Well, if it is him, then
we will welcome him.

218
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,037
If it is a Leaf
pursuer, then we will

219
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,538
{\an1}take care of them.

220
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,215
Everyone, hide
and get ready!

221
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,886
{\an1}<i>Hey, are we really</i>
<i>going outside?</i>

222
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:01,286
<i>Yes!</i>

223
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:03,488
{\an1}<i>But if you go outside...</i>

224
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:05,756
{\an1}<i>Aren't you afraid</i>
<i>of the wind?</i>

225
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:07,824
{\an1}<i>I really want to see it!</i>

226
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:09,959
{\an1}<i>To find out where all</i>
<i>those sounds come from.</i>

227
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,093
<i>Together with</i>
<i>you, Tenzo!</i>

228
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,097
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Orochimaru's</i>
<i>Test Subject"</i>

229
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,401
{\an1}<i>We'll be together,</i>
<i>just the two of us!</i>
