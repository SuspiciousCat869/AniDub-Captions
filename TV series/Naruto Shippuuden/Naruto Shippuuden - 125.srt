00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:15,534
This time I'm going
to detonate myself.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He's insane.

00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,234
-In death I shall
become art itself.

6
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,367
No one's seen an
explosion like this,

7
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:25,934
one that shall leave behind a
scar on the very earth itself.

8
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:29,467
And then I'll receive
more admiration for my art

9
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:32,701
than anyone has
ever seen before.

10
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,534
Sorry Tobi.

00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,801
-Hmm?

12
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,967
-But while I will
be admired, you'll

13
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,534
almost definitely be dead.

14
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,067
This explosion will
cover 10 kilometers.

00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:47,467
You can't run away
from this one.

16
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:54,701
Tremble, be afraid, recoil
in despair, cower in awe.

17

Cry your heart out.

18
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:06,534
Because my art--
is an explosion!

What is it Kakashi?

Chakra, it's that Akatsuki.

I've never seen that.

our rendezvous point.

Wait, is he-- Oh no,
it's just as I feared.

37
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:06,067
That fool, Deidara,
he blew himself up.

38
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,467
-And what about Tobi?

39
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,701
-Probably got caught up in it.

40
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,101
It was within the blast
radius, after all.

At least he went
out with a bang.

KISAME HOSHIGAKI
(VOICEOVER): Oh dear, it

45
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,765
looks like we've lost yet
another Akatsuki member.

46
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:26,999
And I really thought he was
one of the stronger ones too.

47
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,732
So who did him in then?

48
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,132
Was it Sasuke?

49
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,465
or the nine-tails Jinchuuriki?

50
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,299
-It was Sasuke.

51
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:40,565
However, it appears that
Sasuke has died as well.

52
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,265
-Deidara took him with him?

-You should feel
grateful Itachi.

Deidara sacrificed his life
to save you a lot of trouble.

forgotten about something.

-It looks like Toby
is dead as well.

58
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:02,832
Deidara had no regard
for his partner.

00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:05,399
-Tobi, that's what
I'd forgotten.

60
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,065
Must've been quite a Jutsu
that Deidara set off,

61
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,565
if that escape artist,
Tobi, couldn't run from it.

-No matter.

63
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,865
We can easily replace
someone like Tobi.

64
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,632
But losing Deidara
is unfortunate.

65
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:21,832
Don't get me wrong.

00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,399
I like Tobi.

Let us try to mourn
Deidara quietly.

-And I shall mourn
for the loss of Tobi.

-You're that bored, huh?

00:06:53,299 --> 00:07:03,232
-OK, when the crest of the
snake vanishes then I do this.

Add a drop of Sasuke's blood.

All right, summoning Jutsu!

So, this is Orochimaru's
summons, Manda.

Orochimaru could
barely control him.

such a thing to me?

me with those damned eyes

of yours.

89
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:04,032
Me, you did this to me.

-Oh, boy, well, he's dead now.

92
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,765
Hey, wasn't Manda supposed
to be Orochimaru's favorite

93
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,232
pet or something?

94
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:20,265
You know, you really ought to
treat animals better Sasuke,

95
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,799
and not force Genjutsu
onto them either.

96
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,565
-There wasn't any time
to think about it.

97
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,232
I had no choice but to do this.

98
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,399
There you are.

99
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,232
I thought you'd be here.

100
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:34,799
Your Chakra suddenly
disappeared.

101
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:35,999
So I wondered what happened.

102
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,599
Did you transport
yourself or something?

103
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,932
You hid yourself inside Manda
and used the transportation

104
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,965
technique to escape to another
dimension, is that right?

105
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,232
Then why are you so beat up?

106
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,732
-Just before we
jumped, Manda and I

107
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,332
were hit by the blast wave.

108
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,965

stronger than I expected.

00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:08,132
-Well, in any case, you'll
need some time to rest up.

112
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,699
Isn't that right Karin?

113
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,599
-Huh?

I can't believe you're the
man who killed Orochimaru.

117
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,365
-Orochimaru was already
weakened to begin with.

118

That's all I'll say about that.

119
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,565
-It doesn't show any
signs of stopping.

120
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,832
Strange, there usually
isn't this much rain

around here this time of year.

on in your head right now,

Yet from here it looks
like you're crying.

It's really too
bad, what happened

to your younger brother.

129

It looks like you're the sole
surviving member of the Uchiha

-No.

-Sasuke's not dead.

134
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,899
Besides--

135
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,365
-What are you talking about?

136
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,065
-The rain has finally stopped.

-Naruto!

138
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,799
-It looks like that explosion
caught everyone's attention.

139
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,632
-You guys, what happened?

140
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,965
-There's evidence Sasuke was
here just before we arrived.

141
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,199
-Huh?

142
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,232
-It's very faint.

143
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:12,032
But his scent is
definitely here.

144
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,899
Also, I can detect several
other scents as well.

145
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:17,265
-What does that mean?

146
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:23,565
-By the look of this crater,
a battle was fought here.

147
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,799
-Thought so.

148
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,599
As I suspected, one
of the other scents

149
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:30,799
is identical to the one
I detected in the city.

150
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:33,299
Sasuke isn't traveling
by himself now.

151
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:36,099
He has three companions
traveling with him as well.

152
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:37,432
They must be his accomplices.

153
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,532
-Then in the town--

154
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:47,265
-Yes.

155
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,865
Sasuke's probably formed a team.

156
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,699
Also, I know that one
of the five scents

157
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:57,565
here belongs to Deidara,
a member of the Akatsuki.

158
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,999
-Wasn't he the one who
self destructed and was

159
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,565
sent to another
dimension by your Jutsu?

160
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,799
-I thought so, but
it seems that he

161
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,099
faked his own death to escape.

162
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,265
Now, the Akatsuki
operate in two-man teams.

163
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,699
So there should be three left.

164
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,399
And Sasuke is in a
four-person team.

165
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:18,065
I don't care how
many of them there

166
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:22,065
are, let's just get moving
and track down Sasuke's scent.

167
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:24,665
-Sorry, I'm afraid
we can't do that.

168
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:25,199
-What?

169
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:26,832
Why not?

170
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:29,132
-The trail goes cold here.

171
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,765
-And what does that mean?

172
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,765
-I'd say, in this
case, either Sasuke

173
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,999
was completely annihilated
in that explosion

174
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,499
or he used the
transportation technique

175
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:42,932
to escape before it went off.

176
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,799
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Transportation technique?

177
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:55,032
-It was probably the latter.

178
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,899
I've made my sense of smell
even keener than a dog's.

179
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:00,032
I think I found Sasuke.

180
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:04,065
-A nose sharper than a
Ninja Hound's, impressive.

181
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,265
Just what I'd expect
from the Inuzuka clan.

182
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,165
-Right Kiba, show us the way.

183
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,299
KONAN (VOICEOVER): Come
in Pain, it's time.

184
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:22,832
He's arrived.

185
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:48,099
-Well, so how is Sasuke?

186
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,865
-Coming along nicely.

187
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,865
His Sharingan is at full power.

188
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,699
His eyes will surpass
even Itachi's.

189
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,165
Then, the time has come.

190
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,632
I'm sure his mind
is made up, since he

191
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,165
doesn't have much longer.

192
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,132
-And what about the Nine-tails?

193
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,565
-You will hunt it.

194
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,699
And as leader, I will
not tolerate failure.

195
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:49,575
-Ha, you said you'd
take down Itachi.

196
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:52,842
But in this condition, you're
barely even able to move.

197
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,608
-Look Karin, we've been
going nonstop lately.

198
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:57,742
We need the rest.

199
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,008
-Give me a break!

200
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,708
That's all you've done
is rest, you punk!

201
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:01,942
-There, it's all done.

202
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,942
-You didn't do a thing
at the northern hideout.

203
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:06,308
So don't start
saying that I'm lazy.

204
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:07,675
-What did you just say?

205
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,442
Do you want a piece of me?

206
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,542
Well come then, bring it on!

207
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,342
-That's enough you two.

208
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,375
Suigetsu, Karin, have you
gathered data on Itachi

209
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:18,942
like I asked you to?

210
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:21,175
-You're not in any shape to
boss the rest of us around,

211
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,375
you know?

212
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,608
-Well, I picked up some
intel about the Akatsuki

213
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:27,608
here and there, but nothing
specific about Itachi,

214
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:28,975
I'm afraid.

215
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,308
-I've got nothing.

216
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,408
-It appears that they're
targeting specific people,

217
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,942
or at least,
they're after people

218
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:40,208
who have very special Chakra.

219
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,508
-Special Chakra?

220
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,042
I see.

221
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,608
-I've been conversing
with the animals.

222
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:52,942
And I've pinpointed a
few Akatsuki hideouts.

223
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:59,942
It seems they sense powerful
unpleasant Chakra coming

224
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,742
from those places.

225
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,175
That's what the animals told me.

226
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,975
-Wow, so what you're
saying, is even

227
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,375
lowly animals have the
ability to sense Chakra.

228
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:14,175
Or maybe it's because they're
so lowly, just like you Karin.

229
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,075
Uh--

230
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,908
-What did you say?!

231
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:32,342
Suigetsu, I'm not going to let
you get away with it next time!

232
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,442
-Hey!

233
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:34,442
Hey wait!

234
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:35,942
Stop!

235
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,908
Just relax Karin!

236
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:38,908
It was just a joke!

237
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,908
-I must kill.

238
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:45,342
[growling]

239
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,975
-Oh no, Jugo's
impulses have started!

240
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,275
-Sasuke, hurry.

241
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,542
-Calm down now Jugo.

242
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,208
[gasps]

243
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:10,842
[breathing heavily]

244
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,742
-Sorry, sorry about that.

245
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:49,275
-Screaming and making a
fuss, this is your fault.

246
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:50,442
-What?

247
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:51,775
-It's yours too.

248
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:54,908
-Karin, you're always
trying to provoke me.

249
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:57,642
Just what are you up
to, trying to do that?

250
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,342
I thought I already
made it clear to you,

251
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,708
I don't intend to leave
Sasuke's team for any reason.

252
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,242
-Look, I'm not up to anything.

253
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,608
You always make
it sound like I'm

254
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:09,208
playing some huge scheme
to get you or something.

255
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,942
I'm just trying to test your--

256
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:14,042
-I-- I need Sasuke beside me.

257
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,842
He can replace Kimimaro.

258
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,142
And he's the only one now.

259
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:23,208
Sasuke, he said that he
would become my cage.

260
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:26,642
And right now, only he
can stop my impulses.

261
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,842
like he did for me just now.

262
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,175
-Yeah, well, I don't
know about her,

263
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,375
but my own cage is
unlocked and the door's

264
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:36,108
completely wide open.

265
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:39,775
We can leave any time
that we might want to.

266
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:40,675
But then again--

267
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,242
-It's this way.

268
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:01,742
I'm sure.

269
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,142
From his scent, I can tell
that he's stopped moving.

270
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,042
I think that he's
resting after his battle.

271
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:14,775
-This is our chance.

272
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:22,008
-Sasuke, our paths are finally
going to cross once again.

273
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,608
(VOICEOVER):
Naruto Uzimaki

274
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:31,675
is no longer just
some troublesome brat.

275
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,475
He's acquired some
formidable Jutsu

276
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,742
and has many powerful allies.

277
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,075
it won't be easy.

278
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,808
He even destroyed
two of Kakuzu's lives

279
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:41,675
in a single blow.

280
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,642
-Spare us your words
of warning and of fear.

281
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:47,342
They are wasted on us.

282
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,142
Pain's never lost
a single battle.

283
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,508
[laughter]

284
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,442
Tobi (VOICEOVER):
Well, that is true.

285
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:06,908
We're done here.

286
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,108
Be certain to tell the
other members to hurry

287
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,842
with the remaining Jinchuuriki.

288
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,175
-I know I will.

289
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,908
Tobi (VOICEOVER):
Soon, very soon, all our goals

290
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:17,675
shall be achieved.

291
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:29,442
When that happens,
then everything

292
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:31,942
will be restored to
its rightful place.

293
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,775
The true power of
the Sharingan that

294
00:20:56,808 --> 00:20:59,142
belongs to me, Madara Uchiha.

295
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:17,375
-Once again, the sky is weeping.

296
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:19,308
Pain, are you--

297
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:32,497
[theme music]

298
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,933
-I'm coming in Tsunade.

299
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,433
-Jiraiya, have you
learned anything?

300
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,033
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Yes, I've located

301
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,600
the leader of the Akatsuki.

302
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,400
-You have?

303
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,533
Tell me everything!

304
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,367
-If it pans out, we can
use that information

305
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,667
to plan a surprise attack.

306
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,733
-Now, now, don't be hasty.

307
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,767
-This isn't like plotting
a sequel to your novel.

308
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,767
We have no time to waste.

309
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,267
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Haste makes waste.

310
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,600
We can't afford that, not with
the stakes as high as they are.

311
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:26,000
-Next time, Twilight.
