{\an7}<i>What should we do?</i>

4
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:17,498
{\an1}Huh?!

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,167
{\an1}It's them! They're
toward four o'clock!

{\an1}Wood Style! Deep
Forest Emergence!

{\an1}He's able to use

my body over to you again?!

15
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:07,874
{\an1}<i>No...I'll just give</i>
<i>you my chakra.</i>

16
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,310
{\an1}I do not care
for Madara.

17

{\an1}Giant Rasengan Barrage Line!

{\an1}Just as you said, he's
quite an impressive
shinobi.

{\an1}Isn't he?

{\an1}<i>[heavy breathing]</i>

00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:40,555
{\an1}Naruto, that's enough.
I'll take over this
battle for here on.

33
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:43,591
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage you're
too injured! You're in
no condition!

34
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,125
{\an1}<i>[grunt]</i>

{\an7}I have a chance to
reclaim myself now.

36
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:52,432
{\an7}I've still got enough
energy left to do that,
believe you me!

37
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:41,125
{\an1}I'll fight him!

38
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:42,861
{\an1}What?! That's crazy!

39
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,729
{\an1}You're already
falling apart!

40
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,465
{\an1}<i>[heavy breathing]</i>

41
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:48,766
{\an1}<i>[alarmed grunt]</i>

42
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,605
{\an1}That's too bad. I wanted
to try out some more jutsu...

43
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,842
{\an1}But I don't think
you can dance anymore,
Ohnoki.

44

{\an1}<i>[angry growl]</i>

{\an1}What is that look for?

46
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:08,783
{\an7}I already showed you how
different our strengths
were long ago, remember?

47
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,120
{\an1}What?! But why?!

48
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:16,223
{\an1}That wasn't the agreement!
Lord Hashirama said...

49
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,692
{\an1}There is no alliance now.

50
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:21,794
{\an1}You will merely bow
down to the might
of the Hidden Leaf!

51
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:26,832
{\an1}And also...never mention
that shinobi's name in
my presence again!

52
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,669
{\an1}<i>[scared quivering]</i>

53
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:35,706
{\an1}For all these years,
we shinobi have done
nothing but do battle.

54
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:40,477
{\an7}We have continued to
fight for the sake of
our nations and our
villages.

55
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:44,581
{\an7}We just take what we
want from our enemies
without a single care!

56
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:49,886
{\an4}<i>We take from them, and</i>
<i>they take back from us</i>
<i>again in an endless</i>
<i>cycle!</i>

57
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,389
{\an1}<i>Three times now our</i>
<i>hatred has caused</i>
<i>all-out war!</i>

58
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:57,592
{\an1}But that is simply the
way that life is.

59
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:03,363
{\an4}I can't believe you've lived
as long as you have without
learning a single thing
from the pain of the past.

60
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:08,335
{\an4}I've lived longer than you...
And been around the block
enough to learn twice
what you have!

61
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:15,741
{\an4}It's because I've experienced
pain in the past, that I can
even consider what would be
best for the future!

62
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,510
{\an1}And yet this is the
Fourth Great Ninja War.

63
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,613
{\an1}Is this what's best?

64
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,782
{\an1}This war is different
than the others!

65
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,484
{\an1}This time, we're all
fighting the battle
together.

66
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:33,189
{\an7}In order to achieve
something more than the
petty differences we've
fought over before!

67
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:39,528
{\an4}By watching youngsters like
them, I've learned that
time doesn't just flow
and pass us by.

68
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:48,369
{\an7}Though slow in pace, the
world does accrue its past
experiences...and grows
steadily towards peace.

69
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,305
{\an1}<i>[heavy panting]</i>

70
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,272
{\an1}That is where you
are wrong.

71
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,709
{\an1}The world does not need
to grow any further.

72
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,446
{\an7}It should slumber in peace
under the genjutsu of the
Eternal Tsukuyomi.

73
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,118
{\an1}Madara...Long ago
you forced me to
foresake myself.

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,454
{\an1}However...I shall win
against you here. I
will reclaim myself!

75
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:14,126
{\an1}And you shall be the
one who will slumber!

76
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,129
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage!

77
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:20,630
{\an1}<i>[surprised reaction]</i>

78
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,634
{\an1}Come with me, and
I'll help you
reclaim yourself.

79
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:30,139
{\an4}I've found that the aged
usually complain when those
younger than they are
dote on them too much.

80
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,607
{\an1}Don't you think
that's true?

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,641
{\an1}<i>[chuckle]</i>

82
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:35,176
{\an1}I'll allow all of
you to meddle this
one time.

83
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,644
{\an1}Hmph.

84
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:38,646
{\an1}Still have some dance
left in you?

85
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,782
{\an1}For my soul's sake,
and for the future!

86
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:45,251
{\an1}I shall take you down
here and now!

87
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:46,352
{\an1}Damn it!

88
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,688
Lady Tsunade!

89
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,655
{\an1}Your name's Mabui, right?

90
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,825
{\an1}Prepare your Ethereal
Transmission Jutsu
and come with me!

91
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:56,561
{\an1}The Ethereal Transmission
Jutsu is for transporting
objects!

92
00:07:56,594 --> 00:08:00,799
{\an1}It's not like the Summoning
or Reverse Summoning Jutsu;
it's not meant for people!

93
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:02,533
{\an1}There's no time to argue!

94
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,269
{\an1}We won't know until
we try it, right?

95
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,904
{\an1}We do know!

96
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:10,707
{\an1}The transmission rate is so
fast the body can't keep up
and it just gets torn apart!

97
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,176
{\an1}It's certain death!

98
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,679
{\an4}The only one who has
ever successfully
traveled using this jutsu
is the Third Raikage.

99
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:22,150
{\an4}But he was able to
achieve that feat only
because of his
superhuman body!

100
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:27,354
{\an1}Perhaps it's possible for
the Fourth Raikage, being
of the Third Lord's blood...

101
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:31,424
{\an1}But certainly not for you,
Lady Hokage. Please,
reconsider!

102
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,595
{\an1}I've got an idea that
just might work.

103
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,864
{\an1}We'll use the Flying
Raijin Jutsu.

104
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:45,070
{\an4}We could summon Genma's platoon
here, put jutsu formula on a
Katsuyu clone, and then have
Mabui transmit her to the site.

105
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:48,272
{\an4}Well I do have the
ability to survive
being split into
pieces,

106
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:52,409
{\an1}There's no need. I'm just
going to use this.

107
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,611
{\an1}Yes, of course, I
should've known.

108
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,580
{\an1}<i>[nervous reaction]</i>

109
00:08:56,613 --> 00:09:01,684
{\an4}It's still a very dangerous
gamble. And you tend to be,
shall we say, unlucky with
bets, Lady Tsunade,

110
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,819
{\an1}That's only when
I bet money.

111
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:09,125
{\an1}It's completely different
when I wager my life.

112
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:10,792
{\an1}That's why I'm
still alive.

113
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,594
{\an1}<i>[uneasy groan]</i>

114
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:16,765
{\an1}Lord Raikage, sir. Please
ask Lady Hokage to
reconsider this!

115
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,366
{\an1}<i>[humming]</i>

116
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:24,337
{\an4}Mabui, go prepare the
Ethereal Transmission
Jutsu. You're sending
both of us!

117
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,339
{\an1}Lord Raikage, not
you, too!

118
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,607
{\an1}Shikaku, please!

119
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,144
{\an1}I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
that we have no other
options left.

120
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:34,079
{\an1}It's time for the
Supreme Commander's
entrance!

{\an1}<i>[grunt of approval]</i>

122

{\an1}Madara belongs to
the Uchiha Clan,

123
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:43,654
{\an1}If we don't shut down
his Fire Style, we have
no chance.

124
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,056
{\an1}We'll save the Flying
Raijin Jutsu...

125
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,725
{\an1}...until we're able to
use it against him.

I'll gain.

131
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,808
{\an1}That's why I gotta

00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,778
{\an1}I thought that was
a lot of chakra you
were gathering.

135
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,314
{\an1}I had no idea that
sword would be so huge!

{\an1}I...can't move!

his blade so fast!

00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,157
{\an1}Woah! That guy is
seriously good!

139
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:30,394
{\an1}Genma! I'm sorry, but
could you just do as
I say?

140
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:31,795
{\an1}Shikaku?

141
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:37,700
{\an4}It's an emergnecy
situation. Don't
interrupt me no matter
what I tell you!

142
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:42,438
{\an4}First of all, the real
Madara has been brought
back with the Reanimation
Jutsu.

143
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,340
{\an1}I'm sorry to interrupt,
but...what was that?!

144
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,076
{\an1}I said no
interruptions!

145
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,110
{\an1}<i>[gasp]</i>

146
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:50,312
{\an1}Do it now!

147
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,546
{\an1}All right! Here it goes...

148
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,615
{\an1}Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!

149
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:59,652
{\an1}<i>[struggling reaction]</i>

150
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:04,190
{\an1}This is a surprise.

151
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:09,262
{\an4}So it's instaneous
transportation? Wasn't
that the Fourth Hokage's
jutsu?

152
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:15,234
{\an4}That's right. The three of
us were formerly assigned
to the Fourth Hokage's
Personal Guard Platoon.

153
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,401
{\an1}And now we're there
for the Fifth.

154
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:20,671
{\an1}The Lord Fourth taught
all of us his Flying
Raijin Jutsu.

155
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:26,276
{\an4}Unlike Lord Fourth, who
could do it alone, it
takes all three of us
together to make it work.

156
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,678
{\an1}I'm sorry about the
close quarters.

157
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,513
{\an1}Lady Mizukage...

158
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:33,716
{\an1}Please go and
take Madara down
hard!

159
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:38,320
{\an4}I'll defend this place
with my life as one
of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen!

160
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,356
{\an1}<i>[pleased reaction]</i>

161
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,223
{\an1}Oh, Chojuro...

162
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:46,727
{\an1}That boy...he's
grown so much since
leaving the village.

163
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:52,366
{\an1}Prepare yourself! Lady
Tsunade bears the Jutsu
Formula on her.

164
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:56,102
{\an1}As soon as she reaches
the battlefield, we'll
fly right there ourselves.

165
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,572
{\an7}Roger, understood. I'm
already late for the alter,
I'd hate to be late for more.

166
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:13,683
{\an1}Unruly Ay and
Princess Tsunade!

167
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:18,154
{\an1}I had already relayed
our coordinates to HQ!

168
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:23,458
{\an1}Reserve Seal! Release!
Ninja Art Mitotic
Regeneration Jutsu!

169
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,561
{\an1}Are you okay, Tsunade?

170
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:28,763
{\an1}Yeah...

171
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,598
{\an1}Granny Tsunade is here?!

172
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:34,035
{\an7}<i>That's her Regenerating</i>
<i>Jutsu!</i>

173
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:35,303
{\an1}Hmph.

174

{\an1}<i>[startled yell]</i>

175
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:42,309
{\an1}Well, seeing that everyone
here is still alive, I
guess we made it in time.

176
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:46,679
{\an1}Now I can finally let
loose! And it's about
damn time, too!

177
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,514
{\an1}All right, I'm ready
to go now as well!

178
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:55,453
{\an1}I must say, it is truly
worth living a long life.

179
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:02,359
{\an1}Imagine, seeing the day
when the Five Kage would
unite and fight side by side.

180
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:22,143
{\an4}This is perfect! You
all will make this
test of mine
worth while!

181
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,877
{\an1}Thank you for
this, Princess.

182
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:29,549
{\an4}I'll heal the two of
you. Raikage, Mizukage!
You buy me some time
while I finish this up!

183
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,385
{\an1}Here we go, Mizukage!

184
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:32,318
{\an1}Right!

185
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,686
{\an1}Lava Style: Lava
Monster Jutsu!

186
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:43,561
{\an7}Jutsu this pitiful isn't
even worth absorbing!

187
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,264
{\an1}He's fast!

188
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,204
{\an1}<i>[shocked reaction]</i>

{\an1}What do you think?
Is he still okay?

192
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,063
{\an1}Doubt it.

193
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,132
{\an1}You've seen what
they're capable of.

194
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,133
{\an1}Keep watching!

195
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,601
{\an1}There's no way for us
to join the fray and help.

196
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:33,104
{\an4}Look, why don't all
three of you come
with me, and we'll
go after the other one.

197
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,538
{\an1}Help me out!

198
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:39,777
{\an1}Is that the guy?

199
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,711
{\an1}Follow me! Let's go!

200
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,584
{\an1}How much longer, Hokage?

201
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:51,354
{\an1}Just a bit!

202
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,689
{\an1}But Granny Tsunade,
are you okay?

203
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:59,126
{\an4}Whenever you use that
forehead mark jutsu, you
get really old and you
fall down!

204
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:03,563
{\an1}It's different than when
I fought Pain, Naruto.

205
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:08,536
{\an4}I only healed myself
so far, and none
of these wounds are
very troublesome.

206
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,669
{\an1}I have more than
enough chakra!

207
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,106
{\an1}Great! So does that mean
you can heal me too,
Granny Tsunade?

208
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,342
{\an1}I may be a clone, but
I can't afford to
disappear yet!

209
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,643
{\an1}I can join you!

210
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,145
{\an1}That's not necessary!

211
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:20,745
{\an1}<i>[taken aback reaction]</i>

212
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,580
{\an1}Why not?!

213
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:30,153
{\an1}Naruto, you must understand.
This war is no longer being
fought only to protect you!

214
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:51,738
{\an4}Lightning Style
Teleportation as
well as Lava Style
Kekkei Genkai...

215
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,341
{\an1}Most impressive attacks.

216
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:04,250
{\an4}You know, I normally
prefer men who are hard to
melt. But in your case,
I think i'd have to pass.

217
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:07,285
{\an1}He can counter me
even at my full speed.

218
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:23,133
{\an4}I'm gonna have to get
faster...and thus up the
power to crush your
defense!

219
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,337
{\an1}How is your defense?

220
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,344
{\an1}<i>[shocked reaction]</i>

222
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,651
{\an4}Do you understand now?
This war has become a
battle to protect each
other!

223
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,420
{\an1}I wanna fight Madara,
too! I can help you!

224
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,490
{\an1}A defensive wall of
Sand and Stone?

225
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,025
{\an1}Also quite impressive!

226
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,295
{\an1}Right! It's time to
go on the offensive!

227
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,632
{\an1}Now, Mizukage! Raikage!
Listen to me well!

228
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,403
{\an1}You! Hold it!

229
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,572
{\an1}How pesky!

{\an1}<i>[struggling grunt]</i>

231

00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:46,704

{\an1}<i>Water Style: Hidden</i>
<i>Mist Jutsu!</i>

234
00:17:58,481 --> 00:18:03,286
{\an4}Hidden Mist...They're
trying to block the
Rinnegan's field of
vision with it.

235
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:07,722
{\an7}Let's do this, Raikage!

236
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,058
{\an1}Right!

237
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,125
{\an1}Huh?!

238
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:19,233
{\an4}<i>That Tsuchikage...He</i>

<i>which increased his speed,</i>
<i>but even so...</i>

239
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,706
{\an1}What a lousy punch!

240
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:29,475
{\an1}Not to worry. It'll
turn out the same
as before.

241
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,544
{\an1}Huh?!

242
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,317

00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,997
{\an1}Granny! Come on! Would ya
heal me already?!

246
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,634
{\an1}Just calm yourself and
listen to me, Naruto.

247
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,269
{\an1}You see, this war
that we're now
fighting...

248
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:06,274
{\an4}In the beginning, I only
agreed to join the Allied
Shinobi Forces in order to
get rid of the Akatsuki.

249
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:14,614
{\an4}But as I battled alongside
all of you, I started feeling
quite differently than I had
in the past.

250
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:19,385
{\an1}Now, I want to be here
as the Tsuchikage of the
Allied Shinobi Forces!

251
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:26,257
{\an4}In the exact same manner, some
shinobi villages which used to
be disparate and autonomous, are
now changing.

252
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,092
{\an1}They are becoming one.

253
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:35,232
{\an4}So perhaps this shinobi
world system, which thus far
has only bred hatred, can
change as well!

254
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,700
{\an1}Naruto...

255
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:42,238
{\an4}Please, let all of us
deal with this Madara.
I swear we'll finish
him off!

256
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:47,410
{\an4}It'll be our first step in
stopping the curse of hatred
we've all been under
until now.

257
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:52,047
{\an1}Like Madara, we Kage are
also guilty of stirring
up hate in the past.

258
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,015
{\an1}It's our responsibility
to make things right!

259
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,218
{\an1}Rest assured and
leave this to us!

260
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:03,089
{\an4}And you...You
go and take
care of the other
Madara, my boy.

261
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:07,226
{\an4}That act will become
the first step in
promoting hope for
the future.

262
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,729
{\an1}The old one or the
new one, it doesn't
really matter.

263
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:14,199
{\an1}Only by defeating both
Madaras will we be able
to bring this war to an end!

264
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:17,268
{\an1}We will all defend you
by fighting on this
battlefield.

265
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:21,372
{\an1}So protect us through your
actions by fighting over
there on that battlefield!

266
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:29,011
{\an4}Now, Clone Naruto...
I entrust you with this
message from all
the Five Kage.

267
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,991
{\an1}We'll win!

268
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,370
{\an1}Yeah!

269
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,506
{\an7}We'll win for sure!

270
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,275
{\an1}<i>Damn it! That thing</i>
<i>is really hard! I didn't</i>
<i>even crack it!</i>

271
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,178
{\an1}<i>Just chill out, Naruto!</i>
<i>Fool, ya fool.</i>

272
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:08,616
{\an7}<i>I could've simply passed</i>
<i>through you, but I guess</i>
<i>it doesn't matter if you</i>
<i>can't even crack the mask.</i>

273
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:12,986
