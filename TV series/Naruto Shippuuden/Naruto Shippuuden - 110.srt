1
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,579
‐Wha‐‐ what is this thing?

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,481
Is it a jutsu?

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,950
‐It's a slug.

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,318
‐Lady Tsunade summoned her.

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,553
It's Katsuyu.

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,153
‐Oh, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,421
‐I had no idea.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,923
‐Why have you come?

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,725
‐Why'd she send you, Katsuyu?

10
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,159
To help us out?

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,193
‐That's right.

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,563
You see, Lady Tsunade
had been concerned

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,398
about the effectiveness of
the sealing jutsu you were

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,035
employing earlier
against the tailed beast.

15
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,671
So she sent me along
to bring more chakra.

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,440
It should help
the sealing jutsu.

17
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,875
‐We could really use it.

18
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,845
‐Then I'll transfer
it to you immediately.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,847
‐Whenever you're ready.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,314
‐Very well then.

21
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,704
‐That damn Tsunade.

22
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:06,907
She had to send
Katsuyu, didn't she?

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,976
More, we need more
power, Yukimaru.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,912
[screaming]

25
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,731
‐Naruto, stop.

26
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:31,264
‐Yeah?

27
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:32,165
What is it?

28
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:37,203
‐Will I be forgiven?

29
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:43,043
I mean, will he forgive
me when Yukimaru finds out

30
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:48,566
that‐‐ that I'm responsible
for killing his mom.

31
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:52,986
‐That's still weighing
you down, huh?

32
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,355
‐I'm fully prepared
to protect Yukimaru.

33
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,623
It's just that‐‐

34
00:01:56,657 --> 00:02:00,661
‐Think about him, and only him.

35
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:03,704
He could push you
away, despise you.

36
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,639
None of that should matter.

37
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:06,907
Don't you see?

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,074
It's about him.

39
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,044
Who cares if I'm the
person he can call home.

40
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:16,149
The only important thing now
is to keep thinking about him.

41
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,117
‐Yeah, I think you're right.

42
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:22,288
I suppose if you're a fool,
that makes me one too, Naruto.

43
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:25,125
‐Hey, that's not nice.

44
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:25,692
Let's hurry.

45
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,299
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Yukimaru.

46
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:43,076
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I feel
the power of the Three‐Tails

47
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:44,077
beneath the surface.

48
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,512
‐It's too big.

49
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,981
I feel like the chakra's
going to explode.

50
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,449
‐Such energy.

51
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,351
Without Katsuyu's
chakra, my power

52
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,386
alone couldn't sustain this.

53
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,223
‐Listen, if the Three‐Tails
falls into Orochimaru's hands

54
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,834
or the Akatsuki's, it will
mean the end of the Hidden Leaf

55
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,837
Village as we know it.

56
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,639
But it won't.

57
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,374
Because the Three‐Tails
is in our hands now.

58
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,011
We're the only ones who
can protect our comrades

59
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:14,414
in the village from this power.

60
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,316
It's all up to us.

61
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,751
ALL: Right.

62
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,586
‐Listen, Katsuyu.

63
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,756
Is there a way you can amplify
your chakra even further?

64
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:23,423
‐Yes.

65
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,091
I will try my best.

66
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,628
‐We're going to send that
beast to the other dimension

67
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,394
right now.

68
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:49,049
‐I don't believe it.

69
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:52,085
They're still trying to
control the Three‐Tails.

70
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:55,722
[screaming]

71
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:57,023
‐Yukimaru.

72
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:59,793
Come on, kid, rile up
that Three‐Tails spirit.

73
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,167
Drive them wild.

74
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,437
Obliterate those pests
from the Hidden Leaf.

75
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,942
[screaming]

76
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,512
[theme music]

77
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,457
‐Hey, Sai.

78
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,492
Did those guys attack you too?

79
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,594
‐Yeah.

80
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,637
Unfortunately, they
got away with Yukimaru.

81
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,606
[barking]

82
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,574
‐What's this?

83
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,175
‐It must be them.

84
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,911
Let us attack.

85
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,647
‐Hold your horses, Lee.

86
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,549
‐What do you think you
are doing, Ten Ten?

87
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,551
We must go seek our revenge.

88
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,419
‐If we rush into
that smokescreen,

89
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,254
there's a chance
we'll hit each other.

90
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,656
‐Yeah.

91
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,559
Even Akamaru's sense of smell
will be useless in that stuff.

92
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,227
[whimper]

93
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,330
‐The best plan of action is to
just wait and see what happens.

94
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,865
‐Oh man.

95
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,266
I am so frustrated.

96
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,444
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
It seems the enemy

97
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:47,347
is using Yukimaru to
stir up the Three‐Tails.

98
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:54,054
If it keeps up, Shizune's
sealing team is in danger.

99
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:59,526
A sticky situation.

100
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,136
And trying to defeat all
these clones is impossible.

101
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:14,581
It's no good.

102
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:16,016
I can't dodge them all.

103
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,059
[groaning]

104
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,698
‐It's time.

105
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:32,966
Binding Smoke Prison.

106
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,049
Well, imagine my luck.

107
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:53,587
I get to bring down the fabled
Kakashi of the Hidden Leaf.

108
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,257
It'll make surviving all
these years worth it.

109
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,660
What?

110
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,302
‐Although I'm not
as skilled as you,

111
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:04,638
I do know how to
use shadow clones.

112
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,272
Lightning Blade.

113
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:06,807
‐Huh?

114
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,144
‐This is bad.

115
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,590
‐You know what they say,
where there's smoke,

116
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:26,192
there's always fire.

117
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,928
Meet my Smoke Dragon.

118
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:36,402
‐Smoke has no real form, so Wood
Style is useless against it.

119
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:40,140
Then I guess I'll just
have to change up my style.

120
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,008
Water Style, Hand of Waves.

121
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:48,248
‐What the hell?

122
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:55,055
‐Smoke is a vapor, and by
adding moisture to the mix,

123
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:57,524
it's too heavy for
you to control.

124
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:59,626
That how to use Water Style.

125
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,234
Now your jutsu is worthless.

126
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:09,009
[screaming]

127
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:09,976
‐Take this.

128
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,522
Silly boy, you
must have forgotten

129
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,356
that I have a third arm.

130
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:35,536
‐Hm?

131
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,306
‐I'm afraid play time is over.

132
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,515
Don't bother.

133
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,016
‐Spindle Formation.

134
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:55,822
‐What?

135
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,223
But how?

136
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:01,127
‐I admit, your jutsu is quite
formidable against my insects.

137
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:06,206
However, the reason you'll
lose is because of your fight

138
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,742
with Hinata of the Hyuga Clan.

139
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,211
I'll explain.

140
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,981
Hinata, may we speak?

141
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,350
‐Shino, what's the matter?

142
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,852
‐I need you to
tell me everything

143
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,588
you know about that
Crystal Style user.

144
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,257
Any detail will help.

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,929
‐Well, unfortunately, her
jutsu had no weaknesses.

146
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,232
And if I hadn't surrounded
myself with chakra,

147
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,467
I wouldn't be here now.

148
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,538
And speaking of
huge chakra, Shino,

149
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,541
you have to be careful
of that slimy guy.

150
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,776
He'll be very difficult
for you to beat.

151
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,645
‐Why is that?

152
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,548
‐Because his entire
body is his jutsu.

153
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,116
That body suit he wears is
filled with pure chakra,

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,120
and it allows him to alter
his form whenever he needs to.

155
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,289
When I used my Gentle
Fist against him,

156
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,660
he just twisted his body
away like it was nothing.

157
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,735
‐He overcame your Gentle Fist?

158
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,805
‐When I grazed his
body with my hand,

159
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,541
I accidentally
touched that fluid.

160
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,711
His entire body is
covered by some kind

161
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,245
of dangerous
mucus‐like substance.

162
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,384
‐So you see, I was tipped off.

163
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,986
Which is why this
whole time, I've

164
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,756
been concentrating on
scraping that lethal fluid

off your body.

‐Since we started fighting?

167
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,093
‐Yep.

168
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:30,196
I focused my attacks
on making that membrane

169
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,065
as thin as possible.

170
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:36,469
I assumed if I could weaken it,
your jutsu would break easily.

look, I was right.

‐Yeah.

‐Took a while, but‐‐

‐How about you guys?

180

Are you all OK?

00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:12,245
‐Yeah, we made it.

182
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,213
And Naruto?

183
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,280
How'd he do?

184
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,949
‐We haven't found him yet.

185
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:17,818
‐I'm sorry about Yukimaru.

186

‐Mm.

187
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:24,958
All right then, we should head
out to assist the sealing team.

188
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:25,559
‐Yes, captain.

189
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:26,059
‐Yes.

190
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,460
‐Right.

191
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:31,898
‐Don't forget, we must
recover and protect Yukimaru.

192

But first, we'll check
on the sealing team.

in a tough battle.

‐Ino, you don't need to rush.

Just slow down and
focus your mind

198
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,812
on stabilizing your chakra.

199
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:13,747
‐Right, OK.

Damn it, it's not enough.

204
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,402
Is that all there is to
Yukimaru's massive power?

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,643
Oh well, I guess this
isn't working anymore.

206
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:45,779
Heh.

207
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,285
I really didn't want to
have to resort to this,

208
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,254
but it looks like
it's my only choice.

209
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,701
You ready to give your life
for the Great Lord Orochimaru?

210
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,638
Here.

211
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,378
‐Yukimaru.

212
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,047
‐Guren, is he all right?

213
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,115
‐You again.

214
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,884
So you two didn't die after all.

215
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:19,452
‐Wake up.

216
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:20,220
What's wrong?

217
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,861
Come on, Yukimaru,
snap out of this.

218
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:28,361
Yukimaru.

219
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,042
Hi.

220
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,477
‐You came back.

221
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:47,413
Oh Guren, you came back.

222
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:51,451
It's because I was
thinking of you.

223
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:54,220
Whenever someone
is thinking of you,

224
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:56,590
that's the place
you come back to.

225
00:14:56,623 --> 00:15:00,527
‐Yes, that's right.

226
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:05,038
All you had to do was think
of me, and see, I came back.

227
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,006
‐Yeah.

228
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,441
‐When I was inside
the Three‐Tails,

229
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,512
trapped in some other dimension,
the only thing I thought

230
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,514
of that whole time was you.

231
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,616
And that's why‐‐
and that's why it's

232
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,784
your turn to return
to me, Yukimaru.

233
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,753
‐That makes me happy.

234
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,888
I'm coming back home.

235
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,226
You are my home, Guren,
the place I can return to

236
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,295
that always welcomes
me back with open arms.

237
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,734
[laughing]

238
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,969
‐Yeah, you're right.

239
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,840
At this point, Guren is the
only place you can run back to.

240
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:43,857
After all, your mother's not
around for you anymore, is she?

241
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,247
‐Stop.

242
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,849
I think you've said enough.

243
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,518
‐Actually, I wasn't
quite finished yet.

244
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,720
Yukimaru, listen to me.

245
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,793
‐Don't you say another word.

246
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,168
‐It's all right, Naruto.

247
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:02,869
‐What?

248
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,605
No, it's not.

249
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,972
‐It's OK.

250
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,042
We have to face the
truth, you taught me that.

251
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,945
‐Guren.

252
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:14,515
[laughing]

253
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,449
‐So you're prepared then?

254
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,318
How noble of you.

255
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,085
Listen up, Yukimaru.

256
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,825
One person destroyed
the place you

257
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,128
used to call home,
the same person who

258
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:31,064
turned that white camellia
red with your mother's blood.

259
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:45,432
The person responsible for
killing your mother is Guren.

260
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,784
She seems so nice, but
Guren is really a demon.

261
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,819
She hid the truth about
killing your mother

262
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,589
and pretended to be your
friend just to use you.

263
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,758
She's been using
you this whole time.

264
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:05,506
How does it feel?

265
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:06,773
Don't you loathe her?

266
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,474
Don't you want to
kill her yourself?

267
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,544
Well, no one's
going to stop you.

268
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,345
As if we could.

269
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,413
Do it.

270
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,749
Use the Three‐Tails
to vent your anger.

271
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:19,019
Command the Three‐Tails
to destroy everything

272
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,353
in your sight.

273
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:23,724
‐You bastard.

274
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:24,658
Shut your mouth.

275
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,469
‐Guren.

276
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:37,838
‐Yukimaru.

277
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:41,542
I'm sorry, but everything he
told you about me is the truth.

278
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,943
‐Listen to me, Yukimaru.

279
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:46,112
The Guren of the past might
have done lots of terrible stuff

280
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:50,551
in the name Orochimaru, but the
Guren you know is different.

281
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:53,353
I know for a fact, she regrets
the way she used to be.

282
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:57,390
She's so sorry, and now
she cares about you.

283
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,192
No matter how much
you hate her, she's

284
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,067
going to keep on
thinking about you.

285
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,536
She swore to me.

286
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:08,809
‐No matter what I tell
you, or what I do,

287
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,411
I realize that nothing
will ever erase the pain

288
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:15,281
that I've caused in your life.

289
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,450
If you want me to die
for what I've done,

290
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,352
I won't stand in your way.

291
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,188
But still, if you
could forgive me,

292
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:25,659
then I‐‐ I swear I'll
protect you forever.

293
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:33,634
‐Guren.

294
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:45,779
‐Yukimaru.

295
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,348
Are you saying you
don't despise me?

296
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:50,116
‐You're a nice person.

297
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,885
Why would I?

298
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,621
After all, we have a connection.

299
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,057
You're the one I can return to.

300
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,825
And don't you see?

301
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,135
I'm the one that you
can return to, Guren.

302
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:06,507
‐Do you mean‐‐ I promise,
for as long as live,

303
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,442
I will keep thinking about
you, and I will never

304
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,878
leave your side again.

305
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,981
‐And you'll never leave
my thoughts either, Guren.

306
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,149
That's my promise.

307
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:17,984
From today forward, forever.

308
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,158
I love you, and I always will.

309
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,027
‐Yeah, I love you too.

310
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:38,371
‐The two of you, together,
you'll never be apart.

‐What a complete farce.

You weaklings can
get all lovey‐dovey.

313

But a stupid bond like that will
be broken before you know it.

‐Kabuto, it's you.

‐Hello, Naruto.

00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,554
If you interfere, well
then, I'll kill you.

‐Kabuto, you're behind
all of this madness?

00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,882
That's the plan, anyway.

327
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,018
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): You're
just talking gibberish.

328
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:20,120
Guren, go with Yukimaru.

329
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:21,354
Protect him no matter what.

330
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,189
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): I
can't let you do that.

331
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:26,259
The two of them
must not be free.

332
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:29,162
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time‐‐ Shattered Promise.
