1
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,601
{\an1}Many shinobi from small
villages survived by taking

2
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:01,767
advantage of the
turbulent situation.

3
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,133
{\an1}They have no wish to be
controlled by the nations of

4
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,534
{\an1}Fire, Wind, and Earth.

5
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,234
{\an1}So I have no doubt
they'll continue

6
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,734
{\an1}to cause disruptions.

7
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,534
{\an1}However, this peace
was won through the

8
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,767
{\an1}sacrifice of many, so
we must maintain it.

9
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,701
{\an1}And for that, I'm going
to count on all of you.

10
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:22,601
Yes, sir!

11
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,901
[sigh]

12
00:02:59,067 --> 00:02:59,901
Chidori!

13
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,234
[gasp]

14
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:34,868
{\an1}Five shinobi! All
approaching rapidly!

15
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,234
Their headband?

16
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,834
{\an1}They're from the Stone.

17
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,100
{\an1}We have a peace treaty
with the Stone, don't we?

18
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,067
{\an1}So maybe they're here
on urgent business?

19
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:45,033
[gasp]

20
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,367
Why are you
breaking the treaty?!

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,701
{\an1}Hey! We're shinobi
from the Leaf Village!

22
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,200
{\an1}Stop! Maybe there's a
misunderstanding?!

23
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,000
Reinforcements!
Retreat!

24
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,934
{\an1}Thanks for that. Looks
like the Hidden Stone

25
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,234
has betrayed us!

26
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,567
{\an1}This isn't a Hidden
Stone shuriken.

27
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,934
{\an1}You mean they were
fakes?! But why would--?!

28
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,701
{\an1}To cause a rift between
the Stone and the Leaf.

29
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,100
Hey!

30
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,601
{\an1}Don't chase them too far!

31
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,000
Chidori!

32
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, there! How
have you been?

33
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,701
{\an1}You're ignoring me?!

34
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,534
{\an1}It's only been a short time
since Kakashi transferred

35
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,067
{\an1}into the ANBU, but
some of his actions

36
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,968
have been quite
astonishing.

37
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,434
[sigh]

38
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,501
One...

39
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:13,901
[scream]

40
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,601
[gasp]

41
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,167
Four!

42
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,234
[grunt]

43
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,501
The Sharingan!
You're the infamous

44
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,767
{\an1}cold-blooded Kakashi!

45
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,334
Kakashi! Wait!

46
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,634
Agh! Somebody!
Help me!

47
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,801
Five!

48
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,434
All five killed
with a single blow to

49
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,901
{\an1}their vital points.

50
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,167
If you'd kept at
least one alive, we

51
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,133
{\an1}could've gotten intel.

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,934
[gasp]

53
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:05,701
{\an1}Lord Hokage, regarding your
concerns: we've seen no

54
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:08,234
{\an1}evidence of psychological
trauma in Kakashi

55
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,200
{\an1}from taking Rin's life.

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,167
{\an1}Is something on your mind?

57
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm okay...

58
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,167
Congratulations!

59
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:30,534
Huh?

60
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:35,400
{\an1}Your due date works out to
be. Let's see, October tenth!

61
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,834
{\an1}[chuckle] Oh, that's great!

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,434
What?! A baby?!

63
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,234
{\an1}That's right! I'm gonna
be a mother, ya know!

64
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:50,234
{\an1}And I'm gonna be a father...

65
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,868
I'm gonna be a
mother, ya know!

66
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,167
And I'm really
gonna be a father!

67
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm gonna be a
mother, ya know!

68
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,567
[happy giggle]

69
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,067
{\an1}Wow, imagine that,
I'm gonna be a father!

70
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,934
{\an1}[enthusiastic laughter]

71
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,367
I can't believe
I'm gonna mother!

72
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,667
{\an1}Kakashi, I want you to leave
your current position and

73
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,801
take on another,
special one.

74
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,234
{\an1}Is there a problem?

75
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,534
Oh, no, it's
nothing like that.

76
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,501
{\an1}Instead, this will be more
like a top-secret errand.

77
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,968
You see, Kushina
is pregnant!

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,601
[gasp] Oh!
Congratulations!

79
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,200
Thank you.

80
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,467
However...

81
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:38,067
{\an1}When a female Jinchuriki
becomes pregnant,

82
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,367
{\an1}the energy that keeps
the seal in place is

83
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,634
{\an1}temporarily transferred
to the fetus.

84
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,701
{\an1}As a result, the seal of
the Tailed Beast weakens.

85
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:48,701
{\an1}In any event, it will be
roughly nine months

86
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,200
{\an1}till she gives birth.

87
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:53,100
{\an1}Till then, I want you to
guard Kushina against

88
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,267
any incidents.

89
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:55,701
Yes, sir!

90
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:47,067
{\an1}Thank you, Kakashi,
for protecting Kushina.

91
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,167
Of course. But...

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,868
{\an1}This is just standard
procedure. The ANBU

93
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:54,334
{\an1}directly under Lord Third
take over guard duties

94
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,934
{\an1}during the actual birth.

95
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,968
{\an1}Then I'll be returning to
my regular ANBU duties?

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,601
{\an1}There's really no need
for you to be so hasty.

97
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,801
{\an1}Why don't you take little
a break for a while?

98
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,901
[sigh]

99
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:23,634
{\an1}I'm so sorry I haven't
been able to come by.

100
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,534
{\an1}It isn't as if I've
forgotten about you.

101
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,300
{\an1}It's just, this is
technically top secret info.

102
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,634
{\an1}But Minato Sensei's
child is about to be born.

103
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,734
This generation
won't know war.

104
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:42,501
{\an1}If only we'd been
born a little later.

105
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,601
I ought to tell
Obito, too.

106
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,200
{\an1}So I'll be going now.

107
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,501
Later, Rin.

108
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,033
[chatter]

109
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,734
{\an1}Thanks for coming!

110
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,601
{\an1}Sure! I'll be back!

111
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,267
I know, come on!
Let's go home!

112
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,234
{\an1}Look, why don't we just do
Rock-Paper-Scissors again?

113
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,367
{\an1}Oh come on! There
must be something more

114
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,133
{\an1}exciting that we can do!

115
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,067
And you call
yourself my rival!

116
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,801
{\an1}We have to get an
early start tomorrow.

117
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,133
{\an1}So let's just take
a pass on tonight.

118
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,667
{\an1}A mission is no excuse!

119
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:42,400
{\an1}I have all of this pent-up
energy inside me, so there's

120
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,367
{\an1}no better time than
right now for some

121
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,334
{\an1}really rigorous training!

122
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,534
{\an1}Honest-to-goodness
discipline and hard work

123
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,167
{\an1}will lead us to success
in future missions!

124
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:56,100
{\an1}Hey! Kakashi! Are you
even listening to me one
tiny little bit?!

125
00:10:56,767 --> 00:11:00,067
{\an1}You sure have gotten awfully
cold since joining the ANBU!

126
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,367
{\an1}I've heard the gossip.

127
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,701
{\an1}Everyone's saying
that you're really

128
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,501
{\an1}cold-blooded now.

129
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,868
{\an1}I know we can't discuss the
ANBU, but we can't cast

130
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,434
{\an1}aside our friendship!

131
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,734
{\an1}Youth is short, you know!

132
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:15,501
{\an1}Forget that for now. Do you
sense something strange?

133
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:18,901
{\an1}As if there were suddenly
a dark chill in the air?

134
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:21,701
{\an1}The only thing that's
chilly is your attitude!

135
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,300
You must be much
more hot-blooded!

136
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,334
I feel something
ominous.

137
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,801
[baby crying]

138
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,434
{\an1}There, there. It's okay...

139
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:47,033
{\an1}What a strange feeling.
Of all the times for Mom

140
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,634
{\an1}and Dad to be out...

141
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,234
{\an1}Don't cry, Sasuke. No matter
what happens, your big

142
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:56,000
{\an1}brother will protect
you, I promise you that.

143
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:05,300
It can't be...

144
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,467
Summoning Jutsu!

No! No way!

00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,601
Lord Third! It's
the Nine Tails!

159
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,367
{\an1}The Nine Tails is
inside the village!

160
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,734
{\an1}Damn you, Nine Tails!

161
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,868
{\an1}It's time to release all
of my pent-up energy!

162
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,133
We don't know
what we're facing!

163
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,234
Come on! I'll be
your opponent!

164
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:28,934
Wait!

165
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:29,968
Huh?

166
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,634
{\an1}We all need to gather
immediately in the guardroom!

167
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,601
Why?

168
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,234
The Third Hokage
ordered it!

169
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,968
What? Lord
Hiruzen did?!

170
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,400
Well, you heard
him. Let's go, Guy!

171
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:46,100
{\an1}Listen up. You younger
shinobi stay away

172
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,801
{\an1}from the Nine Tails.

173
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,501
{\an1}What do you mean?

174
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,434
This is domestic
trouble, not a war

175
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,234
{\an1}against other villages.

176
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,400
{\an1}There's no need for all
of you to put your lives

177
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,067
{\an1}on the line for this.

178
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,000
{\an1}You've got to be kidding!

179
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,133
Stop, Kurenai;
just calm down!

180
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,267
{\an1}You are also a shinobi.
You aren't going to live

181
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,767
{\an1}forever, you know.

182
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:10,033
{\an1}But, my daughter, you're a
woman, too. Bequeath the

183
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,501
{\an1}Will of Fire upon my
future grandchildren!

184
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,968
{\an1}Please make that your
oath to me, your father.

185
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,667
{\an1}For I do believe in you.

186
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
{\an1}It's no time for a
family argument!

187
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:28,501
{\an1}I hate not being able to do
anything! Especially now!

188
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,167
Minato Sensei...

189
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,501
The barrier's
disappeared!

190
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,767
Lord Fourth!

191
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,234
Lady Kushina!

192
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,868
Take her to the
hospital right away!

193
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,934
Summon the
Medical Ninja!

194
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,167
{\an1}Please, Lord Third...

195
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:06,868
Kushina!

196
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:11,000
{\an1}I beg you. Please
take care of our baby.

197
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:14,234
{\an1}Yes, of course, you don't
need to worry about that!

198
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:17,534
{\an1}His name is Naruto.

199
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,434
Minato and I...

200
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:25,234
{\an1}Together, we both picked
that name out of the pages.

201
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,634
{\an1}Of Jiraiya Sensei's novel.

202
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,234
Naruto, you say?
Very well. I'll take

203
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,767
responsibility!

204
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:36,033
{\an1}But now, for the sake of
your child, you must rest!

205
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,133
[gasp]

206
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:47,868
Kushina...

207
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,133
{\an1}I'll keep my promise.

208
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,100
Minato...

209
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,634
{\an1}And Kushina, both of you
gave your lives to protect

210
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:48,100
{\an1}the Hidden Leaf Village,
and to safeguard
its future as well.

211
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,868
Minato Sensei.

212
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,968
{\an1}We managed to quell
the Nine Tails, but the

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,200
sacrifice was
much too great.

214
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,567
However, it's no
time to lament.

215
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,534
{\an1}The Hokage's seat is now
empty, and we must decide

216
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,601
{\an1}with all haste on the
person who will fill it.

217
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,968
{\an1}Perhaps someone from the
generation after Minato

218
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
could take over.

219
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:39,267
{\an1}We have nurtured fine
jonin, without a doubt!

220
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,167
{\an1}But unfortunately, none
of them yet possess

221
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,367
{\an1}the experience to rule
over a whole village.

222
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,367
Is there anyone
who has that?

223
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,167
Uh...

224
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,200
{\an1}It can't be helped.
This is a critical time.

225
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,267
So I shall take
over as Hokage.

226
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,601
You would really
consider doing that?

227
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,968
{\an1}Well, then, if you're
still truly willing to--

228
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,133
You quit once.

229
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,567
{\an1}Do you really believe
that you're up to the task?

230
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,467
Can you actually
handle it?

231
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
{\an1}Truth be told, even though
you did go after the Nine

232
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,167
{\an1}Tails, you still failed
to save the Fourth

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
{\an1}Hokage from his fate.

234
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,601
Such a remark is
completely uncalled for!

235
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,667
{\an1}And where were you
during the battle against

236
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,434
{\an1}the Nine Tails, Danzo?

237
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,434
[growl]

238
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,701
[laughter]

239
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,133
Please, indulge
this old man.

240
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,734
{\an1}Allow me to fill in as
Hokage, just for the time

241
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:32,267
{\an1}being until we can
groom the next one.

242
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,834
[growl]

243
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,200
{\an1}You're Kakashi Hatake,
isn't that right?

244
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,767
Lord Danzo...

245
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:59,200
{\an1}Listen, come and work under
me. What do you say to that?

246
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:02,634
{\an1}But I was working
for Minato Sensei.

247
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,801
{\an1}I'm afraid that Lord
Fourth, the one who

248
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:08,467
{\an1}recruited you into the
ANBU, is no longer with us.

249
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,367
{\an1}If you stay where you are,
you'll end up working

250
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,601
{\an1}directly under the
Third Hokage, who will

251
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:14,901
{\an1}reassume his old position.

252
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,534
{\an1}His foolhardy ideals
of peace are what

253
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,667
caused the war
to drag on.

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,567
{\an1}And also drove Obito
and Rin to their deaths.

255
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:24,868
But, sir!

256
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,334
Furthermore...

257
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,901
{\an1}On the night of the Nine
Tails rampage, you weren't

258
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,801
{\an1}able to join in the fight.

259
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,133
{\an1}That was because of
orders that the Lord Third

260
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,100
{\an1}Hokage himself gave.

261
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,534
{\an1}To be frank, isn't that
one of the reasons why

262
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,133
{\an1}Lord Fourth lost his
life that night?

263
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:41,467
[gasp]

264
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,534
{\an1}I don't want to believe
that Lord Third planned all

265
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,634
this in order to
return to power...

266
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,300
{\an1}But the future of the Leaf
cannot be entrusted to

267
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,901
{\an1}someone like him!

268
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,968
{\an1}A select few of you
ANBU will be chosen to

269
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,501
{\an1}guard the Feudal Lord's
procession on the way

270
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,067
{\an1}back to his prefecture.

271
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,701
Yes, sir!

272
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
{\an1}And this will be our plan.

273
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:24,667
Wood Style?!

274
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,467
{\an1}Wood Style! Giant
Forest Jutsu!

275
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Enough!

276
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,000
I requested that
he join us here.

277
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:55,868
Yes, sir.

278
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:59,467
I appreciate
you coming.

279
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,734
This is it.

280
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,334
{\an1}It appears that the
time has arrived.

281
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,868
Excellent work,
Kakashi.

282
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,934
{\an1}<i>Hashirama Senju, who</i>
