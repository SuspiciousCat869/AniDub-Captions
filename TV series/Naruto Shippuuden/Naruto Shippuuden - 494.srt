00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:54,662
Hmm?

144
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,262
{\an1}So did you think of a
congratulatory message?

145
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,598
{\an1}Oh, no. Sorry, I forgot.

146
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,532
Hmm?

147
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,701
{\an1}<i>(Ebisu) The Advancement Exam?</i>

148
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:08,203
{\an1}It was recommended I take it to
become Vice Principal.

149
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,070
{\an1}W- Wha?

150
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:10,805
{\an8}<i>Why only Iruka?</i>

151
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,474
{\an7}<i>Does that mean I'm not among</i>

<i>candidate?</i>

152
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,674
{\an7}<i>No, that can't be right!</i>

153
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:17,776
Uh, what's wrong,
Ebisu Sensei?

154
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,644
{\an1}Huh? There's nothing wrong!
[nervous laughing]

155
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:22,979
Anyway. What a great
opportunity!

156
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,347
Yeah.

157
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,484
{\an1}Naruto's upcoming wedding will
be even more joyful now that
his mentor is being promoted!

158
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,919
{\an1}That's true! And we'll have
to call you Vice Principal
Iruka-Sensei!

159
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:38,055
{\an1}Oh, no, please don't! At this
point, I haven't even decided if
I'm going to take the test.

160
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:41,458
{\an1}Really? But you wouldn't
pass up a chance like this,
would you?

161
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:44,694
{\an1}Ebisu Sensei, you know, you
look sorta happy.

162
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:49,697
{\an1}I admit I'm grateful for the
opportunity to be promoted.
And besides...

163
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,265
{\an1}<i>(Tsukune) You mean Naruto</i>
<i>Uzumaki, the super-famous Naruto</i>
<i>Uzumaki?</i>

164

{\an1}<i>(Mibuna) No way a plain and</i>

165

{\an1}I know that I'm supposed to be
striving to get ahead in my
career.

166
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,907
{\an1}But there's also a part of me
that really wants to just
continue teaching kids.

167
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,307
One on one.

168
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,878
{\an1}Well, yeah, of course! That's
because you undoubtedly shine in
the classroom, Iruka! It's true!

169
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,179
I still think you seem
a little too happy.

{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) So, what's going on?</i>

171
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:18,481
Uh? Hmm?

00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:21,483
Huh?

173
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:23,452
{\an1}Oh! Lord Kakashi!

174
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:25,786
{\an1}Could all of you just
drop the "lord" part?

175
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,555
{\an1}Jeeze, how long have you been
there? I didn't notice you at
all.

176
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:34,024
{\an1}Well, all of you were going
on about Iruka. So, I didn't
want to interrupt.

177
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:38,828
{\an1}Lord Kakashi, uh, I mean
Kakashi, is something going on
with you, too?

178
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:42,030
{\an1}Oh, no. But what's up with
you, Iruka?

179
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,766
{\an1}He was just asked to take the
Advancement Exam to become the
Vice Principal!

180
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,302
{\an1}Vice Principal? Oh, right,
that position is open.

181
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:54,772
{\an1}Honestly, I'm not entirely
sure if I should take it.

182
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:58,474
{\an1}Oh, really? You? Taking the
Advancement Exam?

183
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,743
{\an1}Now that would be quite
difficult!

184
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:01,376
Uh.

185
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,075
Huh?

186
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,479
{\an1}Well, I'd better get back to
work now.

187
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,647

{\an1}<i>(Teuchi) Thanks for coming!</i>

189

{\an1}Hah! Hey Ayame, did you take
Lord Kakashi's order?

190
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,517
{\an3}Huh?

191
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,350
{\an3}Wait!

194
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:18,787
{\an1}Hmm?

195
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,723
{\an1}<i>(Ayame) Yeah, was he talking</i>

196

I get it!

198
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,193
{\an1}It's clear to me that as the
Hokage...

199
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:34,330
{\an1}Lord Kakashi doesn't
believe that Iruka is suitable
to be the Vice Principal!

200
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,298

00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:26,146
{\an1}Really, could you please
drop the "lord" stuff?

284
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,915
{\an1}Uh? What's the matter, Ebisu?
Why are you so spaced out?

285
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:34,417
{\an1}We were just talking about
whether Iruka Sensei will pass
the Advancement Exam or not.

286
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:38,120
{\an1}Huh? Iruka's actually
planning on taking the exam?

287
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,889
{\an1}Of course! And it's all thanks
to you, Kakashi!

288
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,858
{\an1}It's thanks to me? What did
I do?

289
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,592
{\an1}Oh, don't be humble!

290
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,762
{\an1}Oh that smells delicious! It
must be ramen.

291
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,831
{\an1}Seems they didn't order
potstickers though.

292
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,798
{\an1}Wait, are you serious? Is that
what happened?

293
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,700
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) I really didn't mean</i>
<i>it that way at all!</i>

294
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,368
{\an1}What did you mean, then?

295
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:05,171
{\an1}It's just that, regarding the
Advancement Exam...

296
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:05,938
{\an1}Lord Kakashi!

297
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,840
{\an1}How many times do I need to
ask you to drop the "lord?"

298
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,807
{\an1}Never mind that! We have a big
problem!

299
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,309
{\an1}What? The Scroll of Sealing
has been stolen?

300
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:18,545
{\an1}Yeah! No one has any idea where
it is, and every shinobi is out
searching for it right now.

301
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,647
Don't tell me.

302
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,281
[grunting]

303
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,983
{\an1}[gasps] Iruka Sensei!

304
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,485
{\an1}[heavy breathing] Uh!

305
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:30,954
{\an1}Sansho! Mibuna! Where is Tsukune
now?

306
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,989
{\an1}I swear we tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't listen to us!

307
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,289
{\an8}<i>I knew it.</i>

308
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,125
Hmph.

309
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,229
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

310
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:43,963
See?

311
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:46,164
{\an1}That was totally easy!

312
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:50,466
{\an1}And next, I'm gonna use this
to mess up the Great Stone
Faces!

313
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,434
<i>(Iruka) Stop!</i>

314
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,101
[gasps]

315
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,903
{\an1}I knew that I'd find you
here.

316
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,705
{\an1}You're planning to use a Shadow
Clone from the Scroll of
Sealing...

317
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,672
{\an1}and pull off a flashy prank,
aren't you?

318
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:04,542
{\an1}Well let me guess what you're
planning: to say you know
what I'm thinking?

319
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,944
{\an1}No, I actually don't know what
you're thinking.

320
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:11,847
{\an1}[grunts] I don't even
know what I'm doing anymore!

321
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:15,116
{\an1}I keep comparing students to
the ones I had in the past!

322
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,018
{\an1}But doing that is preventing
me from seeing into the heart...

323
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,786
{\an1}of the precious student
right in front of me!

324
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,320
{\an1}[gasps] Iruka Sensei.

325
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,389
{\an1}I get it now, Tsukune.

326
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:30,659
{\an1}All you want is to be
acknowledged, don't you?

327
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:35,428
{\an1}And I didn't see that and just
kept bragging about an old
student.

328
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,830
{\an1}How long have I been a
teacher anyway?

329
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,767
{\an1}I have been such a fool! I'm so
sorry, Tsukune! Please forgive
me!

330
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,637
{\an1}So did you mean it?

331
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,503
Hmm?

332
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:51,338
You know, about
what you said to us.

333
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:55,175
{\an1}I think anyone here can become
a hero just like Naruto!

334
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,310
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) You simply have to</i>
<i>believe in yourself and always</i>
<i>try to do your best!</i>

335
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,579
{\an1}Of course! I did mean it!

336
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,616
{\an1}Okay then, I guess that I
could give that whole "trying
my best" idea a shot.

337
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:14,353
{\an1}I'm very sorry about what my
student did.

338
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:17,355
{\an1}And I take full
responsibility for it.

339
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,758
{\an1}Oh, yeah? Do me a favor and
confirm what's inside of there,
will you?

340
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,458
Huh?

341
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:28,663
{\an1}What is this? "To me, love is
life. Love is absolutely
everything, you see?!"

342
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:34,333
{\an1}There's no way that I'd leave
the real thing where it can be
stolen so easily. Not again.

343
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,968
Good point.

344
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:40,137
{\an1}And, Iruka? About that
Advancement Exam.

345
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,906
{\an1}Oh yeah. I know. You were right,
Kakashi. Vice Principal's more
than I can handle.

346
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,910
{\an1}Huh? Oh no, when I
said "difficult" all I really
meant by that was...

347
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:54,445
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) the Advancement Exam</i>
<i>is going to be on the same day</i>
<i>as Naruto's wedding!</i>

348
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:55,280
Huh?

349
00:18:56,848 --> 00:19:00,649
{\an1}You were his mentor, Iruka.
There's no way that you can
miss his wedding.

350
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,919
{\an1}Anyway, the situation got me
thinking.

351
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:07,487
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) I could schedule an</i>
<i>extra day for the Advancement</i>
<i>Exam.</i>

352
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:12,291
{\an1}I'd really like you to become
the Vice Principal, Iruka.

353
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,126
{\an1}And serve as a shining example
to all the other Academy...

354
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,993
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:16,660
{\an3}Hmm?

356
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:19,262
{\an1}I've decided not to take the
exam.

357
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:24,166
{\an1}I got carried away about going
to Naruto's wedding as the
newly promoted Vice Principal...

358
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:28,001
{\an1}and I forgot about all of my
students who are right in
front of my eyes.

359
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,469
{\an1}I have failed them all as a
teacher.

360
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,771
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) I have no right to go</i>
<i>celebrate with Naruto.</i>

361
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,340
Hmm.

362
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,374
{\an1}I've gotta take care of my
current students...

363
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:42,509
{\an1}and cherish all of the things
that are right in front of me.

364
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:46,213
{\an1}Then and only then can I
properly congratulate Naruto.

365
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:51,649
{\an1}I think I understand. Cherish
the things that are right in
front you, huh.

366
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:56,418
{\an1}It's more important to fulfill
the responsibility that's right
front of you.

367
00:19:56,452 --> 00:20:00,688
{\an1}Huh. Yes, you're right. Well,
I've decided, too!

368
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:03,224
Huh? About what?

369
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,659
{\an1}I assembled all of you here
today...

370
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:11,263
{\an1}in order to relay something to
you as your Sixth Hokage.

371
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:16,832
{\an1}Listen, I'm giving you a
secret mission.

372
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:21,102
{\an1}Each of you is to prepare a
congratulatory gift for Naruto
and Hinata's wedding.

373
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:24,938
{\an1}Report back one week before the
ceremony...

374
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:28,173
{\an1}and make sure to have
your gift at the ready when you
do.

375
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,141
Really? A gift?

376
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,875
Oh, yeah! Great!

377
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,509
{\an1}Man, what a drag.

378
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,378
{\an1}Just leave it to Lord Hokage!

379
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,212
{\an1}All right. That's about it.

380
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,981
{\an1}But Kakashi, just what is
this all about?

381
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,584
{\an1}We're going to assess and rank
each gift.

382
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:48,452
{\an1}That way we can determine
who'll attend the wedding
ceremony...

383
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,554
{\an1}and who'll be placed
on duty for that day's missions.

384
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:54,857
{\an1}In other words, we're going
to sift and screen through the
gifts.

385
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,626
{\an1}What? Really? But isn't that
like measuring their friendship?
Like putting a price tag on it?

386
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,897
{\an1}M-hm. But what's really
important is what's right in
front of me, isn't that true?

387
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,367
{\an1}I'm prepared to be called the
worst Hokage in the history of
the Leaf for this.

388
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,369
{\an1}The worst Hokage in the
history of the Leaf?

389
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,903
{\an1}And it's all thanks to you,
Iruka!

390
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,904
[grunts]

391
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:18,638
Wha?

392
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:21,006
What?
