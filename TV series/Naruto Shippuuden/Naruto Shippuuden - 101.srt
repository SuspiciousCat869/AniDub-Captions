00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,920
‐Well, are we getting close?

2
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,522
‐At the rate we're
traveling, we'll

3
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,858
get there about noon tomorrow.

4
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,861
And will you please stop
asking me the same question

5
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,795
every five minutes?

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,963
‐What, me?

7
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,064
‐Come on, Lee.

8
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,066
Try not to be so
impatient, will you?

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,736
‐How can I not be impatient
when at this very moment

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,571
our comrades might
be in desperate need

11
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,939
of our assistance?

12
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,141
Let me remind you that our
mission is to provide them

13
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,409
with hot‐blooded backup
as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,447
‐You wasting all that energy
doesn't make us go any faster.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,082
‐Shizune, can I
ask you something?

16
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,050
‐Hm?

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,451
‐It the enemy's
already made contact

18
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,354
with the Three‐Tails, that
means they must have developed

19
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,990
some kind of jutsu that
will control it, right?

20
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,091
‐That's right.

21
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,126
Most likely some
form of sealing jutsu

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,035
that we're not familiar with.

23
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,438
But if we get there in time, we
can use our own sealing jutsu.

24
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,641
We can't allow them
to beat us to it.

25
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:08,942
‐Then we all agree.

26
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:11,077
We should increase our pace
to twice, or even better,

27
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,013
three times our current speed.

28
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,716
‐Oh, brother, not
this speech again.

29
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,050
‐Actually, he has a good point.

30
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,785
We could pick up
the pace a little.

31
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,386
Pakkun, lead the way.

32
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,988
‐OK, if you insist.

33
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,089
Try to keep up, everyone.

There.

38
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,312
That should do it.

39
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:48,248
Well, Kakashi,
what do you think?

40
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,850
‐(DISTRACTED) Yeah, looks good.

41
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:53,319
‐Hm.

42
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:01,702
You've, uh, been staring at
that page for quite a while now.

43
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,369
You want to tell me
what's on your mind?

44
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:04,437
‐Huh?

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,473
Oh, this and that.

46
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,977
Yamato, don't you
wonder just how

47
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,147
those guys were planning
to capture the Three‐Tails?

48
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,549
‐That's a good question.

49
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,951
It is a tailed beast, after all.

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,220
Our enemy's Crystal
Style is powerful,

51
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:23,289
but I doubt it's enough to
restrain a tailed beast.

52
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,692
But perhaps it
works in conjunction

53
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,028
with something else?

54
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,063
KAKASHI: Even so,
they didn't manage

55
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:33,466
to delay us for very
long back there.

56
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,969
It's hard to believe they could
have come up with something

57
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:39,673
so big in such a
short amount of time.

58
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:41,642
‐That's true.

59
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:45,579
But then, what about the little
boy Naruto saw by the lake?

60
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,715
‐Yeah, that's been
bothering me, too.

61
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:51,652
Almost as much as the prospect
of facing that Crystal Style

62
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,354
user again.

63
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,222
‐Where are you going?

64
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,191
‐It's time we came up
with a plan of action.

65
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:04,905
‐Kakashi Sensei.

66
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:07,207
‐Sorry to interrupt.

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,375
(LOUDLY) Hey, there's
something I want to discuss.

68
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:13,580
‐All right.

69
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,321
[music ‐ Joe Inoue, "Closer"]

‐‐[gasp] You know, I‐‐

72
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:20,921
I found
a place where I can return to.

73
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,323
It's with you.

74
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,794
‐Where you can return to.

75
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,294
Ah?

76
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,371
‐Where is he?

77
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,106
He's got to be around
here somewhere.

78
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,078
‐That one.

79
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,815
A Leaf Ninja again.

80
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,417
He could prove troublesome
if I let him get any closer.

81
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,023
Don't go anywhere, OK?

82
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,170
‐OK, we're here to relieve you.

83
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:05,071
‐Right.

84
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:07,440
Nothing unusual
to report so far.

85
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:09,175
SAI: Uh, Sakura?

86
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,076
‐What is it?

87
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,878
‐Sai, what are you
doing over here?

88
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,446
You're supposed to
be at your post.

89
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,882
‐Uh, yes, I'm aware of that.

90
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,785
But do you know where Naruto is?

91
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,653
‐Huh?

92
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,187
He's not on watch?

93
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:22,188
‐No, he isn't.

94
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:23,957
I was supposed to relieve him.

95
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,527
‐Don't tell me he headed
back to camp early.

96
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,661
‐I don't think so.

97
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,763
If he had, I would
have run into him.

98
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:30,797
‐That's right.

99
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,265
Even Naruto would
wait to be relieved

100
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,134
before [gasp] No way!

101

‐If that wave had
carried him off,

102
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,877
there wouldn't be any
trace of him left behind.

103
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,413
All right.

104
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,215

As far as I can
tell, Naruto just up

133
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,044
and took off on his own.

was something on his mind.

we have to find
him, and quickly.

‐Listen, you, I'm
taking that kid back,

166
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,528
so just hand him over!

167
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:28,962
‐Taking him back?

168
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:30,063
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:31,264
He never belonged to you.

170
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,133
He was always one of us.

171
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,236
‐No, he wasn't always with
you, and if he is now,

172
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,839
it's only 'cause of me,
'cause of my big mouth

173
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:41,007
and all the stupid
things I said.

174
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,943
‐What stupid things?

175
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,410
‐Hey, thank you.

176
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:47,013
You're the one who taught
me about going home.

177
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:47,781
‐Uh?

178
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:48,582
Hey.

179
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:50,483
‐Yukimaru, what are you‐‐

180
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,452
‐Wherever someone's
thinking about you,

181
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:54,420
that's the place you belong.

182
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,088
‐No!

183
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,389
Stay where you are!

184
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,859
‐I wanted to thank you
again for teaching me that,

185
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,235
because I found where it
is, the place I belong.

186
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,304
Right, Guren?

187
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,238
‐What have I done?

188
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,175
‐Get away from him!

189
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,045
‐Don't move.

190
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,048
‐So you had another shadow
clone up your sleeve.

191
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,050
‐What are you doing?

192
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,819
‐Hey, so what was
your name again?

193
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,486
Yukimaru?

194
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,156
My name's Naruto.

195
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,558
‐Naruto?

196
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,992
‐What's going to
happen, Yukimaru,

197
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,360
is that you're
going to come home

198
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,662
with me to the Leaf Village.

199
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,230
‐Why is that?

200
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,432
‐Because there's no way
you belong with this woman.

201
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,333
Trust me on that.

202
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,372
She follows Orochimaru,
and Orochimaru's

203
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,475
a guy who thinks only of
his own twisted ambitions.

204
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,513
He'd sacrifice anything and
anybody to get what he wants.

205
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,281
And as far as I'm
concerned, anyone

206
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,618
who'd serve a guy like that
is just as bad as he is!

207
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:56,189
‐But Guren's the one
who thinks about me.

208
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,691
She's always kind to me.

209
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,292
She always protects me.

210
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,467
This might be hard to
understand, but trust me,

211
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:03,336
all she's doing is using you.

212
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,771

215
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:12,613

More Leaf Ninja.

him with you, no matter what!

Let me out of here!

00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,056
‐Forget it.

229
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,791
Anyway, they're gone.

230
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:58,291

would sacrifice anything and

Are you hurt?

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,931
Oof!

239
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,198
‐Will you stop pestering me?

belong with this woman.

upset you, but it's

just that I'm glad you're OK.

Thanks, Biscuit.

[shoom]

254
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,117
What were you thinking, Naruto,
going off all on your own

255
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,786
like that when you knew the
woman we've been chasing

256
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,954
was still out there?

257
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,355
It was foolish.

00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:25,191
‐But I was just‐‐
it was that kid.

259
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,426
I was trying to find him.

260
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,728
‐There is no excuse.

261
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,530
If we hadn't come along,
you might not even

262
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:31,131
be alive right now.

263
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,768
You put the whole squad at risk
by giving in to your emotions.

00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:36,870
By sending you on this
mission, Lady Tsunade

00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,740
put her trust in you, a
trust not given lightly.

00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:43,176
‐OK, you're right.

267
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,245
It was wrong of me.

‐[sighs]

enemy.

271
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,323
If one of us goes off
half‐cocked on his own,

272
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,760
it puts the rest
of us in danger.

273
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:02,503
Just try to remember that, OK?

274
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:03,537
‐I will.

275
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,539
‐So should we get
back to the others?

276
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:06,907
‐Sure.

277
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,344
By the way, Naruto, this boy
you say you saw by the lake‐‐

278
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:12,078
‐Yeah?

279
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,247
What about him?

280
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,683
‐Something's been troubling me.

281
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,252
Tell me more about
this encounter.

00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:35,502
‐Uh?

284
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,470
Guren, am I happy to see you.

285
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:38,972
You're OK.

286
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:42,008
Sorry I wasn't more help, but
I couldn't use my search net

287
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,143
so near the lake.

288
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,811
‐Just forget about it.

289
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:48,448
So I see we're all here, still
at full fighting strength.

290
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,917
I have to admit there's
at least one of our party

291
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,352
I wouldn't mind losing.

292
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,320
‐I'm blessed with the
luck of the wicked.

293
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,355
We have that in common.

294
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:04,204
He's a bit weakened,
but he be all right.

295
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,471
‐He's exhausted.

296
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:06,973
Let him rest.

297
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,710
‐Unfortunately we haven't
really got the time

298
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,144
to hang around here resting.

299
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:15,816
‐Hm.

300
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,630
‐I just can't figure
out why these guys would

301
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,431
be dragging a little
kid along with them.

302
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,066
They've already got
all they can handle

303
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,268
trying to snare that
Three‐Tailed beast.

304
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,171
‐What do you mean,
Kakashi Sensei?

305
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,974
‐Well, what if he possesses
some special power that

306
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,275
works against the Three‐Tails?

307
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,014
‐Wait a minute.

308
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:51,017
Come to think of it,
there was something

309
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,688
he did that seemed to make
the Three‐Tails stop moving.

310
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,326
‐Bingo.

311
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,970
‐You trying to tell me a human
was controlling a tailed beast?

312
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,205
‐Don't ask me how.

313
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,975
But remember, we're dealing
with Orochimaru here.

314
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,678
In any case, they're
obviously using this boy

315
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:14,414
to help them capture
the Three‐Tails.

316
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,349
‐If he's such a key
part of their plan,

317
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:19,219
it seems imperative that
we do something about him.

318
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:20,420
‐What do you mean, something?

319
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:21,555
Like what?

320
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:24,157
‐Like grabbing him at
the first opportunity.

321
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,925
‐Grabbing him?

322
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,226
‐Yeah.

323
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,928
I'm thinking if they
don't have the boy,

324
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,096
they can't capture
the Three‐Tails.

325
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,065
‐And I seriously
doubt that Orochimaru

326
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:35,268
will be satisfied with

He's trying to find
a way to create

a jinchuriki that
he can control.

329
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,576
The boy's ability to
interact with a tailed beast

330
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:44,277
will help him achieve that.

331
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,180
The boy's simply a
tool toward an end.

‐I won't let that
creep get away with it.

And what's more,
I'm sure they'd like

(WEAKLY) Sorry.

I am so sorry.

Good news.

‐There are more Leaf Ninja?

‐Our enemies are
quick to respond.

No doubt they're coming here
to seal the Three‐Tails.

‐That can't happen.

The beast belongs
to Lord Orochimaru.

‐I agree with you.

And that, Guren, is
why you must make

sure Yukimaru restrains
the Three‐Tails next time.

If we just accelerate
his recuperation a bit,

to give him that drug again?

‐Yukimaru still seems
awfully weak to me

from the last attempt.

‐Oh, don't look at
me like that, Guren.

The boy is just a
means to an end.

Unless we can make use of him
now to capture the Three‐Tails,

377
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,845
there's really no point
in allowing him to exist.

You know that.

On the other hand, what
if you push him too hard

and he collapses and
the whole plan fails?

that will make me look?

succeed as much as you do.

You stick your nose in my

keep the Leaf from sealing

the Three‐Tails,
well, then I'll just

I'm just a little
