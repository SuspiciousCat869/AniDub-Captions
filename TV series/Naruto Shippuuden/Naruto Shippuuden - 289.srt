1
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:21,069
There's no sign
of the enemy.

2
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,274
{\an4}I don't see our forces
either. Everyone's
scattered to far and
wide. We have to gather

3
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,109
{\an1}all the troops
together quickly.

4
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,378
You're right. We
need to mobilize.

5
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,145
{\an3}Huh?

6
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,616
Captain Kakashi!

7
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:40,051
Yurui's units requesting
reinforcements!

8
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:41,852
{\an1}Omoi's in that
unit, too!

9
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,888
{\an1}<i>Yes, and right now they're</i>
<i>engaged in a fight with</i>
<i>Ameyuri Ringo!</i>

10
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,124
{\an1}Ameyuri Ringo...

11
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:53,262
{\an4}<i>One of the Seven Ninja</i>
<i>Swordsmen. She wields the</i>
<i>Lightning Blade "Kiba,"</i>
<i>the Fang.</i>

12
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,396
{\an1}All right, I'll go!

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going too. Ameyuri
Ringo uses Lightning
Style.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,069
I may be able to
neutralize her with
my own Lightning Style.

15
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,432
{\an4}Come on! Stop hiding
from me, you cowards!
Isn't there anyone here
at all who can send

16
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,301
{\an1}shockwaves through
my heart?

17
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,770
{\an1}Lightning Style!
Lightning Fang!

18
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:10,872
{\an1}(painful screaming)

19
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:12,374
{\an1}<i>Ahhh!</i>

20
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:17,010
{\an1}Cowards like you aren't
my type, I'm afraid!

21
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,146
(painful grunt)

22
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,113
(painful grunt)

23
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,281
Ahhhh!

24
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,251
{\an1}Why aren't the
reinforcements here?!

25
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:31,222
{\an1}As punishment for defying
me, I'm going to burn you
to a crisp!

26
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:34,225
{\an1}<i>Lightning Style!</i>
<i>Thunder Gate!</i>

27
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,267
{\an1}Ahhhh!

28
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:03,081
{\an1}<i>Yurui!</i>

29
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,817
{\an1}Just hang on,
Yurui!

30
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:08,218
{\an1}(struggling breaths)

31
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:11,988
{\an1}<i>It's over...</i>
<i>Everything's...</i>

32
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:13,990
...going dark...

33
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:17,325
<i>Don't give up, Yurui!</i>
<i>Help is on the way</i>
<i>right now!</i>

34
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,293
<i>Stay with us...</i>

35
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,430
No, Nurui...
It's in...

36
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:25,965
{\an1}...your hands now...

37
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,202
(gasp)

38
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,638
{\an1}Yurui! Yurui!

39
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:38,844
{\an7}Damn it! I've had
enough of this! How
many have to die!

40
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:42,078
{\an1}<i>It this really what</i>
<i>war is all about?</i>

41
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:55,457
{\an1}Are we actually the
only ones who survived
that attack?!

42
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,893
Sorry to say, it
looks like it.

43
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:05,731
{\an4}I'll take over command
from here on out. Not that
I really want to, but
I do have seniority here.

44
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:12,637
{\an4}Ameyuri Ringo went after
another platoon in the
other direction. But I'm
sure she'll be back soon.

45
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:15,139
{\an1}We have to decide what
to do quickly.

46
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:18,642
{\an1}Isn't that obvious?
We retreat!

47
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:22,378
We're running away just
'cause she's one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen?

48
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:27,249
{\an1}Really? Are you suggesting
we take on someone as
powerful as Ameyuri Ringo?

49
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:28,550
{\an1}Well, I, uh...

50
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:36,523
{\an4}That seems out of character
of you. This whole time I
believed that you were the
cautious type, just like me.

51
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:46,931
{\an4}A war is not the place to
seek revenge. And honestly,
we don't stand much of a
chance against somebody

52
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:53,069
{\an4}who wields a Ninja Blade.
They're like elephants and
tigers. And in comparison,
we're like mere ants.

53
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,239
<i>Then why the hell are</i>
<i>we here?! Just to keep</i>
<i>giving up?!</i>

54
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,308
{\an5}Look, don't get full
of yourself! Are you
trying to be a hero
now?

55
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:09,783
{\an4}Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I'm the leader now. We'll
create a diversion for
Ameyuri Ringo and escape.

56
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:18,857
{\an1}How incredibly boring.
Not one single soul to
give me a thrill.

57
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:23,194
{\an1}Wait a minute, there
were two or three more
shinobi back there earlier.

58
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:25,863
{\an1}Maybe they're a
little more my type.

59
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:42,743
{\an5}I don't think that there
can be anymore doubt that
the flash of lightning we
saw earlier was Ameyuri

60
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,378
Ringo's Lightning
Style.

61
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:49,181
{\an4}This much damage in
one instant! I really
doubt that even a
hundred chunin could

62
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,683
{\an1}defeat her in battle.

63
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:55,854
{\an5}Well, who knows. In a
desperate time like
this, a hero could rise
up from among them.

64
00:06:55,887 --> 00:07:00,758
{\an4}Hoping that some of our
scattered comrades were
able to survive an attack
like this is one thing...

65
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,395
But hoping for a hero
is simply wishful
thinking, Kakashi.

66
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:10,666
{\an5}Anyway, based on the
remnants of this battle,
Ameyuri Ringo is heading
north. There should be

67
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,267
some survivors further
on. Let's go!

68
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:21,641
{\an7}<i>Damn it! If all we do</i>
<i>is keep running and</i>
<i>running. Pretty soon,</i>
<i>we'll have encircled</i>

69
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,541
{\an7}<i>the world!</i>

70
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,813
{\an7}<i>And if we keep going</i>
<i>around the world over</i>
<i>and over, we'll forget</i>
<i>why the hell we were</i>

71
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,347
{\an7}<i>fighting in the</i>
<i>first place!</i>

72
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:34,484
{\an7}<i>And everyone I know</i>
<i>will assume that</i>
<i>I'm dead...</i>

73
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:38,821
{\an7}<i>I'll keep running and</i>
<i>running until I die.</i>
<i>But if that's the</i>
<i>case, then...</i>

74
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:44,593
{\an1}Captain! Are we
still going to
keep running away?!

75
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:49,296
{\an4}If we keep running, then
maybe the reinforcements
will arrive and take care
of that harpy!

76
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,932
{\an7}<i>Waiting for others</i>
<i>to bail us out?!</i>

77
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,770
What are you doing?

78
00:07:57,804 --> 00:08:02,106
{\an4}We have to make it look
like we put up a good
fight against our enemies,
otherwise who knows what

79
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,276
{\an1}people might start saying
about us after this war
is over!

80
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,613
{\an7}<i>How stupid!</i>
<i>Talk about ego!</i>

81
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:14,216
{\an7}<i>And this trap is so</i>
<i>unbelievably obvious!</i>
<i>It's like telling the</i>
<i>enemy exactly which way</i>

82
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,085
{\an7}<i>we're running!</i>

83
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,155
{\an7}<i>Nothing good is gonna</i>
<i>come from following this</i>
<i>guy. I just know it!</i>

84
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:26,960
{\an1}(confident chuckle)

85
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:29,295
{\an8}<i>You fools can't</i>
<i>run away from me!</i>

86
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,937
{\an7}They call this a trap?!
I guess they must think
I'm stupid!

87
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:48,044
{\an7}I'm never going to let
you escape me now!

88
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,482
{\an1}Hey, Kayui. Who is this
Ameyuri Ringo anyway?

89
00:08:54,515 --> 00:09:00,054
{\an4}She's an exceptionally
gifted user of Lightning
Style. She died young after
she contracted some incurable

90
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:03,690
{\an1}disease, but it's said
she never once lost
any of her prey.

91
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,892
{\an1}There's no way
to escape her?

92
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,427
{\an7}That's enough,
Kayui! Just
pipe down!

93
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:11,295
<i>Nurui!</i>

94
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:13,431
You knew this about
her, and yet you still-

95
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:14,966
(shocked gasp)

96
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:19,770
It's her!

97
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,838
{\an1}Damn it! She's
way faster than
I thought!

98
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:27,375
{\an7}<i>Of course she's catch</i>
<i>up with us! This is</i>
<i>such a lame strategy!</i>

99
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,476
{\an1}Ahhh!

100
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,520
{\an1}We can't run!

101
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:42,287
<i>Let's fight!</i>

102
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,955
{\an8}<i>No! It's no use!</i>

103
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:48,526
{\an4}We can't just keep on
running away forever!
She always gets her
prey, doesn't she?!

104
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,127
Yeah, I know that!

105
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:55,364
{\an4}Oh, you do, huh? Well,
do you also know that
our lives are in your
hands!

106
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,199
{\an1}That's why we're
retreating!

107
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,637
{\an5}You call yourself a
shinobi?! Have you even
given a thought to our
fallen comrades?! Huh?!

108
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,807
{\an1}Omoi, you don't understand
where Nurui's coming from!

109
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,142
{\an1}<i>And Nurui, you too!</i>
<i>Why don't you both-</i>

110
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,776
{\an1}Shut up, Kayui!

111
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:11,644
That's it!

112
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,413
I've had enough
of running!

113
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:19,784
(shocked gasps)

114
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,820
{\an1}No, Omoi...

115
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:36,330
I know all about it,
Nurui. Your reputation
back home.

116
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,467
Stop, Omoi!
That's enough!

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,436
{\an1}They say your cautiousness
is merely a way to hide
your cowardice.

118
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,005
I'm cautious but
not a coward!

119
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,075
{\an1}Knock it off, Omoi!
Fighting is pointless
right now!

120
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,878
{\an4}Even if we stand up
to her, we can't
become heroes this
way!

121
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,912
That thought didn't
even cross my mind!

122
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,314
I keep thinking
of Yurui!

123
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:00,584
And how his face
looked as he lay
there dying.

124
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:10,992
{\an7}Even if we escape somehow,
I can't go on living with
that image constantly
flashing through my mind.

125
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:18,331
{\an1}Knock it off, Omoi!
Fighting is pointless
right now, got it?!

126
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:21,801
{\an4}Even if we stand up
to her, we can't
become heroes this
way!

127
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,170
That thought didn't
even cross my mind!

128
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,171
I keep thinking
of Yurui.

129
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:29,207
And how his face looked
as he lay there dying.

130
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:36,278
{\an7}Even if we escape somehow,
I can't go on living with
that image constantly
flashing through my mind.

131
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,514
{\an1}Omoi!

132
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:50,158
{\an5}Looks like Ameyuri
Ringo is still in
pursuit of some of
our comrades.

133
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,626
This is not good...

134
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:56,128
{\an1}<i>There aren't any Allied</i>
<i>Shinobi units beyond here.</i>

135
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,898
{\an1}The pursued are only
isolating themselves
more.

136
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:01,833
Let's hurry!

137
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,768
(attacking yell)

138
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:08,839
{\an1}Ah ha! Here's one! At
last, someone who isn't
afraid to face me!

139
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,940
{\an1}This is for Yurui,
damn it!

140
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,541
{\an3}Hnnh!

141
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,683
{\an1}Is that it?! You're
running away so soon.

142
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,122
{\an1}You were a worthless-

143
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:29,856
(shocked gasp)

144
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,860
{\an1}Ha! I fooled ya! Cloud
Style! <i>Deception Slice!</i>

145
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:38,896
{\an1}Nobody ever tricks me!

146
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,665
{\an1}Lightning Blade
Jutsu! Thunderbolt!

147
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,701
{\an1}(painful screams)

148
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,244
{\an7}<i>Man, she's strong. If</i>
<i>I want to beat her, I'm</i>
<i>going to have to use the</i>
<i>one that Bee taught me.</i>

149
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:01,914
{\an4}My sword technique's
one to behold. Get ten
thousand tickets sold
and come to watch me

150
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,683
{\an1}rap, and then in
a snap...

151
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,220
{\an1}<i>I'll help you put</i>
<i>your skills on</i>
<i>the map! Ay-yeah!</i>

152
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,956
{\an4}You mean it, Bee? If
I sell ten thousand
tickets, you'll really
teach me your lethal

153
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,090
{\an1}blade technique?

154
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,993
{\an7}<i>Wait, are there even</i>
<i>ten thousand people in</i>
<i>all the Hidden Cloud?</i>

155
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:21,463
{\an5}To put it bluntly, your
sword power and skill,
well, honestly, they ain't
too much of a thrill.

156
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,365
Unlike my rapping,
which keeps feet
tapping!

157
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,237
{\an1}So in other words,
you're saying that
I'm mediocre?

158
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:34,875
{\an4}Except your Deception Slice,
which is divine. If you can
polish that one up, then
you'll be fine.

159
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:37,910
<i>Now the lesson's</i>
<i>reached the end</i>
<i>of the line.</i>

160
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,947
{\an4}Wait, hold on! You're
telling me to tweak my
Deception Slice and
make it better?

161
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:44,649
{\an3}Yeah!

162
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,318
{\an7}<i>And the result</i>
<i>of that is...</i>

163
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,486
{\an7}<i>Reverse Mist Slice!</i>

164
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,823
{\an4}Still not giving up,
huh? Well, at least
you have a little
backbone.

165
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,792
{\an7}<i>This sword style makes</i>
<i>it difficult to predict</i>
<i>the path of the blade!</i>

166
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:02,030
{\an1}Ah!

167
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,565
{\an7}<i>I'm just getting</i>
<i>started with this</i>
<i>jutsu!</i>

168
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,568
{\an7}<i>My personal style,</i>
<i>Reverse Mist Slice,</i>
<i>Release!</i>

169
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,905
{\an1}<i>Try to counter this!</i>

170
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:12,638
(shocked gasp)

171
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,406
{\an1}<i>They're all decoys?!</i>

172
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,107
{\an1}Gotcha!

173
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,441
{\an1}Lighting Style!
Depth Charge!

174
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,311
(painful grunt)

175
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,914
{\an1}<i>You're not half bad!</i>

176
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,950
{\an1}<i>Most guys would</i>
<i>be dead by now!</i>

177
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,617
{\an1}Anyway, sorry...

178
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,720
{\an1}The truth is I'm
simply too strong
for you.

179
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:35,556
{\an3}<i>Omoi!</i>

180
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,394
{\an1}Hnh!

181
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:45,498
{\an4}<i>I won't kill you just yet.</i>
<i>Because I'm the type of</i>
<i>person who saves the things</i>
<i>I like to eat for last.</i>

182
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,301
{\an1}Go! Get outta here!

183
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,135
{\an1}Nurui! Kayui!

184
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,102
(shocked gasps)

185
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:02,078
{\an1}Nurui...

186
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:10,618
<i>Nurui!</i>

187
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,585
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>Talk to me!</i>

188
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:23,362
Did you have to
be so reckless?

189
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:27,332
{\an1}I'm sorry. For
all of it.

190
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,168
{\an1}Damn right. You've
almost ruined everything.

191
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:35,339
{\an1}Listen. Very carefully.

192
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,206
{\an1}<i>Omoi...</i>

193
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,610
{\an1}Ha! Found you!

194
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,349
{\an1}I won't let
you get away!

195
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:01,592
{\an7}<i>It's no good! I don't</i>
<i>feel like I can win!</i>
<i>More like, I can't!</i>

196
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,297
<i>Are you all</i>
<i>right, Kayui?!</i>

197
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,231
{\an1}Yeah...

198
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,966
Is there anyone
else with you?

199
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:14,336
{\an1}Nurui and Omoi are up
ahead just a ways.

200
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,871
{\an1}And Ameyuri Ringo
is there, too?

201
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:19,673
{\an7}That's right. They're
gonna bring her down.

202
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:25,878
{\an7}<i>Nurui was right all</i>
<i>along. Running away</i>
<i>was my only real</i>
<i>option!</i>

203
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:30,782
{\an8}<i>Who am I kidding?! I'm</i>
<i>no hero! How could I</i>
<i>have been so stupid?!</i>

204
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:32,017
{\an1}Ahh!

205
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,089
{\an1}Now then, are you
fully prepared?

206
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,025
(painful grunts)

207
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,494
{\an1}Fine! You want
me to fight?

208
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:46,095
{\an1}<i>I'll fight!</i>

209
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:47,497
(chuckle)

210
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,870
{\an1}Well, you certainly
are determined. I'll
give you that.

211
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:59,272
{\an8}<i>I hope we get</i>
<i>there in time!</i>

212
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:04,043
{\an4}I don't have any
choice, here. So, I
have to bring you
down.

213
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,244
{\an3}Ha!

214
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,746
For Nurui...
Yurui...

215
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,183
{\an4}You think that you can
take me down?! Are you
still talking utter
nonsense?

216
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,786
{\an1}You're rotten and it's
time I gave you what
you deserve!

217
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,655
{\an1}Do you hear me? How
do you like them
apples, huh?!

218
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,725
{\an1}So bring it on!
Give me the best
you've got!

219
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,169
(attacking yell)

220
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:41,273
{\an1}Looks like you'll be
saying goodbye now. And
you were my type, too.

221
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:42,640
{\an1}<i>Too bad!</i>

222
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,176
{\an1}Lightning Style!
Thunder Gate!

223
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:50,780
(shocked gasp)

224
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,985
{\an1}What is this?!

225
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,188
You've trapped
me in here!

226
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:04,091
{\an4}This is actually a
bottomless marsh, and
once you're stuck in
it, you'll never be

227
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,358
{\an1}able to get out
again.

228
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,229
{\an5}And you're going to
stay here with me and
keep me company? How
gracious!

229
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:16,067
{\an1}Yurui was a very
good friend of
mine.

230
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:21,939
{\an4}I let my personal
feeling interfere.
I wanted to avenge
his death.

231
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,107
(surprised gasp)

232
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:28,977
{\an5}I figured that there
was really only one
for us to have a chance
of defeating her.

233
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:35,317
{\an7}There's a bottomless
marsh up ahead. It's
covered with an Earth
Style lid.

234
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,153
{\an7}If she uses Lightning
Style there, she'll
sink in and become
stuck.

235
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,755
{\an7}I planned to lure her
into it and trap her
there.

236
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:51,497
{\an4}Yurui and Kayui, along
with myself, had prepared
a number of traps. We were
all expecting a big battle.

237
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:55,466
{\an1}So you're saying that
you weren't actually
running away?

238
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:00,403
{\an1}Omoi, I know the limits
of my strength well.

239
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:03,939
{\an1}I know my plan isn't
gonna work now.

240
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,543
{\an1}You just run. Meet up
with Guy. I'll stop
Ameyuri Ringo here.

241
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:12,246
You can't fight
in your condition!

242
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:16,182
{\an1}And besides, you can't
escape her by running
away, right?

243
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:23,922
{\an1}No, don't!
Stop, Omoi!

244
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,559
{\an3}Omoi!

245
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,262
{\an1}Kakashi! And Guy!

246
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,199
I'm just glad that
we made it in time.

247
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,934
{\an1}Pull <i>him out, Sai!</i>

248
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:48,408
So you're not coming
with me? Some gentleman
you are!

249
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,412
{\an1}Sorry, but I'm gonna
pass on that. Maybe
another time.

250
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:57,449
{\an1}In my next life, I guess
that I'd better remember
to eat what I like first.

251
00:19:57,715 --> 00:20:00,652
{\an1}You won't be reanimated
anymore, so here...

252
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,554
{\an1}A farewell gift.

253
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:04,720
(chuckle)

254
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:05,955
{\an1}Thank you...

255
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:10,725
It's Omoi. That's
my name, Omoi.

256
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,093
{\an1}Here, Omoi.

257
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:19,366
{\an1}Just a gift to
say thank you.

258
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:22,536
{\an1}See you on the
other side.

259
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:31,677
You did really well,
Omoi. I guess you are
a hero.

260
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:35,112
{\an1}Nah, the real hero
here is you, Nurui.

261
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:42,352
So there really are new
heroes emerging from
this conflict after all.

262
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:46,622
{\an1}It's a heartwarming
sight. That deep bond
growing between men.

263
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:49,625
{\an1}Kakashi! And Guy!
Listen up!

264
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:55,128
{\an4}I wanted to give you both
advance notice. Naruto
and Killer Bee are heading
to the battlefront.

265
00:20:55,395 --> 00:21:00,199
{\an7}<i>It seems nothing could</i>
<i>convince Naruto to stay</i>
<i>away. So, we're going to</i>
<i>use this opportunity to</i>

266
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,569
{\an7}<i>turn this war around!</i>
<i>Over and out!</i>

267
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:08,172
{\an1}You hear that, Kakashi?

268
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:12,476
{\an1}Yeah, it seems they're
finally on the move.

269
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:16,246
{\an1}The heroes we've
waited so long for.

270
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:04,299
{\an4}<i>A site there has been</i>
<i>reserved for sacred use.</i>
<i>It's known as "The Hole."</i>
