1
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,670
-Hm?

2
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,209
-Lady Tsunade, we received a
message from the Fire Temple.

3
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:33,511
It seems all four of the hidden
tombs have been violated.

4
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,254
-Looks like they've got us.

5
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,657
Well, what's our present status?

6
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,327
-Team Kakashi is on
its way right now.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,130
-I see.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,300
Yamato's message said
that he suspected

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,735
these weren't
ordinary tomb robbers.

10
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,405
Seems he was right.

11
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:54,406
-Yes.

12
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,741
But then what are
they really after?

13
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,376
-Most likely, they're
after the bodies

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,179
that were in those tombs.

15
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:02,183
The Guardian Shinobi
12 themselves.

16
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,087
-I have a bad feeling
about this M'lady.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,692
The previous attack,
the Akatsuki stepping up

18
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,696
their efforts, and all
the signs that Orochimaru

19
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,166
has gone into hiding again.

20
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,436
And of course--

21
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,570
-You mean Danzo?

22
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:20,274
-Uh, yes.

23
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:22,143
I wonder if it was
wise for us to push

24
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,412
for keeping Sai on Team Kakashi.

25
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,515
And the way Danzo
agreed to it so readily

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,486
without any objection, it
just doesn't feel right.

27
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,255
-What to do, what to do.

28
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,559
So many troubles to choose from.

29
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,664
We can't very well take them
all on at once, now can we?

30
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,768
So why not start with
the one closest to home?

31
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,005
--[stops mid-breath]
I don't understand.

32
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,508
-Shizune, everyone not
aligned with the Foundation

33
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,010
will keep watch on Danzo.

34
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,011
SHIZUNE: Yes, M'lady.

35
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,413
[receding footsteps]

36
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:53,385
-[sighs]

37
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:15,181
SAI (VOICEOVER): If
I may make a request.

38
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:16,683
DANZO (VOICEOVER): Request?

39
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:17,684
Really?

40
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,520
SAI (VOICEOVER): Yes.

41
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,356
I'd like to keep the
name, Sai, and stay

42
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,293
with Team Kakashi for
a little while longer.

43
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,239
-(THINKING) That
smile on his face.

44
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,106
Damn that Tsunade.

45
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,309
What's she prying into now?

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,749
No matter.

47
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:11,155
Whatever she's up to,
I hold all the cards.

48
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:13,825
[theme music]

49
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,371
[movement through treetops]

50
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,474
-Chiriku, why are we
going in this direction?

51
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,509
It's not where the
hidden tombs are?

52
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,346
-Those coffins the thieves
are carrying aren't empty.

53
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,615
They'll be heavy.

54
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,686
The Fire Temple is surrounded
on three sides by cliffs.

55
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:17,291
The Blue Dragon, White Tiger,
and Black Turtle Snake.

56
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:20,228
Their only possible way out
is toward the Red Phoenix,

57
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:22,531
what you would call the south.

58
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,132
-Yes.

59
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:23,614
I see.

60
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,537
SORA: My power has never
been anything but a nuisance.

61
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,642
Anyway, nuisance or not, I
can't throw that power away.

62
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,350
I still need it.

63
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,720
I need it to avenge
my father's murder.

64
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,962
Huh?

65
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:00,931
What is it?

66
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,367
Why are you staring
at me like that?

67
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,669
-Uh.

68
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:07,540
Ah.

69
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,911
You mentioned revenge, right?

70
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,882
-[scoffs] Huh.

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,483
-Ah.

72
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:34,442
[wind noise increasing]

73
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,413
[noisy breakout from forest]

74
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,624
NARUTO: Whoa!

75
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:48,661
This spot has a great
view of everything.

76
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:51,332
SAKURA: Yeah, but don't
expect the enemy to show up.

77
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,367
-You're right,
they'd be crazy to.

78
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,738
And there's no place
for them to hide.

79
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:57,340
-Mm.

80
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,378
Naruto.

81
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:02,279
-Huh?

82
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:03,314
What is it?

83
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:04,749
-(WHISPERING) Down there.

84
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:05,350
-Hm?

85
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,444
Huh? (YELLING) Sora, down there!

86
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:26,927
Look, look!

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,762
-Uh, uh.

88
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,663
Will you shut up, you idiot?

89
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:29,664
I see it.

90
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:30,633
-No doubt of it.

91
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,634
That's them.

92
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,835
-Yes.

93
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,505
The coffins, and presumably,
the thieves with them.

94
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,607
-It's strange.

95
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:39,544
Why are they transporting
them in the open?

96
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:44,450
It's as if they
want us to see them.

97
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:45,786
-(THINKING) A trap?

98
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,392
If so, which of us
is their quarry?

99
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:50,926
-Come on!

100
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,927
What are we waiting for?

101
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:52,995
They're getting away.

102
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,731
What should we do, Captain?

103
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,333
-Remain here, Chiriku.

104
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,836
If anything should happen, I
want you to please report back

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,339
to the Fire Temple.

106
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,440
-All right.

107
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,710
-Naruto and Sora, head
straight for them.

108
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,780
Sakura and Sai,
take the left flank.

109
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:07,615
I'll take the right
and provide backup.

110
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,482
-Hey!

111
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,851
How come I get stuck with him?

112
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:10,752
-Mmh.

113
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,755
-You can't go by yourself.

114
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,526
And Sora strikes
me as very capable.

115
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,360
So that's that.

116
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,363
-It's like the book said.

117
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,000
It takes a poison to
drive out another poison.

118
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,735
-Mm.

119
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,004
Huh?

120
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,505
Sora, wait for me!

121
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:32,882
Unh.

122
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,851
I said, wait for me!

123
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:35,853
-Wait for you?

124
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,355
I don't want anything
to do with you.

125
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,457
I'm sick and tired of you.

126
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,325
-Look, I don't like
this either, but they're

127
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,894
Captain Yamato's orders, OK?

128
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:42,962
-Fine.

129
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,765
Then just stay behind
me and keep quiet.

130
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,034
This is the Fire
Temple's responsibility.

131
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,803
-You big loud mouth.

132
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:51,707
We'll see who stays behind who.

133
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,190
Uh!

134
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:58,865
Try and keep up!

135
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,100
-You little jerk.

136
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:08,679
-Hm.

137
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:09,980
They fell for it.

138
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,495
-Well, if it is a trap,
we're stuck out in the open

139
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,462
without any cover.

140
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,463
-Yes, Sakura.

141
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:24,666
But that's true for
the enemy as well.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,770
We'll be able to see them
coming from a long way off.

143
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,107
-(THINKING) If it's the bodies
of the Guardian Shinobi 12

144
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,110
they're after, why the trap?

145
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,513
Why go to this trouble when
they have what they want?

146
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:41,856
-Huh?

147
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,824
Ah!

148
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:43,792
Uh.

149
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,095
-I told you to stay behind me.

150
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,197
Just shut up and watch.

151
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,065
You might actually
learn something.

152
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:49,634
Uh!

153
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,143
-I'll take the lead from here.

154
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:59,013
Try and stay out of my way.

155
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:02,717
-Why you little-- No, you don't!

156
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,241
-Uh!

157
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:07,302
Oh.

158
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:10,908
Sora!

159
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,345
Are you out of your mind?

160
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,850
[rumbling]

161
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,161
-What's going on?

162
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,830
What are you two doing?

163
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,999
-The coffins suddenly
just went underground.

164
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,102
-And I was almost there, too.

165
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:34,439
I could have stopped them if
you hadn't gotten in the way.

166
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,975
-What are you saying, If I
hadn't gotten in the way?

167
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,077
SORA: That does it.

168
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,679
I have half a mind to
put you underground.

169
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:40,154
NARUTO: Yeah?

170
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:41,289
Just try it.

171
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,724
Why don't you pick out
a coffin for yourself

172
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:43,292
while you're at it?

173
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,193
-Knock it off you two.

174
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:44,894
NARUTO: Sakura, he started it

175
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:45,996
SORA: He's lying.

176
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,130
-This is no time to be
fighting each other.

177
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,398
YAMATO: That's strange.

178
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,433
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

179
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,769
YAMATO: There's no
trace of their presence.

180
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:52,304
They're gone!

181
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,516
[wind howling]

182
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:17,070
[dirt breaks open]

183
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:19,006
FURIDO: How long it's been.

184
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,375
How long I've waited
for the re-awakening

185
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,914
of the Land of Fire.

186
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,149
Wake up.

187
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,517
You're of no use to us dead.

188
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,231
What a fortuitous stroke
of fate to have brought

189
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,069
us together like this.

190
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,339
Then again, perhaps
it was you yourselves

191
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:46,943
who did the summoning.

192
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:49,213
Fudo, Fuen, Fuka.

193
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,383
-(TOGETHER) Here.

194
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,354
FURIDO: I must remain
here to greet him.

195
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:57,023
I leave it to you three to
take care of the others.

196
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:57,825
-(TOGETHER) Right!

197
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,511
FUEN: This topographic
diagram is a masterpiece.

198
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:14,346
Try not to damage it.

199
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,849
It's the sort of
perfection that's

200
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:18,386
achieved only once
in a lifetime.

201
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,788
FUDO: [scoffs] Masterpiece.

202
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,458
I'm the one who has
to bring it to life.

203
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,029
That entire thing's nothing
but scribbles on paper

204
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,331
until I make it move.

205
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,902
FUEN: [laughs] Well, when you
reproduce a great painting

206
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,339
like with a wood-cut, who
do you think is remembered,

207
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,441
the original artist,
or the poor wretch

208
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:38,145
who cut the block of wood?

209
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:41,049
FUDO: [growls] What
did you call me?

210
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,986
FUKA: No one likes men who
sit around talking too much.

211
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,823
Now get on with it, will you?

212
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,894
Furido himself is one of
the Guardian Shinobi 12.

213
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:51,263
You want him strangling you?

214
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:51,963
FUDO: [scoffs]

215
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:52,464
FUEN: Ohh!

216
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm all atremble.

217
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,934
All right, Fudo.

218
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,804
It all yours.

219
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:57,371
FUDO: OK, fine.

220
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,238
I'll do it.

221
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,284
Earth-style, Impermanence!

222
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:11,155
[all gasp]

223
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,157
-Oh.

224
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:12,991
-Umh!

225
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,259
-What the heck is going on?

226
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:28,594
-Sai!

227
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,936
-Ninja art, Super-beast Scroll.

228
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,176
-Could it be?

229
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,298
What sort of
Earth-style could affect

230
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,300
so great a geological change?

231
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,110
[ground cracking]

232
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,078
Grh?

233
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:06,560
Gah!

234
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,446
-Seems this is the result
of divine retribution,

235
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,281
thanks to someone's mistakes.

236
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:23,283
-Uh!

237
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,984
This isn't the time
for that, Sora.

238
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:25,467
Gah.

239
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,574
-Unh.

240
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,444
-Hey, Sakura!

241
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,344
-Where are you going?

242
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,052
[rumbling]

243
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,656
-So, the plan is to
bury me alive, eh?

244
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:45,093
(THINKING) It probably
won't grant me a lot of time

245
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,530
to climb out of here.

246
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,533
Very well.

247
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,501
Unh!

248
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:51,535
Wood-style jutsu.

249
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,526
[slams shut]

250
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:13,265
Well, I must say, this is
quite an elaborate little trap

251
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:16,636
they set for us.

252
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,740
-So you and Sai
got separated, huh?

253
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:20,741
-Umh.

254
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:23,745
And I can't find
Captain Yamato anywhere.

255
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:27,416
If we are facing an enemy who's
Earth-style jutsu can transform

256
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,289
the terrain to this extent,
then we've got our hands full.

257
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,658
-Well, we better
find the others fast.

258
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:34,260
-Hey.

259
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:35,494
-Huh?

260
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:38,131
-Didn't that used
to be a valley?

261
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:38,665
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

262
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:46,809
SAKURA: It's gone!

263
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:47,744
NARUTO: How?

264
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,513
Is this some kind of kinjutsu?

265
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,725
[rock clatters]

266
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,860
-I bet it's a trap.

267
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,097
-Well, there's only
one way to find out.

268
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:03,565
-Mm.

269
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:04,633
Careful, Naruto.

270
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:09,105
Stay away from
that until we know.

271
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,075
-Uh!

272
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,078
-Ha!

273
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:14,646
It seems solid enough to me.

274
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,750
Whoever built this trap
got a little carried away.

275
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,154
He must'a had so
much fun making it,

276
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,657
he forgot to put in the
part about the trap-- ploh!

277
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,191
-Naruto!

278
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,299
-Walked right into
that one, didn't he?

279
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,537
-We've got to find Naruto
right away-- [gasp] Ah!

280
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,560
-(THINKING) Perhaps if I make
a search of the area from up

281
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,160
above.

282
00:16:57,504 --> 00:17:00,274
So, they don't want
to let me out of here.

283
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:20,701
FUEN: [laughs] It's no use.

284
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:23,338
You can't escape my
masterpiece with a laugh

285
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:25,274
of a little jutsu like that.

286
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:29,881
FUDO: [scoffs] You weren't even
supposed to survive our jutsu.

287
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:33,585
Well, my execution
of it was perfect.

288
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,589
The flaw must've been somewhere
in Fuen's original design.

289
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,194
Hm?

290
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,195
Wood-style.

291
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,597
Impossible.

292
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,734
Just who are you anyway?

293
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,768
-Funny.

294
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,771
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

295
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:50,240
And what are you up
to with those coffins?

296
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,377
--[scoffs] Why
bother telling you?

297
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,847
What difference will
it make to a dead men?

298
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:56,115
-Very well.

299
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:58,518
You leave me no choice
but to use force.

300
00:17:58,552 --> 00:17:59,754
-[scoffs] What?

301
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,123
You're going to go
one-on-one against me?

302
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,226
Now that's a good one.

303
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,863
Earth-style, Ant Lion!

304
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:07,464
-Ah!

305
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:07,946
Um.

306
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:10,449
Uh.

307
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:11,485
Unh, uh-uhh.

308
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:15,590
-Ha-ha-ha!

309
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:19,228
I expected more from someone
who uses the wood-style.

310
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,298
This is a waste of my talents.

311
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:30,777
Ugh.

312
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,646
What a pain in the neck.

313
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,681
Well, all right.

314
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:37,485
I prefer a more hands-on
approach, anyway.

315
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,855
Uh.

316
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:43,360
argh, oh, urgh, ragh!

317
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,701
-[gasp]

318
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,670
-Yah!

319
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:51,271
-Umph.

320
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:57,546
-All of your leaping and dodging
won't help you escape my fist.

321
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,857
-Where are we?

322
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,659
What is this?

323
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,362
-I don't know.

324
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,696
Where's Naruto?

325
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:14,302
-I thought we all fell together,
but I don't sense his presence.

326
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:16,504
-The first thing we
have to do is find him.

327
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:18,741
-The enemy's trying
to separate us.

328
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,012
Divide and conquer.

329
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,615
-Oh, ah.

330
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:29,289
I don't know where I am, let
alone Sakura and the others.

331
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,357
Huh?

332
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:32,459
Oh, great.

333
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:35,563
The path forks again.

334
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,265
Hm.

335
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,968
Left it is.

336
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:41,905
[click]

337
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:42,906
Heh.

338
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,009
I'm not going to
fall for that again.

339
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:48,447
That obviously means that I'm
going in the right direction.

340
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,849
FUKA: Don't be too sure.

341
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,818
-Huh?

342
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:56,358
[rumbling approaching]

343
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:57,526
Yai!

344
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,761
You think an old-fashioned
rinky-dink booby-trap

345
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,330
like this is going to get me?

346
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,732
No way!

347
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,300
[breathing hard] Yai!

348
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,813
[sighs] That came a lot
closer than I thought.

349
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:16,017
FUKA: [laughter]
Fuen needs lessons

350
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,653
in how to set a good trap.

351
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,006

352
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:01,658
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): What a mess.

353
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:05,463
I can't believe I let my
team get separated so easily.

354
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:07,533
What are these people after?

355
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:10,433
If all they wanted were the
bodies of the Guardian Shinobi

356
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,202
12, why not simply steal
them without drawing

357
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:14,670
all this attention?

358
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,073
Could it be that what they're
really after is one of us,

359
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,274
their pursuers?

360
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:20,142
It's dangerous to
jump to conclusions,

361
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,245
but I got a bad feeling.

362
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:25,114
I have to find the others
as quickly as possible.

363
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:28,951
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, Impermanence!
