1
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,359
{\an1}I guess that's the
limit for now.

2
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:18,021
(gasp)

3
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:20,158
{\an1}<i>That hole earlier...</i>

4
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:22,061
{\an1}That man...

5
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,497
{\an1}<i>...is a village</i>
<i>guard!</i>

6
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:25,965
(gasps)

7
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,040
(chuckle)

8
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:33,376
{\an1}'Till next time.

9
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,122
(coughing)

10
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:48,329
{\an1}<i>He escaped...</i>

11
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:52,301
{\an1}<i>But, Mr. Yamato,</i>
<i>who was he?</i>

12
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,003
{\an1}<i>I'll explain...</i>

13
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:56,507
{\an1}We're going to
need reinforcements.

14
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:58,710
{\an1}<i>Whoa!</i>

15
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,946
(giddy laughter)

16
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:04,418
{\an1}<i>Got it!</i>

17
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,759
<i>Here you go!</i>
<i>On me!</i>

18
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,160
{\an1}Here's your change.

19
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:12,729
Wow mister!
Thank you!

20
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,198
You guys are from the
Tonika Village, aren't
ya?

21
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:15,800
{\an1}Huh?

22
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,837
Were you a guard
or something?

23
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,905
{\an1}<i>Oh...</i>

24
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:23,209
{\an1}Yes. Well, I was,
but I got fired.

25
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,047
It looks like you got
hurt pretty bad, though.
So what happened to you?

26
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,316
{\an1}(uncomfortable gasp)

27
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,486
{\an1}Eh...Oh, nothing.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,654
{\an1}<i>Just an accident.</i>

29
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:44,906
{\an1}Huh?

30
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:47,876
{\an7}<i>Sensei!</i>

31
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:48,744
{\an1}Hey!

32
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:49,813
Sorry, sir!

33
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,781
{\an1}Look, I caught some!

34
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:53,216
{\an1}<i>Check 'em all out!</i>

35
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:54,251
{\an3}Wow!

36
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,621
Yep, all thanks
to my skills.

37
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,957
Of course, I was the
one who chose the bait.

38
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,126
(annoyed grunt)

39
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,930
Oh. What! You didn't
get a bite until you
changed bait!

40
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,504
{\an1}It's just some fish. I
mean, I don't even like
the way fish tastes!

41
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:10,507
Come on, Faz. Don't
be so picky!

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,275
{\an1}They're hard
to eat, too.

43
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,348
{\an1}I don't like the
way they smell,
either.

44
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:18,283
(annoyed grunt)

45
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,822
{\an7}I bet my Mom would
make something better.

46
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,493
Enough, Faz! Face
it! Your mom is gone!

47
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,340
(crying)

48
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:58,672
Hmm...You used to
hum that tune back
in class, too.

49
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,175
{\an1}She says that she
can hear it sometimes.

50
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,278
{\an1}She hears it?

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,115
{\an1}Right now?

52
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,481
So do you know
him, Shiseru?

53
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:12,051
<i>The survivor from</i>
<i>Tonika Village?</i>

54
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,454
{\an1}<i>Yes, he and I were</i>
<i>childhood friends.</i>

55
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:17,291
{\an1}We even lived together
when we were kids.

56
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:21,664
I used to call him my
"Big Brother."  In
fact I still do.

57
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:28,741
{\an4}<i>I haven't seen him for</i>
<i>a while, though. He's</i>
<i>put on a lot of weight</i>
<i>on since we were kids.</i>

58
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:32,979
{\an7}Anyway, I'm just
relieved that he
still remains his
old self.

59
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:34,982
He managed to
protect five kids.

60
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,383
{\an1}Wow, that's amazing.

61
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:39,889
{\an1}What's the matter
with you?

62
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:43,627
I don't know. But,
man I feel so bloated!

63
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:45,629
(giggling)

64
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:46,831
(sigh)

65
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,606
{\an1}<i>Wait here a second.</i>
<i>I'll see if he's</i>
<i>around.</i>

66
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,476
Hm?

67
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,521
Hm?

68
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:06,458
(shocked gasp)

69
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,426
{\an1}Quick! Go!

70
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,596
{\an3}Huh?

71
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,865
{\an1}What's up?

72
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,603
{\an1}Big Brother?

73
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,673
{\an1}<i>Sensei?</i>

74
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,742
{\an1}<i>Why are we running away?</i>

75
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,114
{\an7}Because of the symbol
those shinobi had on
their headbands!

76
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,751
{\an1}<i>It's the same as the</i>
<i>ones who attacked</i>
<i>our village!</i>

77
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,620
(shocked gasps)

78
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:29,856
Hey, hold up!

79
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,524
{\an1}Please, just
wait a second.

80
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,929
<i>We don't mean</i>
<i>you any harm.</i>

81
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,367
{\an1}Ahhhhh!

82
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,435
Come on!

83
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,145
{\an1}Ahhhhh!

84
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:57,694
{\an1}Leo!

85
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,330
{\an1}<i>It's dangerous!</i>

86
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:02,133
But we have
to get away!

87
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:16,552
{\an1}C'mon, <i>Sensei!</i>

88
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,556
{\an1}Mina...

89
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:22,727
{\an1}Let's go!

90
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:39,816
{\an1}Ahhh!

91
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,617
(shocked gasp)

92
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,055
<i>Sensei!</i>

93
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,890
{\an1}<i>Sensei!</i>
<i>Hold tight!</i>

94
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:51,967
{\an1}Naruto!

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,834
{\an1}On it!

96
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,806
{\an1}Sorry, Mina.

97
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:05,785
(shocked gasp)

98
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,800
(strained grunt)

99
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,238
{\an1}No way!

100
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,505
Big Brother?!

101
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,646
{\an1}Boy, you guys
are heavy!

102
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:32,520
{\an4}<i>I'm sorry I</i>
<i>overreacted. I</i>
<i>was just worried</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

103
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,623
I'm sorry, too!

104
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:35,591
's okay!

105
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,526
(chuckle)

106
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,730
{\an1}I see you've
already met
Shiseru.

107
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:43,970
{\an4}And my name's Dokku.
I was their teacher
when we all lived back
in Tonika Village.

108
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:45,572
{\an1}<i>This is Leo.</i>

109
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:46,941
{\an1}Nice to meet ya!

110
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,178
{\an1}You've got a lot
of guts! You know
that, kid?

111
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:51,481
{\an1}Got that right!

112
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,649
{\an7}<i>This is Lando and Faz.</i>

113
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,784
{\an1}Uh, hi.,

114
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,387
Yeah, uh, hello.

115
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,521
{\an7}<i>This is Sora.</i>

116
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,492
Pleasure to
meet you.

117
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,893
{\an1}Good to meet
you, too.

118
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,865
<i>And this is Leo's</i>
<i>younger sister.</i>
<i>Her name's Mina.</i>

119
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:05,599
{\an3}Hm?

120
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,504
Hey, isn't that vest
kind of big for you,
Mina?

121
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:13,810
{\an4}Oh, that's actually mine,
or it was. But she likes
it so much and refuses to
part with it, so...

122
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,380
I see. Well,
put 'er there!

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,988
(scared gasp)

124
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:22,889
Huh?

125
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,327
{\an1}Uh... Sorry
about that.

126
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:29,331
<i>What's wrong, Mina?</i>

127
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:35,206
{\an1}<i>Treasure...</i>

128
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:38,310
{\an1}<i>Why would Kabuto</i>
<i>want something</i>
<i>like that?</i>

129
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:40,447
That really isn't
much like him.

130
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,284
{\an1}What exactly do you
suppose happened there
in the first place?

131
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,019
<i>Years ago...</i>

132
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:50,593
{\an1}I was a scholar focused
on conducting archeological
research. In particular

133
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:58,002
{\an4}during my scholarly career,
I studied quite a bit about
"The Hole." This contains
the results of my research

134
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,041
{\an1}on the ancient writings
and legends about that
place.

135
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:06,614
{\an1}<i>I believe that in many</i>
<i>cases, that lore describes</i>
<i>actual historical events.</i>

136
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:15,327
{\an4}<i>The master of the Great</i>
<i>Lake once created the</i>
<i>"Ama no Hoko". but it's</i>
<i>power was stolen by</i>

137
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,701
{\an4}<i>something evil. This</i>
<i>evil despised all of</i>
<i>existence. And by using</i>
<i>the power it had stolen,</i>

138
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,339
{\an1}<i>it tried to destroy</i>
<i>the world.</i>

139
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:30,547
{\an4}The power spread out
across the entire world,
and was on <i>the verge of</i>
<i>destroying it all...</i>

140
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,487
{\an1}When just by chance, one
of the dead picked up a
shard of the power.

141
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:42,597
{\an4}<i>It turned crimson and</i>
<i>was enveloped in flames.</i>
<i>It sought revenge against</i>
<i>the evil one.</i>

142
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:50,440
{\an4}<i>After a brutal seven-hour</i>
<i>battle in purgatory, the</i>
<i>one sheathed in flames</i>
<i>finally emerged victorious.</i>

143
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:57,316
{\an4}<i>To prevent another evil</i>
<i>from stealing the power,</i>
<i>the crimson one divided</i>
<i>it into seven sounds and</i>

144
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,923
{\an1}<i>sealed it away, to be</i>
<i>unlocked only by the</i>
<i>"Saezuri."</i>

145
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:04,025
{\an1}<i>That is merely a</i>
<i>brief summary.</i>

146
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,994
Saezuri...

147
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,666
Do you believe that
could be what Kabuto
came to steal?

148
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,501
{\an1}(affirmative groan)

149
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:13,171
{\an1}If it actually
exists, that is...

150
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,511
{\an1}<i>Ama no Hoko. What</i>
<i>could it be?</i>

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:25,221
{\an1}<i>This is merely speculation,</i>

152
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:30,261
{\an4}<i>Well, without a doubt.</i>
<i>That "Hole" feels like</i>
<i>it's hiding a deep,</i>
<i>dark secret.</i>

153
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:39,540
{\an5}<i>However, even if he</i>

155
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,749
{\an1}<i>Such a barbarous act</i>

156
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,121
{\an1}<i>I agree completely.</i>

157
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:53,259
Kabuto will be made to
answer for his crimes,
I assure you.

158
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,930
{\an1}Thank you. I am
counting on you.

(startled gasp)

161

Everyone's going to
the outdoor bath.

162
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,609
{\an7}Heh?! You mean we get
to bathe together?

163
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,814
{\an1}<i>As if!</i>

164
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,085
(awed gasps)

165
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,088
{\an7}<i>Wow!</i>

166
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,591
{\an8}<i>Yeah! No wonder he's</i>

167
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:49,300
{\an4}You know, if you guys
train really hard, maybe
you'll be able to do
that, too!

168
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,636
Really?!

169
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:59,147
{\an1}(focused humming)

170
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:06,591
Come on! Again!

171
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,300
{\an5}It must be strange. Even
in a rural place like this,
you're famous! I have to
admit, I thought you'd be

172
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,672
{\an5}much more fierce and
scary. But I'm shocked
at how young and easy-
going you are!

173
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,575
{\an1}(embarrassed chuckle)

174
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:24,682
{\an7}It's really amazing, though!
Your body must be able to
store immense amounts of
power inside of it!

175
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,150
{\an1}Hmph! Nah!

176
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:36,664
{\an7}When I was young, just
about your age, in fact,
I didn't even have enough
power to save one girl.

177
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,307
Shiseru! What's that?

178
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,877
{\an1}<i>You mean the scar?</i>

179
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,181
{\an1}I fell from a cliff
a long, long time ago.

180
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:50,015
{\an1}What?!

181
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:53,253
{\an1}It was about fifty
meters high, I guess.

182
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:56,291
{\an1}Luckily, I fell onto
a tree, and it broke
my fall!

183
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,326
{\an1}How did it happen?

184
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:03,967
{\an1}It was all just a stupid
accident because I was
so careless.

185
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,471
Please, Shiseru, stop!

186
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,242
{\an1}<i>Brother kept warning</i>
<i>me, too. But I just</i>
<i>wouldn't listen.</i>

187
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,014
{\an1}Ahhh!

188
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:14,715
{\an3}No!

189
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,586
Dokku really did that?

190
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:20,623
{\an1}Yeah, he grabbed
me just in time.

191
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:25,530
{\an1}<i>And held onto me for,</i>

<i>almost an hour.</i>

192
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,838
<i>I hated exercise,</i>
<i>so my arms were</i>
<i>weak.</i>

193
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:34,709
{\an1}<i>I was so frustrated</i>

{\an1}(struggling grunts)

195
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,024
{\an1}Ahhhh!

196
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:51,298
{\an1}If I... If Shiseru
had died back on
that day.

197
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,569
{\an1}<i>I...</i>

198
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,208
That whole mess. All
of it was my fault
start to finish.

199
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,246
{\an1}<i>None of the blame</i>
<i>is his...</i>

200
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:09,422
{\an4}<i>I hated myself for being</i>
<i>weak, so to prove I wasn't,</i>
<i>I became a guard. I did my</i>
<i>best, but...</i>

201
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:12,460
{\an1}Well, I wasn't suited
to it, at all!

202
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,161
{\an1}(embarrassed laugh)

203
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:20,771
{\an4}<i>After that, we drifted</i>
<i>apart. Even when I did</i>
<i>go to see him, there was</i>
<i>a wall between us.</i>

204
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,310
And then before I knew
it, we were just like
two strangers.

205
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,851
{\an1}But that night,
if I'd only...

206
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,689
{\an1}If only I could have...

207
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,763
I was so happy to
see him after all
this time, but...

208
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:42,701
{\an1}If only I'd had
more power.

209
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,304
{\an1}If I were stronger.

210
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,106
Big Brother...

211
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,612
I bet he's over there
beating himself up
right now.

212
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:54,317
{\an1}I wish that I could've
saved more of them!

213
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,190
{\an7}All the people that
were dear to him.
He lost so many of
them.

214
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,565
(crying)

215
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,482
I can't do it!

216
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,250
{\an1}It's impossible!

217
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:22,120
<i>Sure is fun, though1</i>

218
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,789

{\an1}Sure!

221
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:43,016
{\an4}<i>I noticed something</i>

222
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:54,631
{\an1}<i>All of a sudden, the</i>

226
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:11,954
{\an3}Huh?

227
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:16,660
{\an1}<i>He just suddenly stopped</i>

228
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:18,863
{\an1}And his strings
had been cut.

229
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:23,070
{\an1}Must have been the
Reanimation Jutsu. It's
a Forbidden Jutsu.

230
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,943
{\an4}<i>It uses a sacrificial</i>

And now it seems, under
the Akatsuki's control,
it's failed

233
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,193
The jutsu still
hasn't been perfected.

234
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:42,595

237
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,907
{\an1}We believe that's what
Kabuto is seeking.

238

244

tomorrow. And with their

266
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:42,523

it to my chakra. It'll
be easier to control now.
