1
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,210
-It's up to you now.

2
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,110
Deliver it to the Hokage.

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,000
[theme music]

4
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,060
[knocking]

5
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,508
-Come in.

6
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,070
-An ANBU shinobi
bird brought this in.

7
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,190
-Where's Kakashi?

8
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,150
-I would imagine he's
probably with Naruto, milady.

9
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,200
-I see.

10
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,050
So he's telling him.

11
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,030
Make sure he knows I wish to
see him the minute he's done.

12
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
-Did the ANBU shinobi
find Orochimaru's lair?

13
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,070
-No.

14
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,010
Apparently they
came under attack

15
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
just as they were
about to zero in on it.

16
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,040
We need to form a
team immediately.

17
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,080
I don't want that
trail growing cold.

18
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,538
-Yes, milady.

19
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,130
-The ANBU who relayed
this information

20
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,100
is nothing more than a memory.

21
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,000
-Yes.

22
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,000
The code of ANBU.

23
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,050
Leave no corpse when you die.

24
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,230
Ever.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
-That's right.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But he won't have died in vain.

27
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,000
We'll find it.

28
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,170
-Our master has
need of you, Guren.

29
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,020
-Lord Orochimaru?

30
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,220
[banging]

31
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,080
-Those are Lord
Orochimaru's orders for you.

32
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,190
[laughter]

33
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,190
-That so, is it?

34
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,050
Orochimaru.

35
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,050
So he hasn't forgotten me.

36
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,120
I can't believe it.

37
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,060
When he sent me to
look after this pit

38
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,000
out in the middle of
nowhere, I figured

39
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,030
I'd been written off for good.

40
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,120
-Well, I'm glad to see you
find this so amusing, Guren.

41
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,050
-So a melee, huh?

42
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,180
Screams of agony.

43
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,070
Bones cracking.

44
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,180
I'm riled up just
thinking about it.

45
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,020
-Well, we do need
a couple left over

46
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,080
for our lord's latest venture.

47
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,110
Won't do us any good if
you kill all of them.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,060
-Don't worry.

49
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll be a good girl.

50
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,100
All right, then, boys!

51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,160
You heard the gentleman.

52
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,120
If you want breathe
open air, you're

53
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,020
gonna have to
fight for it today.

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,100
Survive this, and you'll be
servants of Lord Orochimaru,

55
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,110
under my command.

56
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,100
Talk about your lucky day.

57
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,170
Let's get started!

58
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,140
[growlnig]

59
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,150
-That's the spirit, fellas.

60
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,230
Have at it.

61
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,070
[laughter]

62
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,130
-Here you go.

63
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,190
Miso ramen with pork.

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,090
With some extra
meat, on the house.

65
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,190
-Thank you.

66
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,140
Heh, heh.

67
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,110
Bring it on.

68
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,210
Hot!

69
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,080
-Careful there, now.

70
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,130
We like to keep our
ramen noodles piping hot.

71
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,120
-It's hard to eat
with my left hand.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
-But still, things are
good now, the way they are.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,090
-Huh?

74
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,080
-It's sort of like you and I are
on the road to finding Sasuke.

75
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,100
-Let met take those.

76
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,160
I can help.

77
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,000
-Huh?

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,080
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh, man.

79
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,160
Sakura's gonna feed me.

80
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,210
-Ah!

81
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,010
Huh?

82
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,200
-Say ah.

83
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,210
-If I want your help,
I'll ask for it!

84
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,060
-Huh?

85
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,130
-How's it going?

86
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,230
-What is wrong with you, anyway?

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,436
-Nothing?

88
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:14,170
-Now what?

89
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,170
-Thanks a lot!

90
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,030
Just when Sakura was
about to feed me!

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,140
-Always help a comrade in need.

92
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,170
It's a sign of true friendship.

93
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,050
This book says that--

94
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,130
-Will you forget
all these books,

95
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,030
and try reading the situation?

96
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,030
How about that?

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,140
-How do I read
something I cannot see?

98
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,060
-Argh!

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,070
I can't handle you!

100
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,130
-Oh, boy.

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,190
What's all the commotion?

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,140
-Kakashi-sensei.

103
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,180
-Huh?

104
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,140
-Naruto can't eat
with his right hand,

105
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,230
and we're having a dispute
over who's going to feed him.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,060
[sigh]

107
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,030
-Here comes the choo choo.

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,020
-Kakashi-sensei.

109
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,160
-It's good to see
you on your feet

110
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,160
after that last mission, Sensei.

111
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,220
You're usually in
a hospital bed.

112
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,180
Knock on wood, huh?

113
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,220
-So that's how they
see me now, huh?

114
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,190
That hurts.

115
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,120
Well, uh-- I didn't
have to use my Mangekyo

116
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,190
Sharingan this time.

117
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,220
But I tell ya, if guys
hadn't arrived when you did,

118
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,150
I would have had to for sure.

119
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,100
-Sorry we're late.

120
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,100
But better late than never.

121
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,050
-Then I would have been
bedridden, just as you said.

122
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:45,220
[laughter] Naruto,
there's no question

123
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,020
you've gotten stronger.

124
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,210
You're my equal.

125
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Stronger, even.

126
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,220
But as far as you've come, keep
in mind, the greater the jutsu,

127
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,180
the greater the risk
to your own self.

128
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,060
-Yeah.

129
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,040
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Kakashi, whatever happens,

130
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,080
don't let Naruto try to
use Rasenshuriken again.

131
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,150
If he keeps using that jutsu,
sooner or later he'll lose it.

132
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,020
The ability to be weild chakra.

133
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,070
Once any cell in the body
has been disconnected

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,090
from the chakra network, it's
beyond my ability to heal it,

135
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,040
even with my medical ninjutsu.

136
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,070
Make sure Naruto
understands that.

137
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,170
-Naruto.

138
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,190
That new jutsu of yours--

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,010
-Kakashi-sensei?

140
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,458
-Huh?

141
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,220
-I know my limits
better than anyone else.

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,050
I'm gonna be Hokage
someday, right?

143
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,130
I mean, come on.

144
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,110
If I'm stronger than you, then
what's there to worry about?

145
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,210
-Brother.

146
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,110
What was I even worried about?

147
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,180
-Yes.

148
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,160
This line up for our search
team will do just fine.

149
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,070
Has Kakashi shown up yet?

150
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,010
-Well, we notified
him, but I'm pretty

151
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,220
sure he's got his hands full.

152
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,080
TONTON: Oink.

153
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,010
-I wonder if Kakashi
will actually

154
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,030
be able to talk
some sense into him?

155
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,080
We need to keep a
close eye on the boy,

156
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,050
otherwise he'll go right back
to working on that jutsu.

157
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,200
-But he mustn't do that, milady.

158
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,150
He could lose the ability
to wield his chakra.

159
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,230
-And his days as a shinobi
would be finished forever.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,100
JIRAIYA: Well, we can't
let that happen, can we?

161
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,190
How's it going?

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
Long time no see, huh?

163
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,220
-I thought you were off
investigating the Akatsuki?

164
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,200
-Yeah, well, I've been a little
worried about my protege.

165
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,140
I figured I'd come and check on
him, so fill me in, will you?

166
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,060
What's the story?

167
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,030
NARUTO: Thanks for
the ramen, pops!

168
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,060
Kakashi-sensei will
cover the bill.

169
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,507
KAKASHI: Huh?

170
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,030
MAN: Much obliged!

171
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,080
SAKURA: Thanks, sensei!

172
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,170
KAKASHI: Wait a second!

173
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,050
-Huh?

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,020
Shadow clones, huh, kid?

175
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,070
It's about time.

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,000
-Hey, what's going on?

177
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,050
-Fine.

178
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,050
Come on, then.

179
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,180
Let's see just how
far you've come!

180
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,070
-OK, Naruto.

181
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,190
It's on!

182
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,150
Sexy Jutsu, [inaudible] Jutsu.

183
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,060
-Aw, man!

184
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,050
That's your new move?

185
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,010
[scream]

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,000
-Heh, heh.

187
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,448
Heh.

188
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,230
-So, what do you think, Naruto?

189
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,050
I upped it to two
girls, 'cause--

190
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,000
-Oh, no!

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
Konohamaru, are you OK?

192
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,070
-What the heck did
you do that for?

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,110
-There are ladies
present, you ignoramus!

194
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,050
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Deja vu.

195
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,050
-Idiots.

196
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,120
You do this every time you
see each other, or what?

197
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,230
-Well, it works for diversions.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,210
Besides, what's the
matter with a little bit

199
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,230
of healthy competition?

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,200
-Well, don't put
yourselves out, OK?

201
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,050
Besides, nobody's
distracted but you two!

202
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,060
-Well, now, having a good
time as usual, I see.

203
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,090
-Thank goodness.

204
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,050
Hey, Pervey Sage.

205
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,497
-Huh?

206
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,140
Aw, great.

207
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,030
Here's the other one
that would fall for it.

208
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,200
-And here I was
worried for nothing.

209
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,020
You don't look that
banged up, Naruto.

210
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,040
-Are you kidding me?

211
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,030
This is nothin'.

212
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,010
-Naruto.

213
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,160
Your bones haven't
even healed yet.

214
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,120
[laughter]

215
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,150
-Haven't changed a bit, have ya?

216
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,120
[knocking]

217
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,110
-You may enter.

218
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,080
-It's time for your
medicine now, my lord.

219
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,000
-Ah.

220
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,100
So you've returned.

221
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,040
-Yes, a little while ago.

222
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,200
-How is our dear Guren?

223
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,210
-Oh, just about the same.

224
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,100
If I can be honest,
my lord, I've

225
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,080
never understood what
it is you see in her.

226
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,180
-You've never cared for
her, have you, Kabuto?

227
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,100
She may not look
it, but there was

228
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,000
a moment when Guren was
my number one candidate.

229
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,120
Unfortunately, time
wasn't on her side,

230
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,210
and Gen'yumaru was chosen.

231
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,180
-Yes, my lord.

232
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,020
I know.

233
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,180
-With every passing
day, young Sasuke

234
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,190
grows more powerful, the
transference drawing closer.

235
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,070
When that time comes,
the Leaf and the Akatsuki

236
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,230
can be dealt with
once and for all.

237
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,020
And this current
endeavor will ensure it.

238
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,030
-It's what we need to do
after your transference that

239
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,090
worries me.

240
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,230
I'm not convinced that women
can be trusted, my lord.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,070
-This job's a very
particular one, I'm afraid.

242
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,110
Guren is the only
one who will do.

243
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,110
I want you to
speed up that test.

244
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
-Of course.

245
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,220
I'll leave today if I can.

246
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,190
I'm coming in.

247
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,010
-Tell me, do you prefer
white or red chamelius?

248
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,090
They don't lose their petals.

249
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,080
The whole flower falls off.

250
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,130
The nuts can be pressed for
oil, and the tree itself

251
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,010
makes very good charcoal.

252
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,010
-You shouldn't be here.

253
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,130
Go home.

254
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,000
-Go home?

255
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,090
I'm not sure where
I would go home to.

256
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,020
Maybe you can tell me.

257
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,060
Is this where I'm
supposed to return to?

258
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,030
I don't know.

259
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,140
It doesn't feel right, somehow.

260
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,020
This isn't where I'm
supposed to return to.

261
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,210
But really, you wouldn't
know that, would you?

262
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,090
Say, do you have a home, then?

263
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,210
-I have nothing like that.

264
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,090
-Yukimaru, here you are.

265
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,200
It's time to go.

266
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,060
-All right.

267
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,100
-Sorry to bother you.

268
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,130
-Bye, Sasuke.

269
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,070
See you later.

270
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,130
-So, would Naruto
listen to reason?

271
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,000
-He's matured.

272
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,020
Plus, he'll be looking
out for him now.

273
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,060
All the better.

274
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,040
In the meantime,
I've a job for you.

275
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,180
It's a search mission.

276
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,030
We're waiting for
confirmation, but Black Ops

277
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,050
may have stumbled across
Orochimaru's hideout.

278
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,050
However, the ANBU shinobi
who discovered the place

279
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,040
was killed.

280
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,040
All we know is the general area.

281
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,050
-Understood.

282
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,180
So what do you think of the
team we've assembled for you?

283
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,050
-Honestly?

284
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,040
I don't think you could
find a better line up

285
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,010
for a search mission.

286
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,050
Kakashi-sensei.

287
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,090
-Good.

288
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,170
Everyone's here.

289
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,040
You've all been
filled in, correct?

290
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,040
-Yes.

291
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,070
We are to pinpoint
the exact location

292
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,010
of Orochimaru's hideout.

293
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,100
-Right.

294
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,160
And with this group's skill set,
that shouldn't be very hard.

295
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,210
-I'll send a wave
of parasitic insects

296
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,080
ahead to search for high
concentrations of chakra.

297
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,040
-Akamaru and I can
take it from there.

298
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
With his nose, finding
this hideout will be easy.

299
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,030
[bark]

300
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
-And once the
location's been found,

301
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,080
my Byakugan will seek out the
enemy's chakra, and locate

302
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,140
their positions.

303
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,230
-I'm counting on you.

304
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,140
-Chances are if we actually
do find our way to Orochimaru,

305
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,080
we'll probably encounter
Sasuke, as well.

306
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,010
-That's right.

307
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,010
-But doesn't Naruto know that?

308
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,040
-That question is nonsensical.

309
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,230
If he did, it
would be impossible

310
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,070
for him to contain himself.

311
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
-Yeah, no two ways about it.

312
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,170
-It's true.

313
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,210
Naruto has been kept
in the dark on this.

314
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,090
-Tsunade already filled me in.

315
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,160
You perfected the wind
style Rasenshuriken.

316
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,190
Nice job, kiddo.

317
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,130
-What's it matter?

318
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,180
-Hm?

319
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,030
What do you mean?

320
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,060
You pulled off a jutsu that
even the Fourth couldn't manage.

321
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,020
That's something to
stand tall about.

322
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,180
-What's the point if
I wind up like this?

323
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,090
So I've got a
killer new move now.

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,120
Big deal.

325
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,180
It blows almost
all of my chakra,

326
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,130
and puts me in the
hospital, to boot.

327
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,180
-Huh?

328
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,200
-It isn't a jutsu that I
can use over and over again.

329
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,190
I've gotta learn some
techniques to use less chakra,

330
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,070
'cause this one isn't
gonna cut it right now!

331
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,040
-Oh, so that's what's
eatin' at ya, huh, kid?

332
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,050
Heck, the only thing you need
is a little more training.

333
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,050
And at your level, you can
master any jutsu you want to.

334
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,100
-Huh?

335
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,190
-I'm about to head out
on another research trip.

336
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,060
You want to tag along?

337
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,140
How about it?

338
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,070
You think you can handle the
rigors of my tutelage again?

339
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,070
-You bet.

340
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,100
I'm ready when you are.

341
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,020
-Now, that's what
I like to hear.

342
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,040
What are we waiting for?

343
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,100
Let's hit the road.

344
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,150
-So where we gonna be going?

345
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,120
-First we gotta get that
arm of yours healed up.

346
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,030
I'm thinking you need
a soak in a hot spring.

347
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,476
-Huh?

348
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,040
What do you mean, hot spring?

349
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,210
You think I don't know what
you're going there for,

350
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,200
Pervy Sage?

351
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,170
-This one's good for healing.

352
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,230
And there'll be
plenty of ladies.

353
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,190
-See?

354
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,180
It's just like I said, isn't it?

355
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,160
-It's too bad you're
not interested,

356
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,190
'cause I was thinking about
asking Sakura to join us.

357
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,050
-Huh?

358
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,230
Well, on second
though, hey, wait up!

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,466
I'm coming, OK?

360
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,010
Slow down!

361
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,060
Come on, Pervy Sage.

362
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,040
I'm injured, over here!

363
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,488
Wait!

364
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,050
[theme music]

365
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,120
SHINO: He leaped right at us.

366
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,080
Hinata, how is he?

367
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,040
HINATA: He's already dead.

368
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,100
But his body--

369
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,070
KIBA: That's
Orochimaru's curse mark.

370
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,070
KAKASHI: If this is the place,
what on earth is going on?

371
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,070
HINATA: Traces of chakra are
fading away all over this cave.

372
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,160
KIBA: We'd better
go in, then, Sensei.

373
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,090
KAKASHI: OK.

374
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,070
Watch your surroundings.

375
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,170
There may be traps.

376
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,090
-Right.

377
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,200
NARUTO: Next time, Orochimaru's
Hideout Discovered.
