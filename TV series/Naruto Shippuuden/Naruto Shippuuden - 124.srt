He's eating the detonating clay.

-I saved the best for last.

This'll kill you.

No!

13
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,300
It's the C4 Karura!

Hurry feet!

DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): I set
this jutsu aside especially

to kill Itachi but-- oh well.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Is that a bomb too?

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,466
It's huge.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,666
If that thing goes off--

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,933
-What?

21
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,366
You're just going
to run away now?

22
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,233
Do you really think
that you can escape

23
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:22,833
from me and my C4 Karura?

24

No.

-There we go.

39
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:37,534
The C4 Karura, microscopic
nano-sized explosives.

40
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,734
When the giant Deidara
ruptures, the blast wave

41
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,767
disperses explosives
too small for the eye

42
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,701
to see, scattering them
all over the atmosphere.

43
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:49,301
The mini bombs then
implant themselves

44
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:53,134
within the bodies of any and
all creatures that inhale them.

45
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,534
And when they explode the
multiple-cellular level

46
00:04:56,567 --> 00:05:01,701
explosions destroy their
victims from the inside out.

47
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,334
Huh, a fearsome Jutsu indeed.

48
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,234
-I have Itachi to
thank for this.

I've won!

52
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,901
My art has won this fight!

53
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:40,801
-It seems that you've
exhausted all your Chakra.

54
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,201
And now you're
too slow to react.

55
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,067
-Those eyes.

56
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:49,367
-Your explosives may be too
small for the eye to see.

57
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,467
But my Sharingan sees
Chakra as colors.

58
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:55,367
Your mini bombs
infused with Chakra

59
00:05:55,401 --> 00:06:00,267
were clearly visible to me
as a large cloud of smoke.

60
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,167
I could also tell that
you took great care

61
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:08,367
to remain hovered just outside
the range of the nano bombs.

62
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:13,401
Since I could see the
explosives, escape was easy.

63
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:17,034
-But I just saw you die from
my C4 with my very own eyes.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
That was my Genjutsu.

65
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:28,467
-Of course, so
that's what it was.

66
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,467
-I've avoided hitting
your vital organs.

67
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:37,234
Now, tell me where Itachi is.

68

[laughter]

69
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,501
-Like I said, I've got to
remember to thank Itachi.

70
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,967
-A clay clone, I
should have known.

71
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,201
-You see now?

72
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,367
I anticipated your Genjutsu.

73
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,134
You're just like Itachi.

74
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,167
And I never fall for
the same trick twice.

75
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,534
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Yes,
it all began the day

76
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,134
that I fought Itachi.

77
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,201
That's fine.

78
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:09,267
Just don't mock my art.

79
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:13,201
That's what my Ninjutsu is,
a noble and refined art.

80
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:13,701
-Hmm.

81
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:21,001
-Now, feel my art!

82
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:21,501
Hiya!

83
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,701
Ha, ha you talked big.

84
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:36,134
But it looks like
that's all you've got.

You're done.

-Am I?

88
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,067
You should take a
good look at yourself.

89
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,367
-Uh, what?

90
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,067
How?

91
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,501
-That was close.

92
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,501
A little later and you've
have blown yourself up.

93
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:58,734
-I told he was the type who was
going to die an early death.

94
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,801
-Genjutsu, since when?

95
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:06,101
-Right from the beginning,
when you saw Itachi's Sharingan

96
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:08,534
you were already under
his Genjutsu then.

97
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,401
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
It's beautiful.

98
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,267
This-- this is art.

99
00:08:54,534 --> 00:09:00,967
Ugh, no, I became intimidated
by someone else's abilities.

100
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,067
That, art?

101
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:04,034
Never.

102
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:08,067
I refuse to
acknowledge it as that.

103
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,234
Since that day, I've
trained my left eye

104
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,501
to counter the Sharingan.

105
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,467
As if I wouldn't
find a way to counter

106
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:18,034
such a powerful Genjutsu.

107
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,301
And now it's over!

108
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,401
How about a direct C4 attack!

109
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,401
[grunts]

110
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:53,067
-So now who's the one that's
running out of Chakra, huh?

111
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,901
Bet you don't have
enough to free yourself!

112
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:55,401
Ah!

113
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,967
-Just as I thought, the
inside of this model

114
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,501
is just like the other one,
full of invisible C4 bombs.

115
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,001
Hmph!

116
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:22,267
It hurts.

117
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:25,967
and worse, I used up my
Chakra with that last attack.

118
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,434
What a poor piece.

119
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,501
What do you do now, huh?

120
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:07,734
The last of his chopper's
in that lightening blade.

121
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,534
That lightening blade
attack won't reach me

122
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,334
at this distance.

123
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,434
I'll well out of your range.

[growls]

125
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,367
It's over.

00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:36,468
[breathing heavily]

128
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,435
I won.

129
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:52,268
I really did it.

130
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:55,368
My art triumphed,
as I knew it would.

131
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:04,302
Ha-- ha ha-- ha ha, ha ha--

00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:07,802
No way!

134
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,002
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
What is going on here?

135
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,368
That was no Genjutsu.

136
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:45,268
But then it means-- how-- how
did he disarm the C4 bombs?

137
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,835
But how?

138
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:58,468
Don't tell me that
you figured it out?

139
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:04,502
-Yeah, I did, a while back.

140
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,502
When facing the
Sharingan you really

141
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,402
ought to weave your signs
out of the line of site.

142
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:14,368
Because no matter how fast you
are, these eyes can read them.

143
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:18,302
All of your Jutsu so far
have used Earth Style Signs.

144
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:21,268
My Chidori uses
Lightening Style.

145
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,335
You do the math.

146
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,402
So you knew about
it all along then?

147
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:30,435
Then when you attacked me
with that lightening blade--

148
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:33,035
-Earth Style's
vulnerable to Lightning.

149
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,802
I knew that if I used it
then the lightning blade

150
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:38,002
would diffuse your bombs.

151
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:40,668
It's their Achilles
heel, isn't it?

152
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,202
-Damn you.

153
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:47,102
Of course, the lightning
blade wasn't intended for me.

154
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,868
It was for yourself.

155
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:51,402
You used it to deactivate
the C4 in your body.

156
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:55,202
That's right.

157
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,435
But it left my body
in tatters too.

158
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:02,202
By the way, my Jutsu is
technically called Chidori.

159
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,402
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): He
figured out my art's weakness

160
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:08,068
so quickly and with
perfect accuracy.

161
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:10,135
When did you realize?

162
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,902
after those landmines went off.

163
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,135
I knew then.

164
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:17,735
But I'd been analyzing
it from the very start.

165
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:22,035
Early on I countered your first
attack with Chidori Senbon.

166
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,902
I noticed that some of the
bombs you created exploded.

167
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:28,002
But some did not.

168
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,502
That's when I first
formulated my hypothesis.

169
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,302
-Your hypothesis?

170
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,568
What?

171
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,035
-That time, the only explosive
that actually detonated

172
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,068
was the one you threw
back at me again,

173
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:40,702
the one that you
threw when you tried

174
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,135
to evade my counterattack.

175
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,268
But all of the other
explosives, the ones

176
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:49,002
that I blocked with my Chidori
cymbal did not detonate.

177
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,568
However, it was possible
that you purposely

178
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,102
chose not to trigger them.

179
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,368
They did fall close
to your partner.

180
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,435
So perhaps you disabled them.

181
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:00,435
I see.

182
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,468
So in other words,
you couldn't tell

183
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,202
if your Chidori stopped them
from exploding or if I did.

184
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:13,568
Yes, you checked your theory
by testing it on the land mine.

185
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,035
-Yes, exactly.

186
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:16,602
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
This C2 assault

187
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,635
is brought you by the
linked attacks of the minds

188
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,202
that restrict your
ground movement

189
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,702
and the pinpoint missile
attacks from the air.

190
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,235
You're completely surrounded
by landmines in the ground

191
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,502
all around you.

192
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:29,735
Step on one, even touch
it, and it'll go off.

193
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,268
-If they detonate
automatically then

194
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:33,368
they're not under your control.

195
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,168
And if that was the
case, then I could

196
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,168
confirm if my Liking
Style Jutsu too

197
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,035
could diffuse your
Earth Style bombs.

198
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,468
[gasps]

199
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:46,568
-That's right, that time I
stuck my sword into the ground.

200
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:50,368
I wasn't trying to find a place
in between the land mines.

201
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:52,568
I was testing my
hypothesis by running

202
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:56,168
my Chidori-charged blade
through a mine I knew was there.

203
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,002
-But how could you?

204
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,768
How could you ever pinpoint
the position of the landmines

205
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,035
like that?

206
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,435
-These eyes see Chakra
as different colors.

207
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,235
Didn't you hear me before?

208
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,635
-You can see where
the landmines were.

209
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,835
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): So
then he wasn't just trying

210
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:19,568
to find a safe place to stand.

211
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:22,402
He was a step
ahead, seeing if he

212
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:25,335
could disarm my detonating clay?

213
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:28,035
But what would you have done
if the mine had stayed active

214
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,102
and gone off?

215
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,135
-There were only two outcomes.

216
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,868
Fortunately, I had a
backup plan just in case.

217
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:39,802
But I guess I didn't
need to test it out.

218
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,135
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): He--
still has other Jutsu.

219
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,402
-Now tell me where Itachi is.

220
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:25,168
-(LAUGHING) You
sure can talk tough.

221
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:26,968
But you're on your
last legs too.

222
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,935
Your Chakra took a
big hit, didn't it?

223
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,002
(LAUGHING) I still win.

224
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:35,135
I have some
detonating clay left--

225
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:39,968
[breathing heavily]

226
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,268
-Are you still calm?

227
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,335
Shouldn't you be worried
at least a little?

228
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:47,668
Come on.

229
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,868
You're about to be
killed by my art.

230
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,502
[laughing]

231
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:06,935
[laughing]

232
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:11,902
That is what annoys me the most
about you and your brother.

233
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:16,368
You think you're just so cool!

234
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:20,435
Those eyes, those over-confident
eyes make me so sick.

235
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,902
Your eyes, always
judging me and my art.

236
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,935
I'll never forgive
them for that!

237
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,568
You have absolutely
no respect for my art.

238
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,535
I can tell that you don't.

239
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,968
I can never forgive those
eyes that just ignore my art!

240
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,250
-I couldn't care less
about all of that.

241
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,650
I just want you to tell me
where I can find Itachi.

242
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,217
-So you've retracted
your Sharingan.

243
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,850
Do you really take
me that lightly?

244
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,017
This is my ultimate art.

245
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,817
This time I'm going
to detonate myself.

246
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,050
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He's insane.

247
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,984
In death I shall
become art itself.

248
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:54,150
No one's seen an
explosion like this,

249
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:57,584
one that shall leave behind a
scar on the very earth itself.

250
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:00,984
And then I'll receive
more admiration for my art

251
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,517
than anyone has
ever seen before!

252
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,484
Sorry Tobi.

253
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:09,850
-Huh?

254
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:13,517
-But while I will be admired,
you'll most definitely be dead.

255
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,550
[grunts]

256
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:18,317
-This explosion will
cover 10 kilometers.

257
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,917
You can't run away
from this one, hmm.

258
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,350
Tremble, be afraid.

259
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:30,646
Recoil in despair, cower in
awe and cry your heart out.

260
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,619
Because my art--

261
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,917
Is an explosion!

262
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,119
[theme music]

263
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,652
-Noruto, there's
evidence Sasuke was here

264
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,052
until just before we arrived.

265
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,086
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): What?

266
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,686
-It's faint, but
definitely his scent.

267
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,086
I'd say he fought a battle here.

268
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,886
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER):
What are we waiting for?

269
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:13,886
Let's go after him!

270
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,686
-We can't.

271
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,719
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): Why not?

272
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:17,886
-His trail goes cold here.

273
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,719
In this case, either
Sasuke was annihilated

274
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:25,052
in that explosion or--

275
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,786
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Disappearance.
