1
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:04,261
{\an1}The Sharingan is a
disposable power.

2
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,964
{\an1}Even among the Uchiha Clan
who possess the Sharingan.

3
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:11,066
{\an1}The more they use that
power, the greater the

4
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,034
{\an1}loss of their eyesight.

5
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,104
{\an1}Until in the end,
they finally go blind.

6
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,373
{\an1}Furthermore, there is even a
Forbidden Jutsu that can be

7
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,975
{\an1}invoked only at the cost
of losing the Sharingan.

8
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,714
{\an1}Procure a replacement for
this right eye of mine.

9
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,917
{\an1}If we are to attack a
member of the Uchiha,

10
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:33,551
{\an1}we must prepare carefully.

11
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,186
{\an1}There is one with the
Sharingan who is not an

12
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,855
{\an1}Uchiha, who has neither
parents nor teachers,

13
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,056
{\an1}and has killed his
own comrade.

14
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,425
{\an1}Kakashi... Hatake.

15
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,728
{\an1}Then our troubles
will end.

16
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:09,011
{\an1}Whose grave is that?

17
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:11,247
{\an1}It belongs to the
friend he killed.

18
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,220
Kakashi, sir...

19
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,188
Lord Hokage has
sent for you.

20
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:23,656
All right.

21
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,659
{\an1}And stop calling me "sir."

22
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,928
This isn't the
academy, you know.

23
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:32,396
{\an1}You're still my superior in
the ANBU. Besides, you're

24
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,966
{\an1}sort of like my role model.

25
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,267
You should find
someone more suitable.

26
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,406
Hey!

27
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:46,876
Rin Nohara.

28
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,716
{\an1}You are aware that
Orochimaru has secret

29
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,017
{\an1}research facilities
scattered throughout the

30
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,585
{\an1}country, aren't you?

31
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,386
Yes.

32
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,488
{\an1}After he deserted the
village, he destroyed many

33
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:06,924
{\an1}of them, but we've
discovered that he's also

34
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,125
{\an1}kept several intact.

35
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,529
{\an1}And most likely others we
have no knowledge of, as well.

36
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,730
So it seems...

37
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,098
{\an1}A small battalion on a
mission stumbled upon

38
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,734
such a facility
by accident.

39
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,470
{\an1}According to the report they
gave upon their return, it

40
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,038
{\an1}appears to be a research
facility that was

41
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,008
{\an1}abandoned by Orochimaru.

42
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,010
Huh. Did they go
inside to investigate?

43
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,144
Fortunately for
them, not yet.

44
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:36,513
{\an1}Right. We don't know
what dangers are inside.

45
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:39,917
{\an1}I'd prefer that the people
of our village not learn

46
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,219
{\an1}about all his repulsive
research projects.

47
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,755
{\an1}It would be difficult if
they learned what happened

48
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,989
to their missing
friends and family.

49
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,625
However, we must
investigate it.

50
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,628
So, you want
me to go, sir?

51
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,630
{\an1}Orochimaru left the
village three years ago,

52
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,000
{\an1}but he still remains a
thorn in our side.

53
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,267
I hate to ask...

54
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,101
But please, take
care of this.

55
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,336
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:27,888
{\an1}I understand Orochimaru's
hideout was found.

57
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,456
It's one of his
research facilities.

58
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,025
{\an1}I've dispatched someone
to investigate it.

59
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,025
I see...

60
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,995
Is something
troubling you, Danzo?

61
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:40,064
{\an1}It's possible Orochimaru
could've set some kind of

62
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,432
{\an1}trap before abandoning
that place.

63
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,033
{\an1}Are you certain that
it's safe to investigate

64
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,701
it right now?

65
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,936
{\an1}I sent a skilled ANBU agent.

66
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,739
{\an1}Well, I hope that
nothing goes amiss.

67
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:29,902
[grunt]

68
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,375
{\an1}Is that you, Kinoe?

69
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,012
{\an1}It's been a while, Kakashi.

70
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:51,486
{\an1}What are you doing here?

71
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,220
{\an1}I'm on a mission.

72
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:58,190
{\an1}As my back up? No,
wait, that isn't it.

73
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:01,394
{\an1}Did Lord Danzo dispatch a
Foundation shinobi because

74
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:04,130
{\an1}he's also interested
in this research facility?

75
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,235
{\an1}Foundation shinobi never
discuss their mission,

76
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:13,236
is that it?

77
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,405
{\an1}No matter. Thanks
for helping me.

78
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,975
{\an1}Well, we can't have you
burnt to a crisp, Kakashi.

79
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,813
{\an1}Should we investigate
what's inside together?

80
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,883
{\an1}Whatever we each find, we'll
share the intel. Sound good?

81
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,785
What's wrong?

82
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,687
{\an1}We may work in different
divisions, but we're both

83
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,955
Leaf shinobi, so
let's team up.

84
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:42,859
Okay...

85
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,562
{\an1}Who knows what we might
find, a demon or a snake.

86
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:47,563
{\an1}Let's go together.

87
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:48,430
Right.

88
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,006
{\an1}Seems like the only trap
was the one at the entrance.

89
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,910
{\an1}Orochimaru must have been
in a real rush to escape.

90
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,679
{\an1}You're right. Still,
we have to be careful.

91
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:13,616
Yeah...

92
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,192
Let's go.

93
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,093
Right.

94
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,809
{\an1}There's nothing in here.

95
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,278
{\an1}What was Orochimaru
working on here, anyway?

96
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,516
{\an1}Probably indulging in his
specialty: experimenting

97
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:57,184
on humans.

98
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:00,386
Experimenting
on humans.

99
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,124
{\an1}This one is no good.

100
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,126
Nor this one.
Or that one.

101
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,160
{\an1}None are any good.

102
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:16,166
{\an1}This human experiment
is a failure.

103
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,969
{\an1}I thought that an adolescent
would adjust far better in

104
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,704
{\an1}propagating Hashirama's
cells, but...

105
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,075
{\an1}It's just the opposite. A
child lacks the strength

106
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,509
{\an1}and stamina for it.

107
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,945
{\an1}I guess I'll have to
shut this place down.

108
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:41,852
Wait!

109
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:43,220
{\an1}But not to worry.

110
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,956
{\an1}There are many more methods
for cell implantation.

111
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,892
{\an1}I'll start the next
test right away.

112
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:56,264
{\an1}Wait! Wait! Wait!

113
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:01,802
Kinoe.

114
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,836
Hey, Kinoe!

115
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,403
Let's go.

116
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:06,704
Right.

117
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,445
{\an1}This one's locked tight.

118
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,014
Leave it to me.

119
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:26,887
It's open.

120
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,857
{\an1}That jutsu went extinct
in the Hidden Leaf

121
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,625
{\an1}Village ages ago.
How did you learn it?

122
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:37,495
It's a secret.

123
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,898
{\an1}Do you know just how
important the Wood Style is

124
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,365
{\an1}to the Hidden Leaf?

125
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,668
No, I don't...

126
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:48,271
{\an1}The Nine Tails' Jinchuriki
belongs to the Leaf.

127
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,606
{\an1}Wood Style is one of
the powers that can

128
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,308
{\an1}control the Nine Tails.

129
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:56,343
{\an1}I know that the Sharingan
is the other power.

130
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:01,014
{\an1}Your Wood Style Jutsu isn't
just for the Foundation.

131
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:02,949
{\an1}It's a power meant
to serve all of the

132
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,483
{\an1}Hidden Leaf Village.

133
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,485
{\an1}Lord Danzo wants to
keep you by his side,

134
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,654
{\an1}but I think you're
more suited to working

135
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,123
{\an1}directly under the Hokage.

136
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:14,624
{\an1}Wouldn't you like to
leave the Foundation and

137
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,893
{\an1}come out into the sunlight?

138
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:30,137
{\an1}No! No! I'm still
alive! Don't leave!

139
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,914
No! No...

140
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,389
{\an1}There's a survivor?!

141
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,309
What is this?

142
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:23,846
{\an1}There's something inside...

143
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,248
[gasp]

144
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,164
{\an1}What do you think
you're doing, Kinoe?!

145
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,767
Kinoe!

146
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:55,436
{\an1}Are you serious?!

147
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,240
{\an1}Yes, I'm serious!

148
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,110
[grunt]

149
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,758
{\an1}<i>I have the advantage.</i>
<i>All that's left is...</i>

150
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:25,961
{\an1}<i>He knows how to fight</i>
<i>against my Sharingan. </i>

151
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,829
{\an1}<i>This was his intent from</i>
<i>the very beginning.</i>

152
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:33,666
Kinoe!

153
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,936
{\an1}If you're serious about
killing me, then I'm not

154
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,603
{\an1}going to hold back!

155
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,307
{\an1}It'll be a death match,
friend against friend!

156
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:44,809
Oh, I'm serious.

157
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,844
[grunting]

158
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,479
Dead serious!

159
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,115
[grunt]

160
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,583
[gasp]

161
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,387
Why do you
want to kill me?

162
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,055
It's my mission.

163
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:05,292
{\an1}What kind of mission sends
a friend after a friend?

164
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,026
{\an1}You're one to talk.

165
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:07,893
[gasp]

166
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,763
{\an1}I mean, you're the one who
killed a friend, aren't you?

167
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:13,865
Substitution?!

168
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,036
{\an1}Wood Style Substitution...

169
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,239
{\an1}You've gotten better
since the last time.

170
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:26,675
{\an1}That's right. So don't
hold back, Kakashi.

171
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,676
{\an1}I won't kill a friend.

172
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,845
You don't have
to hold back!

173
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,680
{\an1}Stop, Kinoe! Abandon
this mission!

174
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,017
No! A shinobi's
mission is absolute.

175
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,883
Kinoe!

176
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:40,686
[gasp]

177
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,892
{\an1}A mission is not absolute!

178
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,195
{\an1}If your orders are to
kill a friend, then

179
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,696
{\an1}those orders are wrong!

180
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,298
{\an1}And the one who gave
you those orders is wrong.

181
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,636
{\an1}Could Lord Danzo be wrong?

182
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,476
{\an1}So, can you walk?

183
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,913
{\an1}What's the matter? I know
you don't seem to remember

184
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:18,215
who you are, but
have you forgotten

185
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,816
{\an1}how to talk as well?

186
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,385
Uh, no, I...

187
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:23,819
Come with me.

188
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,893
{\an1}Orochimaru's greedy
and impatient.

189
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,261
{\an1}It's good to have the
desire to test new things

190
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,962
out, but then he
gives up too quickly.

191
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:40,499
{\an1}However, I suppose that you
should count yourself lucky

192
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,234
{\an1}that he gave up on you.

193
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,803
{\an1}If you had stayed with
Orochimaru, you would

194
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:47,771
{\an1}have ended up just
another test subject.

195
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,980
{\an1}My organization takes in
shinobi who don't have

196
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:01,282
{\an1}anyplace else to go.

197
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,716
{\an1}Starting right now,
you will be a shinobi

198
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,319
{\an1}of the Foundation.

199
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:06,586
Huh?

200
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,390
{\an1}Foundation. We are the
unyielding organization that

201
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:12,424
{\an1}supports the great
tree known as the

202
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,958
{\an1}Hidden Leaf Village.

203
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:17,161
{\an1}Without strong roots,
a steady foundation,

204
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:18,695
{\an1}a tree cannot grow.

205
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,897
{\an1}That's why the Foundation...

206
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,533
{\an1}From this point on,
you'll be called Kinoe.

207
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,902
{\an1}Henceforth, you will be
counted as one of us.

208
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,074
You were just
one out of sixty.

209
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,042
Huh?

210
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:38,579
{\an1}In the quest to produce
another Wood Style user,

211
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:41,646
{\an1}a total of fifty-nine other
children have been lost.

212
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,850
{\an1}Kinoe, you must cherish the
life that you've been given.

213
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,251
Yes...

214
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,959
{\an1}I'm leaving. He said I'm
going to be part of the

215
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:59,061
Foundation of
the Hidden Leaf.

216
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,139
Water Style!

217
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,310
{\an1}You are able to infuse
chakra very nicely now.

218
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,512
Yes, sir!

219
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:26,182
{\an1}Well, then... Seems
the time has come.

220
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:27,849
{\an1}I shall train you myself.

221
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:29,518
{\an1}Lord Danzo is--?!

222
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:30,684
Personally?

223
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,058
One time, years
ago, I witnessed the

224
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,959
{\an1}First Hokage in battle.

225
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,795
{\an1}Deep Forest Emergence,
Deep Forest Bloom...

226
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,466
Such formidable
Wood Style Ninjutsu.

227
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,234
{\an1}If you've inherited his
cells, all my hopes now

228
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:52,502
reside in you.

229
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,172
{\an1}Now, then, infuse Earth
Style and Water Style Change

230
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,007
{\an1}in Chakra Nature together!

231
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:04,546
{\an1}You aren't quite there yet.

232
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,513
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:10,149
{\an1}It can't be helped. After
all, you're not an identical

234
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,351
{\an1}replica of the First Hokage.

235
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,921
{\an1}Here's the Wood Style
Ninjutsu Scroll that was

236
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,788
{\an1}left by the First Hokage.

237
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:22,058
{\an1}It's full of jutsu that I'm
not able to use, but I think

238
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:24,527
{\an1}that you should be
able to learn them.

239
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,095
{\an1}Me, learn jutsu you
can't, Lord Danzo?

240
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,964
The world of the
shinobi is filled with

241
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,632
{\an1}a myriad of jutsu.

242
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,834
{\an1}You cannot compete if
you only have one power.

243
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,937
{\an1}And so, we must master
numerous jutsu and use the

244
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,039
powers that we
acquire to unite the

245
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,341
{\an1}entire shinobi world.

246
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,977
{\an1}I have high hopes for your
Wood Style Jutsu, Kinoe.

247
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,583
{\an1}Lord Danzo is not wrong!

248
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,954
{\an1}I will complete my mission!

249
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:00,288
Why you--!?

250
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,161
{\an1}To hell with your mission!

251
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,631
{\an1}I'll say it again! Killing a
friend is not a mission!

252
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,066
Then why did
you kill her?!

253
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:15,500
What?!

254
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,770
Why did you kill
Rin Nohara?!

255
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,172
[gasp]

256
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,645
[grunting]

257
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,114
Why'd you do it?
Why did you kill her?

258
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:39,620
{\an1}You did it because
it was your mission!

259
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,958
Don't you dare
talk about Rin!

260
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,961
{\an1}As part of my ANBU missions,
I've had to deal with Rogue

261
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,130
{\an1}Ninja and traitors
to the Hidden Leaf.

262
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:57,133
{\an1}So I can't help it if I'm
called Friend-Killer Kakashi!

263
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:58,967
But!

264
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,469
Rin was...

265
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,070
Don't you--!

266
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:05,806
[gasp]

267
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,342
{\an1}I didn't want to kill her!

268
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,016
{\an1}I couldn't protect my
friend. That's why Rin died,

269
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,851
{\an1}because of this Chidori.

270
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,453
{\an1}Couldn't protect her?

271
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,238
{\an1}Couldn't protect her...

272
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,040
{\an1}Are you going to kill me?

273
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,275
{\an1}Are you a friend of
the Hidden Leaf?

274
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:53,244
{\an1}Or are you a traitor?

275
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,278
{\an1}I am not a traitor.

276
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,113
{\an1}Then what are you?

277
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,215
{\an1}I'm Kinoe of the Foundation.

278
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,718
Alright, Kinoe,
abandon your mission

279
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,052
{\an1}with the Foundation.

280
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,486
I can't.

281
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:07,854
{\an1}Then I'll take you into
custody and turn you

282
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:10,223
{\an1}over to Lord Hokage.

283
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:12,992
Do whatever
you please.
