1
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:04,725
{\an1}Everyone is growing
tired of fighting.

2
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,827
I know...

3
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,964
{\an1}Even if we win, the Akatsuki
never really gets rewarded...

4
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,034
{\an1}The only things that we
have are our ideals.

5
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,405
In time, pent-up
frustrations will

6
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,540
{\an1}erase even those.

7
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,475
{\an1}So everyone's going to
forget what they're fighting

8
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,612
{\an1}for? Is that what
you're telling me?

9
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:27,947
Nagato...

10
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,483
{\an1}Will you take over as
leader of the Akatsuki?

11
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,651
Huh?!

12
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,152
It's just...

13
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,354
I'm not cut out
to be a leader.

14
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,357
That day...

15
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,661
I killed someone
for the first time.

16
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,865
{\an1}It's like I can still
feel that moment...

17
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,268
{\an1}And I can't stop trembling!

18
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,238
Yahiko...

19
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:56,305
{\an1}But you're different.

20
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,942
{\an1}You have the mark of a hero.

21
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,745
{\an1}A special symbol known as
the Rinnegan and that will

22
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:06,482
{\an1}become everyone's new ideal.

23
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,116
Yahiko!

24
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,019
{\an1}Are you trying to
exploit my Rinnegan?!

25
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,257
{\an1}I'm frightened of myself.

26
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,493
{\an1}These eyes have brought
me so much suffering.

27
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:20,761
I know...

28
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:22,963
{\an1}But remember, you have
someone who can help you

29
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,632
{\an1}keep that power in check.

30
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,835
{\an1}Konan will always
be by your side.

31
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,738
Yahiko...

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,774
{\an1}Brother! Big news!

33
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,075
What's going on?

34
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:38,977
{\an1}Hanzo sent a messenger!

35
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,755
{\an1}Are you Yahiko, the
leader of the group that's

36
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,757
{\an1}known as the Akatsuki?

37
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,124
Yes, I am.

38
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:57,061
{\an1}I am Kanzo, a trusted friend
of Hanzo of the Salamander,

39
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,229
{\an1}the one who sent me here.

40
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:02,165
{\an1}We have heard many rumors
about you Akatsuki...

41
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,367
For example, how
you seek peace

42
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,137
{\an1}without relying on
military might.

43
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:10,139
{\an1}That is the founding
principle of the Akatsuki.

44
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:12,676
{\an1}Hanzo has asked me to
deliver a confidential

45
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,643
{\an1}letter to you. Here it is.

46
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:27,955
Is this?!

47
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,193
{\an1}Is he serious about this?!

48
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,462
{\an1}He would very much
like to meet with your

49
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,030
{\an1}group personally.

50
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:40,734
{\an1}Hanzo has given the Akatsuki
his seal of approval.

51
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,942
{\an1}In time, Hanzo will leave
you to handle the peace

52
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:52,911
{\an1}negotiations between
the three nations on

53
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,714
{\an1}behalf of the Hidden Rain.

54
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,482
We'll handle the
negotiations?! Brother!

55
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:58,683
That's amazing!

56
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:03,621
{\an1}Please relay to Lord
Hanzo that I accept.

57
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:10,561
[cheering]

58
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,962
{\an1}This means we can
step out of the shadows

59
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,465
{\an1}and help people openly!

60
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,568
{\an1}So many have died...

61
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,369
...for us to
reach this point.

62
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,705
{\an1}Finally, we'll be able
to face them with pride!

63
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:25,842
You did it...

64
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,043
{\an1}Your determination to
free others from pain and

65
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,479
{\an1}suffering has gotten
through to Hanzo.

66
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,347
Look...

67
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,418
[laughter]

68
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,320
{\an1}The Akatsuki's faith in our
ideals has been restored.

69
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,224
{\an1}There was never a
need for a symbol.

70
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:48,061
{\an1}We'll all follow your
dream, wherever it leads.

71
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,865
{\an1}Nagato... [chuckle]

72
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,701
{\an1}We were right after all!

73
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,476
{\an1}Tomorrow, Nagato and I
will go to the meeting

74
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,011
{\an1}with Hanzo alone.

75
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,880
You sure about
this, Brother?

76
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:09,515
{\an1}We'd all be happy
to go with you.

77
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:10,716
{\an1}No, that's all right.

78
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,284
{\an1}Besides, Hanzo might wonder
what he's gotten into if too

79
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:15,286
{\an1}many of us show up!

80
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,220
[laughter]

81
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,289
Yeah, I know
that, but still...

82
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:20,223
{\an1}Where is Konan, anyway?

83
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:22,760
{\an1}She went to go and
patrol the Seventh Ward.

84
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:25,262
{\an1}She won't be back
until tomorrow.

85
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,465
{\an1}I see... On such a
special day, too.

86
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:32,134
{\an1}Today, the Akatsuki took
a giant step forward!

87
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:34,905
{\an1}So all of you! Set
aside your duties tonight

88
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,138
and celebrate!

89
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,007
[cheering]

90
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,949
{\an1}The brats in the Akatsuki
aren't becoming

91
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:51,151
suspicious at
all, are they?

92
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,855
{\an1}No, of course not.

93
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:56,957
{\an1}I'm certain that if the
one named Yahiko is

94
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,527
{\an1}killed, the Akatsuki
will naturally die off.

95
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:02,362
{\an1}What about your plans?

96
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,064
{\an1}No need to worry.

97
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:27,351
{\an1}Who could have--?

98
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,290
[gasp] Poison!

99
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,427
[groans]

100
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,338
{\an1}We should be securing the
hostage right about now.

101
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,942
{\an1}With this operation, that
lawless gang that threatens

102
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,612
{\an1}your village will be
gone, and the Hidden Rain

103
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,179
{\an1}will be all yours.

104
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,197
I can't believe
we've come this far...

105
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,899
Nagato.

106
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,567
You--!

107
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,004
{\an1}Reality is moving
forward quickly.

108
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,705
{\an1}The time has come for
you to cut ties with

109
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,974
{\an1}Yahiko and join me.

110
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,844
{\an1}Otherwise, you'll all...

111
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,211
We'll all what?

112
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:37,115
{\an1}What Yahiko proposes
are just naïve ideals.

113
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:40,485
{\an1}He tries to understand
others' pain, but they make

114
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,519
{\an1}no attempt to know ours.

115
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:46,790
{\an1}But in any event, this world
has no desire for either

116
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:49,660
{\an1}attempt. That is reality.

117
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:54,196
You possess the
Rinnegan, so you really

118
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,766
{\an1}should understand.

119
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:57,600
{\an1}No matter what you say...

120
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,303
I believe in
Yahiko's ideals!

121
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:09,377
{\an1}I guess without pain you
cannot comprehend reality.

122
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,380
{\an1}Though you possess the
Rinnegan, you still think

123
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,316
{\an1}like an ordinary man.

124
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,755
{\an1}Very well, then... Go
witness reality for yourself.

125
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:24,024
{\an1}And experience pain.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,468
{\an1}There you are, Nagato.

127
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:38,670
Yahiko...

128
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,439
{\an1}Was someone here?

129
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:41,640
No one...

130
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:44,108
{\an1}Well, we'd better get going.

131
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,578
{\an1}Or we'll be late for our
meeting with Hanzo.

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,413
Right. Let's go!

133
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:54,518
[snoring]

134
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,090
Ow!

135
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:03,760
{\an1}Hey, what's the big idea?
I was having a nice nap!

136
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,196
{\an1}Huh? Let's see...

137
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:12,035
{\an1}Hey, you guys! Where're
Yahiko and Nagato?!

138
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,005
{\an1}I think they both left for
that meeting with Hanzo

139
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,272
already. It's
today, remember?

140
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,042
{\an1}Wake everyone up!

141
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,777
{\an1}We gotta catch up to them!

142
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:22,978
What's wrong?

143
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,079
{\an1}I'll tell you later!

144
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:28,916
{\an1}So, talk! What the
hell is going on?

145
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,952
{\an1}We just received word
from a member of the team

146
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:32,719
{\an1}at the Hidden Leaf border.

147
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,788
{\an1}The Leaf's Anbu Black
Ops are on their way

148
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:36,056
{\an1}to meet Hanzo, too.

149
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:39,158
{\an1}What? Anbu from the
Hidden Leaf Village?!

150
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:41,327
{\an1}But why would they be
going to see Hanzo?!

151
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,930
{\an1}I don't know any of
the specifics...

152
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:46,265
{\an1}But the timing of it
sure seems suspicious.

153
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,068
{\an1}Besides when you think
about it, this thing

154
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:52,071
{\an1}with Hanzo really sounds
too good to be true!

155
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:55,173
{\an1}Then that means today's
meeting with Hanzo is...

{\an1}know about all this!

what reality truly is.
