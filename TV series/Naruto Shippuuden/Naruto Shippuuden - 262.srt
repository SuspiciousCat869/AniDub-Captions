00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:30,138
{\an1}Hey, Omoi!
Are you listening?

16
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:33,374
{\an1}Get your head in the game!
We're heading down.

17
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:35,443
We're above enemy
territory right now.

Hey, uh,

19
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,215
Can I ask you a
question real quick?

00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:41,817
{\an1}What is it?

21
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,822
Well, Captain,
you don't seem that
much older than I am.

22
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,794
{\an1}So this war.
It's your first one, right?

23
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:52,195
Yeah.

24
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,767
Well aren't you
nervous at all?

25
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,178
{\an1}Listen up! This war's outcome

26
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:10,382
{\an1}will hinge on the results
of our unit's attacks.

27
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,819
{\an1}As will the casualty count.

{\an1}If you want to protect
your family and friends,

{\an1}Only think about succeeding!

00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,239
{\an1}So, in which direction
should we evacuate, then?

31
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:37,577
{\an1}You'll continue heading
south through the Land of
Steam into the Hidden Leaf.

I'm here.

35

quite a long time.
How much longer?

36
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,276
{\an1}Not too long, sir.
Please, be patient.

this whole area

{\an1}I'll increase the
power of the jutsu.

46

{\an1}These insects are
so annoying! Hmph!

47
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:20,192
{\an1}They keep moving and hiding.
It's quite bothersome.

48
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:29,334
{\an1}The insects interfere with the
ability I have to sense chakra.

49

{\an1}This is the Beetle
Jamming Jutsu.

{\an1}These infiltration and
recon unit guys are good.

{\an1}However, they'd better not
underestimate this artful duo!

{\an1}Get to HQ.
Go quickly.

61
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:51,158
{\an1}I have to rendezvous
with the main regiment.

62
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:10,947
{\an1}All right, gather around.

63
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,986
We're already
inside enemy
territory.

64
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,454
We'll make our
stronghold
right here,

65
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:20,190
and we'll build a
mini base camp.

66
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,828
{\an1}We can head out from here to
launch surprise attacks and set
up delayed explosive traps.

Hmm.

68
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,304

Don't ever let

<i>'cause of my elite skills.</i>

{\an1}So, is there anything else
I should be aware of for now?

{\an1}Kabuto uses Orochimaru's
ninjutsu known as the
Reanimation Jutsu.

91
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:31,236
{\an1}According to our intel, corpses
are brought back to life,

{\an1}<i>their souls held in bondage.</i>

93
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:36,975
{\an1}<i>And they can't be killed, no</i>
<i>matter what you hit them with.</i>

94
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:41,113
{\an1}<i>The only way to stop them</i>
<i>is to seal away their</i>
<i>souls or immobilize them.</i>

95
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:45,918
<i>Also, even if you kill</i>
<i>the caster, the jutsu</i>
<i>will not come undone.</i>

{\an1}First Company! Come on!
You're with me!

101
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,946
Ah! This is...
a jamming jutsu!

102
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,649
{\an1}What is it?

103
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,521
{\an1}I can't tell for
sure 'cause of the
jamming jutsu, but,

00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,688
{\an1}Something's coming!

105
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:27,897
{\an1}Is it the enemy?!

106
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:29,466
Ah...

00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:34,838

{\an1}Wait, that's Muta! It's him;
I can tell by the chakra!

110
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:51,023
{\an1}He's from the Aburame Clan,
part of the advance
scouting party!

111
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:52,624
Hey! Wait!

112
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,462
{\an1}It's booby trapped out there!
I'll get him!

113
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:58,398
{\an1}Damn it!

114
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:02,202
{\an1}Muta! Are you all right?

115
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:03,136
{\an1}Hoheto.

116
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,137
Yeah, I know.

117
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:05,372
Byakugan!

118
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:12,913

{\an1}Get away from me...

120
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:15,649
Huh?

121
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:20,155
{\an5}The insect bag that he
has on his back doesn't
contain any Aburame
Clan insects inside it!

122
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,423
{\an1}Oh no!

out your little trick.

Everyone, run!

{\an1}Just save yourselves!
No one can help me now!

132
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,524
Those moves.

133
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,958

you to be cautious!

So, what do we do?!

137
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:03,736
{\an1}Go.

138
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,504
I'm on it.

139
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,877

of chakra inside the
insect bag on Muta's back!

140
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,313
Something's
going on!

141
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:15,449
There's no mistaking it.
It's Deidara's
detonation clay!

142
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,918
Ittan! Do it!

{\an1}Ha ha ha!
Now that is art!

146
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,261
{\an1}Did they all
blow up? Hmph.

147
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:57,762
Check for them.

148
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,238

00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:31,734
{\an1}Right.

154
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,141
No time to even mourn
our comrade's death.
So that's war, huh?

155
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:40,377
Aaagh!

156
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,711
<i>Just hold still!</i>

157
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,781
{\an1}The enemy's coming in!
Stay alert!

158
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:49,085
{\an1}Damn! No time to
contemplate that,
either.

159
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:52,089
{\an1}For the time being.

160
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,859
{\an1}Cloud Style!
Crescent Moon Slice!

161
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,028
Huh?

162
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,797
{\an1}Wait. Those two are...

163
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,701
{\an1}<i>Tokuma! And Ranka!</i>

164
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,171
More comrades?!
Are they being
manipulated?!

165
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,841
{\an1}Ah! More! Above!

166
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:18,485
{\an1}Nice, Sai!

167
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,657
{\an1}We'll keep your friends
alive for a while yet.

168
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:26,328
{\an1}You monsters.

169
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:30,031
So, what now? Hm?

170
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:31,966
[straining]

171
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,203
{\an1}You're playing dirty,
Akatsuki.

172
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:37,506
This is just
unforgiveable!

173
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,311
{\an1}Sasori. I know
you're out there.
Now show yourself.

174
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:46,817
{\an1}Hah! You're quite the puppet
master, aren't ya? Hmph!

175
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,492
{\an1}You're a Commando
Unit too, right?

176
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:58,463
{\an1}It's a little strange for
Commando Units to engage
each other like this.

177
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,067
Hmph! If we win here,
our surprise attacks
will be more effective.

178
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:09,641
{\an4}Our side initiated this
entire conflict. A victory
here could decide the
course of this war. Hmph.

179
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,411
{\an1}Well, then.
We will not lose.

180
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,948
You think so?
It's impossible
for you to win.

181
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,251
You want to know why?

182
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:22,355
{\an1}Because we are immortal! Hmph!

183
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:23,524
[gasp]

184
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:25,925
{\an1}What is it?

185
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:27,862
Impossible!

186
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:34,101
{\an1}Run away, little brother.
We're indestructible.

187
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,638
{\an1}There's no way you can win!

188
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,241
{\an1}Shin. Brother...

189
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,877
Hm? Your brother?!

190
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,050
Ah ha ha ha!
What a touching
reunion! Hmph!

191
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:55,259
{\an7}<i>I get it. They're intentionally</i>
<i>pitting us against people that</i>
<i>we know and care about!</i>

192
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,028
{\an1}That means there's
no time to hesitate.

193
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:01,198
{\an1}If these guys're gonna
try to hurt our comrades,

194
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,835
Then, no mercy!

195
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,474
{\an1}This is war, you fool!
There's no room for niceties.
Hmph!

196
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,748
{\an1}Hoheto, Tango, go!
Ittan, you're next!

197
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,285
Deidara.
You will pay.

198
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:22,422
{\an1}Brother!
Snap out of it!

199
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:26,593
{\an1}You've got nice moves.

200
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,196
{\an1}But even if you make contact,
nothing will happen.

201
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,201
{\an7}<i>I must hand it to you Sasori,</i>
<i>my good man.</i>

202
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,337
{\an8}<i>I don't even need to</i>
<i>counter this, hmm!</i>

203
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,439
Cloud Style!

204
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:39,006
Whaa!?

205
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,375
Back Slice!

206
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:43,879
Ahh!

207
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,150
{\an1}Well done, Omoi!

208
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:49,886
Eggh!

209
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,122
{\an7}<i>I'm unharmed!</i>
<i>It's a trick move.</i>

210
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,994
{\an7}<i>He appears to slice in</i>
<i>front, but he actually</i>
<i>slashes back. So stupid!</i>

211
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,097
He severed all my
chakra threads.

212
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,367
{\an1}That's some swordsmanship!

213
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,001
Now!

214
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:08,239
Uh?

215
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,774
[pulling]
Hrrh!

216
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,008
Dah!

217
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,711
Ittan, raise us!

218
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,746
Earth Style!
Mobile Core!

219
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,649
What's this?!

220
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,150
Augh!

221
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,155
Eggh!

222
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:33,400
{\an7}<i>This unit came together at</i>
<i>the last minute, I'd say</i>
<i>we're doing pretty well!</i>

223
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,103
{\an1}Why you--!

224
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:40,909
{\an1}Hm, this is the first
time that I've seen
you in that form.

225
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:42,544
[chuckle]

226
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,715
{\an1}That was quite clever,
attaching your threads to
mine and reeling me in.

227
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:52,923
{\an1}Seems your thread-handling
skills have improved since
we last met, Kankuro!

228
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:57,394
{\an1}While I do appreciate
receiving praise from a Red
Secret Technique Master,

229
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:01,164
{\an1}My Secret Black Technique's
now superior.

230
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,602
{\an1}Never did I imagine that
you would still be alive.

231
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:08,940
So, then, there was
an antidote to the
poison that I used.

232
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:14,512
{\an1}Hm. It appears that Fate
has decided you and I
would fight again.

233
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:26,359
{\an1}Hold it right there!

234
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,441
{\an1}Not for a moment have I ever
forgotten about that day.

235
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,351
You have talent.

236
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,954
{\an1}You might even win, against
a different opponent.

237
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:56,726
Those puppets of yours,
with all their hidden
poisoned mechanisms,

238
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:59,629
They're not
hidden from me.

239
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:05,535
{\an7}<i>No one's ever been able</i>
<i>to read my hidden weapon</i>
<i>attacks like this!</i>

240
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:12,744
{\an1}<i>You must be wondering how</i>
<i>I can anticipate every</i>
<i>attack your puppets make.</i>

241
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:16,681
{\an1}<i>Crow. Black Ant. Salamander.</i>

242
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,418
{\an1}<i>The answer is quite</i>
<i>simple, really.</i>

243
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,855
{\an1}I'm the one who created them!

244
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,225
{\an1}<i>[Kankuro]</i>
<i>So then, you must be...</i>

245
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,195
{\an1}<i>the legendary master</i>
<i>craftsman of the</i>
<i>puppet corps,</i>

246
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:34,768
<i>the great Sasori</i>
<i>of the Red Sand.</i>

247
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,479
{\an1}<i>The poison is</i>
<i>circulating, eh?</i>
<i>It's over!</i>

248
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:51,485
{\an1}Since you want to live so badly,
I won't finish you.

249
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,022
{\an1}I'll just let the
poison take its course.

250
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,427
But it will be over in
less than three days.

251
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,399
{\an1}After the last time,

252
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,835
{\an1}I owe you, Sasori.

253
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,761
{\an1}<i>[Shin]</i>
<i>Please. Just run away, Sai.</i>

254
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,064
{\an1}<i>I don't want to fight you.</i>

255
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,067
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>Shin. My brother.</i>

256
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,170
{\an1}<i>[Shin]</i>
<i>I really don't want to have</i>
<i>to hurt you, Sai... I...</i>

257
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:15,411
{\an4}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>This jutsu... that toys with</i>
<i>people's lives and feelings...</i>
<i>I'll... I'll...!</i>

258
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:20,784
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Sai and Shin.</i>

00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:22,887
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>I'll never forgive you!</i>
