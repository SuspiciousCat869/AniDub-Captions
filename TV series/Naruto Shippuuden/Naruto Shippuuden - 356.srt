1
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:57,516
Stand...

2
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,053
We're leaving.

3
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:06,823
{\an1}What about your mission,
Kakashi? Weren't you

4
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,625
{\an1}supposed to search
this location.

5
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:11,361
It's suspended
because of you.

6
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:13,462
{\an1}Don't let me stop you.

7
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:16,332
{\an1}You just tried to kill me,
so stop joking around!

8
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,334
I'm not joking
around at all!

9
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,267
Just move!

10
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,478
{\an1}I hear Foundation agents
are trained to discard

11
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,780
{\an1}all their emotions. Is
that true of you, too?

12
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:36,415
{\an1}Not just our emotions.

13
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,783
{\an1}Shinobi of the Foundation
have no names, past, or

14
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:41,752
{\an1}future, either. We only
have our missions.

15
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,888
Well, you failed
your mission.

16
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,636
{\an1}Don't move from that spot!

17
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,078
Huh?

18
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:21,086
[screaming]

19
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:29,560
Snakes?!

20
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,739
What are they?!

21
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:45,541
{\an1}And what's that?!

22
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,911
They're not
snakes, they're...

23
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:51,912
Orochimaru's
experiments!

24
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:00,219
[gasp]

25
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,663
[grunts]

26
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,936
What the?!

27
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,008
Kinoe!

28
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:27,344
Kinoe!

29
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:53,265
[attacking yell]

30
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:03,575
<i>Dead... </i>

31
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,111
<i>Everyone's dead...</i>

32
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:13,182
{\an1}<i>I'm going to die, too.</i>
<i>In here, like this...</i>

33
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,685
<i>I don't want to...</i>

34
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,761
You alive?

35
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,799
{\an1}You all right, Kinoe?!

36
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,601
[groaning]

37
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,068
Are you okay?

38
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,204
{\an1}I think so... But why?

39
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:41,073
Why what?

40
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,007
{\an1}Why did you save me?

41
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,743
{\an1}I couldn't just let you die.

42
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:51,948
{\an1}But if you did, I
would have deserved it.

43
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:56,353
{\an1}Did- Did you want to die?

44
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:59,221
No, I didn't.

45
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,292
{\an1}I... definitely didn't
want that to happen.

46
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,828
{\an1}Then be grateful that
you're still alive.

47
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,533
That I'm alive?

48
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:20,072
[gasp]

49
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,309
{\an1}The fluid from the snake...

50
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:26,879
This is...

51
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,046
{\an1}Don't inhale it; it's
poisonous! Run!

52
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:30,782
Right!

53
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:36,253
Kakashi!

54
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,025
[grunt]

55
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,408
[grunting]

56
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:13,585
{\an1}I didn't find Orochimaru.

57
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,287
{\an1}Nor did I encounter
a strange clan...

58
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,989
Nor anyone from
the Foundation.

59
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:36,438
{\an1}All I can really do for
now is live by the rules.

60
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,440
But that's okay.

61
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:42,376
{\an1}Beause now I know
that I'm capable

62
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,811
{\an1}of protecting someone.

63
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:49,983
{\an1}Procure a replacement for
this right eye of mine.

64
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,704
{\an1}Kinoe, where's Kakashi?

65
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,140
Did you do it?

66
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:20,476
Yes.

67
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,045
{\an1}So, you didn't need me...

68
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:27,447
{\an1}Where's his body?

69
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,683
{\an1}I made it appear like he
was killed by one of

70
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:30,984
{\an1}Orochimaru's traps.

71
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,220
{\an1}Lord Hokage's ANBU
will find him.

72
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,990
{\an1}Good. Let's return before
they get wind of us.

73
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,405
[groaning]

74
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,774
Kinoe?

75
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:08,584
<i>"To Kakashi..."</i>

76
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,486

77

{\an1}Kakashi, sir, your wounds!

83
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,844
{\an1}I must report in first!

84
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,084
What's wrong?

85
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,953
{\an1}Lord Third, it's regarding
the Foundation.

86
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:55,356
{\an1}The Wood Style user just
targeted me, likely on Lord

87
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,725
Danzo's orders.

88
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,426
Hmm...

89
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:02,228
{\an1}But he defied Danzo and
abandoned his mission midway

90
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:05,231
{\an1}through, even going so
far as to save my life.

91
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,166
{\an1}He should've returned
to the village.

92
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,402
Who knows what's
happened to him by now...

93
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,878
{\an1}What?! What's the
meaning of this?!

94
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,079
Kinoe?!

95
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,148
{\an1}I beg your pardon.
I failed my mission.

96
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:28,451
{\an1}If Kakashi was able to
defeat you, then there is no

97
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:31,021
one to blame for
that failure but me.

98
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:33,155
{\an1}It appears that I
have underestimated

99
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,690
{\an1}Kakashi's strength.

100
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:37,860
{\an1}But what is much harder to
forgive is you abandoning

101
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,928
your mission and
making a poor

102
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,996
{\an1}attempt at faking
his death!

103
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:45,099
{\an1}And I sent two men
to do the job.

104
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,538
{\an1}What were you hoping
to accomplish?!

105
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,811
{\an1}Answer me! Tell me
why you've done this!

106
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:02,247
{\an1}Please, sir, go to Lord
Danzo and save Kinoe.

107
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,284
[sigh]

108
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,754
Lord Third!

109
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,726
{\an1}It was agreed upon that I
would not interfere with the

110
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,460
Foundation. But...

111
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,130
{\an1}That is not possible
in this case.

112
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:36,242
So, Yugao...

113
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,242
Sir!

114
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,512
{\an1}Go and take this missive to
Foundation headquarters.

115
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,082
It's an order
from the Hokage.

116
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,919
{\an1}It summons Danzo here to
speak with me immediately.

117
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:48,419
Right!

118
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,698
I'm counting on
you, Yugao.

119
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,433
{\an1}Rest assured, my lord.

120
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,536
Kakashi...

121
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:09,604
Sir!

122
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,674
{\an1}Go to the infirmary and
tend to your injuries.

123
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:13,742
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,147
Huh?

125
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:24,283
Sir?

126
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,651
I'm coming, too.

127
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,531
{\an1}Kakashi is a shinobi of the
Hidden Leaf. He's a comrade

128
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:45,300
{\an1}from the Village. Isn't it
wrong to kill a friend?

129
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:48,204
{\an1}To be frank, you should
only consider those in the

130
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:50,906
Foundation to be
your true friends.

131
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,542
{\an1}Isn't the Foundation
the Leaf's friend?

132
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:57,179
{\an1}The Foundation's a unique
organization that supports

133
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:59,947
{\an1}the tree of the Leaf
from deep underground.

134
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,750
{\an1}Just as a tree is divided
into what is above and below

135
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,788
{\an1}ground, the Foundation
has its own existence.

136
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,823
{\an1}Kinoto, what is a
Foundation shinobi?

137
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,592
{\an1}Our shinobi have no names.

138
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,129
{\an1}We've no emotion.
We've no past. No future.

139
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:20,865
{\an1}We have only our missions.

140
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,101
{\an1}I'm the leader of
the Foundation!

141
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,270
{\an1}The missions I give
you are absolute!

142
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,871
No past?

143
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,438
No future?

144
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:31,674
No emotion?

145
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,010
No name?

146
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:39,147
{\an1}Tenzo! Welcome home!

147
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43,417
{\an1}Are you listening, Kinoe?!

148
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:47,320
{\an1}No! Don't call me that!
My name is not Kinoe!

149
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,422
What?! What do
you mean?!

150
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:52,525
{\an1}You are Kinoe of the
Foundation!

151
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,928
{\an1}What other name could you
have besides that one?!

152
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,465
{\an1}I am a shinobi of the Leaf!

153
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,535
{\an1}A shinobi not just of the
Foundation but the whole

154
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,103
{\an1}Leaf and its branches!

155
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:08,773
{\an1}They're all my comrades!

156
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,874
Damn you...

157
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,410
{\an1}What has made you
turn on us like this?!

158
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:16,146
[gasp]

159
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:21,083
Take him away to
the treatment room.

160
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:23,152
Bind him with
a Curse Mark.

161
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:24,385
Yes, sir!

162
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:29,023
{\an1}Lord Third has sent this
communiqué to Lord Danzo,

163
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,624
summoning him
to an audience.

164
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:33,760
{\an1}Notify Lord Danzo that he
is to appear immediately.

165
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,830
{\an1}Lord Danzo isn't here.

166
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:38,332
{\an1}What did you say?

167
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,900
{\an1}We will let him know just
as soon as he returns.

168
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,802
Where is he now?

169
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,271
We have no idea.

170
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,072
{\an1}We aren't privy to
the details of Lord

171
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,406
{\an1}Danzo's schedule.

172
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,179
{\an1}Go back and report
this to Lord Third.

173
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:56,446
{\an1}What about you, sir?

174
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,350
{\an1}I'll stay here and
wait for him. Go.

175
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:00,049
Right.

176
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:16,297
[gasp]

177
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:19,532
Stop!

178
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:21,235
{\an1}This is Foundation
jurisdiction!

179
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,270
[gasp]

180
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,774
[gasp]

181
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:30,876
Where is Kinoe?!

182
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:37,315
{\an1}Damn that Kinoe! What
ideas has Kakashi fed him?

183
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,184
{\an1}Lord Danzo, we're ready.

184
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:53,461
Release!

185
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:56,197
{\an1}Let's get out of here!

186
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,167
Kakashi?!

187
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,437
Agh! Kinoe!

188
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,974
Wood Style!

189
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,276
Hey! Wait!

190
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:15,814
{\an1}Found him! Over there!

191
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,154
[gasp]

192
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:24,855
Wind Style!

193
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:26,623
Vacuum Bullets!

194
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,226
[gasp]

195
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,195
{\an1}Wood Style: Domed Wall!

196
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:35,432
[groan]

197
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,203
{\an1}How good of you to
come over from your side

198
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:43,004
{\an1}to see us here, Kakashi.

199
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,007
{\an1}You entered Foundation
jurisdiction without

200
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,110
{\an1}authorization and tried to
take one of our own.

201
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,545
{\an1}Don't think you'll
get off so easily.

202
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,053
{\an1}Lord Danzo, Kakashi-

203
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,654
Just shut up!

204
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,191
{\an1}You won't be getting
away with this either.

205
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,659
{\an1}Neither shall you...

206
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,030
Hm?

207
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,298
[gasp]
Who is that?

208
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,038
Hiruzen...

209
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,207
{\an1}I am well aware that
you harbor a grudge

210
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,574
against Kakashi.

211
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,643
{\an1}But still, that does not
give you the justification

212
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:32,747
{\an1}to target one of the
Leaf's finest shinobi.

213
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,781
{\an1}What are you talking
about, Hiruzen?

214
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:38,752
{\an1}I couldn't care less about
Kakashi. But he chose to

215
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,421
trespass into
Foundation territory.

216
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,490
{\an1}And that is quite serious.

217
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,024
He chose?

218
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,659
{\an1}You're wrong. In actuality,
I dispatched him here with a

219
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,062
summons from me.

220
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,930
{\an1}Then, in order to complete
his assignment, he went

221
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,799
{\an1}looking for you to
deliver that message.

222
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:57,534
{\an1}All on my orders.

223
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:03,839
{\an1}It seems there was a
miscommunication.

224
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,476
{\an1}This is the first
I've heard of that.

225
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,545
{\an1}Well, then that settles
things with Kakashi.

226
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,848
However, it's
regarding this next issue

227
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:15,083
{\an1}that I sent for you.

228
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,453
{\an1}It has to do with
another exceptional

229
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:20,454
{\an1}shinobi of this village.

230
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,324
{\an1}You're aware that a Wood
Style user has long been

231
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,793
sought in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

232
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,962
{\an1}There was even a period when
we conducted questionable

233
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:32,265
{\an1}tests to acquire that power.

234
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,935
{\an1}I understand there is now
such a Wood Style user, so

235
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:39,937
{\an1}why keep him hidden
in the Foundation?!

236
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,473
{\an1}I was the one who found him,
and I protected and raised

237
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:45,742
{\an1}him, too. I wasn't
hiding him from anyone.

238
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,711
{\an1}I just didn't feel there was
any need to report it to you.

239
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,414
Hear me, Danzo...

240
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:55,583
{\an1}The Jinchuriki child has
now entered his fourth year.

241
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:59,321
{\an1}Wood Style Sealing Jutsu is
becoming more and more

242
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,888
{\an1}crucial to the village.

243
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,757
Because of that...

244
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:08,295
{\an1}I ask you to entrust this
Wood Style user to me.

245
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,198
{\an1}To the ANBU under
my direct control.

246
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,501
I can't...

247
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,869
{\an1}Please do this, Danzo.

248
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,238
{\an1}I know he is valuable
to you. But for the sake

249
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:23,108
{\an1}of the Hidden Leaf,
transfer him to me.

250
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,849
{\an1}Should you choose to
do so, everything will

251
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,418
{\an1}be settled amicably.

252
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:42,390
{\an1}Members of the Foundation
bear a Curse Mark so they

253
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,292
{\an1}don't reveal secret intel.

254
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,694
{\an1}I will not remove
it from him.

255
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,696
That is fine.

256
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,997
Very well, then.

257
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,167
{\an1}He is in my care now.

258
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,302
{\an1}So henceforth, you
will be an ANBU under

259
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,004
{\an1}my direct orders.

260
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,245
Uh, sir?

261
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:17,653
{\an1}Thank you, for everything.

262
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:32,799
{\an1}Um, hello? My name's Kinoe.

263
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,935
{\an1}I just transferred here
from the Foundation.

264
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:38,738
{\an1}Oh, hey there, Tenzo!

265
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,308
Tenzo?

266
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,776
Kinoe's your
Foundation codename.

267
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,646
In the ANBU, you
should go by Tenzo.

268
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,079
{\an1}But that name is kinda...

269
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,949
{\an1}Wasn't there even a
time when you called

270
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,384
yourself Tenzo?

271
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:56,820
{\an1}All right, everyone! This is
Tenzo. He's the new guy!

272
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,191
And I can vouch
for his skill.

273
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:03,326
[chatter]

274
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,064
{\an1}So, I'm Tenzo now, huh?

275
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:13,001
{\an1}Tenzo, you'll be on
my team, Team Ro!

276
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:14,636
{\an1}I'm counting on you.

277
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:15,970
[chuckle]

278
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:18,640
Okay. Yes, sir.

279
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,025
<i>As usual, your</i>
<i>Lightning Blade is as</i>

280
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,559
{\an1}<i>brilliant as ever, sir. </i>

281
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,962
{\an1}<i>There's no such thing as</i>
<i>brilliant or inferior in</i>

282
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,997
{\an1}<i>assassination. Killing</i>
<i>is killing, that's all.</i>

283
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,932
{\an1}<i>By the way, what ever</i>
<i>happened with the</i>

284
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,468
{\an1}<i>replacement? Our team</i>

285
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,202
{\an1}<i>There isn't really a rush.</i>

286
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,138
<i>We're not in the</i>

287
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:18,742
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
