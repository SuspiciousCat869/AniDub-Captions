00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,246
This should
pulverize Madara!

00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,817
{\an1}Deep Forest Bloom!

00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,928
Agh! Damn it!

00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:41,432

00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,140
As expected!

00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,311
{\an1}It's getting closer...
What now?!

10
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:59,782
{\an1}Hold on... That's
Grandfather's!

11
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:01,617
Kazekage!

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,718
Yes, I know!

13
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:14,997
What is that?

14
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:17,666
Just look at the
sheer scale of it!

15
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:20,601
{\an1}To create a forest
in an instant!

16
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,473
{\an1}Everyone, beware of the
pollen! Don't inhale it!

17
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:28,043
{\an1}Not just the Deep Forest
Emergence...

18
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:32,147
{\an1}... but the Deep Forest
Bloom as well? How dare
you, Kabuto!

00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:52,240
{\an1}I guess I'm too old...
to do anything.

36
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:08,889
{\an1}Hey now, the left
side is dirty!

37
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,892
{\an1}That's a precious
stone of the Hidden
Stone Village!

38
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,295
{\an1}You need to learn to
be true and sure.

39
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,031
And scrub until
your hands blur!

40

{\an7}<i>His rhymes and puns</i>

{\an8}Wha-?!

42
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:25,806
{\an1}Listen, symbol of our
village or not, this thing
looks like nothing more than

43
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,442
{\an1}a plain old ordinary
rock if you ask me!

44
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,944
{\an1}I mean, why don't we have
Great Stone Faces just

45
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,946
{\an1}like the Hidden Leaf
Village does?

46
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,050
{\an1}Seems like you're being a
real cheapskate, Lord
Tsuchikage.

47
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:39,586
{\an1}Ohnoki, I can tell the worth
of any stone I see just by

48
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,690
{\an1}taking a good look at
it for a moment or two.

49
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:47,561
{\an1}This rock is... a symbol! It
carries inside of it our
village's Will of Stone!

50
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,128
{\an1}It is our bedrock!

51
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:53,266
{\an1}Aw, even a cheapskate with
your words! Don't be using
our symbol in your puns!

52
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,500
Well...

53
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,704
{\an1}Actually, you're right. This
is just an ordinary rock.

54
00:05:58,806 --> 00:05:59,839
What?!

55
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,343
Agh!

56
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,545
{\an1}What do you think you're
doing, you stupid old man?!

57
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,347
{\an1}I can't tell which
one it is now!

58
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,717
{\an1}You see... if you simply put a
new one of them on here like

59
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,218
{\an1}this, no one would
ever even know it.

60
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,821
What?!

61
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,558
{\an1}What's really important is
the Will of Stone inside
you.

62
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:24,896
{\an1}Just as I can with an
ordinary rock, I can also
tell the worth of someone's

63
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,432
{\an1}will just by looking at them.

64
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:28,967
Ohnoki...

65
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:34,406
{\an1}Hidden within the will you
possess is the power to
change the entire world.

66
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,010
{\an1}But if you aren't careful, I
worry that precious will of
yours may disappear...

67
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,080
Disappear?

68
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:00,231
What?! But why?!

69
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:04,201
{\an1}That wasn't the agreement!
Lord Hashirama said...

70
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,137
{\an1}There is no alliance now.

71
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,038
{\an1}You will merely bow down to
the might of the Hidden
Leaf!

72
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:14,010
{\an1}And also... never mention that
shinobi's name in my
presence again!

73
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:17,914
Susano'o!

74
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:28,992
Barriers!

75
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:35,665
{\an1}As you keep running into
barriers, you may abandon
your will, make excuses, or

76
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:38,535
{\an1}perhaps even replace
it with hatred.

77
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,069
{\an1}Listen well, your will...

78
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:45,575
{\an1}Never abandon it and always
stride with pride!

79
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,097
{\an1}It seems that you still want
to keep dancing...

80
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:13,435
{\an1}But there's no strength
remaining in your step
anymore!

81
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,427
{\an8}<i>No more excuses!</i>

<i>Dismantling Jutsu! </i>

about my age...

84
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:14,561
{\an1}There's no excuse for making
such an excuse! Let's go!

85
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,337
What is this?

86
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,072
{\an1}Nice job, Ohnoki!

87
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:32,278
{\an1}Good, you're all awake! All
right, then! Let's get on
with our counterattack!

88
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,781
There he is now!

89
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:42,488
You dance well.

90
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:51,897
{\an1}However your step
is still too weak.

91
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,466
{\an1}Is that?! The First
Hokage's face?!

92
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,507
{\an1}I didn't want to believe it,
but that's why he can
use Wood Style!

93
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:07,612
{\an7}<i>[chuckling] And this is far</i>

Wait!

00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:01,488
{\an1}Is that you, Itachi?!

100
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,162
{\an1}I told you to wait!

101
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,369
A Susano'o!

102
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,407
{\an1}That Susano'o. You
definitely are Itachi!

103
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:26,580
{\an1}I'm impressed. I didn't know
you had been able to master
it as well, Sasuke.

104
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,951
{\an1}But what are you even doing
here?! You are dead!

105
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,252
{\an1}Kabuto's jutsu...

106
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,289
I have become a
Reanimated shinobi.

107
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:38,992
{\an1}No time to talk right now.

108
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,395
{\an1}There's something important
that I have to do.

109
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,766
{\an1}So what?! I don't care!
You're here, right in front
of me, right now!

110
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,234
And I have
questions for you!

111
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,903
Ask me later...

112
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,473
But you probably
won't listen...

113
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,875
{\an1}You're the one who told me.

114
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,145
{\an1}To come and find you once I
had the same eyes as you!

115
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,315
{\an1}Now you want to run away
from me?! Are you running
out of guilt for being a

116
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,718
{\an1}liar?! You don't have the
courage to tell me the truth!

117
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:10,989
{\an1}I already know everything
about you anyway!

118
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,694
{\an1}That's why I'm going to
destroy the Hidden Leaf!

119
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:19,631
{\an1}I told you before when we
fought against each other...

120
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,934
{\an1}We each live inside
our own fantasies.

121
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,071
{\an1}I asked you to think
about it that way.

122
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,341
{\an1}And about how one's reality
might be an illusion.

123
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,711
{\an1}However, my truth is real.

124
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:37,615
{\an1}I no longer live inside an
illusion! And I can see
through your genjutsu!

125
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,384
These eyes...

126
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,485
{\an1}...are your eyes!

127
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:51,962
{\an1}Sasuke understands all your
pain and your resolve to do
what you did!

128
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:57,134
{\an1}But Sasuke isn't like you.
He's really going to destroy
the Hidden Leaf!

129
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:00,004
{\an1}He's going to kill everyone
in order to avenge the pain

130
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,873
{\an1}that the village caused
his older brother!

131
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:10,281
{\an1}I can tell part of you is
still the same, but I've

132
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:12,682
{\an1}heard from others
what's happened to you.

133
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,418
I know how much
you've changed...

134
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:19,789
{\an1}You're wrong! You were the
one who changed my world
long ago!

135
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:23,459
{\an1}I was supposed to die, too!

136
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,197
{\an1}You were also supposed to
kill me along with both our
parents!

137
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,167
But, no!

138
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,273
{\an1}So he made up his mind. He
himself would drop the

139
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,741
{\an1}curtain on his own
clan's history.

140
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:45,781
{\an1}Of course he did not hate
the Uchiha. He simply did
what he had to.

141
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:50,219
{\an1}The discrimination by the
village... And the object of
their antagonism...

142
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,889
{\an1}He shouldered all
the blame himself...

143
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:58,760
{\an1}No one should ever
question Itachi's decision
and the sacrifices he made.

144
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:06,869
[gasps]

145
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:08,836
{\an1}What is going on?

146
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,040
{\an1}Big brother! Father and
Mother are both-

147
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:18,679
{\an1}I don't... Understand! Just
who could do something like
this?! [stunned breath]

148
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,649
{\an1}My foolish little brother.

149
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,417
{\an1}Mangekyo Sharingan!

150
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:31,893
{\an1}Now explain it! Why me?!
Why?! Why did you spare
only me?!

151
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:36,330
{\an1}He just couldn't bring
himself to kill you.

152
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,234
{\an1}Do you understand
what that means?

153
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,473
{\an1}Why me?! What's different
about me versus our father
or mother?! Why only me?!

154
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,009
{\an1}Because you didn't
know anything.

155
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:53,847
{\an1}You had no part in the
Uchiha Clan's folly. You
were just a child.

156
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,517
{\an1}And do you think I
did it just for you?

157
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:00,287
{\an1}I wanted you to grow
up and judge me.

158
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:03,823
I deserved to be
dealt with only by
another Uchiha.

159
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:08,460
{\an1}And so I took advantage of
the hatred inside you.

160
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,232
{\an1}That's why I failed.

161
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,037
{\an1}Ultimately I only filled
you with hatred and made
you go rogue.

162
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,374
I turned you
into a criminal!

163
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:34,386
Chidori!

164
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:37,222
{\an1}[battle cry] Elbow Bolt!

165
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,763
{\an1}Even though all I ever
really wanted was for you
to walk the right path.

166
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,439
{\an1}Back before I died, I--

167
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:57,742
{\an1}I tried to lead you down
that path to righteousness.

168
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,212
{\an1}Down a path without
any forks or turns...

169
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:06,284
I changed the
signposts on it...

170
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,020
{\an1}...with lies and my
Visual Prowess.

171
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:14,225
{\an1}What? I was supposed to
happily walk that one path,
ignorant of everything?!

172
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,862
I couldn't!

173
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,333
{\an1}I never could have
walked that path!

174
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,335
Yes...

175
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,170
{\an1}You're completely right.

176
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:30,107
{\an1}You ought to decide your
journey for yourself.

177
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,411
{\an1}No matter how you try to
obscure the signposts, my

178
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,779
{\an1}eyes can strip away
all of your lies!

179
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:39,216
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

180
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:40,916
{\an1}What's so damn funny!

181
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,752
Nothing...

182
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,690
{\an1}Just realizing that the
signposts were not your
only guides.

183
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,295
{\an1}Properly speaking,
I'm dead now...

184
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,703
{\an1}There's no point in
talking any further.

185
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,840
{\an1}When you were alive, you
never paid any attention
to me.

186
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:08,576
{\an1}Always flicking my forehead,
saying "forgive me," and
running off.

187
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:12,481
{\an1}And even now that you're
dead, you're still running
away?!

188
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:14,383
I'm not running
away from you.

189
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:18,487
{\an1}As I told you, There's
something important I
have to do.

190
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:23,591
I must stop the
Reanimation Jutsu.

191
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,541
{\an1}You there, female
medical ninja.

192
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:45,113
{\an1}You have it. His blood
runs through your veins,
doesn't it?

193
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:47,449
{\an1}And what if it does?!

194
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:51,752
Then I will take
you down first.

195
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:57,257
{\an1}Taking out a unit's Medical
Ninja first is a
well-established tactic.

196
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:01,495
{\an1}Surely, you don't think we'd
let you do something like
that so easily...

197
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,298
You're wrong...

198
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,903
{\an1}The reason that she's first
is that she's a descendant
of Hashirama Senju.

199
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:16,776
{\an1}Your Medical Ninjutsu is
only strong enough to defer
death for what essentially

200
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,779
{\an1}amounts to a meaningless
period of time.

201
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:25,284
{\an1}It's pathetic compared to
what Hashirama Senju was
able to accomplish.

202
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:33,659
{\an1}He could heal wounds without
even weaving a single sign.

203
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:38,064
{\an1}In every jutsu he attempted,
he was in a class by
himself.

204
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,933
{\an1}Everyone viewed him as
the ultimate shinobi.

205
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,440
{\an1}And I once fought a battle
against him, putting my own
life on the line.

206
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:50,376
{\an1}Compared to that,
this is nothing!

207
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,318
So even if you
are his descendant...

208
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:05,190
{\an1}What do you really have to
offer? Just what can you
hope to do in this battle?

209
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,061
{\an1}You cannot use Wood Style,
your Medical Ninjutsu

210
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,829
doesn't even
come close to his.

211
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:16,368
{\an1}And most of all, you're
merely a weak woman!

212
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,172
{\an1}Weakness of any kind
completely revolts me.

213
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,907
{\an1}A weak Senju disgusts
me even more!

214
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:26,310
{\an1}I think you've rambled
on for long enough now!
Hm?

215
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,183
{\an1}I am a descendant of First
Hokage Hashirama.

216
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:34,653
I don't use Wood
Style, that's true.

217
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,456
{\an1}My Medical Ninjutsu is
pathetic compared to the

218
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,493
{\an1}First Hokage, who
didn't need hand signs!

219
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:46,930
{\an1}And it is also true
that I am a woman.

220
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,202
A woman...

221
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,505
{\an1}But I am not a weak
woman-- far from it!

222
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:59,577
{\an1}Physical strength
isn't everything.

223
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,514
{\an1}There's something else,
something passed down to
me from the First Hokage.

224
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:08,384
{\an1}And that gift is what
my true power is!

225
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,292
{\an1}Don't dare underestimate...

226
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,229
{\an1}...the Will of Fire!

227
00:22:57,222 --> 00:23:01,060
{\an1}This Reanimation jutsu
will not come undone
even if you kill me.

228
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:04,430
{\an1}But I am the only
one who can stop it.

229
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:07,666
{\an1}In other words, you
cannot simply kill me.

230
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,569
{\an1}I will make you stop the
Reanimation Jutsu.

231
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,107
{\an1}This jutsu has neither
risks nor weaknesses.

232
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:19,778
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Risks of
the Reanimation Jutsu."

233
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:23,081
{\an1}Every jutsu has a weakness.
