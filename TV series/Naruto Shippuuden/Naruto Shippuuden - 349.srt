the whole shinobi world.

143
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:20,703
{\an1}There won't have to be any
more sacrifices like yours.

144
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:50,276
{\an1}I'm counting on you...
Fourth Hokage.

145
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,046
{\an1}I pledge my
life to it.

146
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:08,099
[applause]

147
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:28,093
{\an1}<i>Kakashi, in my opinion,</i>
<i>you shouldn't  use that</i>
<i>jutsu of yours again.</i>

148
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:32,031
{\an1}<i>From what I saw, it's a</i>
<i>strike with a single focus.</i>

149
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,337
{\an1}<i>It certainly has speed and</i>
<i>destructive power...</i>

150
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,908
{\an1}<i>But it makes you move too</i>
<i>fast to ascertain the</i>
<i>opponents counterattack.</i>

151
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,813
<i>It's still an</i>
<i>imperfect Jutsu.</i>

152
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:49,989
{\an1}Those were the words
Minato Sensei spoke to
me back then...

153
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:56,932
{\an1}Obito...

154
00:15:56,965 --> 00:16:02,272
{\an1}I'm giving you my...
Sharingan.

155
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:03,475
[gasp]

156
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:05,778
[sob]

157
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:12,821
{\an1}Whatever the village, or
anyone else may say, I think
you're a great Jonin...

158
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,191
{\an1}It's true. That's how
I really feel.

159
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,463
{\an1}Please accept this...

160
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:24,236
{\an7}<i>You gave me this sharingan</i>
<i>in my left eye...</i>

161
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:30,144
{\an7}<i>When Chidori and Sharingan</i>
<i>became one, it became a</i>
<i>complete jutsu.</i>

162
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:36,386
{\an7}<i>But that Jutsu also</i>
<i>took Rin's life...</i>

163
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,188
Chidori!

164
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:52,140
So here you are!

165
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:55,011
{\an1}You have a mission. You've
been summoned immediately.

166
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,219
[worried groan]

167
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,558
[knocking]

168
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,894
Yes, enter.

169
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,034
You have a
mission for me?

170
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:17,308
{\an4}Yes. I want you to
retrieve documents
related to the peace
treaty.

171
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:18,610
Understood.

172
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:23,549
{\an1}Among the shinobi, there
are still some in power
who desire war.

173
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:30,091
{\an1}They have stolen the
missing documents, They're
intent on sowing discord.

174
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,461
{\an1}You need to be your
best on this mission.

175
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:33,497
Yes sir.

176
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,822
{\an7}<i>Gotta wrap this up!</i>

177
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:52,890
Chidori!

178
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,424
{\an8}<i>(Rin)</i>
<i>Kakashi...</i>

179
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,093
[gasp]

180
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:03,871
{\an1}Kakashi...
Kakashi...
Kakashi..!

181
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:06,040
[gasp]

182
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,414
Huh!

183
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,454
{\an3}Die!!

184
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,158
{\an1}Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

185
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,532
[grunt] Another one!?

186
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,039
This isn't like
you! Snap out of
it and focus!

187
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:32,877
S- Sorry...

188
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,581
Woah, Kakashi!

189
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,218
[grunt]

190
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,489
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

191
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,928
Get a hold of
yourself..!

192
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:52,336
{\an1}Oh, I see.

193
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,138
Yes, sir...

194
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:56,008
{\an1}Hm...

195
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,512
{\an1}I've never seen Kakashi
like that before, sir.

196
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,851
{\an1}Good thing that I secretly
sent you along as backup.

197
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,052
{\an1}You got that right!

198
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,456
{\an1}I want to be able to
help him in a time
like this...

199
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,627
{\an1}That's what a it truly means
to be an eternal rival!

200
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,397
{\an1}You have already
done a lot to help.

201
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,434
{\an1}Please, leave the
rest to me now, Guy.

202
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,905
[gasp]

203
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:33,826
[gasp]

204
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,469
Minato Sensei! I mean...
Lord Fourth..!

205
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,474
{\an1}You may address me as
you always have, Kakashi.

206
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:54,487
{\an4}You know, there are some people
within the village, who think
I'm not qualified for this
position, and oppose me.

207
00:19:57,323 --> 00:20:04,367
{\an7}I came here today
because I want to assign
you to the ANBU under
my direct control.

208
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,836
[gasp]

209
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:10,475
But, why me?

210
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,847
{\an1}I want you to be my
right-hand man, Kakashi!

211
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:49,294
{\an1}Here's a set of
equipment for you.

212
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,902
Thank you.

213
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:01,408
{\an5}<i>(Minato)</i>
