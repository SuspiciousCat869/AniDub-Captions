00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:20,711
What's wrong?

163
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,078
{\an1}You look depressed.

164
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:24,681
If you feel like
talking, I'll listen.

165
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:37,660
-Kakashi, that's
your name, right?

166
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:43,065
{\an1}The thing is I happen to be--
I'm Naruto Uzumaki's homeroom

167
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:44,233
teacher.

168
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,934
-Really?

169
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,103
{\an1}-I went to ask the Third
Hokage to relieve me

170
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:52,107
{\an1}from my assignment,
but he wouldn't see me.

171
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:57,613
{\an1}The truth is I don't have any
idea how to deal with that boy.

172
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,014
Nothing works.

173
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:00,649
I don't know why
the Hokage thought

174
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,085
{\an1}I was the right person for this.

175
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:07,623
{\an1}I'm just not qualified to
teach a kid like Naruto.

176
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:08,857
-I see.

177
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,759
{\an1}That's why you look lifeless.

178
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,593
-What?

179
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,462
{\an1}-There's no spark in your eyes.

180
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:20,134
{\an1}-Kakashi, how is it that
you were there and yet--

181
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,302
-Forgive me.

182
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,303
It was my fault.

183
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,640
I made an error
in the formation.

184
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:27,208
{\an1}I realized that I should have
kept him right beside me.

185
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,648
{\an1}-Ah, Iruka, how are
your wounds healing?

186
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,949
{\an1}Are you doing all right?

187
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,484
-Yes.

188
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,352
{\an1}It's a minor injury.

189
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,755
{\an1}But thank you for
your concern, sir.

190
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,225
{\an1}-I'm aware that you worked
very hard on your mission.

191
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:47,127
{\an1}I want you to take some time
off to recuperate and regain

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,596
your strength.

193
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,233
{\an1}-Lord Hokage, I was responsible
for the incident that occurred.

194
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,603
Our unit leader
did nothing wrong.

195
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:58,205
{\an1}-I fully understand
the situation already.

196
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,474
{\an1}You don't need to
explain it to me.

197
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:01,575
-Sir.

198
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,878
{\an1}-Iruka, you've always
been a kind person,

199
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,847
{\an1}one who possesses
great compassion,

200
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,014
and that is an
admirable quality.

201
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,784
{\an1}But I believe your
kindness proved detrimental

202
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:14,221
{\an1}in a crucial moment
against an enemy ninja.

203
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:17,557
{\an1}There may come a time when that
compassionate nature of yours

204
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:20,160
{\an1}puts your comrades
lives in danger.

205
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:23,697
{\an1}-Yes, I was aware of that and I
thought I'd made the necessary

206
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,632
{\an1}adjustments but--

207
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,869
{\an1}-Well, what's done is done,
and cannot be changed now.

208
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,336
{\an1}But for your next mission--

209
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,003
-Lord Hokage.

210
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:31,505
-Hm?

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,812
{\an1}-Actually sir, I'd like to
speak to you about that.

212
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,579
-Go ahead.

213
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,481
{\an1}You may speak freely.

214
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,518
{\an1}-I'm not sure if you
remember this, Lord Hokage.

215
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,153
{\an1}But after I had lost my
parents, you spoke to me

216
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,089
{\an1}in front of the Stone
Monument of Heroes

217
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:52,090
{\an1}and you told me about
the Will of Fire.

218
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:55,026
{\an1}-Yes, of course, I
remember it well.

219
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,897
{\an1}-Everything changed after
we had that conversation.

220
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,199
{\an1}I could focus on training
and carrying out my duties.

221
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:04,302
{\an1}The lesson you taught me that
day about the Will of Fire--

222
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:07,006
{\an1}I'd like to pass it on to
the next generation of ninja,

223
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,707
{\an1}to help them out as well.

224
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,276
{\an1}-Let me make sure
that I've understood.

225
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:14,145
{\an1}You want to become an
instructor at the Academy?

226
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:17,815
{\an1}-Yes, if I may, sir.

227
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,751
{\an1}-Well then, starting
tomorrow, you

228
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,253
{\an1}shall be an assistant
instructor at the Academy.

229
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:23,021
-Seriously?

230
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:25,557
{\an1}You mean it, Lord Hokage?

231
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,860
-Your eyes had a
spark back then.

232
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:29,727
{\an1}Now they're lifeless.

233
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:35,365
{\an1}Perhaps you've forgotten
a basic rule of teaching--

234
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,168
{\an1}you cannot open the mind of
another unless you have an open

235
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,038
mind yourself.

236
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,441
{\an1}Or perhaps there's something
else you're trying to forget.

237
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:47,344
{\an1}-The Nine-Tails sealed
inside of Naruto

238
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:50,147
{\an1}is responsible for
my parents' deaths.

239
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,016
I'm fully aware
that Naruto is not

240
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,919
{\an1}to blame for what
occurred back then.

241
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,521
{\an1}But whenever I look
at him, I can't

242
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:00,424
{\an1}stop thinking about what's
hiding deep inside of him,

243
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,393
{\an1}and about what the
Nine-Tails did.

244
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:07,531
{\an1}I don't think someone like
me can make Naruto open up.

245
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:12,002
{\an1}-Actually, you are the only one
who can reach Naruto's heart.

246
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:16,873
{\an1}And that-- that is
your personal ordeal.

247
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,674
-My ordeal?

248
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,478
{\an1}-Yes, Lord Hokage has presented
you with a personal ordeal.

249
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,247
{\an1}I believe if you can just
hang in there a little longer,

250
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,717
{\an1}you will find the
way to reach Naruto.

251
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,253
{\an1}Rise up to meet the
Hokage's expectations.

252
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:31,988
So long.

253
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,002
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
The Third Hokage

254
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,469
{\an1}sure made a bold decision.

255
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:55,143
[laughter]

256
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,849
{\an1}WOMAN: Choji, time to go.

257
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,851
{\an1}MAN: Daichi, dinner time.

258
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,785
BOY: OK.

259
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:05,587
{\an1}WOMAN: Let's go home, everyone.

260
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,154
GIRL: Mom.

261
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:10,825
{\an1}-What do you think you're doing?

262
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,994
{\an1}I told you not to
play with that boy.

263
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,663
{\an1}-Come on, let's go.

264
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,202
{\an1}SHIKAKU: Shikamaru,
come on, let's go.

265
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,303
-All right, dad.

266
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,075
-You too, Choji.

267
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,308
{\an1}We said we'd walk you home.

268
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,543
{\an1}Now let's go, you two.

269
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:30,244
Let's move.

270
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,346
{\an1}-See you, Naruto.

271
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,347
-Later.

272
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,815
-Yeah, bye.

273
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,591
{\an1}-Dad, let go of my hand.

274
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,826
[chuckle]

275
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:46,994
-What?

276
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:48,595
{\an1}Are you embarrassed to be
seen with your old man?

277
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:29,836
-Hmph.

278
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,338
{\an1}Thank you for the food.

279
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,804
-No, let me go.

280
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:42,106
{\an1}My mom and dad are still
fighting back there!

281
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,863

-Whoa.

286
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,212
{\an1}Who's that at my door?

287
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,979
{\an1}And why are they here so early?

288
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:39,061
What?

289
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,996
Iruka-sensei?

290
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,496
{\an1}Why is he coming to see me here?

[doorbell]

00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,454

[door opens]

294
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,291
-Huh?

295
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,560
{\an1}Naruto, you here?

296
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,969
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): Is
this all he ever eats?

297
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,675
{\an1}-Thanks for the food.

298
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,610
{\an1}-You're going to Choji's
later, aren't you?

299
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:31,711
Better hurry.

300
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:33,613
-Yeah, yeah.

301
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,582
{\an1}Hey dad, can I ask
you about something

302
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,883
{\an1}that's been bugging me?

303
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,218
-What is it?

304
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,686
{\an1}-It's about Naruto.

305
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,990
{\an1}Why does everybody avoid
him like the plague?

306
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,325
{\an1}Did he do something wrong?

307
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,798
{\an1}-Shikamaru, why don't you tell
me how you feel about Naruto.

308
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:55,501
-Uh, you want to
know how I feel?

309
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,172
{\an1}Huh, I never thought
about it before.

310
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,174
{\an1}Well, he's not the sharpest
knife in the drawer,

311
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,708
{\an1}but he's pretty funny.

312
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,910
{\an1}I don't think we'll ever
be buddies or anything,

313
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,180
{\an1}but it's not like I
want to avoid him.

314
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,417
{\an1}-Well then, ignore the others.

315
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,018
I say treat him
however you want to.

316
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,254
-Yeah, that's
exactly what I'll do.

317
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,968
{\an1}-I have so much free time
since I quit the Academy.

318
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,467
Hm?

319
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,142
{\an1}What do you guys want?

320
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,077
-Hey, isn't that
Naruto down there?

321
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,778
-Huh?

322
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,482
{\an1}-Naruto, we all decided that you
can join our group if you want.

323
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,049
-Huh?

324
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,452
Are you serious?

325
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,419
-Of course.

326
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,853
But there's just
one thing you have

327
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,122
{\an1}to do before you can
hang out with us.

328
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:51,689
-Oh yeah?

329
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,490
{\an1}And what is that?

330
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,160
{\an1}-Yesterday, my dad's patrol
unit had a fight with some enemy

331
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,162
{\an1}ninja in the back
hills, and he said

332
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,831
{\an1}they left the corpses out there.

333
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,900
{\an1}If you can bring back something
from one of those corpses,

334
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,801
{\an1}then we'll let you
join our group.

335
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:05,903
-For real?

336
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:06,938
-Yeah.

337
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:07,904
-All right then.

338
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,340
I'll bring back
something for sure.

339
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,409
{\an1}You can count on it.

340
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,909
-What a loser.

341
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,878
{\an1}-Boy, is he in for a surprise.

342
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,114
{\an1}Dad said the enemy might
still be out there.

343
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,449
-That's so mean.

344
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,183
{\an1}You still mad about
how he scared you

345
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,386
{\an1}in the test of courage?

346
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,386
{\an1}-Never mind that.

347
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,354
Did you see the
smile on his face?

348
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,490
{\an1}He doesn't have a clue
this is all a trick.

349
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:33,497
{\an1}-All right, guys.

350
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,298
{\an1}Has anyone seen Naruto?

351
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,434
{\an1}-Nope, haven't seen him.

352
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,769
{\an1}-I saw him this morning
heading into the back hills.

353
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:40,903
{\an1}-Pipe down, Shikamaru.

354
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,506
{\an1}-What are you doing?

355
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,274
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
Into the back hills?

356
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:48,611
{\an1}-He went looking for
corpses, didn't he, Hibachi?

357
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,481
{\an1}Your pranks have gotten
annoying and so have you.

358
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,015
{\an1}-Stay here and study.

359
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:53,682
-What?

360
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,451
{\an1}-What's going on?

361
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,051
-I don't know.

362
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:55,818
-What is it?

363
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,962
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Finally, I'm going

364
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,331
{\an1}to have friends just
like everybody else.

365
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:35,190
[theme music]

366
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:45,200
[theme music]

367
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,837
{\an1}WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Iruka-sensei,
did you hear the news?

368
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,474
{\an1}There was a battle in the
forest in the back hills.

369
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,575
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): A battle?

370
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:03,909
{\an1}WOMAN (VOICEOVER): A
patrol unit discovered

371
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:05,311
{\an1}a group of enemy spies.

372
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:08,046
{\an1}They were able to kill one of
them and bring the body back.

373
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,981
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER):
If that's the case,

374
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,618
{\an1}we can't let the students
go near that area.

375
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,686
{\an1}There might still be
spies hiding out there.

376
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,458
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time
on Naruto Shippuden-- Iruka's

377
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:21,725
Decision.

378
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,629
{\an1}IRUKA (VOICEOVER): I hope
nothing's happened to him.
