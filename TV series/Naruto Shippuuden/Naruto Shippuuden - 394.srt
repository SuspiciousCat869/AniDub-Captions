What did Lord
Jiraya tell you?

00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:04,979
{\an1}Seems the training's
going well.

has seriously grown! And
after only 2 years of training!

11
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:41,635
{\an1}Perhaps it's about time that
that we took things to the next
level...

12
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,304
To the next level?

13
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,604
{\an1}Yep!

14
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,072
What're we
gonna do?

15
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:51,441
{\an1}I think perhaps the time
has come for you to
utilize your inner power.

16
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:52,876
Wait, you mean...?

17
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,779
{\an1}Mhm. You might have to
put your life on the line
for this training.

18
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,881
All right. I'm
ready. Bring it on!

19
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:11,121
{\an1}Can't believe it's
been two years already.

20

{\an1}Now the day that kid
returns home to the

stop now, then Naruto is just
going to laugh at you!

{\an1}Everyone always seems to keep
Naruto in their thoughts while
they're training!

32
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,916
Looks like we've
got a message.

33
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,053
{\an1}Where's it from?

34
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,887
Lord Kazegake!

35
00:03:54,921 --> 00:04:00,524
{\an1}A Shinobi Hawk has  just deliv-
ered a missive to you from the
Hidden Leaf's Fifth Hokage, sir.

36
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:53,763
Hm.

37
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:58,966
{\an1}'Bout time. I was
getting tired
of waiting.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,469
{\an1}Look who they sent
for our welcome. Thanks
for meeting us.

39
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:08,039
{\an1}Heh heh. Well, it is
a drag, but seeing as
it's Lord Kazekage...

40
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,374
Welcome to
the Leaf.

41
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:24,648
{\an1}Here's the data from
the Chunin Exams two
years ago.

42
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:30,120
{\an1}One hundred fifty three
entrants total. Information
about their villages,

43
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:34,756
{\an1}<i>the three rounds of exams, and</i>
<i>the qualifying stats have been</i>
<i>compiled for easy reading.</i>

44
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:40,359
{\an4}But you'd know more about the
reason behind the interruption
of the finalrounds and the
chronology.

45
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:45,062
{\an1}Ahem. Because of the suspension
of the previous Chunin Exams,

46
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:49,531
{\an1}the Leaf would like to sponsor a
brand new combined Chunin Exams.

47
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,869
{\an1}Thanks in part to the Leaf's
help, the situation in the
Sand has stabilized since then.

48
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:59,272
{\an1}In particular, our training
curriculum has now become
very successful.

49
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:02,640
{\an1}We have more genin qualified
to take the Chunin Exams.

50
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,309
{\an1}Then you have no objection
to us sponsoring an event?

51
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,246
{\an1}Lady Hokage... first, what's
your true motive here?

52
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,748
{\an1}My "true motive?"

53
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:19,951
{\an1}The timing of this
whole thing, why hold
the Chunin Exams now?

54
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,686
{\an1}If it's a personnel
shortage, you still
could've done this sooner.

55
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:30,191
{\an8}All right, then.
I'll be honest
with you.

56
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:37,029
{\an1}First, its to gauge the response
of each of the villages in the
Five Great Nations...

57
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:41,665
{\an1}On the surface they seem
to be at peace, and yet...

58
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:47,035
{\an1}Their response to holding
the combined Chunin Exams
will reveal their true feelings.

59
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,105
{\an1}And the second reason is
to probe the movements
of the Akatsuki.

60
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:55,107
{\an1}Our intel says that they're
seeking the Tailed Beasts
from each village,

61
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,142
{\an1}but they've been awfully
quiet for these past 2 years

62
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:03,579
{\an1}you want to open the
Village and use the Chunin
Exams as some kind of bait?

63
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:06,448
{\an1}you want to attempt to
lure the Akatsuki out?

64
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,215
That's right.

65
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:13,618
{\an1}I'm betting the Akatsuki have
grown impatient and are getting
ready to make a move soon.

66
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,458
{\an1}That is a risky
proposition...

67
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,758
Hold on.

68
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,664
{\an1}The Sand would like to host
these Chunin Exams alongside my
introduction as Kazekage.

69
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:33,998
{\an1}[gasp]

70
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,567
{\an1}Hm.

71
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,434
{\an1}That will not do.

72
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:42,437
The Hidden Leaf must be
the one to sponsor
these Chunin Exams

73
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,406
so we may finish what
we previously started.

74
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:48,174
{\an1}Absolutely.

75
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:52,110
{\an1}Lord Kazekage cannot decide
this all by himself, of
course.

76
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:54,445
{\an1}He must talk with
the village advisors.

77
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:58,582
{\an1}That's right. So we're going to
need some time to contact them.

78
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:02,584
{\an7}Let's come back to this.
We'll discuss it again
at the next meeting.

79
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:10,721
All right. We'll
settle this during
the next meeting, then.

80
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,195
{\an1}This whole thing has
become a real drag.

81
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,965
{\an1}Yeah. I didn't expect
Gaara to make an
announcement like that.

82
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,501
{\an1}He really didn't tell
you anything at all?

83
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,502
No, it came out
of nowhere!

84
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:35,338
{\an1}Well, Gaara has his own
ideas about the way
things should be done.

85
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,612
<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>I leave it to you.</i>

86
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:49,313
{\an1}If the Hokage's right and
the Akatsuki make a move,

87
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,515
you know you're going to
be their target!

88
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:56,017
{\an1}If the enemy wants Tailed
Beasts, they'll come for
me sooner or later.

89
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,686
{\an1}So I'll simply act as
bait and just take
them down.

90
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,922
{\an1}What are you saying!?
The Village welcomed
you as their new Kazekage

91
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:06,857
{\an1}...but things are
still unstable!

92
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,326
{\an1}I am aware.

93
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,029
{\an1}I know some aren't
happy that I've
become Kazegake.

94
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:19,432
{\an1}And I have no doubt there
are those who would welcome
an opportunity to kill me...

95
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,934
{\an1}Then why'd you even
consider hosting the
event?

96
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:26,203
{\an1}That's why I want the
Chunin Exams in the Sand.

97
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,771
{\an1}You must be joking!

98
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:34,808
{\an1}You don't want the Akatsuki,
you want to lure out the
conspirators in our village!

99
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,178
That's way too
dangerous, Gaara.

100
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,055
{\an7}In regards to the combined
Chunin Exams,

101
00:10:55,088 --> 00:11:00,258
{\an1}it's Lord Kazekage's wish
that we host the event
in the Hidden Sand Village.

102
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:05,128
{\an1}And he also intends to introduce
himself as Kazekage to the other
nations.

103
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,629
Is that a
wise choice?

104
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,764
{\an1}Though things have been
quiet for a while now,

105
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,800
{\an1}it doesn't change the fact that
Gaara's a military weapon to be
feared.

106
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:20,271
{\an1}To be honest, as long as Gaara
continues to live, this village
can never  truly be at peace.

107
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:25,007
{\an1}For the second round
of the Chunin Exams

108
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:29,977
{\an1}Lord Gaara intends
to offer up the Demon Desert
as a suitable arena.

109
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,515
{\an1}And we, the Hidden Sand,
will do our utmost to
support him!

110
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,588
{\an1}I'm sure that Yuura
is onto us by now.

111
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,256
No, everyone's
just uneasy about
Gaara.

112
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,992
{\an1}Still, that isn't enough to
build a coup d'état around,
and I--

113
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:59,129
{\an1}Well now, if it isn't my
seniors. Of all the places
to find you three.

114
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,730
What do you want now?

115
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:05,434
All of us have already
agreed to give our support
to Lord Gaara's plan.

116
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:09,302
{\an1}It's nothing, really.
I just forgot to tell you.

117
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:13,672
{\an1}Lord Gaara plans to
personally supervise
the exam site.

118
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:17,040
{\an1}We'll have to be very
careful with our
preparations.

119
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:22,511
{\an1}The second round is a survival
test, and--- there are always
some fatalities.

120
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:30,617
{\an4}So who's to say that nothing
will happen to the supervisor
himself, our Kazekage, Lord
Gaara.

121
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,385
{\an1}Now, if you'll
excuse me...

122
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:41,657
{\an1}This is the perfect opportunity
to get rid of the Kazekage

123
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,057
and make it look like
it was an accident...

124
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:47,059
But... he is a
Jinchuriki.

125
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,960
{\an1}There's a way.

126
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:53,732
{\an1}The first Jinchuriki, Sir
Bunpuku, was able to temporarily
seal Shukaku in a teapot.

127
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:59,201
{\an1}Maybe we can use that.

128
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:02,103
What's your decision,
Lady Tsunade?

129
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,271
Hm...

130
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:10,375
{\an1}<i>...Two years ago, Jiraya's intel</i>
<i>said the Akatsuki would target</i>
<i>Naruto in three of four years.</i>

131
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:15,177
{\an1}<i>We tried to learn their plans</i>
<i>with no success. It's now</i>
<i>two years later.</i>

132
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,681
{\an1}I'm fully convinced that by
this time, they're practically
itching to make a move.

133
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:23,316
You're not thinking
of using Naruto as bait!?

134
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:27,519
{\an7}No, as Fifth Hokage of
the Hidden Leaf, I could
never do that.

135
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:33,156
{\an7}You mean, Lord Gaara
will assume that role?

136
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,891
{\an1}As luck would have
it, he's the one
who proposed it.

137
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,360
But... will the
advisors agree
to that?!

138
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:44,030
{\an1}Well, I'll just have to
placate them by suggesting
a joint sponsorship.

139
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,298
{\an1}We can't negotiate
any further.

140
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:54,703
{\an5}(Tsunade)
I reviewed the plans
that you submitted,
Lord Kazekage.

141
00:13:54,736 --> 00:14:00,640
{\an1}What do you think about the idea
of a joint sponsorship with the
Hidden Leaf?

142
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,543
{\an1}We'll hold round one,
the written exam, in
the Leaf Village...

143
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:09,680
{\an1}...and the Hidden Sand will host
the site of the second round,
the survival test.

144
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:18,151
{\an8}The Forest of Death
really has become too
familiar as a test site.

145
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:21,920
{\an8}I was just thinking
recently that a new
site would be needed.

146
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:24,488
{\an1}I agree as well.

147
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:33,561
{\an1}We've no objections
to that proposal.

148
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:41,899
{\an1}All right, then. I guess we'll
see you again at the Chunin
exams.

149
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,535
Yeah...

150
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:49,404
{\an1}Just let us know if any
trouble arises, all right?
We'll handle it, Mr. Crybaby.

151
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:57,343
Heh, she hasn't
changed a bit.

152
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,780
The Hidden Sound
probably won't take
part this time around.

153
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:08,149
{\an1}Should we just send out
invitations to everyone else who
attended the last Chunin Exams?

154
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:16,321
{\an4}Send invitations for
the introduction of the new
Kazekage to every village in the
Five Great Nations.

155
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:20,057
I see. That way we
can monitor each
village's response.

156
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:23,293
{\an1}That's right. In addition
to the Akatsuki problem,

157
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:26,928
{\an1}that's the other reason for
reopening the combined Chunin
Exams.

158
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,230
{\an1}Okay. I
understand, M'Lady.

159
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,808
{\an1}These invites are for the
Chunin Exams. Go and
deliver them to every Village.

160
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:47,708
(Anbu Ops)
Yes ma'am.

161
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,015
Well, we've set
out the bait...

162
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:05,553
{\an1}<i>Now we just have to wait and</i>
<i>see how they react to it.</i>

163
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:33,438
Lady Tsunade! The
Hidden Sand send their
reply right away.

164
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:39,007
{\an1}Ah, they'll be sending
nine teams, twenty-seven
genin in total.

165
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,109
Last time they
sent thirty in
ten teams...

166
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:47,045
{\an1}It may be one team fewer, but
considering the Sand's current
situation,

167
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,014
{\an1}one has to commend them
for nurturing this many genin.

168
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,449
Right...

169
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:55,252
{\an1}Oh, and- Any word from
the other villages that
we sent invitations to?

170
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,786
No, not yet.

171
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,688
I wonder how the
other Kage will
respond to all this.

172
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:07,259
<i>(Raikage Ay)</i>
<i>What!? Chunin Exams!?</i>

173
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,761
{\an1}Damn Princess Tsunade!
She's getting carried away!

174
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:17,232
{\an4}She probably coaxed the Kazekage
into cooperating and plans to
get the jump on us within the
Five Great Nations.

175
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,367
{\an1}What should we do?

176
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,335
{\an1}Ignore her, that's
what! We'll just
ignore her!

177
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:28,740
{\an1}And don't mention this, or
the past to anyone! Especially
Bee! He can't find out!

178
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,341
{\an1}Whenever an event like this
is getting planned,

179
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,310
{\an1}he gets worked up about live
concerts and other nonsense.

180
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:38,646
Actually, I kinda
already told him.

181
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,613
{\an1}What!?

182
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:42,882
Well, he kept asking
questions... Sorry sir.

183
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:47,652
Bee! Where are
you, Bee!?

184
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:53,021
{\an1}Don't tell me that
he... Find Bee immediately
and bring him here to me!

185
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,356
Understood, sir!

186
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,391
{\an1}This is so dull...

187
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,794
{\an1}Gonna have a concert at the
Hidden Leaf Village, yo!

188
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:05,029
{\an1}Turning up at the Chunin
Exams, showin' what I know!

189
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:10,966
{\an1}And I'll take a lesson
from Kinchan Sensei, too!
That one's fo' sho'! Yeahhh!

190
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,869
{\an1}Lord Bee! Lord Raikage
wants to see you.
Please return!

191
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:17,637
What!? No way,
fool, ya fool!

192
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,842
Did Lord Raikage
say no?

193
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,778
{\an1}He said that unfortunately
they're swamped with Village
business,

194
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:35,315
{\an1}so they don't have
enough time to prepare now.

195
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:40,051
{\an1}Now why would the Hokage
and the Kazekage send
a message?

196
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:49,257
{\an4}Well, it appears they are
looking to resume the Chunin
Exams. What shall we do about
it?

197
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,294
{\an4}There's still the matter of Lord
Fourth Yagura. I think we should
focus on rebuilding the village
now.

198
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:58,497
{\an1}You very well may have
a point, there.

199
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,733
{\an1}Yes, that's right. A
ceremony for the Kazekage
is only a waste of our time!

200
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:10,238
{\an8}<i>A wedding ceremony....</i>
<i>is... a waste of time!?</i>

201
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:15,107
Shut up, or die.

202
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,008
{\an3}What!?

203
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:22,178
{\an1}Perhaps it would be best
if we forego the Chunin
Exams this time.

204
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:25,480
Yes, let's
do that!

205
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:31,518
{\an1}It seems that the Hidden
Mist Village is currently
tied up as well.

206
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:41,725
Listen, we have just
received an invitation
from the Hidden Leaf Village

207
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:44,793
{\an1}to attend the new
combined chunin exams.

208
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,261
Hmm.

209
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:48,862
{\an1}Their ulterior motive's
crystal clear!

210
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,364
{\an1}They're looking to test the
strength of the villages

211
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,466
{\an1}in  preparation for the next
battle that erupts between them!

212
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:58,701
{\an1}I say we just throw it
right back in their face!

213
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:01,069
Yes, I intend
to do so!

214
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,905
[pleased grunts]

215
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:07,941
I'll give you my
answer, right here!

216
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:13,645
Ahhhhhhh!
My Back!!

217
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,089
I want you
to go here.

218
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,391
To the Hidden
Rain Village?

219
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:38,460
{\an1}Yes, to that most
troublesome spot.

220
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:44,765
{\an1}Every person who enters the
village is checked & kept under
surveillance during their stay.

221
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:46,832
{\an1}It's said Hanzo of
the Salamander,

222
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:51,101
{\an1}whom even blood relatives can't
approach,  rules with an iron
fist.

223
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:53,003
Yes, so I've heard.

224
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:56,104
Even if I'm carrying an
invitation to the
combined Chunin Exams,

225
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:59,206
I doubt if they'll
let me in easily.

226
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,510
{\an1}That place remains unstable.
There are rumors of a coup
d'état.

227
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,912
{\an1}But since it's closed
off, no one knows the
true state of things.

228
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:11,281
While I'm there should
I also look into
their internal affairs?

229
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:15,051
{\an1}Yes, but don't take
any chances.

230
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,283
