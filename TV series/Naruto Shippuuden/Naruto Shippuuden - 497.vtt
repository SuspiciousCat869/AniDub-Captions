(Birds Chirping)

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:09.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
Welcome to the Leaf!

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's been a while Lord Sixth.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:19.473 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry I'm late. Have all the
other Kage made it to the
village already?

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:22.610 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, almost all of them, yes,
but they've just gotten here.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:25.747 position:35% line:89% align:start
6th Hokage

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.180 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where's the Mizukage?

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:31.753 position:7% line:77% align:start
(SHIZUNE) Due to the inclement
weather she and her entourage
encountered en route,

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:33.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
(SHIZUNE) they're running about
a half a day behind.

00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.026 position:7% line:77% align:start
(KAKASHI) While you're here,
please relax and enjoy what our
village has to offer.

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
(KAKASHI) I've assigned Hidden
Leaf Shinobi to escort you.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:45.700 position:7% line:77% align:start
Oh, by the way, Lord Sixth. I
understand that Naruto's going
to marry soon.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.702 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. So you've heard,
huh?

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:52.472 position:10% line:77% align:start
I've prepared a wedding gift
from the Hidden Stone that I'd
like to have delivered to him.

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:55.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
May I ask you to present it at
the wedding ceremony?

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.082 position:7% line:77% align:start
And the Hidden Cloud is also
going to be sending him a gift.
So I ask you the same.

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:04.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
(KAKASHI) I understand. I'm sure
Naruto will be very happy.

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:07.722 position:10% line:83% align:start
Naruto's... getting married,
huh...

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:12.426 position:5% line:77% align:start
"Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect
Day for a Wedding, Part 4: The
Kazekage's Wedding Gift"

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.830 position:16% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) We didn't hear
anything about Naruto getting
married!

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:19.967 position:10% line:77% align:start
Temari, you were here just a
little while ago! You must've
heard about it!

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.769 position:61% line:83% align:start
Y-Yeah...

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:23.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
(KANKURO) Why didn't you tell
us?!

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.271 position:30% line:89% align:start
(embarrassed)

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.709 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just shut up! I forgot, okay?!

00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:29.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's come over you...?!

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.813 position:7% line:89% align:start
Y- You're being kinda scary...

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:36.084 position:10% line:77% align:start
In any case, we'll definitely
need to prepare a wedding
gift from the Sand...

00:03:36.117 --> 00:03:39.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since it's from the Kazekage, it
should be extravagant.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:43.256 position:5% line:83% align:start
Extravagant? Do you really think
Naruto would like that?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.960 position:13% line:77% align:start
What, do you think that he
wouldn't like something
extravagant?

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:52.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
(cheering, for the happy couple)

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.602 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, when you put it that
way...

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
(LEE) Gaara! It has been a long
time!

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.740 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why yes, it certainly-

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:01.843 position:5% line:77% align:start
We are here to take you wherever
you want to go in the Leaf
Village

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:05.012 position:21% line:83% align:start
until Lady Mizukage
arrives here for the Summit!

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:09.217 position:10% line:77% align:start
Hey! Lee! Don't forget that
Gaara's here for the Five Kage
Summit too.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.588 position:5% line:77% align:start
And we're here on official duty.
It's really not alright for you
to get too casual?

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:17.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, no... let's not stand on
ceremony. It's okay.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.726 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're happy to have you here.

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.362 position:7% line:77% align:start
Then tell me this... where is
the first place you would like
to go?

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:24.232 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let me see...

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
I want to find out what it is
Naruto likes.

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:30.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
You wanna know what Naruto
likes? Really?

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:35.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then... Ahh I know
the perfect place to take you!

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.811 position:21% line:89% align:start
(LEE) Let us go now!

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.147 position:13% line:83% align:start
(GAARA) Great. Are you two
coming?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
(KANKURO) Yeah, sure!

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:45.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm just gonna stay here and
relax for a bit.

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:49.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>It'd be so awkward if I ran into</i>
 <i>him...</i>

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's the matter, Temari? You
seem all irritated.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
Look! There's nothing going on
with me!

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
Would you guys just get going
already?!

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uhhh!

00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.299 position:30% line:5% align:start
RAMEN ICHIRAKU

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Hmmmm...

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:03.538 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmmm....

00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:04.705 position:21% line:89% align:start
(IRUKA) Hey, there!

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:05.405 position:44% line:5% align:start
Oh!

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.041 position:27% line:89% align:start
Iruka! Welcome!

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
A large miso char siu ramen,
please.

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:15.216 position:7% line:77% align:start
You got it! You know, it seems
like you've been coming around
more often than usual lately.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey now, don't be rude, Ayame!
He's a very important customer!

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.991 position:7% line:77% align:start
(laughter) So what's going on
with you, Teuchi? It seems like
something's troubling you.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.358 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, uh...

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:30.298 position:5% line:77% align:start
(TEUCHI) you know how everyone's
been in a tizzy over what to get
Naruto for his wedding...

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.900 position:24% line:83% align:start
(TEUCHI) I've been
thinking real hard about it too.

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:37.872 position:7% line:77% align:start
'Cause you see... I'd like to
give him something as well. So I
came up with this!

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.307 position:10% line:89% align:start
A gift card for free ramen?!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.908 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh... No... Hold on!

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:45.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
FREE RAMEN FOR ONE YEAR ICHIRAKU
GIFT CARD

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:50.184 position:7% line:77% align:start
I get it... Free ramen for an
entire year! I'm sure that'll
make him happy!

00:05:50.218 --> 00:05:55.223 position:5% line:77% align:start
But actually, now that I think
about it... I wonder if a whole
year is a good idea...

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:00.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slurping noodles)

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:05.432 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slurping noodles)

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:08.769 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slurping noodles)

00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:11.906 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slurping noodles)

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:21.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
(Ayame) Yeah, a year's too
long...

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.818 position:16% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Way too long...

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
FREE RAMEN FOR 6 MONTHS ICHIRAKU
GIFT CARD

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the same problem with half
a year...

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.257 position:7% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Yeah, you're right...

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:34.629 position:5% line:83% align:start
(LEE) I understand. You want to
give Naruto a wedding gift, too?

00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.964 position:10% line:83% align:start
(LEE) He will definitely be
overjoyed by that!

00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:40.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
You said "too." So do you have
your gift already?

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:41.468 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course!

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:42.203 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:46.040 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've never had to pick out a
wedding gift before.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.610 position:7% line:77% align:start
And I don't have the slightest
clue about what I should get
him.

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:54.682 position:16% line:77% align:start
Then you must begin by
considering just what a wedding
ceremony is in the first place!

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:55.448 position:24% line:89% align:start
(shocked, worried)

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:59.053 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(GUY) First of all, what is a</i>
 <i>wedding ceremony?</i>

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:02.422 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>(GUY) what is absolutely</i>
 <i>necessary for a wedding</i>
 <i>ceremony?</i>

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Uhh... Well, would it be</i>
 <i>love?</i>

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:07.628 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>I've got a bad feeling about</i>
 <i>this...</i>

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:13.000 position:10% line:77% align:start
"What's a wedding ceremony?"
Well... That's a very
philosophical question.

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:16.637 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yes, you are right! One way that
you can think about it is
this:...

00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.408 position:5% line:77% align:start
...what is it that is absolutely
necessary for a wedding
ceremony?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's absolutely necessary...?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:23.778 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huhhh...?

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, wouldn't that be love?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.881 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh nooo...

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:32.753 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes! That was the very same
answer that I gave, too!

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:36.657 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why is this happening the same
way it did before?!

00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:41.829 position:7% line:77% align:start
(LEE) However, Guy Sensei, my
mentor whom I greatly respect,
did not stop there.

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:46.334 position:5% line:77% align:start
(LEE) He realized that it is the
bride and groom who are most
important in a wedding.

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:48.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
(LEE) And if you put yourself
in their shoes,

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:52.506 position:7% line:83% align:start
(LEE) you would be able to see
what the best gift for them is.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
(LEE) Because of that...

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:57.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
I knew that the perfect gift to
get them would be dumbbells!

00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:00.114 position:19% line:89% align:start
You... got dumbbells?!

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:04.318 position:5% line:77% align:start
I am only a shinobi, so for me,
that is the most suitable
present.

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:07.855 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you are the Kazekage, so we
must consider your position.

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:12.393 position:5% line:77% align:start
So for the gift that you get, I
think extravagant barbells would
be the best!

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
B-Barbells, huh...?

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:19.233 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't know about the
"barbell" part...

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.736 position:13% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) But I agree that
Gaara's gift should be
extravagant!

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:23.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
(LEE) Hello!

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Welcome.

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
(LEE) Iruka Sensei!

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:28.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, hello there, Lee! So we meet
again! Ohh!

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:33.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, Gaara... this is Iruka
Sensei, Naruto's teacher.

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:36.017 position:7% line:83% align:start
Iruka Sensei, let me introduce
Gaara the Kazekage!

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.652 position:16% line:89% align:start
H-How do you do?

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:41.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
But why is Lord Kazekage with
the two of you guys?

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:44.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've both been assigned to show
him around the village

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:47.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
while he's waiting for the Five
Kage Summit to begin.

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:51.899 position:10% line:77% align:start
Gaara is also thinking about
what might be a good choice to
get Naruto for a wedding gift.

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:54.635 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because you see, Naruto and
Gaara are really good friends.

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:58.372 position:13% line:89% align:start
They're friends huh?! Hm.

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:01.342 position:7% line:83% align:start
Anyway, we're planning to send
him an extravagant gift

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
that's representative of the
Hidden Sand.

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:06.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I may say so, I'm very
grateful to you, Lord Kazekage,

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.883 position:10% line:83% align:start
for making such a tremendous
gesture...

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
...and I'm sure that Naruto will
be overjoyed, too.

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.522 position:10% line:89% align:start
And now... please excuse me.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:23.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
See? Naruto's gonna love
something extravagant!

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:25.900 position:7% line:83% align:start
His own teacher just confirmed
that for us!

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:27.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
Think so?

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
One thing's for sure about
Naruto loves flashy things!

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:34.375 position:19% line:77% align:start
There's no way that he
wouldn't be happy with
an extravagant gift.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:35.142 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:38.879 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe I'll be extravagant, too,
and give him free ramen for a
year!

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:39.747 position:58% line:83% align:start
No, father...

00:09:40.915 --> 00:09:42.883 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh... Okay...

00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:46.020 position:7% line:83% align:start
Pops, for me... one large miso
char siu ramen!

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:46.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
What is that?

00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:52.026 position:5% line:77% align:start
It is Naruto's favorite item on
the menu. It has an extravagant
helping of char sui.

00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:54.395 position:16% line:89% align:start
His ramen's extravagant?

00:09:55.564 --> 00:09:57.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then I will have that, as well.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.732 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right! Me, too!

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.471 position:7% line:77% align:start
Okay, then, Pops... four large
miso char siu ramen, one for
each of us, please!

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:08.843 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hold on a second! Make mine just
a regular without char siu. And
for the topping...

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:10.411 position:38% line:89% align:start
Topping?

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:12.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Naruto fish cake is number one!

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
(TEUCHI) Way back when, it used
to be the least popular.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:18.719 position:10% line:83% align:start
(TEUCHI) But nowadays, it's
Naruto fishcake, hands down.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:20.555 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's the kind of effect
Naruto's had!

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:25.059 position:10% line:77% align:start
(TENTEN) Then I'll have the
regular miso ramen with the
Naruto fishcake topping.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.129 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you would please add it to
mine, as well

00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:31.632 position:7% line:77% align:start
(TEUCHI) Coming right up! And
I'll give you an extravagant
helping of it! Ha Ha!

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:36.904 position:7% line:89% align:start
(KANKURO) Man, we ate so much!

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.039 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ok, where would you like to go
next, Gaara?

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:45.179 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hey, are you all right? It seems
like you've been lost in thought
for a really long time.

00:10:46.347 --> 00:10:50.050 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was thinking of what to give
Naruto as the Kazekage.

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:51.819 position:7% line:83% align:start
As the Kazekage?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.690 position:5% line:77% align:start
Kankuro wants to give something
extravagant, but that just feels
off to me.

00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:58.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see...

00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.561 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, c'mon now, Gaara...

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:04.331 position:7% line:77% align:start
(GAARA) But after hearing his
teacher and the ramen shop
owner, I'm convinced.

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.301 position:10% line:89% align:start
If it makes Naruto happy...

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.936 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that's more like it!

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:11.338 position:41% line:83% align:start
I will help in any
way I can too!

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:14.141 position:35% line:89% align:start
(ALL) Huh?

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:15.843 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:23.350 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yo! Hey there, all you Hidden
Sand and Leaf fam! You care to
take a guess who I am? Yeah!

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:24.519 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>What an awful rap...</i>

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.055 position:7% line:83% align:start
You are Lord Killer Bee, Lord
Raikage's bodyguard, right?

00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:30.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
Was no one assigned to accompany
you through the village?

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:34.663 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, yo, check it out, my chum.
I prefer my freedom.

00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:39.767 position:5% line:77% align:start
(KILLER BEE) My brother's at the
summit reception, but me, I
prefer a village exploration.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.771 position:13% line:77% align:start
By the way, Kazekage, you
planning on giving Naruto a
wedding gift,

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:44.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
you catch my drift?

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:46.508 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am. I intend to.

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:49.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
Roger that! Finding a gift is my
personal mission!

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's both do our best to make a
good decision! Yeah!

00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:56.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sounds like the Hidden Cloud
is really into this whole idea!

00:11:56.183 --> 00:12:00.321 position:5% line:77% align:start
Our gift's gonna be something to
marvel at! So listen well and
remember that!

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:04.058 position:10% line:5% align:start
 <i>(TENTEN) Seriously? Do you</i>
 <i>have  to talk in rap all the</i>
 <i>time?</i>

00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.861 position:7% line:77% align:start
(KILLER BEE) For the special
occasion, special decoration on
ten kegs from the Cloud,

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
(KILLER BEE) sake of which we're
proud!

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aw, yeah!

00:12:11.533 --> 00:12:15.836 position:5% line:77% align:start
KILLER BEE) What's more, here's
the score: Hidden Cloud beef of
super high-quality.

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:17.838 position:7% line:77% align:start
(KILLER BEE) We'll present it
roasted whole, in its entirety,
yeah!

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.574 position:41% line:5% align:start
(moo)
Yeah!

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
(KILLER BEE) Plus, some premium
games, the best of the best!

00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:25.412 position:7% line:83% align:start
(KILLER BEE) Count 'em up: ten
great games, no more, no less.

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:30.451 position:13% line:77% align:start
That's my presentation! A
wedding's an important
celebration! Yeah!

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:31.720 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was amazing!

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.624 position:13% line:77% align:start
I didn't catch the details
because your rap made it
difficult to understand,

00:12:35.657 --> 00:12:38.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I did get that it's gonna be
very extravagant!

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.663 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yo, check it!  So what's the
Hidden Sand up to, then?

00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:45.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatcha gonna get?  Where's it
at? You already ordered it yet?

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Sigh) That's just it.

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:51.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, okay! I apologize! I guess
I should a realized!

00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:56.076 position:7% line:77% align:start
Our gift's so extravagant that
it's made you hesitant. But
that's not what's important.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.077 position:64% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:58.747 --> 00:13:00.981 position:7% line:77% align:start
(KILLER BEE) No biggie if it's
not fancy. What's from the heart
is the best choice.

00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
(KILLER BEE) It'll make
Naruto rejoice, yeah!

00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:06.320 position:10% line:89% align:start
Enough! Don't patronize us!

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:07.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
(GAARA) K- Kankuro?!

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:12.293 position:7% line:77% align:start
The gift that we're gonna give
will rival the Hidden Cloud's,
and that is that!

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:16.631 position:13% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) We'll cover the
reception hall with flowers
grown in the Hidden Sand!

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:18.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
(KANKURO) As the highlight of
the celebration dinner,

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:22.637 position:5% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) we'll send the finest
tuna in the land, a whole
bluefin!

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:27.141 position:10% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) And we'll prepare
enormous boxes of sweets as
wedding favors for every guest!

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:29.711 position:10% line:89% align:start
You feeling me, Killer Bee?!

00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:31.345 position:10% line:89% align:start
(GAARA) Wait, I never said-

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:36.250 position:5% line:77% align:start
Incredible! And you came up with
all of those amazing ideas in
such a short time!

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:38.118 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, but... we didn't decide-

00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:39.654 position:21% line:89% align:start
(KILLER BEE) Ahhhhh!

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:43.090 position:16% line:77% align:start
I forgot something real
important about the
entertainment!

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's not good,
fool, ya fool.

00:13:44.793 --> 00:13:48.028 position:16% line:77% align:start
(KILLER BEE) In this
circumstance, my brother just
might perchance...

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:49.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
...do the "Hidden Cloud Dance!"

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.298 position:21% line:89% align:start
(KILLER BEE) Yeah!

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Raikage...

00:13:53.334 --> 00:13:55.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
...will do the Hidden Cloud
Dance?! Really?!

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.772 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, no, no! No way! No way!

00:13:57.806 --> 00:14:02.811 position:5% line:77% align:start
So now you get the drift! You'll
see how the party will get a
lift! Yeah!

00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:04.345 position:24% line:89% align:start
(KANKURO) Uhhh...

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.382 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ahhh... This is bad! At this
rate...

00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:10.150 position:19% line:89% align:start
...Gaara's gonna lose!

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:13.253 position:10% line:77% align:start
But you guys, giving a gift
shouldn't be about winning or
losing.

00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:14.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
A dance...

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:16.423 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:20.160 position:13% line:77% align:start
(KANKURO) To show up the
Raikage, you're just gonna have
to dance, too, Gaara!

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:22.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, that is right! It is truly
the only way!

00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:29.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
(KAKASHI) The Mizukage should be
arriving soon.

00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:32.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then we'd better call the
Kazekage back here.

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:35.810 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lord Kakashi...

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:37.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, drop the "lord" part...

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:42.550 position:7% line:77% align:start
We just received a request to
adjust the length of time that
was allotted

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:45.587 position:7% line:83% align:start
to entertainment at Naruto and
Hinata's wedding ceremony.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.087 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? What was that?

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.593 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wasn't even aware there would
be entertainment at the wedding
ceremony?! Who asked?

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:54.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was... Lord Raikage's
bodyguard...

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:55.597 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, what?!

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:00.602 position:7% line:77% align:start
I cannot believe he said that
the Raikage is going to do the
"Hidden Cloud Dance..."

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:03.904 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, then...  Gaara will
just do the "Hidden Sand Samba!"

00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:06.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, my! This just keeps getting
more exciting.

00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:09.977 position:10% line:83% align:start
Stop messing around. I can't
dance at all.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, doing so won't make
Naruto happy.

00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:16.984 position:5% line:77% align:start
Actually, I think that he might
take the initiative and join in
on his own...

00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:19.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait, what?! Really?! (Gulp)

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:23.457 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes... You're right...

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.293 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, you're the Kazekage! I
mean, come on!

00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:27.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really shouldn't be dancing
in front of everyone!

00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:30.497 position:16% line:83% align:start
But he told us that the
Raikage's gonna dance!

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:38.606 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Raikage's wedding gift of
dance is a total must-see...

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
Miss this chance, and behind the
times you'll be! Yeah!

00:15:43.778 --> 00:15:44.913 position:21% line:89% align:start
(RAIKAGE) That fool!

00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:50.984 position:7% line:77% align:start
Hokage, I must beg your pardon
in advance if I make a scene
here...

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:54.087 position:7% line:5% align:start
You know... Actually, I doubt
there will be a need for you to
intervene.

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:54.756 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmmm?

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:58.125 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Raikage's wedding gift of
dance is a total must-see...

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:01.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
Miss this chance, and behind the
times you'll be, yeah!

00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:04.131 position:16% line:83% align:start
(MIZUKAGE) Wedding...
Behind the times?

00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:07.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're done for.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:08.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ohhhh!!!

00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:12.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
(frightened yell)

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:16.711 position:10% line:83% align:start
And now I call the Five Kage
Summit to order.

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:24.051 position:19% line:89% align:start
But before we begin...

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:27.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
Regarding Naruto Uzumaki and
Hinata Hyuga's gifts...

00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:31.826 position:10% line:77% align:start
(KAKASHI) ...I'd like to ask
that you use your good sense and
keep things in moderation.

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.127 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sigh)

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.965 position:5% line:83% align:start
(KAKASHI) All right! Now, let's
move on to our agenda!

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.639 position:10% line:89% align:start
(kids laughing and playing)

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:45.907 position:19% line:89% align:start
(SHIKAMARU) Uh, hey...

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.808 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!?

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:49.978 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ahh... Hmm...

00:16:51.813 --> 00:16:55.115 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, I'm sorry about last time.

00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:56.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, I... Me, too.

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:59.687 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wanna grab a bite?

00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:03.390 position:38% line:89% align:start
(Groan)

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:07.361 position:16% line:89% align:start
(TEMARI) Sure, why not.

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:09.531 position:38% line:5% align:start
Leaf Inn

00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:10.865 position:10% line:5% align:start
Reserved for a Special Event
Today

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.010 position:44% line:5% align:start
âªâªâª

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:29.717 position:44% line:5% align:start
âªâªâª

00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:33.721 position:10% line:77% align:start
(TEUCHI) Lord Kazekage! So,
you're still in the village,
huh?

00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:38.826 position:13% line:77% align:start
The summit ran longer than
expected. So, I decided that I'd
stay the night.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.195 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm grateful that you've
chosen our ramen for dinner!

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:46.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know... I've never had
something so good.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:49.003 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm very honored Lord Kazekage

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:52.874 position:10% line:77% align:start
Oh, and by the way, I heard
about what Lord Hokage said to
everyone

00:17:52.907 --> 00:17:56.010 position:7% line:83% align:start
about the gifts for Naruto and
Hinata's wedding...

00:17:56.044 --> 00:18:00.048 position:10% line:83% align:start
As expected. We may have let
things out of control.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.450 position:10% line:83% align:start
(GAARA) I'm sure everyone's
feeling remorseful now.

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.121 position:16% line:89% align:start
Even I got caught up...

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:11.491 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I kinda went overboard, too.
I apologize.

00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:13.093 position:19% line:89% align:start
don't worry about it.

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:15.095 position:10% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Oh, Iruka! Welcome!

00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:22.503 position:10% line:77% align:start
Lord Kazekage... I overheard
what you said just now. And I
want to apologize, too.

00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:24.137 position:7% line:89% align:start
Naruto's teacher shouldn't...

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:27.008 position:10% line:89% align:start
When I met you last time...

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:30.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I may say so, I'm very
grateful to you, Lord Kazekage,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.379 position:24% line:83% align:start
for making such a
tremendous gesture...

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:34.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
...and I'm sure that Naruto will
be overjoyed, too.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:38.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think that I'm at fault as
well. 'cause I said that.

00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:41.756 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for my part in all
this.

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:44.626 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's nothing to be sorry
about!

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:49.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know... I'm feeling
extremely happy right now.

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.666 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've learned that Naruto has
wonderful friends

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:55.770 position:7% line:77% align:start
and that they'll go above and
beyond in order to celebrate
him.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:57.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
Friends, Huh? Well...

00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:00.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much, Lord Gaara.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.442 position:7% line:83% align:start
No, I would like to thank you
too.

00:19:02.744 --> 00:19:03.176 position:10% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:07.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was confused, but you've
cleared things up.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.150 position:10% line:83% align:start
I got carried away thinking
about appearances

00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:13.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I ended up forgetting what's
really important.

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:15.123 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't get it. What do you
mean?

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:21.129 position:21% line:77% align:start
(chuckle) I'm going
to honor Naruto not as Kazekage,
but as a friend.

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.397 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would that be all right?

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:24.666 position:30% line:89% align:start
(taken aback)

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, it's perfect.

00:19:28.503 --> 00:19:31.338 position:10% line:83% align:start
(TEUCHI) Large miso char siu
with Naruto fishcake topping!

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
(GAARA) Thank you.

00:19:32.707 --> 00:19:33.841 position:16% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) And you, Iruka?

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:37.979 position:10% line:77% align:start
(IRUKA) The same. Large miso
char siu with Naruto fishcake
topping.

00:19:38.012 --> 00:19:38.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
(TEUCHI) Got it!

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:44.251 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right, Dad, I'm all done
cleaning up in the back.

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:46.154 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, thanks, Ayame!

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:50.323 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're not going home yet? Well,
I'm gonna take off. Make sure
you lock up!

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.994 position:24% line:89% align:start
All right... Done!

00:19:57.165 --> 00:20:00.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
Naruto Congratulations All You
Can Eat Forever

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.038 position:5% line:89% align:start
(KAKASHI) Have a safe trip home.

00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:06.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
(LEE) Gaara! Please come back to
visit!

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:10.912 position:7% line:77% align:start
It would be great if you come
back on your own, instead of on
an official business.

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:13.548 position:10% line:83% align:start
I agree. And it won't be too
long.

00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:14.649 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:17.552 position:19% line:89% align:start
For Naruto's wedding.

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:21.221 position:13% line:77% align:start
Sorry, but I don't plan on
bringing a special gift from the
Sand

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:23.057 position:16% line:83% align:start
for him and Hinata after
all.

00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.424 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that?! But why not?!

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:25.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let him finish!

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want to honor the two of
them personally, as a friend.

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:31.666 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think that'll please Naruto
more.

00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:33.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Good call, Gaara!

00:20:33.668 --> 00:20:34.401 position:38% line:89% align:start
Gaara...

00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:37.772 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes! That sounds great, please
do that.

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:48.783 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, everything seems
settled,

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:51.318 position:7% line:83% align:start
like somehow all of it turned
out for the best in the end.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:53.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're certainly in a good mood,
Temari.

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:55.957 position:7% line:89% align:start
What?! No way! I'm not at all!

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.460 position:7% line:77% align:start
And besides, what's even more
shocking is seeing you so
depressed, Kankuro!

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:03.998 position:7% line:83% align:start
You can't blame him, since now
we're not giving a big gift.

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:05.867 position:7% line:83% align:start
That isn't what's bothering me
right now.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.937 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'm just disappointed that we
aren't gonna get to see you
dance, Gaara.

00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.874 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't give up just yet!
There's still hope!

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:15.209 position:35% line:77% align:start
After all,
he could dance as Naruto's
friend!

00:21:15.243 --> 00:21:15.576 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.345 position:21% line:89% align:start
(chuckle) No chance.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.283 position:7% line:89% align:start
16 More Days Until the Wedding

00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:57.410 position:5% line:77% align:start
(SHINO) To the one million Shino
fans out there: sorry I've kept
you waiting.

00:22:57.444 --> 00:23:00.781 position:5% line:77% align:start
(SHINO) It's been said for over
ten years that I don't stand
out.

00:23:00.815 --> 00:23:03.351 position:10% line:77% align:start
(SHINO) But finally, I'm the
lead! It's because I've been
chosen to go

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:06.254 position:7% line:83% align:start
(SHINO) on a mission to find a
wedding gift for Hinata! And-

00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:10.324 position:13% line:77% align:start
(KIBA) Sorry to keep you
waiting! I'm the lead next time
on Naruto Shippuden:

00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:15.363 position:16% line:77% align:start
"Hidden Leaf Story, The
Perfect Day for a Wedding,
Part 5: The Last Mission."

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:18.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
(KIBA) I'm the lead!
Hey, where's Shino?

00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:20.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
(SHINO) Is it true that I don't
stand out?
