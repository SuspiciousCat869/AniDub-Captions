-I don't think it's
really all that likely,

00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,660
but still, you can
never be too careful.

173
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,336
We'll keep hidden
as much as possible

-What do you--

-All right, let's pack
it in here tonight.

-Say what?

If you really want
to set up camp,

183
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,029
then we should backtrack
to that cave we passed,

instead of lying in
the open out here.

things I need to know.

-What about?

224
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,918
-Everything regarding the
Akatsuki member Sasori.

225
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,223
-Sasori--

[music playing]

227
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,903
-I wanted to bring
it up sooner, but I

228
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:27,740
promised we wouldn't talk about
stuff like that yesterday.

229
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,010
I need you to tell
me everything now.

230
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,446
You're the only one who's
ever seen him and lived

231
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,214
to tell the tale.

232
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,150
-Yes, sir.

233
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:40,453
-I received his file from
the Hidden Sand Village,

234
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,755
but it would help if you
could fill in the blanks,

235
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,159
like his personality or speech
pattern, even mannerisms

236
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,927
or quirks.

237
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,129
-Why do you need
to know all that?

238
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,199
-The spy hidden in
Orochimaru's ranks

239
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,834
expects to rendezvous
with Sasori.

240
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,107
They might catch me
right away, but I'm

241
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,610
going to try to approach
them in disguise.

242
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:07,880
-But if Sasori is a
no-show at the bridge,

243
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:10,516
the spy might not
reveal himself.

244
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,853
-Absolutely, that's a
distinct possibility.

245
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,889
NARUTO: Than this will
all have been for nothing.

246
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:19,525
-Working as a spy always
entails a certain amount

247
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,795
of risk and danger.

248
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:27,166
I think our target will
definitely have their guard up.

249
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,434
-All right.

250
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,870
So then, you'll be the one
to transform into Sasori.

251
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:33,206
-That's the plan, yeah.

252
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,109
He would always hide himself
within this Hiruko puppet,

253
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,077
so it really should be me.

254
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,914
Remember, I'm master of
the wood style ninjutsu.

255
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,349
-You're right.

256
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,752
-Oh, and one more
thing-- since there's

257
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:49,222
a slight chance this is a
trap, I'll approach on my own,

258
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:51,858
at first.

259
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,494
-Go to the Tenchi
Bridge in the village

260
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,898
hidden in the grass 10
days from now, at noon.

261
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,667
-Why, what's there?

262
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,905
-One of Orochimaru's henchmen
is working for me as a spy.

263
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:09,976
And that's where I'm supposed
to rendezvous with him.

264
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,645
However, I don't think a--

265
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:20,086
-The way he was talking at the
end-- I really don't believe he

266
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,287
was lying to me.

267
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,790
And besides, the
Akatsuki had a spy

268
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,359
named Yura in the
Sand Village, as well.

You three will hang back
and wait for my signal.

273
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,473
-Either way you look at
it, one thing is certain.

274
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,448
This spy is likely to be
strong and quite accomplished.

280
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,272
Shall we?

281
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:50,409
The devil's in the details, so
here's the mission from A to Z.

282
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:54,247
Our one and only goal
is a live capture.

283
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,017
The target must not be killed
or injured, no matter what.

284
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,322
If they are, we lose our
only source of intelligence.

285
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:07,260
This will be more difficult than
simply taking out the enemy.

286
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,428
The mission is a delicate one.

287
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,298
That's why I'm taking
the lead, but you guys

288
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,301
are to be ready as back-up.

289
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,103
The strategy is simple.

290
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:20,740
I move in and
restrain the target.

291
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:24,243
If that should fail, and I
enter into a combat situation,

292
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:29,982
we move to plan B. That's your
cue to enter into combat mode.

293
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:33,386
You'll enter on
my signal, alone.

294
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,022
Should that second
scenario come to pass,

295
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,090
we'll be using the buddy system.

296
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:39,392
-Huh?

297
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,928
Buddy system, how do you mean?

298
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:45,064
-Every warrior's action will
be covered by their partner.

299
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,500
The watchword,
people, is teamwork.

Make sense?

we'll be pairing up.

-I could explain it
for you, if you like.

313
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,572
NARUTO: That's not what I meant.

314
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,607
-You know, you really
shouldn't blame others

for your own lack of competence.

who has lost his cool.

situation, make a decision,

and act.

Nations.

329
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,482
The Five Nations
are the countries

330
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,218
in which the powerful
hidden villages preside.

331
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,253
For example, the
Hidden Leaf Village

332
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,422
is found in the Land of Fire.

333
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,892
And here, in the Land of Wind,
is the Hidden Sand Village.

334
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,627
The Hidden Stone
Village is found

335
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,297
in the Land of Earth, the Hidden
Cloud in the Land of Lightning,

336
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:08,100
and the Hidden Mist Village
is in the Land of Water.

337
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:11,637
Five in total-- these make up
what we call the Five Great

338
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,341
Nations, whose powerful leaders
earn the title of Hokage.

339
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:16,842
Collectively,
these men and women

340
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:19,512
are known as the Five Hokage.

341
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,213
Let's test your knowledge.

342
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,415
Which headbands belong
to each village?

343
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:25,518
You all know this, right?

344
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:29,588
[beeping]

345
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:33,073
Let's have a look.

346
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:34,942
So, did everyone
out there get it?

347
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:37,411
For those of you
didn't, you have

348
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:39,737
got a lot of studying to do.
