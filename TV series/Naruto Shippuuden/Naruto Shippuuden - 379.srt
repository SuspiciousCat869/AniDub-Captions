1
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,560
I'll have to
teleport it away with me!

2
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:18,276
Here, you can
have this back.

3
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,814
[gasp]

4
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,452
Don't worry.

5
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:28,986
{\an1}I only teleported a clone.

6
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:33,024
{\an1}I marked him earlier,
that time before when we

7
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:34,660
{\an1}had made contact with him.

8
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,933
That's amazing!

9
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:43,801
{\an1}You can copy my dad's move!

10
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,070
Nice, Second
Great Stone Face guy!

11
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,140
Lord Fourth is
actually using my move!

12
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,842
Plus, that is
"Lord Second" to you!

13
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,212
-Hm?
-[chuckling]

00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,346
{\an1}Wood Style: Wood Dragon!

15
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,315
[roar]

16
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,644
{\an1}Out of my way, Madara!

17
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:01,179
{\an1}I don't have much time
but there's something

18
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,215
{\an1}I've got to do now!

19
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,786
Wood Style:
Wood Golem Jutsu!

20
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,920
{\an1}Now I'm going to take
another chunk of you!

21
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,261
[painful gorans]

22
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:33,972
Amazing!

23
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,173
{\an1}They're on another level!

24
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,076
So this is the
battle capacity

25
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,812
{\an1}of our predecessors?!

26
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,214
We'd just get in
their way if we went out

27
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,816
{\an1}there and tried to join in.

28
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,463
In a battle like
they're waging we'd be

29
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:00,031
{\an1}of no use whatsoever!

30
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,838
Ino, please!

31
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:06,806
Got it.

32
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:13,278
{\an1}Even a small power
can be helpful

33
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,213
depending on
how it's used.

34
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:16,749
Shikamaru?

35
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:20,185
{\an1}We may not be any help now,
but there might come a time

36
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:21,721
{\an1}when we will be needed.

37
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,956
{\an1}So don't take your eyes
off the battlefield in

38
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,726
{\an1}case such a time arrives!

39
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,961
{\an1}Our power could change
the course of this world!

40
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:32,865
{\an1}We can't afford to relax
and let our guard down,

41
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,100
{\an1}even for one second!

42
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,301
Yeah!

43
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,571
He's right!

44
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,312
[chuckle]

45
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,081
{\an1}Shikamaru, you would
make a great Hokage.

46
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:59,892
{\an1}The ability to sway people's
hearts is practically a

47
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,993
{\an1}requirement for any Kage.

48
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:24,417
{\an1}This is just like
the time back then.

49
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,426
Madara, at one
time, we were friends!

50
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:36,729
We both shared
the same dream!

51
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,598
Hashirama!

52
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,066
{\an1}How long will you keep
saying such childish things?

53
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,045
{\an1}It is not possible
to show each other

54
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,815
{\an1}what is inside of us!

55
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:57,884
{\an1}Do you really not get it?

56
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,324
Hashirama!

57
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:06,792
Madara!

58
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:18,504
{\an1}The end result will be
different this time, though.

59
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,306
{\an1}So when are we supposed to
make our move, Shikamaru?

60
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,541
{\an1}You should try to think
for yourself a little

61
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,243
{\an1}more once in a while!

62
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:59,278
First, we need
to figure out the

63
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,080
{\an1}circumstances of their battle.

64
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:05,919
Also, what's
going on down there?

65
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,561
{\an1}Well, did he get him?

66
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:34,647
{\an1}He blocked it, huh?

67
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,115
He's fast.

68
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,284
We can't hit him
with ordinary jutsu.

69
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,326
{\an1}I'll have to use my
Rasen-Flash Super-Circle

70
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,528
{\an1}Dance Howl Stage Three.

71
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:52,032
I'll create an
opening for us all with it.

72
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,369
{\an1}You're, uh a bit of a
comedian, aren't you?

73
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:59,840
{\an1}I would normally make fun
of all your jutsu names.

74
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,241
{\an1}Except this guy is no joke.

75
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,210
Amaterasu!

76
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:08,682
Sasuke!

77
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:09,883
Naruto!

78
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,952
{\an1}I said I'd make an
opening for you!

79
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,020
{\an1}I'll create an opening!

80
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:14,788
{\an1}No way, we'll both do it!

81
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,923
{\an1}We'll let Dad and the
others be the main act!

82
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,962
{\an1}I saw you amassing
chakra in your left eye.

83
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,730
{\an1}Hardly a surprise attack.

84
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:25,531
{\an1}So frustrating...

85
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,101
{\an1}Come on, Fourth, let's go.

86
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,537
A clone's Flying
Raijin will be too slow.

87
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,807
Let's combine
and reciprocate

88
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,542
{\an1}our Flying Raijin.

89
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,011
{\an1}Go ahead and put your
mark on me, as well.

90
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,079
Yes, sir.

91
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:41,648
Plus with these
bodies, we can still

92
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,282
{\an1}move after being hit!

93
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,318
Naruto!

94
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,088
{\an1}This time, I'll match
your chakra level using

95
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,456
{\an1}my Sharingan, got it?

96
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:50,724
{\an1}All right, all right!

97
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:52,826
{\an1}I mean, there's no need to
turn this whole thing into a

98
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,226
{\an1}competition, you know!

99
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,966
{\an1}-Inferno Style: Flame Control!
-Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

Pincer attack?!

101
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,792
{\an1}You two are the main act!

102
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:29,663
Distracted by
what's in front of you?

103
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,631
Now!

104
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:33,200
Reciprocal
Round-Robin Jutsu!

105
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,634
{\an1}Flying Raijin Jutsu!

106
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,540
{\an1}I name it the Scorch
Style Nimbus Tempest!

107
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,776
{\an1}Keep going as planned!

108
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,711
[attacking yell]

109
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,552
{\an1}They switched places
by teleporting with

110
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,187
{\an1}the Flying Raijin?!

111
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:02,295
Hinata!

112
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,864
{\an1}How're Naruto and Sasuke?

113
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,911
{\an1}They're both... smiling!

114
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,689
Smiling?!

115
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:30,957
Both of them?

116
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,559
Yeah.

117
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:35,896
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

118
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,702
All right!

119
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,106
{\an1}So, did you guys get him?!

120
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,479
{\an1}We made a direct hit
before those black

121
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,282
{\an1}things could protect him.

122
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,616
I'm pretty sure
he felt that one!

123
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,998
[gasp]

124
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,775
{\an1}It had no effect at all.

125
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:24,711
{\an1}We have to avoid those
black transforming spheres.

126
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,380
And our attacks
have no effect on him.

127
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:29,583
His offense and
defense are so fast!

128
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,185
What a pain.

129
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:34,088
{\an1}He's even more perfect
than how I imagine

130
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,990
{\an1}myself in my dreams!

131
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,192
{\an1}I mean, he's just perfect!

132
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,492
{\an1}You've got a point.

133
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,695
{\an1}It's like he's truly
obtained dreamlike power.

134
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,398
{\an1}There's something odd.

135
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,467
What is it?

136
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,071
{\an1}You only lost an arm.

137
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:52,807
{\an1}Dust should be swirling
around in order

138
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,709
{\an1}to restore it by now.

139
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,214
{\an1}Our reanimated bodies
aren't regenerating.

140
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:11,058
{\an1}I now possess the same
power that the Founder

141
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,261
{\an1}of Shinobi possessed.

142
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,899
{\an1}You can no longer measure
me by the standards

143
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,066
you're used to.

144
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,139
Don't tell me
that your jutsu--!

145
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,309
{\an1}What does he mean, the power
of the Founder of Shinobi?

146
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,311
Listen, Fourth.

147
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:34,148
{\an1}Don't get seriously wounded
even though you've got a

148
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,650
reanimated body.

149
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:39,754
{\an1}I think he's using a jutsu
based on Shadow and Light

150
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:43,190
Styles that
nullifies all ninjutsu.

151
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:47,328
{\an1}In short, if he hits your
reanimated body you'll be

152
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,531
{\an1}unable to regenerate
could even die!

153
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,199
[gasp]

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,769
Also assume that
right arm of yours is

155
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,337
{\an1}permanently gone.

156
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,640
{\an1}In which case, we'll
need to fight him

157
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,175
{\an1}even more carefully.

158
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,712
{\an1}But since ninjutsu
won't work on him,

159
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,080
{\an1}this'll be tricky.

160
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,482
How about
physical attacks?

161
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,484
Let's try it.

162
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,586
Sasuke...

163
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,754
What is it?

164
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,257
{\an1}You and I going to have to
take the lead on this one.

165
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,959
{\an1}Think you can you keep up?

166
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,194
Don't
underestimate the Uchiha.

167
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:22,630
All right, then!

168
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:24,565
{\an1}I'll up my Kurama Mode
and go deeper into

169
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,100
{\an1}Tailed Beast State!

170
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,773
Uh oh...

171
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,009
{\an1}Are you trying to
make things even worse?

172
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:38,079
{\an1}You're as goofy as your
father, so much so

173
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:40,281
{\an1}that even he's dumbfounded.

174
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,750
S-Sorry.

175
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:50,124
Kurama!

176
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,394
{\an1}Come on, lend me some more
of your chakra, would ya!

177
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:55,896
Just hold off on
Nine Tails State!

178
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,666
{\an1}But he's not someone
we can beat without it!

179
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,337
{\an1}If you want to enter into
Perfect Tailed Beast State,

180
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,772
fight in normal
mode for now!

181
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,708
[sigh]

182
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,277
Syrup Gun!

183
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,684
{\an1}A Mount Myoboku toad?!

184
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,119
{\an1}What was that, Gamakichi?

185
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:20,621
{\an1}If you wanna make a move,
do a diversion or combo!

186
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:23,624
{\an1}Sorry, Naruto. We're rapidly
approaching the time limit

187
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,160
{\an1}for the summoning.

188
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,061
I just wanted to
repay that guy with a

189
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:29,164
{\an1}little parting shot!

190
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,732
Thanks for the
effort anyway, Gamakichi!

191
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,567
{\an1}Now go rest up, okay?

192
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,836
{\an1}Sorry about this.

193
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,041
Huh?

194
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,789
[gasp] Is that?

195
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:55,923
Obito!

196
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,493
{\an1}I thought what you
wanted was to become Hokage.

197
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,062
{\an1}Why are you doing this?!

198
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,862
{\an1}You want to know why?

199
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,864
{\an1}This is my chance!

200
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,833
You're going to
lecture me now?

201
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:08,236
{\an1}Bit late for that, Sensei.

202
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,603
Don't you think?

203
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:16,244
{\an1}You're always too late
when it matters most.

204
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,580
{\an1}It seems that Rin and
Kakashi are totally

205
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:20,982
surrounded.

206
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,951
{\an1}Sounds like all of the Mist
guys appear to be jonin or

207
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,020
ANBU Black Ops.

208
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,222
{\an1}What's Minato Sensei doing?

209
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,524
Who?

210
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,692
{\an1}I'm asking what the Yellow
Flash of the Leaf's doing!

211
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:37,099
{\an1}Hm, it seems that he's on
some different mission.

212
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,934
{\an1}At a time like this?!

213
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:48,276
{\an1}Rin, once again...

214
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,781
{\an1}Let's create a world
where you can exist again.

215
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,452
I'm glad my
teacher was a Hokage.

216
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,658
{\an1}It made it easy to give
up on becoming Hokage!

217
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,067
{\an1}He defeated the Anbu Black
Ops assigned to Lord Third,

218
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,704
{\an1}got past a highest-level
classified barrier and knew

219
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,707
{\an1}The Nine Tails' Seal would
weaken during childbirth.

220
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,277
{\an1}Are you Madara Uchiha?

221
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,483
{\an1}No, that would be impossible.

222
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,686
{\an1}He is dead, after all.

223
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,759
In the end, it
doesn't matter who you are.

224
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,330
But why attack
the Hidden Leaf?

225
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,367
What would you
like to hear?

226
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,770
{\an1}I could say I did it on a
whim, or that I planned it,

227
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,640
{\an1}or that it's for war...

228
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,507
{\an1}Or that it's for peace.

229
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:59,814
{\an1}If only I had realized that
man was Obito, I may have

230
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,050
{\an1}been able to stop him!

231
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,588
{\an1}And then, I might have
been able to prevent

232
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:07,088
Kushina's death.

233
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,125
I might not have
had to make Naruto

234
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:11,927
{\an1}into Nine Tails' Jinchuriki.

235
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:17,966
If only I had
noticed that he was Obito!

236
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,703
{\an1}Perhaps the shinobi
world wouldn't have

237
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,439
{\an1}ended up like this either!

238
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,342
{\an1}You were my teacher,
and yet you didn't

239
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,778
{\an1}realize it was me.

240
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,847
{\an1}That's just who you
are, fundamentally.

241
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,016
How pathetic!

242
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,321
{\an1}You died a hero Hokage, but
now, exposed as a disgrace

243
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,089
{\an1}in front of your son.

244
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,594
That's right.

245
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:47,162
{\an1}A Hokage is a pitiable
existence compared

246
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:49,197
{\an1}to what I am now.

247
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,134
{\an1}Apparently, the kid's
not a total goofball.

248
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,203
He's caught on!

249
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:58,374
{\an1}You have no right to make
fun of the Hokage when you

250
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,443
{\an1}couldn't even become one!

251
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:03,379
{\an1}Naruto, what are-?!

252
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,017
{\an1}Especially not my dad,
who actually was Hokage.

253
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,555
How dare you
put him down!

254
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,462
That worked?!

255
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:21,197
I don't get it?

256
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:27,703
It's effective!

257
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,438
{\an1}So it is just as I thought!

258
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:33,209
{\an1}Ninjutsu may not work, but
it seems Sage Jutsu does!

259
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,580
{\an1}The toad from Mount Myoboku
used Sage Jutsu, and his

260
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,881
attack wasn't
nullified or erased.

261
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:42,218
You bastard!

262
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,491
Amazing, Naruto!

263
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,126
{\an1}What's going on?!

264
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,560
{\an1}His Sage Jutsu is working!

265
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,005
{\an1}He's even mastered
the same Sage Jutsu

266
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,407
{\an1}as Jiraiya Sensei.

267
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:09,779
{\an1}Seems he's grown into
quite a son, eh, Minato?

268
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:17,753
{\an1}It's no wonder that he
managed to sweet

269
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:19,655
{\an1}talk my other half.

270
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:59,422
{\an1}<i>Dad, I don't know if</i>
<i>this will work or not,</i>

271
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:01,123
{\an1}<i>but I've got an idea.</i>

272
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:02,324
<i>Naruto!</i>

273
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:04,861
{\an1}<i>Face it, Minato's useless.</i>

274
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,129
{\an1}<i>He wasn't even able to</i>
<i>protect your mother.</i>

275
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,699
{\an1}<i>Nor his subordinates.</i>

276
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,234
<i>You know what</i>
<i>tomorrow is, don't you?</i>

277
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:15,104
{\an1}<i>It's the anniversary</i>
<i>of their deaths...</i>

278
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:20,443
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Day</i>
<i>Naruto Was Born."</i>

279
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>The day both</i>
<i>your parents died.</i>
