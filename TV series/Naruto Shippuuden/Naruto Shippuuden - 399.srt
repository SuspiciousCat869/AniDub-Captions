{\an1}<i>...for Lord Gaara</i>

3
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,840
{\an1}<i>Lord Gaara, putting up your Sand</i>

4
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:33,806
Sorry.

5
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,170
{\an1}My Sand Guard's a automatic
response, not a conscious one.

6

{\an1}Your Sand is like armor.

7

{\an1}<i>Even if it's solid, you'll still</i>

{\an1}[thud, heavy breathing]

10
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,196
{\an1}Just stay on the offensive and

{\an1}<i>You've progressed so much in</i>

00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,772
Yes.

26

{\an1}I'm eternally grateful for the
opportunity. Thank you for
giving it to me.

27
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,267
{\an1}Of course. You have the skills.

<i>The Chunin Exams!</i>

{\an1}<i>I'm getting kinda antsy.</i>

31
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,891
{\an1}<i>It's too soon to get nervous.</i>

32
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,355
{\an1}Our goal isn't simply to pass
the Chunin Exams ourselves,...

33
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:09,552
{\an1}<i>...but to have as many Sand</i>
<i>entrants as possible pass. </i>

34
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,517
{\an1}That will be my way of repaying
Lord Gaara.

35
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,582
{\an1}Wow, Shira! When your mind's
made up, you don't budge!

36
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:22,545
{\an1}I want...to live up to his
expectations.

37
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:29,275
{\an1}<i>By the way,...this time around,</i>
<i>the Chunin Exams are shorter</i>
<i>than they were before. </i>

38
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:33,040
{\an1}<i>Yes, it is three days this time</i>
<i>as opposed to five days. </i>

39
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,237
{\an1}Simply put, what that really
means is this place is just that
much more dangerous.

40
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:44,533
{\an4}<i>When the sun rises, the</i>
<i>temperatures soar in the desert.</i>
<i>And getting around will become</i>
<i>very difficult. </i>

41
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,699
<i>I see...</i>

42
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,365
{\an1}So what you're saying is we may
barely have enough time to
make it to the goal.

43
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,529
{\an1}Then we cannot stop for
anything!

44
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:56,827
{\an1}Either way, our priority is to
acquire the scroll quickly.

45
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,891
{\an1}To do that we'll have to battle
another team.

46
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,024
{\an1}<i>But still, we can't just pick</i>
<i>any team.</i>

47
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,023
{\an1}<i>I came up with something.</i>

48
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,322
{\an1}What is it, Neji?

49
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,186
{\an1}<i>Yesterday's brawl in the</i>
<i>cafeteria was a fortunate turn</i>
<i>of events. </i>

50
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,883
{\an1}<i>I was able to get a rough idea</i>
<i>of the other teams' strengths. </i>

51

[wham, thud]

52
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:25,012
{\an1}<i>In my opinion, the teams to</i>

<i>who stopped Lee's kick.  </i>

53
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:26,944
And then...

54
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:35,906
[clank, boom]

55
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:41,669
{\an4}<i>The team from the Hidden</i>
<i>Waterfall. With our skills, we</i>
<i>should have no problems with the</i>
<i>rest of the teams. </i>

56
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,900
{\an1}You're amazing, Neji! You
analyzed all of that already?!

57
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:49,664
{\an1}So we'll avoid the strong teams
and aim for the weaker ones,
is that right?

58
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:50,497
<i>But,...</i>

59
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,595
{\an1}I do not like to do things in
that way...

60
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:57,094
{\an1}Yes,...I figured you might say
that, Lee.

61
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:04,190
{\an1}<i>But we've waited two and a half</i>

<i>You don't want to fail, do you? </i>

62
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,989
No, but I...

63
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,654

{\an1}<i>So, what do we do?</i>

72
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:58,328
{\an1}We were told not to enter the
Demon Desert, so what now?

73
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,959
{\an1}<i>I have a message from Lady</i>

{\an1}<i>In other words...</i>

82

water droplet that's dozens of
kilometers away...

8 Palms!

{\an1}I cannot believe I get to fight
you so soon!

{\an1}What's that?! What are you so
happy about, Lee?!

158
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,659
{\an1}Don't fight him carelessly!

<i>Oh, too bad...</i>

160
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,590
{\an1}The Cactus Genjutsu got broken
already, huh?

161
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,355
<i>Cactus Genjutsu?</i>

163

{\an1}Back then, I did catch a faint
floral scent...

164
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,151
{\an1}That was the genjutsu?

165
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,581
{\an4}We were aware that the Second
Round was gonna take
place right here within the
Demon Desert.

166
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,213
{\an1}So we set up several jutsu as
traps in advance.

167
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:35,043
{\an1}But don't hold it against us. We
just happen to have te advantage
here.

168
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,575
{\an1}But you do not have it this
time!

00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:46,236
{\an4}I'm usually very cautious, so if
I'm willing to confront you like
this,what do you think that
means...?

172
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:50,633
[gasp] <i>What?!</i>

173
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,667
I cannot move!

<i>No, not again!</i>
!

175
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:57,164
{\an1}Oh, I'll release it for you this
time.

176
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:58,796
Release!

[gasps]

178
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,491
{\an1}I don't have time to deal with
you three now. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:09,223
{\an1}Please, just wait!

180
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,353
{\an1}Shira! Why will you not fight
me right now?

181
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:19,218
{\an1}You're quite strong. I knew that
the moment I blocked you.

[grunt]

183

{\an1}<i>That's why I won't fight you.</i>

184
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,082
{\an1}Otherwise, one of us will get
hurt.

185
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,613
{\an1}A shinobi fights despite the
risk!

186
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:31,145
{\an1}<i>We have an important goal right</i>
<i>now... </i>

187
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,642
{\an1}...to make sure as many Sand
entrants as possible make it
through the Exams.

188
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,373
{\an1}You're helping other entrants?
But why?!

189
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:47,302
{\an1}<i>Instead of asking questions, you</i>
<i>should worry about yourselves.</i>
<i>Sen, Yome,...Let's go! </i>

190
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,435
Shira!

191
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:51,801
{\an1}<i>The sand is moving!</i>

192
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,465
Huh?! [grunting]

193
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,131
Lee! Help me!

194
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:59,396
{\an1}I cannot! I am stuck! [grunting]

195

<i>Don't struggle!</i>
<i>You'll get pulled in deeper!</i>

196

{\an1}[gasp] <i>It seems that I've</i>

197
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,425
{\an1}What do you mean?

198
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:09,624
<i>Last night...</i>

199
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:14,454
{\an1}<i>He was also busy analyzing the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf's strengths.</i>

200
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,783
{\an1}<i>They've had us under</i>
<i>surveillance from the start!</i>

201
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:29,946
{\an1}<i>Not only that, but he took</i>

<i>Sand entrants... </i>

202
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,411
{\an1}<i>...and he ordered them not to</i>
<i>confront us. </i>

203
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:40,440
{\an4}<i>That is why we did not encounter</i>

<i>well! </i>

204
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:43,505
{\an1}<i>Lee! It's not the time to be</i>

205
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,771
{\an1}<i>Wait, do you hear that</i>

206
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,834
{\an1}[gasp] <i>Damn, so this is what he</i>

{\an1}<i>Oh, no! We're going over!</i>

{\an1}Is everyone okay, now?

214
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,683
{\an1}<i>Yes, thanks, Lee!</i>

215
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:27,016
{\an1}<i>Yeah, but...where are we?</i>

216
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,011
{\an1}<i>There's no way out of this</i>
<i>waterfall area.</i>

217
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,009
{\an1}<i>What?! So we just have to wait</i>
<i>'til someone comes to rescue</i>
<i>us?! </i>

218
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,839
{\an1}<i>No way! Does that mean that we</i>
<i>will be disqualified?! </i>

219
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,669
{\an1}<i>Is everyone safe?</i>

Taken care of.

222
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,664
{\an1}They fell into the Sand
Waterfall Pit. They won't get
out until the Exams are over.

223
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:01,830
{\an1}<i>I see. That's a relief.</i>

224
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,627
{\an1}Now's our chance to get scrolls
from the other teams.

[gasps]

226

227
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:15,421
What is this?!

228
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,953
{\an1}Like we just said! We're gonna
tkae one of these scrolls from
you guys.

229
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:21,218
But why?!

230
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,984
{\an1}That's an easy answer, Shira.

231
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,815
{\an1}It's because we don't like you.

232
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,646
{\an1}<i>What did you want to talk about?</i>

233
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,044
{\an1}We just wanna help make sure
that everyone passes.

234
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,308
{\an1}<i>Your team and ours will start</i>
<i>out close to each other for the</i>
<i>Second Exam.</i>

235
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:45,205
{\an1}<i>However, a Hidden Leaf team with</i>
<i>a Byakugan user will also be</i>
<i>nearby. They're quite strong. </i>

236
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,805
<i>So what?</i>

237
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:52,902
{\an4}The chances are good that one
of us will confront the Hidden
Leaf team near the beginning of
the Exam.

238
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:58,631
{\an1}<i>Their team is not to be take</i>
<i>lightly. But still,...we'll slow</i>
<i>them down.</i>

239
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:03,128
{\an1}<i>While we do,...I want you to get</i>
<i>as far away from them as</i>
<i>possible. </i>

00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,028
Oh...?

241
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,092
{\an1}In other words, you're gonna
order us all around, is that it?

242
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:12,958
{\an1}I merely want as many Sand as
possible to pass, that's all.

huh...?

246
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:24,750
{\an1}You see, Shira, that just
doesn't sit well with us.

247
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:31,880
{\an4}A guy like you, who barely just
became a shinobi, catches Lord
Gaara's eye and then has the
nerve to act all high and

248
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,111
{\an1}mighty toward us!

249

{\an1}Hey! Did you forget Shira saved
you earlier?!

250
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,876
{\an1}So? We don't owe him anything.

289
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:47,472
Retreat!

290
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,068
{\an1}<i>Shira! You all right?!</i>

291
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,299
You guys...

292
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,432
Why?!

293
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,430
{\an1}I thought that you all fell
into the Sand Waterfall Pit?

294
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:07,928
{\an1}[chuckle] Oh, that? That wasn't
any trouble at all!

295
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,281
{\an1}You guys are pretty good...

296
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,713
{\an1}<i>But...why did you save us?</i>

297
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,244
{\an1}We aren't so unprincipled as to
torment opponents who've
been weakened.

298
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:41,108
{\an1}Well, whatever the reason,
thanks for your help.

299
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:48,705
{\an4}<i>May I ask you something? Why</i>
<i>would your own comrades do this</i>
<i>to Shira, the very one who</i>
<i>protected them? </i>

300
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:50,103
Well, you see...

301
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:54,602
{\an1}It's just that...Shira wasn't a
shinobi until recently.

302
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,301
{\an1}He wasn't a shinobi?!

303
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:59,466
{\an1}Someone of his skill?!

304
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,096
{\an1}Perhaps that is due to his
special situation...

305
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:05,729
{\an1}Do you know something about
this, Lee?

306
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:11,293
{\an1}Shira has almost no skill at
all for ninjutsu or genjutsu.

307
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,191
{\an1}<i>Shira and I are alike...</i>

308
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,555
{\an1}We are shinobi who can only
perform taijutsu.

309
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:00,233
{\an1}<i>I am livid with rage!</i>

310
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:03,964
{\an1}<i>Shira has persevered through and</i>
<i>trained so much more than I... </i>

311
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:08,028
{\an1}<i>So why do you insult him? You</i>
<i>are comrades from the same</i>
<i>village! </i>

312
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,359
{\an1}<i>Please apologize to Shira!</i>

313
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,225
{\an1}<i>Until you apologize to Shira...</i>

314
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:19,123
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"As a Taijutsu User." </i>

315
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:21,821
{\an1}<i>I will never forgive you!</i>
