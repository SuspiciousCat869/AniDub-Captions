1
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:19,584
{\an1}[sigh] Whew! All done!

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,218
{\an1}[chuckle] Everything's nice
and clean now!

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,055
{\an1}Wow, you really cleaned
Naruto's room?!

4
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,123
{\an1}That's right! Naruto's been
away for three whole years,

5
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,723
{\an1}and it really needed it!

6
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:35,091
{\an1}His place is spotless!

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,692
{\an1}It's ready to welcome him
home and so are we!

8
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:43,895
[gasp]

9
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,300
{\an1}Naruto, is that you?!

10
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,268
Hm?

11
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:56,834
[chuckle]

12
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,438
{\an1}Been a while, huh, Sakura?

13
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,737
Hey! Naruto!

14
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:08,773
Sexy Jutsu!

15
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:10,975
[scream]

16
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:15,444
{\an1}Well, what do you think? Not
too bad in the curves

17
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:16,644
{\an1}department there, huh!

18
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,615
{\an1}Konohamaru... I'm not that
scrawny litle kid anymore.

19
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,382
{\an1}And you shouldn't be using
jutsu like that either.

20
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:26,350
Huh?

21
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:29,683
{\an1}Just face it, that jutsu
is totally weak!

22
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,419
{\an1}Now step aside and get a
load 'a my brand spankin'

23
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:34,454
{\an1}new pervy Ninjutsu!

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,254
{\an1}Are you kidding me?!

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,791
{\an1}We don't see each other for
two years and you pull a stunt
like that?!

26
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:35,312
{\an1}Oh man, I thought that you'd
be a little impressed, at least.

27
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,479
{\an1}[laugh] Well, my training
involved way more awesome

28
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:39,147
jutsu than that!

29
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,415
{\an1}That's just what I'd expect
from you! Everything's going

30
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,449
{\an1}exactly according to plan!

31
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:44,650
Plan?

32
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,749
[chuckle]

33
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,052
Wow!

34
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:54,622
{\an1}No way! What happened?!

35
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,423
{\an1}Isn't it obvious? I
cleaned your entire

36
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,256
{\an1}house until it sparkled.

37
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,658
{\an1}Thanks, Konohamaru!
You're such a great guy!

38
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,326
{\an1}Yup! And I don't even expect
you to teach me a new jutsu

39
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,227
{\an1}in return either!

40
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,628
{\an1}I have no ulterior
motives at all!

41
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:11,697
{\an1}Right. Could you be
more obvious?!

42
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:15,465
{\an1}But okay! I'll teach you an
absolutely amazing jutsu!

43
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:16,465
All right!

44
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,567
{\an1}Hold on. First, let me
just put my things way.

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,635
Huh?

46
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,935
{\an1}Isn't that your old outfit?

47
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,171
{\an1}Yeah, it doesn't really fit
me anymore, but I just can't

48
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,972
{\an1}bring myself to part
with it...

49
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:33,006
{\an1}So you could say, it's kinda
like a treasure to you!

50
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,241
{\an1}When you put it that way,
it's embarrassing.

51
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,177
[chuckle] Hm.

52
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,479
{\an1}The new jutsu I'm gonna
teach you is like nothing

53
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,513
{\an1}you've seen before; it's
totally different and cool!

54
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:50,515
{\an1}<i>I wonder what kind of</i>
<i>Sexy Jutsu it is!</i>

55
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:53,350
{\an1}Well, c'mon! Show
me already!

56
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,484
{\an1}The first step's "rotation"!

57
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,919
{\an1}Whoa! So we're going to
add motion to it, huh?!

58
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,521
{\an1}That's right. And the
second step's "power!"

59
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:05,656
{\an1}Oh, I see: attack with
the risqué! Awesome!

60
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:08,658
{\an1}And then third, comes
the final step.

61
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:12,158
{\an1}Seriously?! There's
still more?!

62
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,526
Containment!

63
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,695
{\an1}Oh-ho! The most points go to
the best cute expression, eh?!

64
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,631
{\an1}What are you talking about?!
Quit kidding!

65
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,831
But it's a Pervy
Ninjutsu, right?

66
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,666
{\an1}No way! It's better!

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,800
{\an1}It's an A-Rank jutsu, and
it's seriously hard to master.

68
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,471
{\an1}This is a super advanced
Ninjutsu that combines

69
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,306
{\an1}Chakra rotation, power,
and containment.

70
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,072
{\an1}It's called Rasengan!

71
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:48,976
So awesome!

72
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,746
{\an1}But I don't understand
what happened!

73
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:52,845
{\an1}How'd you do that?!

74
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,246
[chuckle]

75
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,748
{\an1}Don't you worry about that!

76
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,348
{\an1}Because I'm gonna teach
you, Konohamaru!

77
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,250
{\an1}And, you can do this jutsu
even if you're stupid!

78
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:03,484
No kidding?!

79
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,285
Huh?

80
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,419
Stupid?!

81
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:08,720
{\an1}To complete this training,
you just have to make it

82
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,154
{\an1}through three steps.

83
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,087
First, we need a
water balloon.

84
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,356
{\an1}A water balloon?!

85
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:18,090
{\an1}The "gaah!" is first you,
then you "bam" it!

86
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,760
{\an1}Oh! Wow! So, how'd
you do that?!

87
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,827
{\an1}What do you mean?
I just explained it.

88
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:28,095
{\an1}First, you have to "gah" it,
then "bam" it to burst it!

89
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,929
Uh...

90
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,930
I said...

91
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:35,799
{\an1}You just "gah" it and, then,
you "bam" it! Simple, right?

92
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,467
Uh...

93
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,969
{\an1}Okay, do your best,
Konohamaru!

94
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,337
{\an1}What, seriously?!
That's it?!

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,204
{\an1}You're just gonna
leave, like that?!

96
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,205
{\an1}I have to go train
with Sakura now.

97
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,006
Yeah, but...

98
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,742
{\an1}Come on, Konohamaru.
Don't be a baby.

99
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,175
Uh...

100
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,910
{\an1}Like anything, you've got to
learn by doing and feeling.

101
00:06:58,943 --> 00:06:59,745
Oh...

102
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,980
{\an1}And besides, I have faith
that you'll be able

103
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,248
{\an1}to do it, no problem!

104
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,282
{\an1}Big Brother Naruto...

105
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,985
{\an1}All right, I'm gonna do it!
Just watch me!

106
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,486
{\an1}The next time you see me,
Big Brother, you're going to

107
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,154
{\an1}get a really big surprise!

108
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:23,323
{\an1}Okay, first I go "Gaah"
and then "bam!"

109
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,823
{\an1}"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"

110
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:30,826
{\an1}"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"
"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"

111
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,860
{\an1}"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"

112
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,896
{\an1}"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"
"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"

113
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:41,864
Lady Tsunade!
Terrible news!

114
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:43,032
{\an1}Now what is it?!

115
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,966
{\an1}We've just received a
message! The Hidden Sand's

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,035
{\an1}Kazekage has been abducted
by a group called the Akatsuki!

117
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,736
[gasps]

118
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,203
Gaara was...

119
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,806
{\an1}Team Kakashi, I'm hereby
assigning you to a new mission.

120
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,240
{\an1}You're to go to the Sand
Village at once, find out

121
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,841
{\an1}what's going on, and
keep us informed.

122
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,443
{\an1}You're to remain there and
follow their orders.

123
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:06,110
{\an1}Give them any backup they need.

124
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,143
Right!

125
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,646
{\an1}"Gaaaah" and then "bam!"

126
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:14,147
{\an1}I can get the water
inside rotating, but...

127
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,349
{\an1}There he is! Hey,
Konohamaru!

128
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:19,216
{\an1}Huh? What? Oh, hey, what's
going on, you guys?

129
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,884
{\an1}It's terrible! Some guys
called the Akatsuki

130
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,386
{\an1}kidnapped the Kazekage
of the Hidden Sand!

131
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,787
{\an1}The Kazekage? Big
Brother Naruto's friend?

132
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:31,022
{\an1}Yeah! And Naruto just left
as part of the Hidden Leaf

133
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:32,790
{\an1}Village support team!

134
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,023
Huh?

135
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,058
{\an1}Isn't it awesome?! The
minute he gets back, he gets

136
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,660
{\an1}picked for no less than
an S-rank mission!

137
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:43,328
{\an1}Cool, huh?! Even though he's
only a genin, just like we are!

138
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:44,696
Hm?

139
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,933
[grunting]

140
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,035
{\an1}"Gah" and "bam" ú aren't
enough to figure this thing out!

141
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,803
{\an1}Hey! What are you doing,
anyway, Konohamaru?

142
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,504
{\an1}How long have you guys
been watching?!

143
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:04,405
[giggle]

144
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,708
{\an1}So this is the reason for
your weird yells, huh?

145
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,241
{\an1}Come on! They're not weird!

146
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:14,410
{\an1}Well, maybe they are a
little bit embarrassing.

147
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:17,945
{\an1}I mean, "gah" and "bam"-
what do they mean?!

148
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,780
{\an1}Maybe you just need to
take a step back from

149
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,480
{\an1}it for a little while.

150
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,749
{\an1}Huh? I don't understand...

151
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:27,516
{\an1}Well, Naruto tends to do
things intuitively, by feel.

152
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:30,251
{\an1}But not everyone learns
in the same way.

153
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,385
Mhm...

154
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,552
{\an1}Yeah, you could try
it a different way.

155
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,919
I guess...

156
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:37,388
{\an1}Okay, the first step is
rotation, and he said I'd

157
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,122
have to learn it
by feeling it.

158
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:41,590
That's it!

159
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,124
{\an1}Okay! Konohamaru!

160
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:46,024
{\an1}Let's just focus on
practicing that part first!

161
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:47,493
Uh, yeah, okay!

162
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:52,763
{\an1}Anyway, that's what's up.
Can you please help?

163
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,797
{\an1}To be honest, I don't really
understand what you're

164
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,163
talking about.

165
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,731
{\an1}Are you sure about this?

166
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,965
Yes, absolutely!

167
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:03,200
{\an1}Please, I have to do this if I'm
gonna learn this new jutsu!

168
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,168
{\an1}All right, then, you got it!

169
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,870
{\an1}You sold me with your
determination.

170
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:07,935
Come on!

171
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:14,905
{\an1}[attacking yell] Huh?!

172
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,440
Fang Over Fang!

173
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,509
[screaming]

174
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,411
{\an1}So did it help, Konohamaru?

175
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:25,779
{\an1}Uh... Everything just...

176
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,945
{\an1}Well, okay, then! On
to the next thing!

177
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,148
Please, help us!

178
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,816
All right, if
that's the case.

179
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:35,115
Bring it on!

180
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,751
{\an1}Try this out! Human Boulder!
[growling]

181
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:43,553
Next one!

182
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,455
{\an1}Okay! You ready, Konohamaru?

183
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:48,955
Go!

184
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,290
Wait a second!

185
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,224
Uh... Huh?

186
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:55,392
{\an1}Aw, but Hinata this is to
help Konohamaru

187
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,059
{\an1}learn a new jutsu!

188
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,428
{\an1}No, it isn't that.

189
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,896
{\an1}It's just I can't
use rotation!

190
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,897
Huh? Well, okay!

191
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:04,831
Hm.

192
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,265
I understand.

193
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,733
{\an1}Hold on! Understand what?!

194
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,667
{\an1}8 Trigrams Air Palm!

195
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:16,502
{\an1}This doesn't make any sense!

196
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,371
Idiot! Idiot!

197
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:23,773
Next up is...

198
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,874
{\an1}Hold on! I can't keep doing
this kind of thing, you know!

199
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:30,109
{\an1}You're right. But have you
figured anything out?

200
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,277
{\an1}Nothing. Not at all...

201
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:36,145
{\an1}Did Big Brother Naruto tell
you anything else?

202
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,313
{\an1}He said he taught me
everything I needed to know.

203
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:42,615
{\an1}But the only thing that he's
ever really taught me was

204
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,883
the Sexy Jutsu.

205
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,417
{\an1}Oh! Wait a minute.

206
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,618
What's up?

207
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:50,952
{\an1}Well he dissed my Sexy Jutsu,
and he told me that it was

208
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,454
totally weak.

209
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:55,521
{\an1}So maybe if I escalate the
sexiness, it'll all come

210
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,022
together nicely!

211
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,824
{\an1}Konohamaru! That's
gotta be it!

212
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,024
{\an1}Really? You think?

213
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,760
{\an1}But the problem is how are
you going to go about making

214
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:07,060
{\an1}it even sexier than
it already is?

215
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,228
{\an1}There's only one man who
holds the key to that!

216
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,400
{\an1}Anyway, that's it!

217
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:22,334
{\an1}I see. So you're practicing
a new jutsu, huh?

218
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,969
{\an1}Yeah, but I've hit
a really big wall.

219
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:28,170
{\an1}Please, Sensei! If I'm gonna
be able to get over it, then

220
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:29,438
{\an1}I'll need your help!

221
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,339
[whimpering]

222
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:34,507
{\an1}<i>It's so unlike Konohamaru to</i>
<i>be this determined. Well, I</i>

223
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,342
{\an1}<i>have no choice but to do</i>
<i>my best to help him!</i>

224
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,109
{\an1}Of course I'd be happy to
help you, Konohamaru!

225
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:43,879
{\an1}What exactly is it that
you want to know?

226
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,278
About sexiness!

227
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,379
{\an1}I want you to teach me
everything that you know

228
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,747
about sexiness!

229
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:52,649
{\an1}Oh. Yes, of course. All I
know about sexiness.

230
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:55,617
{\an1}Wait, what?! Did you say
sexiness just now?!

231
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,219
{\an1}Big Brother Naruto
told us...

232
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,820
[laugh]

233
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,721
{\an1}If Old Man Jiraiya is the
all-out-in-the-open pervert,

234
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:05,355
{\an1}then you're the closet
pervert, Ebisu Sensei!

235
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:10,325
{\an1}Gah! That Naruto and his
big, dumb mouth!

236
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,659
{\an1}You're the only one I
can turn to, Sensei!

237
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,961
{\an1}I need that secret side of
you to come out in the open!

238
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,261
But, I, uh...

239
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,263
{\an1}We found something,
Konohamaru!

240
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:22,196
What?!

241
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,064
{\an1}Looks like a secret
textbook!

242
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,999
No!

243
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,033
{\an1}Hey, look! There's more!

244
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,634
No!

245
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,669
Here, too! Oh,
and over here!

246
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:36,403
Wow, there's so
many of them.

247
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:39,572
{\an1}This is great! It's like a
secret library or something!

248
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:43,741
{\an1}And look! There's stacks of
textbooks in the attic, too!

249
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,475
{\an1}We should check under
the floorboards!

250
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:51,278
{\an1}Thank you, Ebisu Sensei!

251
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,179
{\an1}This is way more than
we ever imagined!

252
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:56,547
{\an1}Now you can continue
your training!

253
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,249
<i>That look...</i>

254
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,685
{\an1}<i>Behind those eyes, the</i>
<i>eyes of an innocent girl.</i>

255
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:12,088
{\an1}<i>The feeling lurking</i>
<i>there was contempt!</i>

256
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:21,926
{\an1}Awesome! There's so
many different kinds!

257
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,261
{\an1}Boy, closet perverts don't
mess around, do they?

258
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:27,562
{\an1}I think I'm starting to see
Sensei in a different light.

259
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,897
{\an1}The problem now is that
there are way too many of

260
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,264
{\an1}them to choose from.

261
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,465
{\an1}How about this one?

262
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,164
[chuckle]

263
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,301
{\an1}Well, it does have
the rotation part.

264
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,602
{\an1}I'll try it! Here goes!

265
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,539
[giggle] Uh...

266
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,273
{\an1}You're not good at that.

267
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,240
{\an1}Anyway, time to do
the real jutsu now!

268
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,442
{\an1}Right! Here goes!

269
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:01,379
This time...

270
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,014
I'll do it!

271
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,615
Idiot! Idiot!

272
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,083
[giggle] So?
How's this, huh?!

273
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:15,084
{\an1}This time, I'm gonna
do it for real!

274
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,086
I saw something
go bloop just now.

275
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,721
{\an1}You're right! It's different
than it was before!

276
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,088
Hm...

277
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,224
{\an1}Wait, that's right, when
Big Brother Naruto burst it...

278
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,258
Oh! Wow!

279
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,293
{\an1}The surface of his
balloon went bloop like

280
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:32,794
{\an1}this one just did.

281
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:35,995
{\an1}Then, go on! Try it again
but with some more finesse!

282
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,462
Okay! Yeah!

283
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:39,031
{\an1}I'm gonna do this!

284
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,034
[grunting]

285
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,068
How was that?!

286
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,770
{\an1}No way, you actually
did it, Konohamaru!

287
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:55,271
{\an1}I mean, it's a little
different, but...

288
00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,240
{\an1}Okay, so we get to move on
to step two now, right?

289
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:02,074
{\an1}Oh, man! [giggle]

290
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,976
{\an1}It was worth it, training
hard while you were away in

291
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,209
the Hidden Sand,
Big Brother!

292
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:09,245
Yeah! On to the
next step, then!

293
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,078
{\an1}Now, for the second step.

294
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,379
Use this!

295
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,113
A rubber ball?

296
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:19,684
{\an1}Yeah, exactly! What you do
is "guh" it and then "boom"

297
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,350
it to burst it!

298
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:23,786
That's it!

299
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,520
{\an1}Not this again! Although
I expected it!

300
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,154
{\an1}That's really all I get
about step two?!

301
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,856
{\an1}Now, don't be like that,
Konohamaru.

302
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,957
This jutsu...

303
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,824
{\an1}Just has to be learned by
doing it, is that it?

304
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,358
See? You get it!

305
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,827
{\an1}But I wish I could stick around
and supervise your training.

306
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,028
{\an1}Uh... You just got back and
now you're going out on

307
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,596
{\an1}another mission?!

308
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,296
{\an1}From this last mission, we
learned that Orochimaru had

309
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,665
{\an1}a spy embedded with Sasori.

310
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,932
Orochimaru?!

311
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,333
So, then?

312
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:56,367
{\an1}If things go well on this
next one, we might find a

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,168
{\an1}clue about Sasuke.

314
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,270
{\an1}We're gonna lure the spy out
and make him talk!

315
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,905
{\an1}<i>He's so casual about it, but</i>
<i>this mission has to be an</i>

316
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,872
{\an1}<i>A-rank or higher.</i>

317
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,908
{\an1}<i>Big Brother really</i>
<i>is amazing.</i>

318
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:10,207
Huh?

319
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:13,743
{\an1}Don't worry! I've got
natural talent, so I don't

320
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,277
{\an1}need your help, Big Brother!

321
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,612
{\an1}Good luck on your mission!

322
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,279
{\an1}[chuckle] Thanks!

323
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,447
<i>I'm gonna keep</i>
<i>getting better, too!</i>

324
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,781
{\an1}<i>I'm gonna do this!</i>

325
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:28,450
{\an1}This jutsu's really hard,
isn't it?

326
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:30,517
{\an1}You've gotta get the power
right. You said that's what

327
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,785
{\an1}this step's about.

328
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,019
[sigh]

329
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,219
{\an1}Man, the rubber ball is a
whole lot harder! Because

330
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:38,254
{\an1}it's empty, I can't
get the feel of it!

331
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:41,289
{\an1}So what should we use
as a reference this time?

332
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,790
{\an1}I'm positive that
this one's better!

333
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,059
{\an1}No way! It's this
one for sure!

334
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,660
{\an1}But my mom says that
guys have a weakness

335
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,361
{\an1}for ones like these! They
can't help themselves.

336
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:54,429
{\an1}Come on! For power,
it's gotta be this one!

337
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:57,230
{\an1}Actually, I think this woman
looks like the strongest.

338
00:17:57,263 --> 00:18:00,566
{\an1}We just can't seem to agree
on this one, can we?

339
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,935
{\an1}I think I get it. So, you
feel that you lost some

340
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,502
{\an1}respect due to something
that happened recently.

341
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,370
{\an1}That's right, and I just
don't know what I

342
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,204
{\an1}can do about it now.

343
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,238
{\an1}It's okay. Everyone
makes mistakes every

344
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,673
now and again!

345
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:19,475
{\an1}You know, there's always a
chance to put things right.

346
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,142
{\an1}Thank you, Iruka.

347
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:24,044
{\an1}I say for now, we should
just calmly support

348
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,277
{\an1}Konohamaru and his progress.

349
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,379
[chuckle]

350
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,346
There you are!

351
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,781
{\an1}We've been looking for you!

352
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:34,815
{\an1}Well, well! What perfect
timing! We were just

353
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,449
{\an1}talking about you!

354
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,951
{\an1}Please, Ebisu Sensei,
there's something else we

355
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,618
{\an1}need you to help us with!

356
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,151
{\an1}It's really important!

357
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,719
What, me again?!

358
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,487
{\an1}This is perfect! What a
wonderful opportunity!

359
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,255
{\an1}This is your chance to
regain their trust!

360
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:50,590
You guys!

361
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:52,858
Don't tell me!

362
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,092
Wha-?!

363
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:55,925
[giggle]

364
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,292
{\an1}What do you think?

365
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,028
{\an1}I'm not holding anything
back! [chuckle]

366
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:03,663
{\an1}Which girl do you think...

367
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:05,064
...Is the best?

368
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,998
{\an1}Please! You gotta tell us!

369
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:11,500
[screaming]

370
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:19,303
{\an1}What?! Such depravity!
In public?!

371
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,405
{\an1}I won't tolerate this, this...

372
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:24,807
{\an1}...this, immoral behavior!

373
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,444
{\an1}What in the world are
you fools up to?!

374
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:34,944
But we had to!

375
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:37,113
{\an1}To master my new jutsu,
I had to find a way

376
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,180
{\an1}to make it even sexier.

377
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:42,281
{\an1}Is what he's saying true,
Ebisu Sensei?

378
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,949
I've no idea!

379
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,518
{\an1}However, a jutsu is like a
secret weapon for a ninja!

380
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,418
{\an1}It's not something
you use recklessly,

381
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,352
{\an1}not even a Sexy Jutsu!

382
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:55,088
{\an1}You hold it in until the
last minute, and, only then,

383
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,522
{\an1}release it! And that's
how you get the

384
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,556
{\an1}maximum result out of it!

385
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,825
{\an1}Hold it 'til the last minute,
and only then release it?

386
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:02,892
Huh?

387
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:04,325
Ebisu Sensei!

388
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,726
{\an1}What's the matter now?!

389
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,627
{\an1}Is this what you're
talking about?

390
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:13,763
{\an1}Hold it with "guh", then
burst it with "boom!"

391
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,332
[screaming]

392
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,734
{\an1}Well, that definitely
looked powerful!

393
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:21,801
Awesome!

394
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,368
{\an1}Leave it to Ebisu Sensei
the closet perv!

395
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:27,137
{\an1}I can do this! Hold it,
with "guh", then

396
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,705
{\an1}burst it with "boom"!

397
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:30,906
[power yell]

398
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:31,906
Boom!

399
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:33,907
Uh?

400
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,874
{\an1}Hey! It expanded right
away that time!

401
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:37,308
{\an1}Yeah! It's working!

402
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,609
{\an1}But it still didn't burst!

403
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:44,012
{\an1}<i>Big Brother Naruto is just</i>
<i>so far ahead of me!</i>

404
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:48,980
{\an1}<i>Even now, he's out there</i>
<i>trying to get stronger.</i>

405
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,282
<i>So I will, too!</i>

406
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,350
Ouch!

407
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,317
{\an1}Are you okay, Konohamaru?!

408
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:03,353
{\an1}This is bad. Your hand is
a mess from all of that

409
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,888
{\an1}compressed chakra.

410
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,222
{\an1}I'll take care of
it right now.

411
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:09,490
{\an1}It was bound to take its
toll on you. You've been

412
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,491
{\an1}training for days
on end, you know!

413
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,962
Damn it!

414
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,510
{\an1}I wasn't strong enough to
bring him back. Next time,

415
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,246
{\an1}with my Wind Chakra, I'll be
able to surpass Sasuke!

416
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:04,579
You're so cool,
Big bro Naruto!

417
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:08,281
{\an1}And that is exactly why
you're my rival!

418
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:10,282
So how are you
doing, Konohamaru?

419
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:15,352
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Naruto's Rival"

420
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:19,120
{\an1}Here I go! Hold it in with a
"guh!" and "boom"!
