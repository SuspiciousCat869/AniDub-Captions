 <i>(Sai) To think, Shikamaru had</i>
 <i>this many reinforcements</i>
 <i>prepped.</i>

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.733 position:7% line:77% align:start
Although that's just what I'd
expect out of a coward like
him.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you've misunderstood, so
I'll set you straight.

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:17.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
We all barged in here of our own
free will.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.943 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that Shikamaru is
hiding something.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:23.343 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:28.148 position:7% line:83% align:start
And it must be fairly serious,
for him to act alone like this.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:33.788 position:24% line:77% align:start
Will you go look into it,
Temari? Take as many others as
you think will be necessary.

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure? Shikamaru's
a Hidden Leaf shinobi.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.428 position:16% line:77% align:start
The age of drawing lines
between villages is
over.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:45.365 position:10% line:83% align:start
We need him in the Alliance.
It's only natural to help.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.672 position:10% line:77% align:start
And besides, I'm pretty sure
Kakashi would just give me the
runaround.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:52.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll drag it out of him.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know you understand, but do
it as peacefully as possible.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Of course I'll
do it peacefully!

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:01.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
As much as I can.

 <i>(Kakashi) And?</i>

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:07.421 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there something else you
wanted to ask?

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.757 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right now, Shikamaru's...[gasps]

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.669 position:5% line:77% align:start
Anyway, we rushed over here as
soon as we heard that
Shikamaru was in trouble.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:25.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
Out of friendship, right? Oh,
I'm gonna cry.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.273 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Temari) Just wait.</i>

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.008 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.812 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll make you cry so hard
you'll wish that you couldn't.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.580 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just leave Sai to me.

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:34.148 position:5% line:89% align:start
He is strong, you know.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:36.416 position:47% line:89% align:start
M-hm. Oh, I know.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.755 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but you're really
no match for me, Ino.

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:42.824 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let me take on the old man!

Who'd you just call a brat,
huh?

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:29.570 position:13% line:77% align:start
Your name is Soku, right?
You really should be present
and supporting Shikamaru.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
So what the hell
are you doing?

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:36.077 position:21% line:77% align:start
Like, all I did was
choose a leader who could make
me realize my full potential.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:43.584 position:7% line:77% align:start
Remaining under the leadership
of a weakling like Shikamaru is
like, too tedious and pointless!

Hmph!

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:53.360 position:5% line:77% align:start

Too late?

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:21.454 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just what the hell does that
even mean?

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:29.496 position:7% line:77% align:start
That wasn't bad! But if you're
already this out of breath
against just one opponent...

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.666 position:13% line:89% align:start
you don't stand a chance.

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.035 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please, Sai! You gotta wake
up!

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:37.271 position:13% line:77% align:start
Don't you think you should
worry about yourself instead
of me?

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:40.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you remember what you
wrote? You said...

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:44.111 position:24% line:77% align:start
"I don't even know myself
anymore," in the last message
that you sent to the Leaf.

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:49.250 position:5% line:77% align:start
I now have the will that Lord
Gengo has bestowed upon me.
And that means...

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:51.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
that I'm not lost any
longer!

Uh, oh.

Did I overdo it? I can't
sense his chakra at all.

[grunting]

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:23.017 position:21% line:77% align:start
You could say that causing
whomever I target to misread
chakra...

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.187 position:44% line:83% align:start
is exactly what my
specialty is all about.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why would I ever say that?
What are you talking about?

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:36.496 position:13% line:77% align:start
I'm certain that right around
now, Shikamaru will be bowing
down in front of Lord Gengo.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:23.938 position:5% line:77% align:start

handle a really big assignment

Huh? Oh, good.

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:30.310 position:5% line:77% align:start
Uh, Sir, you're being too
stiff and formal again, don't
you think?

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:33.246 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't forget the clouds! The
clouds, sir!

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:35.248 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah.

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:38.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'm really
busy right now. See ya!

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.319 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:42.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.058 position:7% line:89% align:start
What was that, Lord Shikamaru?

00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:47.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] The thing about
clouds is, you can't grab them.

00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:50.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can try, but it's not gonna
happen.

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:05.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's nothing important, but, I
was wondering if you um, well.

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:07.715 position:27% line:89% align:start
What is it? Spit it out!

00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:12.520 position:5% line:77% align:start
Maybe when you slap people,
you could go a bit easier, all
right?

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:15.890 position:13% line:77% align:start
Look, if you space out again,
I'll slap you as hard as I
want!

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:19.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh. Well, good. I'm
counting on you for that.

I really felt your kindness.

Beautiful? Oh, uh.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:47.454 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'd like to thank you properly.
If you'd allow me to do so, that
is.

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:50.591 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh! Well, then, uh.

00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:57.497 position:41% line:83% align:start
Ino, now you're the
one being awkward.

00:19:57.532 --> 00:20:00.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
How about sometime,
we, uh...

00:20:01.102 --> 00:20:03.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
Have dinner or
something like that?

00:20:03.137 --> 00:20:04.072 position:75% line:89% align:start
A date?

00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:04.872 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:05.773 --> 00:20:07.608 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to ask me out
on a date?

00:20:08.176 --> 00:20:10.178 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, uh, yeah.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.982 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see. A date, huh?

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:16.851 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, you don't want to?

00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:18.720 position:55% line:83% align:start
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:20.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Uh.

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.690 position:33% line:89% align:start
Be prepared.

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:25.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
A date with me could really be
a drag.

00:20:26.828 --> 00:20:27.662 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:31.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have a plan in
mind, Lord Shikamaru?

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:32.567 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.602 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like, a strategy for the date?

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't need one, do I?

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:41.441 position:5% line:77% align:start
Going on a first date without a
strategy would be like trying to
fight a Tailed Beast unarmed.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have zero chance of
winning that way.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:47.148 position:7% line:83% align:start
What would you two know about
it?

00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:50.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
What exactly do you mean
by that, Lord Shikamaru?

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:52.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do know a thing or
two about relationships.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.389 position:5% line:77% align:start
Find out all you can about
Lady Temari's likes and
dislikes...

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
and use them to carefully
construct a plan.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
You need like at least three
contingency plans...

00:21:01.062 --> 00:21:03.330 position:10% line:83% align:start
for a sunny day, a cloudy day,
and a rainy day!

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:06.033 position:13% line:83% align:start

won't bore her.
