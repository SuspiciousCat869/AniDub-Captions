1
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:32,273
-Will you spit it out?

2
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,774
What do you mean
destroying the village?

3
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:34,409
Come on!

4
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,377
That's old news!

5
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:38,113
-I mean the present village.

6
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,516
-Present village?

7
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:41,517
Wait!

8
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,488
That means, m'lady.

9
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,390
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

10
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,658
-No way.

11
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,194
Sorry, this whole conspiracy
thing just doesn't add up.

12
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,531
-OK, Sai has some
boss and he really

13
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,267
used to hare the
Third Hokage, but what

14
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:56,669
does that have to
do with destroying

15
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:59,472
the whole village
or Grandma Tsunade?

16
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,542
-Did you forget, Naruto?

17
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:04,745
Lady Tsunade was the
Third's favorite pupil.

18
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,321
-And it's not just Lady Tsunade.

19
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:14,390
She hand picked the entire
current Leaf hierarchy.

20
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,694
They embody the Third
Hokage's philosophy.

21
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,403
And you can bet Danzo is
none too pleased about that.

22
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:28,374
But even so, the vast majority
of people in the village

23
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:31,111
support the current
regime, so it'd

24
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,146
be quite difficult
to change things.

25
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:36,017
-The only way to shake
the current regime

26
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,685
would be to create
some sort of earth

27
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,289
shattering crisis
in the village.

28
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:44,027
Like when Orochimaru tried
to destroy the Hidden Leaf

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,550
village.

30
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:49,490
-Destroy the Leaf village?

31
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:15,221
-Danzo could be
conspiring with Orochimaru

32
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,690
to mount a fresh
attack on the Leaf.

33
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:20,394
And if they're
successful this time,

34
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:24,866
Lady Tsunade would certainly
be ousted as Hokage.

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,536
-You're saying that they wanna
wipe out the whole village just

36
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,404
for that?

37
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:31,140
SAKURA: It's not
the only reason.

38
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:32,910
After the current
regime falls, he'd

39
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,646
rebuild the village
as he envisions

40
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,316
and take center stage
as the new Hokage.

41
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,404
-The reason Danzo is
probably making his move

42
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:59,341
now is because three years have
passed since the last attack,

43
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,178
and Danzo thinks that's
enough time for Orochimaru

44
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:03,913
to have regained his strength.

45
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,283
YAMATO: Yes, that
could be part of it.

46
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,919
But Danzo also knows that
Orochimaru's position

47
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,356
is more precarious than before.

48
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,759
After all, he failed
the last time.

49
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,562
He's betting Orochimaru will
be willing to collaborate

50
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,563
with him.

51
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,799
Perhaps--

52
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,134
-When he attacks,
he'll get support

53
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,438
from inside the village.

54
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,140
-Exactly.

55
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,643
-Wait a minute.

56
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:32,282
You mean that Sai's
top secret mission--

57
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:32,846
-Maybe.

58
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,986
[theme music]

59
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:30,723
NARUTO: Wait a minute.

60
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:33,826
You mean that Sai's
top secret mission--

61
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,763
SAKURA: May be to join
Orochimaru's ranks

62
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,732
and become the conduit
between him and Danzo.

63
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:44,106
Danzo knew the odds were good
that we'd eventually encounter

64
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,610
Orochimaru, and that's why
he put Sai on our team.

65
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,613
-No way.

66
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:55,086
-Depending on what
might happen, I'm

67
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,823
afraid that we may have
to do something about Sai.

68
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,429
-You don't mean--

69
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,459
-Lord Orochimaru.

70
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:30,630
-I know.

71
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,698
It seems we're being followed.

72
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,005
-He might merely be pursuing us.

73
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,777
Or it might be a trap.

74
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,812
How do we proceed?

75
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,421
-Either way you look
at it, I do believe

76
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,958
this situation
calls for a corpse.

77
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,526
Am I right, Kabuto?

78
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,353
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Eliminate?

79
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,956
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sai.

80
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,024
SAKURA: But we can't.

81
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:23,627
Just like that?

82
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,630
-My clone is still
following them,

83
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:27,432
but we have no idea
what might happen.

84
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,038
We have to get on
their trail right away.

85
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:33,673
-But--

86
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:34,541
-All right.

87
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,909
Now you're talking.

88
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:36,643
Let's get going.

89
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,911
What?

90
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:46,375
-Naruto!

91
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:57,337
Naruto.

92
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,271
Are you OK?

93
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:06,849
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He still hasn't

94
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:10,053
recovered from all that damage.

95
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:12,756
-Captain Yamato.

96
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,291
-Sakura, there's no time.

97
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,460
-Captain, I know we need
to catch up to them as soon

98
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:28,809
as possible, but he's-- It's
just, in Naruto's condition,

99
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,877
he shouldn't--

100
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,079
YAMATO: Then we'll have
to leave him behind.

101
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,448
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Leave him?

102
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:37,419
How can he say that?

103
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,188
-He's a liability now.

104
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,290
Although he probably has
enough strength to make

105
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,893
it back to the village.

106
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,796
-Kakashi-sensei would
never talk like that.

107
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,932
-Sakura.

108
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:48,432
It's OK.

109
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:52,805
Let's go.

110
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,139
I'll be all right, Sakura.

111
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,414
I can keep up with you.

112
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,366
-Naruto!

113
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,405
-Sakura.

114
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,376
I think I know what
you're trying to say.

115
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,579
I've worked alongside
Kakashi many times

116
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,115
before in the ANBU
Black Ops, so I

117
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:17,383
know the kind of person he is.

118
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:24,525
And I know that I'm filling
in for him on this team,

119
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,527
but Kakashi and I
are quite different.

120
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,903
I'm sorry, but I can't
watch over you like him.

121
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:36,407
I can't laugh and say I'll
never let you get hurt.

122
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,914
-I will not allow
my comrades to die.

123
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:43,548
Trust me.

124
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,993
-You're no longer
ninja in training

125
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,394
who need to be
shielded from danger.

126
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,132
You're shinobi that must
surpassed Kakashi and bear

127
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,636
the Leaf on your shoulders.

128
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:01,971
We can't afford compassion.

129
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:20,393
If we stop now, we fail.

130
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:21,895
If we don't chase
after them now,

131
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,864
we'll never catch Orochimaru.

132
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:27,002
With Orochimaru, there's
no second chance.

133
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:44,990
-Sakura.

134
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,975
-OK.

135
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:02,144
-We can't waste any more time.

136
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,046
Naruto.

137
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,047
You strong enough?

138
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:15,860
-Always am.

139
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:20,966
All right.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,003
Let's do it.

141
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:25,405
-Naruto.

142
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,074
-It's OK.

143
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,252
If I go back to the village,
then everything we've done

144
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:39,256
would've been for nothing.

145
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:39,780
-Naruto.

146
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,336
-Well, all right then.

147
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,705
But if you cause any delay,
we'll have to leave you behind.

148
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,407
You understand that,
don't you, Naruto?

149
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,276
-You bet!

150
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,177
-Then let's move.

151
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,469
-Is that--

152
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,727
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
Well, Orochimaru.

153
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,697
I have to hand it to you.

154
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:06,575
-Naruto!

155
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:26,781
-Sakura!

156
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:40,331
Sakura.

157
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:54,648
Hey, Sakura.

158
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,557
Hey, what's wrong?

159
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,859
Are you all right?

160
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,295
What's that wound from?

161
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,346
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Chakra
from the Nine Tailed

162
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,247
fox must have entered
her through that wound

163
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:21,748
like a poison.

164
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,626
This isn't easy to heal.

165
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,564
Not even for a
skilled medical ninja.

166
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,934
Which only makes Naruto's
apparent immunity

167
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,236
to that chakra even
more astonishing.

168
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:50,249
-Oh, this was-- Um.

169
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:52,319
These are injuries
from Orochimaru.

170
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:52,953
It's OK though.

171
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:54,621
It doesn't really hurt.

172
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:57,458
I'll be fine in a sec.

173
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:58,726
-Well, all right?

174
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,797
Just don't push
yourself too hard, OK?

175
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,364
-Yeah.

176
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,909
-Let's take a little break.

177
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,780
Sakura is our team's
only medical ninja.

178
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,984
If she's not well, it could
jeopardize the whole mission.

179
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,519
-I said I'm fine.

180
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,422
If we don't hurry,
they might get away.

181
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,490
Captain.

182
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,758
What about what you said before?

183
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,362
-I'm sorry, but I can't
watch over you like him.

184
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:29,631
I can't laugh and say I'll
never let you get hurt.

185
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:39,976
You're no longer
ninja in training

186
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,313
who need to be
shielded from danger.

187
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:45,250
You're shinobi that must
surpass Kakashi and bear

188
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,519
the Leaf on your shoulders.

189
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:48,787
We can't afford compassion.

190
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,525
You're right.

191
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,395
I did say that, Sakura.

192
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,664
But we can't afford
to be too hasty.

193
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,532
After all, haste makes waste.

194
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,869
I mean, there's a big difference
between hurrying and just

195
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,337
being reckless.

196
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,474
NARUTO: Yeah, I agree.

197
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,541
Captain Yamato's right.

198
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:06,943
You're just too important.

199
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:09,446
You're the only medical
ninja on the team.

200
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,281
Not to mention your strength.

201
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,751
You're a monster.

202
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:14,652
You're a key part of
this whole mission.

203
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,921
-Can't you flatter me
without calling me a monster?

204
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:17,957
NARUTO: What?

205
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,891
I was just trying to
give you a compliment!

206
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:19,892
SAKURA: I don't wanna hear it!

207
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:20,793
NARUTO: You don't
like a compliment?

208
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:21,527
Sorry.

209
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,829
I was just-- OK, OK.

210
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:23,463
I stop.

211
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:23,964
I apologize!

212
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:24,664
YAMATO: Naruto.

213
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:25,832
-Mhmm?

214
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:28,469
-Since Sai's not with us,
you will be my partner

215
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,804
when we get into battle.

216
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:31,740
We should coordinate
our attack strategies

217
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,408
while we have the time.

218
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,411
Shall we?

219
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,613
-Yeah that's a good idea.

220
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,753
-They're not following
us any longer.

221
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:11,054
Our plan must've worked then.

222
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,324
-I think you're right.

223
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,492
-Ah, well.

224
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:18,931
At any rate, you did a
fine job as usual, Kabuto.

225
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,935
-I owe it all to
you, Lord Orochimaru.

226
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:25,940
With your constant guidance,
I've created countless corpses.

227
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,543
-We might have gone a tad
overboard, don't you think?

228
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,913
-Perhaps, but it's better
to be safe than sorry.

229
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,277
Oh yeah.

230
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,513
I had an idea Lord Orochimaru.

231
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,548
You might like it.

232
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,818
-Hm?

233
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:04,786
-What do you think about
having this one help

234
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,954
with our experiments?

235
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,697
Apart from serving as our
go between with Danzo,

236
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:17,402
he'll have lots of free time.

237
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:18,370
-Do as you see fit.

238
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,519
-So, they left a fake corpse.

239
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:32,921
Probably a jutsu from Kabuto.

240
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:41,331
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sure
enough, this injury's

241
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,034
almost impossible to heal.

242
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:45,703
The most I can do
is ease the pain.

243
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,314
-This should be far enough.

244
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:55,715
-We're gonna work here?

245
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:56,583
-Yes.

246
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:57,584
But before we do--

247
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:58,686
[static]

248
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,887
Hold on just a moment.

249
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,390
My wood clone is making
radio contact with me.

250
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,030
-Yes, that's right.

251
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,735
There's subtle and unnatural
stitching along the scalp.

252
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,437
It's barely even noticeable.

253
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:17,075
Otherwise, it's a
near perfect match.

254
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:19,578
If we hadn't
anticipated this, we

255
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:22,614
would've been completely fooled.

256
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:26,019
They found out I was
tailing them so quickly.

257
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:28,321
I was confident,
but I guess we'll

258
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:29,523
have to be even more discreet.

259
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,541
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): We're
dealing with Orochimaru.

260
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:47,312
There's no such thing
as too discreet.

261
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:48,847
NARUTO: Captain Yamato.

262
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,681
-Ah, yes.

263
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,982
That's all taken care of.

264
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:51,851
All right.

265
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,552
So what are we gonna do first?

266
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:56,523
-Before we work,
there's something

267
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,392
I think you need to know.

268
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:58,882
-Hm?

269
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,190
-The person who injured Sakura.

270
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,159
It was you, Naruto.

272
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:01,531
NARUTO: Hey, Sakura.

273
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,166
Isn't the Sai's sketchbook?

274
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,735
SAKURA: That's right.

275
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:05,736
-What's inside it?

276
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,605
-Don't ask me.

277
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:08,874
-He didn't write any words.

278
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:09,908
It's just pictures.

279
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:11,176
-Ah, Great.

280
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,046
Then how's that
supposed to help us?

281
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,149
-It might contain a clue
that could connect us to Sai.

282
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,584
SAKURA: Come to
think of it, this

283
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:19,620
is Sai's most prized possession.

284
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:21,723
Didn't he say it belonged
to his big brother?

285
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,224
NARUTO: Don't you
think those faceless

286
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,493
drawings are a little creepy?

287
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,130

Crossing Super Quiz!

290
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:45,485
Hello, and welcome
to another big show.

291
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:47,754
Let's kick it off and
meet today's challengers.

292
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,190
-Bring it on!

293
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:49,924
-Ha cha!

294
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,997
-Round one, Land of Waves.

295
00:22:55,997 --> 00:22:57,733
Hands on your buzzers.

296
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,737
A certain shinobi with the
nickname Demon of the Hidden

297
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:02,940
Mist got in
Kakashi's way when he

298
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:06,810
was heading to the Land of
Waves to escort Mr. Tazuna.

299
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:07,946
-Zabuza!.

300
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,481
YAMATO: Not finished yet.

301
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,182
One Shinobi was
picked up by Zabuza

302
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:13,119
and found his life
purpose fighting

303
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,954
as Zabuza's faithful servant.

304
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:18,058
He had kekkei genkai,
uses ice crystal mirrors,

305
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,760
has a sort of girlish face.

306
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:20,527
-Haku!

307
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,896
What?

308
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,030
YAMATO: Not finished yet.

309
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,790
The question is, who
were Gato's bodyguards?

310
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,459
The ones who disrupted
Tazuna's bridge construction?

311
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,027
-Do they even exist?

312
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:33,297
-I don't remember them at all.

313
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,532
YAMATO: Uh oh, time's up!

314
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:37,034
The correct answer
was Waraji and Zori.

315
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:39,437
-Nobody can know that!
