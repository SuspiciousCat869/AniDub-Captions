1
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,760
All right! We've
cornered him!

2
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:10,434
{\an1}This is what I come back
to after regaining
consciousness...

3
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,568
[gasp]

4
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:12,903
What's that?!

5
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:24,344
{\an1}You are indeed strong,
Pakura Sensei.

6
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,413
Maki?

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,081
Pakura Sensei?!

8
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,951
{\an1}Come on! Let me out!

9
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,590
{\an1}I've had it! I'm done! I'm
completely fed up! I'm gonna
explode any second now!

10
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:39,524
Hmph!

11
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,460
{\an1}You okay with that?!

12
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,561
{\an1}Please, we've got you
sealed with Lightning

13
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:46,330
{\an1}Style, exactly so
you can't explode.

14
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:50,133
{\an1}So just shut your trap!
Face it, you're nothing
but a dud!

15
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,536
{\an1}There's are no such thing as
a dud when it comes to art!

16
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,741
{\an1}No way, he's gonna explode?!

17
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,951
{\an1}What's happening?!

18
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,618
What's this?

19
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:18,022
Dan!

20
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:23,126
{\an1}I know... It looks like
someone has succeeded.

21
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:35,605
Hm?

22
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:40,775
{\an1}Naruto! The Jinchuriki are
gonna quit it! Looks like
Itachi did it!

23
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,178
[chuckle]

24
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,581
{\an8}<i>Thanks, Itachi!</i>

25
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:51,183
{\an1}We better get out! Time
for us to quit it!

26
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,452
Zip it! Come on!
We have to go!

27
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,800
Tell Ohnoki...

28
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,837
{\an1}He must secure the future of
the Allied Shinobi Forces!

29
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:18,273
Only then can he
come and tell me
all about it...

30
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,277
What the hell
is going on?!

31
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,285
{\an1}I see... It looks like
the bookworm has been
taken out...

32
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:41,492
{\an1}It was a dud... don't
scare us like that!

33
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,593
Bang!

34
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,496
{\an1}Nothing I do is a dud!

35
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,430
True art...

36
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,065
{\an1}...is indestructible!

37
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,639
{\an1}Scaring us like that...

38
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,876
[gasp]
Granny Chiyo!

39
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:15,153
{\an1}It seems at last I am
free of this cursed spell.

40
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,422
Pakura Sensei!

41
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:21,459
{\an1}Maki, make sure you
don't die in vain!

42
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:23,928
Sensei...

43
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,965
{\an1}You all have a future
to look forward to...

44
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,407
Looks like I can
finally die now...

45
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:42,843
Granny Chiyo!

46
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:44,845
Kankuro!

47
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,018
{\an1}I entrust you with the
Puppet Master techniques.

48
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,587
{\an1}I gladly accept....
Granny Chiyo.

49
00:05:56,888 --> 00:06:00,424
{\an1}Now there's no need to
play possum anymore!

50
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,370
{\an1}As I expected, it seems
that I'm able to move my
body freely now.

51
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:17,672
Can you undo the
barrier, Choza?

52
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:19,841
It's safe now.

53
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,876
{\an1}It looks that way...

54
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:25,245
{\an1}Hey! We don't need
the barrier now!

55
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,513
Yes sir!

56
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:32,350
{\an1}Choza, please forgive me.

57
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,854
{\an1}Those signs. Ghost
Transformation Jutsu...

58
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:41,191
{\an1}I understand. Please, go on
ahead and hurry to Lady
Tsunade's side!

59
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,862
{\an1}This jutsu that has killed
so many shinobi...

60
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:49,065
{\an1}I never imagined that it
would come in so handy in
a situation like this!

61
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,035
{\an1}Ghost Transformation Jutsu!

62
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,202
{\an1}It's just as I thought!

63
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,607
{\an1}Souls ascending after
release from the Reanimation
Jutsu are able to be

64
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,076
{\an1}controlled with this
jutsu as well.

65
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,845
{\an1}However, it doesn't seem
like you have a lot of time.

66
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,052
{\an1}So you'd better hurry!

67
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:15,120
Yeah...

68
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:19,123
{\an1}Farewell, Choza! Thank
you for everything!

69
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:27,630
{\an1}Wow. How cool! He flew
away just like a ghost!

70
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,167
{\an1}What is the Ghost
Transformation?

71
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,737
{\an1}It allows one to become a
living ghost who can then
possess and kill an enemy.

72
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,105
{\an1}Normally, that is.

73
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:41,642
{\an8}<i>Tsunade...</i>

74
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:50,149
{\an1}Reform is absolutely
necessary for the
future of our village.

75
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:53,119
{\an1}It is the only way to
minimize the loss of life.

76
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:55,921
{\an1}I know. You're right.

77
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,724
Please, help me
with it, Tsunade!

78
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,193
{\an1}Yes, whatever you need.

79
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,661
{\an1}What I really need is you.

80
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:06,329
Dan...

81
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,732
{\an1}Let's make all our
dreams come true!

82
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:11,967
Yes.

83
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,170
{\an7}<i>Our dreams as shinobi.</i>

84
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:22,176
What is this?
What's going on?

85
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,245
{\an1}Chakra from all the
Reanimated Shinobi is
fading rapidly!

86
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:29,648
{\an1}Reports are flooding in.
From every battlefield!

87
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:34,652
{\an1}The reanimated are all
turning back into souls.
Even the sealed ones.

88
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,421
{\an1}And the ones still fighting!

89
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:41,391
{\an1}The only way to explain
all of this is that the
Reanimation Jutsu has

90
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:43,761
{\an1}somehow been released.

91
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:47,964
{\an1}There's no mistake. The
Reanimation Jutsu has been
dispelled.

92
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:51,600
{\an1}Quick! Relay this
information to every
company!

93
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:55,937
{\an1}HQ reporting! The
Reanimation Jutsu's undone!

94
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:58,839
{\an1}I repeat... The Jutsu
is undone!

95
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,209
{\an1}Amazing! They're all
just disappearing!

96
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:07,213
{\an7}Good, but... Which
company managed to
pull such a thing off?

97
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,553
{\an1}You don't ever have
to forgive me.

98
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,991
{\an1}And whatever you do from
here on out, know this...

99
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:26,096
{\an1}No matter what, I will
love you always.

100
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,460
I...

101
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:22,776
Yugito...

102
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:24,410
Yagura...

103
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:26,213
Han...

104
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:28,347
Utakata...

105
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:30,282
Fuu...

106
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,684
Old bearded guy!

107
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:36,520
{\an1}Just leave this to us!

108
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:39,923
{\an1}They're all gone...

109
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,794
{\an1}Then this means that the
other battles are...

110
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,564
Curse Kabuto. He
has failed.

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,236
{\an1}Hey, what do you think
you're looking at, huh?

112
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,272
{\an1}Did you forget already?
You're fighting me!

113
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,842
As well as the
Noble Blue Beast!

114
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,445
{\an1}It looks like the
Reanimation Jutsu
has been released.

115
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,348
And...

116
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:09,948
What of it?

117
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:15,853
{\an1}What is that? That light
coming from him?

118
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,492
{\an1}The Susano'o is gone and the
debris from the Reanimation

119
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,961
{\an1}is swirling in a whirlwind
around him...

120
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:27,830
{\an1}Without a doubt, this means...

121
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:32,234
{\an1}Yes, it would appear that
the Reanimation Jutsu has
been released.

122
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,835
What?! It has?!

123
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:38,306
{\an1}But how? We haven't even
located Kabuto yet...
It's too soon!

124
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,408
{\an1}Even if Kabuto was
found... To be able
to stop this jutsu...

125
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,944
{\an1}Who could have done it?

126
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:50,283
{\an1}It doesn't matter! Whoever
did it is a hero who saved
the Shinobi World!

127
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:54,252
{\an1}It seems the heavens
haven't forsaken us yet!

128
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:58,088
{\an1}It appears that you
have able shinobi on
your side, too.

129
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:00,324
{\an1}It can't be helped...

130
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,592
{\an1}He planned for this?!

131
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,395
Stay on guard!

132
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,930
{\an1}He's planning a final strike
before he disappears!

133
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,731
So watch out!

134
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,901
{\an1}Fire Style: Dragon
Flame Caterwaul!

135
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,542
Water Style...

136
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,377
{\an1}No, it won't be in time!

137
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,281
[groaning]

138
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:30,748
Lady Hokage!

139
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,517
I'm all right!

140
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:37,688
{\an7}<i>[gasp] The 100 Healings</i>
<i>Jutsu has worn off!</i>

141
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:43,260
{\an8}<i>But...</i>

142
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:45,295
{\an8}<i>...we've won...</i>

143
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:55,370
Damn it!

144
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:08,814
{\an1}What just happened?!

145
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:11,350
{\an1}I thought that she had
completely lost
consciousness!

146
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,685
{\an8}<i>I couldn't move</i>
<i>anymore, so how?</i>

147
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,855
<i>It's been a long</i>
<i>time,Tsunade.</i>

148
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,324
It's me.

149
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:27,196
Dan... But how
are you here?!

150
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,932
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu
has been undone.

151
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,934
I used my Ghost
Transformation Jutsu
to fly here.

152
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,970
{\an1}Although... that sure
was a close one!

153
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,938
But Dan...

154
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:41,308
{\an1}You haven't changed,
Tsunade.

155
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:45,011
I... I've always
tried to honor your-

156
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:46,511
There's no time.

157
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:51,016
{\an1}We can't wallow in
sentimentalities. 'Cause
I have to go soon.

158
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,251
{\an1}But, please, Dan...

159
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:58,621
{\an1}Who ever said it was a
shinobi's duty to watch his
comrades die one by one?

160
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,258
{\an1}I love this village and
the people in it with
all my heart.

161
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,394
{\an1}I want to protect them.

162
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,362
The person that
protects everyone.

163
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:10,032
To be Hokage,
that's my dream.

164
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,337
{\an1}Dan! For a long time
after your death,

165
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,605
{\an1}I kept running from all my
memories of you.

166
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,007
{\an1}But I've changed so much
since then, and now...

167
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,411
{\an1}All of your regrets. The
dreams you left behind.

168
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,479
I can make up
for everything!

169
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:32,583
I've even become
the Hokage!

170
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,085
But still...

171
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,953
{\an1}Thank you, Tsunade. But
please, don't worry.

172
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:40,623
{\an1}You're fulfilling my
dreams just fine.

173
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,861
{\an1}But it really seems that
I've caused you a lot of
pain, haven't I?

174
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,129
Sorry...

175
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,601
{\an1}I'll be waiting for you on
the other side. But don't
come too quickly, okay?

176
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:58,105
{\an1}For you, are my dream.

177
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:13,717
{\an1}I was able to protect
you in the end...

178
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,686
So it appears
something good...

179
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,988
...did come from
being reanimated.

180
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,364
{\an1}Hokage, you all right?!

181
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:34,936
{\an1}Your vitality has
returned... Did you
receive chakra?

182
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,737
{\an1}I got to see an old friend
for a little while...

183
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,041
{\an1}Well, you'll be with
them again soon enough.

184
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,444
{\an1}But what?! What is going on?

185
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,913
{\an1}Madara's chakra, which had
started to separate from

186
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,082
his body, is now
clinging fast to it.

187
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,551
{\an1}He's still reanimated?

188
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,220
{\an1}But how? Why won't
he disappear?!

189
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:58,821
{\an1}I thought the Reanimation
Jutsu was undone!

190
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:05,595
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu
is a jutsu that summons
back the dead.

191
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:07,796
{\an1}There is only one risk to it.

192
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,064
What risk?

193
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:14,068
{\an1}As long as they know the
correct signs to weave, a
reanimated Shinobi...

194
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:17,071
{\an1}can actually rescind
the Reanimation Jutsu's

195
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:20,006
{\an1}Summoning Contract
from their end.

196
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,543
They can rescind
the contract?!

197
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:27,980
{\an1}And when that happens, you
end up with the biggest
problem of all.

198
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,082
{\an1}An immortal body and
infinite chakra, on the move

199
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,585
{\an1}without any way to
control or restrain it.

200
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,287
{\an1}You don't mean...

201
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:44,727
{\an1}Tell the jutsu caster to
never use a Forbidden
Jutsu like this carelessly!

202
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,829
{\an1}Reanimation Jutsu, release!

203
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:07,946
What is a clan?

204
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,885
{\an1}What is a village?

205
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,156
{\an1}What is a shinobi?

206
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,471
What am I?

207
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,713
Ha! Found ya!

208
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:50,781
[chuckle]

209
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,351
It's you two...

210
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:58,322
{\an1}That's right. But what're
you doing here, anyway?

211
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:01,490
{\an1}Putting a stop to the
Reanimation Jutsu.

212
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:02,757
Huh?!

213
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,195
{\an4}You've always been like
this, you know that? You
never really feel the need

214
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,564
{\an1}to explain things in
better detail, do you?

215
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:12,132
{\an1}Look, it's been a while
since we've seen you,

216
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,134
{\an1}so just tell us what
you've really been doing!

217
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:17,338
Heh?

218
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,339
What?

219
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:22,874
It's Kabuto...

220
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:27,912
{\an1}Kabuto was the one who cast
the Reanimation Jutsu.

221
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,255
But how?! How is
this possible?!

222
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:43,626
{\an1}Your ridiculously juvenile
jutsu cannot hold me back.

223
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:47,762
{\an1}Don't you get it by now
after fighting me for all
this time?

224
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:52,966
{\an1}Now, then. You have seen
the Perfect Susano'o...

225
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,802
{\an1}And everyone who lays eyes
on it dies, or so they say.

226
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,009
{\an1}I'm almost embarrassed to
have to do this again. I
already used it once, but...

227
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,582
{\an1}My interest has waned
thanks to the interference.

228
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:13,751
{\an1}So perhaps I ought to go and
retrieve Nine Tails instead.

229
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:14,984
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

230
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:21,023
{\an1}Please, let all of us deal
with this Madara! I swear
we'll finish him off!

231
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,425
Rest assured and
leave this to us!

232
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:26,495
No!

233
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:35,503
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage! I'm sorry,
but this is beyond us! We
cannot stop him.

234
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:39,406
{\an1}We still have to fight him!
We must stop him right here!

235
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,410
{\an1}How pitiful you are.

236
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,179
Lightning Cable!

237
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,081
Guy!

238
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,249
Right!

239
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:54,117
{\an1}Take this! Pinky Attack!

240
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,689
[attacking yell]

241
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,468
{\an1}[chuckle] What's wrong?
You don't look too happy!

242
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,270
{\an1}What do you mean?

243
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:21,840
{\an1}Well, you're hiding your
face, so all I can really do
is take a guess at it.

244
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,443
{\an1}If you're actually calm
under there, take off that

245
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:27,346
{\an1}stupid mask and prove
it to me! Ya fool!

246
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,282
[chuckle]

247
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,717
{\an1}Nice going, Naruto!

248
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,753
{\an1}[sigh] I told him not to
aggravate the man.

249
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,326
{\an1}I have no choice...
I have to use this.

250
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:46,427
What is that?!

251
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:49,797
{\an1}Uh, looks like a giant
gourd and a jar...

252
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,535
{\an1}I would have preferred
bringing it back in a
completed state, but...

253
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:07,112
{\an1}It is only a fragment, but
it is not lacking in power.

254
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:21,957
{\an1}It's taking too long. And
now's the time!

255
00:22:56,837 --> 00:23:01,407
{\an1}<i>We found something</i>
<i>incredible in one of the</i>
<i>hideouts. Take a look at it!</i>

256
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,042
{\an1}<i>This is it! The all-knowing.</i>

257
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:07,512
{\an1}<i>I need to get out of here to</i>
<i>meet up with someone. I'm</i>
<i>leaving.</i>

258
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,614
<i>Huh? Meet who?</i>

259
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,048
<i>Orochimaru.</i>

260
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:14,283
{\an1}<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>You killed Orochimaru!</i>

261
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:20,355
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Orochimaru's</i>
<i>Return."</i>

262
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:24,226
{\an1}<i>Are you surprised that</i>
<i>someone as tenacious as</i>
<i>him might not be dead?</i>
