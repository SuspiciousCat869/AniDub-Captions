1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,313
-That came a lot
closer than I thought.

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,282
[laughter]

3
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,619
-Fuen needs lessons in
how to set a good trap.

4
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,270
-Their skill's unbelievable.

5
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,613
We may be out of our depth here.

6
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,070
-Did any of those get him?

7
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,012
-Not quite.

8
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,650
-Come on, then.

9
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,297
-Laughable!

10
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,067
You can't run forever.

11
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:43,503
Earth style.

12
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,338
Stone plate coffin.

13
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,520
That's the end of that.

14
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,669
Well, you've earned a
grave marker, at least.

15
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,582
Dammit, Fuen.

16
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,350
I broke a sweat 'cause of you.

17
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,709
-You should never
overestimate your own jutsu.

18
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,711
Always make sure
that the job is done.

19
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,250
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): But
what's their game here?

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,519
After stealing the
bodies, they deliberately

21
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,421
attract attention
as they escape.

22
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,528
-Maybe they're after one of
us from the Leaf Village.

23
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,532
That could mean Danzo
has a hand in it all.

24
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,434
[theme song]

25
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,177
-It looks like we're trapped
in the middle of the enemy's

26
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,645
jutsu, huh?

27
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,314
First thing we should
do is locate the others.

28
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,049
They've probably
regrouped nearby.

29
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,021
-I'm gonna go find
your idiot friend.

30
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,289
-Hey, wait a second, will ya?

31
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,024
-I'll be fine on my own.

32
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,760
You'll just slow me down.

33
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,128
-Oh, boy.

34
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,629
So much for working together.

35
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,298
We're all off on our own now.

36
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,001
Oh, well.

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,269
Can't be helped.

38
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,538
I doubt he's had the team
training that Naruto and I have

39
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,373
had.

40
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:44,211
Come to think of it, Naruto
flunked that course, didn't he?

41
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,284
-All right.

42
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,152
What's her deal?

43
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,558
-Ugh.

44
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,160
Manual labor.

45
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,696
Not really my cup of tea.

46
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,334
The traps in this place were
supposed to do the work for me.

47
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,402
I guess I have no choice.

48
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,438
Let's make it a
quickie, shall we?

49
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,405
-Don't worry.

50
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,007
It'll be quite, all right.

51
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,009
I guarantee you that.

52
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,676
Let's go!

53
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,686
What in the blue
blazes was that?

54
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,021
-Oh, my.

55
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,690
The taste leaking from
your chakra network.

56
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,259
Who knew?

57
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,695
So you're one of the rare
few with wind-based chakra.

58
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,064
-What about it, you lunatic?

59
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,001
-You'll make for a nice
addition to my collection.

60
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,469
-What?

61
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,703
-What do you prefer, kid?

62
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,007
French or traditional?

63
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:47,674
-What do you mean?

64
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,276
Like food?

65
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,176
-Cutie.

66
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,178
I meant kissing.

67
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,582
-Wait, you're saying-- ahh!

68
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,551
You saying you want
to make out with me?

69
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,586
-That's right, hun.

70
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,421
You think you can handle it?

71
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,592
I mean, you have been
kissed before, haven't you?

72
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,326
-Come on!

73
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,560
Are you kidding me?

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,495
Don't be ridiculous.

75
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,663
Of course I have!

76
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,339
I know it was a guy, but still.

77
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,573
-Really?

78
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,741
Whatever.

79
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,611
Anyway, how about having
a little fun with me?

80
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,378
-Yuck.

81
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,147
No freaking way, lady.

82
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,583
Women like you are
nothing but trouble!

83
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,519
-I don't believe it.

84
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,555
He turned me down.

85
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,291
-What the heck is
wrong with this chick?

86
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,160
I've heard of easy,
but this is ridiculous.

87
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,031
-You never want to disappoint
a lady, sweetie-pie.

88
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,036
Now, you are mine.

89
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,242
-No way.

90
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,144
Can't we talk about it?

91
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,112
-Reaper kiss.

92
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,762
What?

93
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,594
-Not bad.

94
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,996
A little on the
cold side, maybe.

95
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,331
But you've got soft
lips, that's for sure.

96
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,667
-Your last moments would
have been sheer bliss

97
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,303
if you had just held
still for a minute.

98
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,006
-Good luck finding the real me!

99
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,208
-Well, now you've gone
and ticked me off, kid.

100
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,549
-This isn't merely
some genjutsu.

101
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,252
I designed this
terrain and summoned it

102
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,489
into being, calling it forth
from another dimension.

103
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,268
Run, if you wish.

104
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,638
However, escape is impossible.

105
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,474
-I'm not stupid enough to
fight in a terrain created

106
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,142
by the enemy.

107
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,153
-There's no point in hiding.

108
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,687
Skulk about all you want.

109
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,689
My eyes will be on you.

110
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,360
After all, I've already
left my mark on you.

111
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,298
I know where you're going.

112
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,267
Almost before you do.

113
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,017
SAI (VOICEOVER): Am I safe?

114
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,226
-I need to find the others fast.

115
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,160
I'd better get moving.

116
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,506
-Off in that direction, are you?

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,301
-What?

118
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,616
How could they possibly
know where I am now?

119
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,552
And why are there traps
waiting everywhere I go?

120
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,730
-I think this little game
has gone on long enough.

121
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,527
How unfortunate.

122
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,234
Every move you make
shows up on the design

123
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,969
plans I carry with me.

124
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,374
Earth style, spears of stone!

125
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,794
Farewell.

126
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,409
-Ninja art, super beast scroll.

127
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,148
-Spears of stone!

128
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,328
Clever boy.

129
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,029
He got away.

130
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,501
But don't I look the fool.

131
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,538
Well, I guess if he's
capable of outmaneuvering me,

132
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,773
perhaps he might be more of a
challenge that I first thought.

133
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,683
-Hm?

134
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,417
Hardly the time to be standing
watch over an old man.

135
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,194
-Huh?

136
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,566
A message at this hour?

137
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,274
[oinking]

138
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,376
-Shizune, what have you got?

139
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,711
-An owl, ma'am.

140
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,580
A Blakiston's fish owl, I think.

141
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,082
-That's not what I meant.

142
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,483
What is it doing here?

143
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,684
-Oh.

144
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,654
Uh-- it's an urgent message
from the Fire Temple.

145
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,192
Team Kakashi was ambushed
while pursuing the enemy.

146
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,094
-Why didn't you say sooner?

147
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,338
-I've already dealt
with one of them.

148
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,340
-Well, unlike your
opponent, mine

149
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,410
was a young man with
some actual fight in him.

150
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,678
-Did he get away?

151
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,316
-The labyrinth that I created
is absolute perfection.

152
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:47,253
They'll never make it out alive.

153
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,254
-You sure about that?

154
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,760
-They've barely had a
taste of what's to come.

155
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,130
If anyone survives they'll
deserve a standing ovation.

156
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,578
-This smell-- it's sulfur.

157
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,113
It doesn't seem to be poisonous.

158
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,093
Sai!

159
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,667
-Ninja art, super beast scroll!

160
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,722
-Sai, you all right?

161
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,399
Sai, try not to move.

162
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,034
Looks like your arm's broken.

163
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,504
This is gonna hurt.

164
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,705
Try and bear with me.

165
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,648
That should do it.

166
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,317
Now, for the spider venom.

167
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,084
Don't worry.

168
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,520
It's not that toxic.

169
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,723
I'll neutralize the poison, OK?

170
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,726
-So, were you moved just now?

171
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,128
-Huh?

172
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,664
-You were moved, weren't you?

173
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:39,732
Enough to save me.

174
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,577
-What's that?

175
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,146
Guide to self-sacrifice?

176
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,047
-Yes.

177
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,349
It's been a help to me.

178
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,585
According to this book, if
you want to endear yourself

179
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,189
to people, nothing works more
than laying down your life

180
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,190
for them.

181
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,192
Particularly when
it comes to women.

182
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,295
Perhaps it'll work
on Naruto, too.

183
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,329
-Huh?

184
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,197
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,431
All right.

186
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,267
Zip it.

187
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,167
[scream]

188
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:22,441
-You've had some luck, but
now I'm angry, little boy.

189
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,210
-Ready to fight now, huh?

190
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:24,744
OK.

191
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,145
Now you're talking.

192
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,648
-Yeah, show us
what you got, lady.

193
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,716
-You don't think you can
lock lips with all of us,

194
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,318
now, do you?

195
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,687
-Fire style, phoenix
flower jutsu!

196
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,197
Like I said.

197
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,333
Just a boy.

198
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,169
Now, I wonder where
the real one is hiding.

199
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,047
-Wait.

200
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,181
Did I get her?

201
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,522
What the-- oh, hell.

202
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,490
Where'd she go?

203
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,592
I don't get it.

204
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,460
I'm almost positive
I tagged her.

205
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,062
[laughter]

206
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,332
-Earth style, hidden
in stone jutsu.

207
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,467
You're plucky, that's for sure.

208
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,236
And your wind
chakra's formidable.

209
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,706
Can't wait to make it mine.

210
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,474
-Jeez, what are you, immortal?

211
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,144
Nobody gets up after I blast
them with the Rasengan.

212
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,312
-Your attacks are sloppy.

213
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,548
I can read them like a book.

214
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,549
But enough banter.

215
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,151
Those lips of
yours need kissing.

216
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,319
You ready, handsome?

217
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,487
-Sorry.

218
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,190
I don't think I'm
as easy as you are.

219
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,658
-First I'm gonna
knock the words out

220
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,461
of that smart little
mouth of yours.

221
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,331
-Shadow clone jutsu!

222
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,733
-Oh, please.

223
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,667
More clones?

224
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,636
Not very creative.

225
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,240
Then I'll just go with-- water
style, mouth of the serpent.

226
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,591
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): She can use
earth, fire, and water chakra.

227
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,464
How can she have three?

228
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,000
-Lightning style, earth flash!

229
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:28,968
-Lightning?

230
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,363
What the-- four kinds of chakra?

231
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,072
Come on!

232
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,225
-What in the world is that?

233
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,379
Who are you?

234
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,449
-You're Sora, aren't you?

235
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,554
I've been waiting for you.

236
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,519
[music playing]

237
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,544
NARUTO: A woman's hair.

238
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:03,812
Feminine mystique.

239
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:04,913
Please.

240
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:07,615
What do I care about
any of that stuff?

241
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,453
At any rate, she's got earth,
fire, water, lightning,

242
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:12,520
and wind chakra.

243
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,656
That's all of them!

244
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,192
I've got my wind, too.

245
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,561
Time to put all that
training to good use.

246
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:20,662
Ah-- wait!

247
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:25,367
I haven't mastered any
wind-style jutsu yet!

248
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,902
Next time-- Contact.
