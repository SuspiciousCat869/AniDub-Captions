{\an1}We got all the rice balls
we could. I hope it's
enough.

00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:39,435
Thanks, but... There are
only two of us. We'll
never eat all of these!

9
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:41,904
{\an1}Well, then, I could
always eat some...

rebuild Ichiraku; maybe
if I do I'll get a free
bowl of ramen!

{\an1}Boy, you really do love
ramen, don't you?

00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,571
{\an1}Yeah! I need it to keep
up my strength!

They're all signs of the

{\an1}The chakra virus?

84
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:55,989
{\an1}It's an extremely
contagious virus of
mysterious origin; a

85
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,960
{\an1}nasty bug that turns
chakra into a fever.

{\an1}That's horrible!

87
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:04,000
{\an1}Yes. Once infected, you
can't infuse chakra for
several months after

grave disease.

But how did Naruto get
infected with this chakra
virus?

91
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,819
{\an1}There was an outbreak
recently in a village not
too far from here.

92
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:23,493
{\an4}The infected were
quarantined quickly,
and the virus was thought
to be contained.

93
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,731
{\an1}Are you telling me that's
where Naruto was sent on
his mission...?!

94
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:33,074
{\an4}Yes, the very same. I
think we can conclude
that Naruto is the source
of this outbreak.

95
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:37,847
{\an1}The way things stand now,
if the virus spreads,
it's inevitable that the

even more vulnerable.

300
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:53,147
{\an1}What?! Are you
kidding me?!

301
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:55,484
All's well that ends
well, kid.

302
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:58,088
{\an1}Nothing about this went
well at all!

303
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:05,264
{\an4}Cho, Cho, Cho, Choji, I'm
passing through and
bringing a piece of wood
to you!

304
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,300
Honestly...

305
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,270
{\an1}They're right that "Fools
never catch a cold..."

306
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:10,271
{\an1}<i>Oww! </i>

307
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:11,606
<i>Oh, sorry. </i>

308
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,275
{\an1}<i>Watch where you're</i>
<i>walking, would you? </i>

309
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,277
<i>Sure thing! </i>

310
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:16,113
{\an1}<i>Ow! </i>

311
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,115
[giggling]

312
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,617
{\an1}He sure knows how to stir
up trouble!

313
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,721
{\an1}<i>I'm the team captain</i>
<i>for this mission! </i>

314
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,658
{\an1}<i>I don't know,... maybe</i>
<i>Neji should lead us. </i>

315
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:05,764
{\an1}<i>You just pipe down! I'm</i>
<i>the captain, and that's</i>
<i>that! </i>

316
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:08,902
{\an7}<i>Calm down, Tenten. It's</i>
<i>just a D-rank mission. </i>

317
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:12,574
{\an1}<i>I can handle this! I'll</i>
<i>make sure this mission</i>
<i>succeeds! </i>

318
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:16,245
{\an1}<i>All right, you guys;</i>
<i>let's do this! </i>

319
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,785
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Deploy!</i>
<i>Team Tenten!</i>

320
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:23,022
{\an7}<i>You've got this all</i>
<i>wrong, guys... </i>
