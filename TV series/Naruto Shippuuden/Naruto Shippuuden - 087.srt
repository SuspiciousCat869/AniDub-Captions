you're overestimating him?

-Just the opposite.

88

-We received an offer from the
Land of Fire's Feudal Lord.

89
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,180
They want Shikamaru to be a
member of the feudal lord's

91
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,130
It seems he made quite
a good impression

92
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,230
when he was running
the last Chunin exam.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,140
The Lord's inner circle thought
he showed a lot of potential.

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,210
-You mean that he--

95
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,020
-That's right.

96
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,020
He'd be taking that
important first step

97
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,020
toward being a member of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

98
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,090
It's quite an honor.

he accept their offer?

the Feudal Lord's offer.

SHIKAMARU: Yeah.

you to see the world a little.

and I probably never will.

-I just-- how do I put it?

114
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,210
With Choji and Ino here in the
Leaf, the guys in my new squad,

115
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,060
and even Naruto, I
guess I'd rather just

116
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,200
stay close to home
in case they need me.

So you carry the Will
of Fire in you too.

talk about that.

to protect this village.

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,090
He didn't just randomly
separate me and Kakuzu.

166
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,080
He lured me here deliberately!

167
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,130
Which means this was all
part of his calculations.

168
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,010
-When you curse someone,
you dig your own grave.

169
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,060
You know why, don't you, pal?

170
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,150
-Enlighten me!

171
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,050
-If you curse someone
and take them out,

172
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,000
you'll also be defeated
in retribution.

173
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,170
And that's why you end up
digging your own grave.

174
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,050
-Ah!

175
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,060
-You cursed my Sensei dead.

176
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,010
Can't just let you keep
living, running around free.

177
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
-[gasping]

178
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,000
-That's your grave
you're hanging over.

179
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:27,230
HIDAN: [laughs] I won't die even
you if you dismember my body

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,170
and bury the pieces
six feet deep.

181
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,230
I'll just chew my way out
and come seeking your throat!

182
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,070
Huh?

183
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,020
What the-- deer?

184
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,110
-These woods are a special
place in the Land of Fire.

185
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,210
Only members of my Clan
are allowed in here.

186
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,110
Anyone else is forbidden.

187
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,000
Once you set foot in here, we
can watch you for eternity.

188
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,120
-You did well here, Shikamaru.

189
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,508
-Thanks.

190
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,130
-Hm?

191
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,210
Huh.

192
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:46,130
[music playing]

193
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,130
My Will of Fire I
entrust to you now.

194
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,170
-[sigh]

195
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,180
-Hey, what were you
just doing what that?

196
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,020
I'm talking to you!

197
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,110
-It's the Will of Fire.

198
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,120
The will to protect our village.

199
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,170
Farewell, Sensei.

200
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,000
-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

201
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,120
-Shadow Clones, huh?

202
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,100
So, you're the
Nine-Tails jinchuriki.

203
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,000
-Kakashi, bring us
up to speed on what

204
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,020
we're dealing with here.

205
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,130
What's the rundown?

206
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,220
-Both our opponents
are Akatsuki.

207
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,120
Shikamaru splintered
off with one

208
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,000
of them leaving the rest
of us to handle this guy.

209
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,220
He's able to split
into multiple entities.

210
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,010
See those two masks?

211
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,120
Not only can they
detach, but each one

212
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,110
has its own beating heart
and can act autonomously.

213
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,120
He originally started
out with five in total,

214
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,080
but now he's down to three.

215
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,070
-So two of them have been--

216
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,160
-That's right.

217
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,190
We've killed him twice already,
and he won't go down for good

218
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
until we get the other three.

219
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,010
Plus he's a mid-distance fighter
using several different changes

220
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,230
in chakra nature.

221
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,200
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): No wonder
Kakashi's had his hands full.

222
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,020
Naruto!

223
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,210
-Yeah, Yeah, I heard.

224
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,230
-Naruto, don't!

225
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,170
-A head on attack
won't work on this guy!

226
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,140
-Only Shadow Clones?

227
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,210
You'll never win that way.

228
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,160
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Based on his
assault speed and battle style,

229
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm going to need three clones
for the diversion alone.

230
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,170
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
He's at least

231
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,130
learned to tap into
his clone's experience

232
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,100
now and use that knowledge
to his advantage.

233
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,230
His mastery of them is evolving.

234
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,120
-[breathing]

235
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,210
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

236
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,090
-Hm?

237
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,210
Another trio of clones.

238
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,220
[music playing]

239
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,210
-What is that?

240
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,210
He's--

241
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,090
-Listen, that sound.

242
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,110
So-- so much chakra!

243
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,010
-Interesting.

244
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,000
Now what?

245
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,120
-This is as far as
I've ever gotten.

246
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,090
What am I supposed to do now?

247
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,070
-Well, let's see
what happens when

248
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,090
it collides with my Rasengan.

249
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,080
You ready?

250
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,090
-Huh?

251
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,170
Are-- Are you sure
that's a good idea?

252
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,070
What'll it do?

253
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,100
-If your jutsu is
near completion,

254
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,090
my Rasengan will
be canceled out.

255
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,130
All right, let's do it!

256
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,130
[music playing]

257
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,220
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): The Fourth!

258
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,080
KAKUZU (VOICEOVER):
What is that jutsu?

259
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I can't let it hit me,
or I'll be finished.

260
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,140
-Wind Style Rasen Shuriken!

261
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,150
[theme music]

262
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,230
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Look, I
know my teamwork is important,

263
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,030
but right now this is a bridge
I need to cross alone no matter

264
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,190
how dangerous it is.

265
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,020
If I don't work my
way to the other side,

266
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,150
I'll just be a kid forever.

267
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,140
So don't take away my chance
to prove what I can do!

268
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,040
Next time, "Wind
Style Rasen Shuriken!"
