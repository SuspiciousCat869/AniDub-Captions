1
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,580
-Can it be that you're--

2
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,982
-You finally
remembered, have you?

3
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,655
-Have we met somewhere before?

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,157
-It's no wonder
you're called a beast.

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,628
Your intelligence is
certainly subhuman.

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,563
Well, don't worry.

7
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,431
I'll refresh your
memory soon enough.

8
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,109
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Itachi.

9
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,547
-So.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,017
That's the one.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,721
The child who wiped
out his entire clan.

12
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,656
-Kakashi.

13
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,024
Naruto.

14
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,758
It's been awhile.

15
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,230
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
His Sharingan.

16
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,732
It's the same as Sasuke's.

17
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,936
So this is the guy who's been
hounding Sasuke and Naruto all

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:09,503
this time.

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,708
-I wasn't enough for you, huh?

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,843
You had to go after
Gaara as well.

21
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,473
I'll destroy every
last one of you.

22
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,314
-Everyone.

23
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,849
Whatever you do, don't
look him in the eyes.

24
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,688
[theme music]

25
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,131
-So he's an Akatuski.

26
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:06,213
-Water Style, Exploding
Water Shockwave!

27
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,481
-Get ready.

28
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,048
-All right.

29
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,032
-Ready or not, here I come.

30
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,413
-Itachi's genjustsu
is a visual jutsu,

31
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,150
which means, avoid
eye contact with him

32
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,186
and his jutsu can't take effect.

33
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,387
-Yeah, that I know.

34
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,957
-OK, but then, how are
we supposed to fight him?

35
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,331
-That's the tricky part.

36
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,766
Guy.

37
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,835
How did you fight Itachi?

38
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,703
-Hm?

39
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,807
There's only one way.

40
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,109
-You have to
anticipate his moves

41
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,044
by watching his feet, his body.

42
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,925
-But that's like fighting with
one arm tied behind your back.

43
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,460
-The Uchiha clan, eh?

44
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,732
It's been a long time since I've
gone up against the Sharingan.

45
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,534
Don't look so surprised.

46
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,470
I've been around, and I know
there's more than one way

47
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,040
to fight a visual
jutsu like that.

48
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:40,974
-Yeah?

49
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,642
Like what, then?

50
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,478
-If one against the
one, abandon the field.

51
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:50,183
If two against one, take
the rear, and he'll yield.

52
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,451
-What's that mean?

53
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,987
-Well, the first part
of it is pretty self

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,856
explanatory, isn't it?

55
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,593
The Sharingan can never be
beaten in single combat.

56
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,562
But, if you outnumber
the Sharingan user,

57
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,299
if the battle is two against
one, then even if one of you

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,702
is caught in his
genjutsu, the other

59
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:13,573
is free to strike from the rear,
breaking the genjutsu's spell.

60
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,376
Even if your attack from the
rear should fail somehow,

61
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,946
you're still free to strike
your comrade yourself

62
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,716
and break the genjutsu that way.

63
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,786
So, while one of us fights him
face to face as a distraction,

64
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,322
the rest of us will
mount a series of attacks

65
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,826
from the rear, where his
Sharingan can't reach.

66
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,394
-Good plan.

67
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,862
-I guess you learn
a lot of stuff

68
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,597
like that if you
live long enough.

69
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:43,737
Let's go.

70
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,871
I'll take the rear.

71
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,839
KAKASHI: Wait.

72
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,339
-Huh?

73
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:13,967
-You guys!

74
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,968
Look out!

75
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,069
-How about it?

76
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,504
Like it so far?

77
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,883
-Huh?

78
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,885
-Ah, you remember me now?

79
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,863
-Where in the world is all
this water coming from?

80
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,000
-This technique of his requires
a huge amount of chakra.

81
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,569
An incredible amount.

82
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,737
-OK, Sensei.

83
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,607
We're waiting, but what
are we waiting for?

84
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,811
-Do you have a problem with my
way of fighting the Sharingan?

85
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,847
Are you suggesting my
methods won't work?

86
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,881
-No.

87
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,985
They work fine against
ordinary genjutsu,

88
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,920
but what we're
dealing with here is

89
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,556
something much more complicated.

90
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,424
-Meaning what?

91
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,760
-He uses Mangekyo Sharingan.

92
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,430
It's far more powerful than
any other visual jutsu.

93
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,301
It only takes a second, but if
he hits you with that jutsu,

94
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,171
it'll be the longest
second you ever lived.

95
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,740
Time itself gets warped.

96
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,342
What seems like a
second in the real world

97
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:33,413
can be hours or days to
someone trapped in his jutsu.

98
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,647
I know.

99
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,317
I wandered around
in it for three days

100
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,619
and lost consciousness
for more than a week.

101
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,159
It's not a genjutsu that can
be broken just like that.

102
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,101
-That does sound tricky.

103
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,204
What a troublesome
fellow this is.

104
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,173
-Very good, Kakashi.

105
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,976
I see your sojourn
in my Tsukuyomi.

106
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,210
Wasn't wasted.

107
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,178
-Oh, believe me.

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,746
I learned something
else as well.

109
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,519
There's a price to pay
for using that Sharingan.

110
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,421
It exhausted you, didn't it?

111
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,591
You had to quit before
the battle was over.

112
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,959
-Itachi.

113
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,761
You've risked
overusing your eyes.

114
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,798
You know that's dangerous.

115
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,734
-We're not here to fight
a full scale battle.

116
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,537
Tempting as it may be, it's
not the way to do this.

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,173
Let's go.

118
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,775
-So in addition to using
up a lot of chakra,

119
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,844
you risk permanent
damage to your eye

120
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:42,182
every time you use that
jutsu, don't you, Itachi?

121
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,251
-You seem to have learned
a great deal from our one

122
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,487
brief encounter.

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,761
-I wonder just how
much damage has already

124
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,729
been done to your eyesight.

125
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,879
ITACHI (VOICEOVER): Kakashi.

126
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,347
Could it be that you--

127
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,766
-Where do you think he is?

128
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,808
Guy-sensei!

129
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,308
Tenten.

130
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,659
-It was only a water clone.

131
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,196
-I guess you'll never get
the chance to remember me.

132
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:32,525
-It appears Itachi has made
contact with the enemy.

133
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,361
And I see that Kisame
is engaged in combat.

134
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,808
-Lee!

135
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,810
-Leaf Rising Wind!

136
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:51,311
-What?

137
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,420
-Eight Trigrams, Air Palm!

138
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,166
KISAME (VOICEOVER): Paper bomb!

139
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,646
-Damn he got away.

140
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,428
-Where's he hiding this time?

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,201
-Neji.

142
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,303
Any sign of him?

143
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,506
-In front of us,
and coming closer.

144
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,307
-I have found him.

145
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,681
-I'll grant you brats this much.

146
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,950
You're more trouble
than I thought you'd be.

147
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,987
In fact, you're
incredibly annoying.

148
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,022
-Wait a minute.

149
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,058
The water jutsu and
the massive sword.

150
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,226
Are you--

151
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,428
-Don't tell me a
memory is finally

152
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,698
stirring in that
tiny brain of yours.

153
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,200
-I feel certain
we've met before.

154
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,309
-I'd think this guy would
be pretty memorable.

155
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,376
-Listen to that.

156
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,345
Even your own
followers are beginning

157
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,848
to wonder if you can
remember anything.

158
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,819
Well, let's see what we can do.

159
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,654
Enough pain and maybe
then you'll remember.

160
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,514
-I underestimated you back then.

161
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,515
I admit it.

162
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,686
But I am not the
fool I used to be.

163
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,889
Things aren't gonna go
the same way this time.

164
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,157
I promise you that.

165
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,164
-Yeah, and don't go thinking
I'm the same kid either.

166
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,867
A lot of things have
changed since then.

167
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,402
-Naruto.

168
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,304
Leave him to me.

169
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,538
-Huh?

170
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,975
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This
is just like the last time.

171
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,377
-Now, quick.

172
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,512
Manji formation.

173
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:45,017
Protect the bridge builder,
and stay out of this fight.

174
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,718
-Huh?

175
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,286
-I taught you teamwork.

176
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,921
Now it's time to use it.

177
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,723
-Not again.

178
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:54,694
Not that kind of teamwork where
we sit back and do nothing!

179
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,461
-No.

180
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,798
This time, you cover me.

181
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,267
I wish I could say
you guys go on ahead,

182
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,736
I can handle this alone.

183
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,038
But I never make the
same mistake twice.

184
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,933
-Let's see now.

185
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,767
-All right.

186
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,769
Time to launch a counterattack.

187
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,305
Let me go in against him first.

188
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,074
As soon as his guard
is down, you move in.

189
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,309
-Yes, sir.

190
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,777
-Are you fool
enough to think you

191
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,713
can get me to lower
my guard that easily?

192
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,549
I won't try to
talk you out of it.

193
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,284
I'll let you learn the hard way.

194
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:01,561
-Gentle Fist!

195
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,645
He has a point.

196
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,848
He swings that huge
sword with such ease.

197
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,617
And getting through his
guard is just impossible.

198
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:34,694
-If close range combat won't
work-- How'd you like that?

199
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:40,032
-If close range combat won't
work-- How'd you like that?

200
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,304
-I missed it.

201
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,174
Did you do something?

202
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,243
-That sword's
getting on my nerves.

203
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,210
-Of course.

204
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,179
That sword of his.

205
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,815
-Ah, do you remember at last?

206
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,582
-That weapon.

207
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,784
It's yours, right?

208
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,520
-Whose else could it be?

209
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,654
-A-ha!

210
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,156
But there's a big
difference between knowing

211
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,125
and being absolutely certain.

212
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,327
-Wise words, Guy-sensei.

213
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,465
So simple and yet so
full of profound meaning.

214
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,966
Oh, give me a break.

215
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,736
Do you get this excited
about everything he says?

216
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,471
LEE: Forget it, Tenten.

217
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,174
-I said you had the intelligence
of a subhuman beast,

218
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,645
but a beast could run
circles around your brain.

219
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,913
Let's go.

Dynamic Action!

-It's time you came
with me, Naruto.

222
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:49,635
-Me first.

223
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,878
A shadow clone.

00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,378
-Rasengan!

225
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,855
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Another shadow clone.

226
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,836
-What the-- Sakura?

227
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,337
Granny?

228
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,608
Sakura.

229
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,043
Are you-- I--

00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:56,836
-Attack!

No.

239
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,172
-Kakashi-sensei!

240
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,320
What's going on here?

241
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,288

kids of all ages,

244
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,456
and welcome to the
Kisame Shark Tank Show.

245
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,225
We've got a really
exciting show for you

246
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,494
today, as Guy-sensei
and his team

247
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,430
go up against five ruthless
predators of the deep.

248
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,065
Now, before we get
started, we ask

249
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,466
those seated in
the front rows who

250
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,269
don't want to get wet to please
move to the seats farthest away

251
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,404
from the tank.

252
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,471
OK, kids.

253
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,673
Here we go!

254
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,473
Now, all together.

Yes, it's me, the Noble
Blue Beast of the Leaf.

It's Might Guy!

-First question, Guy-sensei!

269
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,816
What is the power of youth?

270
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,784
GUY: One part talent,
two part sweat and tears,

271
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,253
a dash of passion.

272

That is the
indescribable ecstasy

I call the power of youth!

274

-And just how much
is a dash, exactly?

275
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,327
GUY: It also helps to
have a worthy opponent.

276
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,229
A rival you can compete against.
