00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,044
{\an1}Red Vapor. The blood
vapor... that's peculiar to
all eight gates being open.

2
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:20,220
{\an1}Heh! But now, actually
seeing it with my own
eyes... it's almost the

3
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:23,557
{\an1}color of dead autumn leaves
that've fallen off their
tree...

4
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:28,330
{\an7}I'll admit, you're not
wrong. But they're not
falling without reason
or purpose!

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,765
Hm?

6
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:34,772
{\an7}They'll become the
nourishment for fresh green
leaves!

7
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:39,445
{\an7}<i>And thus the period they</i>

<i>once again...</i>

8
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:43,851
{\an7}<i>...is the climax of youth!</i>

{\an1}"The Eight Inner Gates

00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:33,832
{\an1}Now, First Step!

11
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,288
{\an1}Go for it, Guy Sensei!

12
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,958
{\an1}I am already... I am.

13
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,495

{\an1}Guy, is- is that your-?!

00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:13,552
{\an1}Sensei's Sekizo, The
Evening Elephant!

00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:19,193
Ah!

19
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,028
{\an7}<i>He stopped partway?! </i>

20
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:24,534
{\an7}<i>Sekizo should be a</i>

{\an7}<i>one to five times.</i>

22

{\an7}<i>I see... What unbelievable</i>
<i>pain! </i>

23
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,117
{\an7}<i>But I've acclimated. Next</i>

24

{\an7}<i>Great stress is placed on</i>

<i>Fifth Gate of Closing... </i>

25
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:48,132
{\an1}<i>I bet the Gate of Death's</i>
<i>level of pain is something</i>
<i>that exceeds my imagination!</i>

26
00:03:56,543 --> 00:04:00,815
{\an1}A Taijutsu move that
bombards one with blows of
punched air...

27
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,851
{\an1}A kind of air cannon...

28
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:12,699
{\an7}Getting hit by four or five
of those would be bad.

29
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:16,870
{\an1}And... I should definitely
avoid getting hit by the
fists that are creating them.

30
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,620
{\an1}Did he succeed?!

31
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:30,989
[gasping]

32
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,466
{\an1}One rarely gets to fight the
Eight Inner Gates Formation!
All right I'm game!

33
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,034
{\an1}I'll play with you.

34
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,236
[grunting]

35
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,074
{\an1}Madara still can't be taken
down, huh...?

36
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,977
{\an1}But what exactly
has Might Guy done?

37
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,113
{\an1}The Eight Inner Gates
Formation.

38
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:52,919
{\an1}It lets someone draw out
their maximum power by
releasing all the limiters

39
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:55,155
{\an1}that are placed on it.

40
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:00,261
{\an4}<i>This is the final stage of</i>

<i>so long ago.</i>

41
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:04,568
{\an1}<i>Releasing all eight limiters</i>
<i>results in power tens of</i>

<i>the Five Kage. </i>

43
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,877

{\an1}<i>... the user will</i>
<i>inevitably... die. </i>

{\an1}<i>...he is my student. And also</i>
<i>because he is precious to me.</i>

47
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,222
{\an1}Rock Lee, are you...?

48
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:47,057
{\an1}No, I am not sad!

49
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:53,600
{\an1}Showing compassion or sorrow
to someone who has resolved
himself... would be an affront!

50
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:54,836
[yelling]

51
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:03,748
{\an1}We have to go lend
assistance to Guy,
so listen up!

52
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,722
{\an1}Sensei, those black weapons
of Madara's are troublesome.

53
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:14,795
{\an1}They don't activate from
nothing. They're an always
on standby type that undergo...

54
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,731
{\an1}Change in Form...

55
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:19,902
{\an1}And also... their impact

00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:24,642
{\an1}<i>...disappear. But there's</i>

57
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,246
{\an1}<i>only send them about seventy</i>

58
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:32,519
{\an1}<i>Since they physically exist</i>
<i>and can be traced and</i>
<i>followed, your</i>

59
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,089
{\an1}<i>Kamui should be able to work</i>
<i>on them, Kakashi.</i>

60
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:39,328
{\an1}<i>By sending them away, we</i>
<i>can prevent Madara from</i>
<i>controlling them. </i>

61
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:43,467
{\an1}To be frank,... I'm
starting to lose sight
in my left eye.

62
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,572
{\an1}I'm going to have to get pretty
close to them to target them
accurately.

63
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,512
{\an1}Gaara, can you ready some
sand?

64
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,250
{\an1}In order to transport
Kakashi, is that what
you're thinking?

65
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,054
{\an1}But it won't be fast enough
to avoid Madara's attacks.

66
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,424
Don't you worry.
That's my job.

67
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,295
{\an1}Kakashi will carry one of my
kunai.

68
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:07,132
{\an1}Eight Inner Gates: The Sixth
Gate of Joy!

69
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,200
Open!

71
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:14,676
{\an1}You've mastered the Eight
Inner Gates, too?!

72
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,112
{\an1}I can only open up to the
Sixth Gate.

73
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,251
{\an1}I have never cursed my own
lack of power as much as I
do now!

74
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,892
{\an1}No. It seems to me that
it's plenty, Lee.

75
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,460
{\an1}Huh?

76
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:33,134
{\an1}You're still a fresh
new leaf... that Guy wants
to risk his life to protect!

77
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:46,886
{\an1}Lee, I want you to stay here
to support and guard Gaara.

78
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,557
{\an1}And one other thing... Take
one of my kunai.

Fifth Step!

00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:20,263
{\an1}Just keep forging on, Guy!
Go!

{\an7}You're the first since
Hashirama to make me this
excited!

96
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,839
{\an1}You can still dance, can't
you? Do you have any other
moves?

97
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,775
Come on, give me
some more fun!

{\an1}Where am I? Does this
mean...?

...I'm dead?

104
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:33,142
{\an7}Thine ethical viewpoint on
death differs much from that
which prevailed in my time.

105
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:39,784
{\an7}To so easily replace oneself
with the term 'death', thou
must gain mettle, oh fledgling.

106
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,822
{\an1}Who are you?

107
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:46,493
{\an1}'Tis quite precise
question for this place
but...

108
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:51,166
{\an1}I am quite uneasy over
whether thou shalt be able
to connect my name with my

109
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,402
{\an1}actions as a herald...

Uh--

111
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,311
{\an1}I am he who shall achieve
peace and order...

112
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,546
{\an1}And my name is Hagoromo.

113
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,959
{\an1}But on the other hand...

114
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:15,299
{\an1}I had already foreseen that
thou wouldst end up in such
a state as that one, after all.

115
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,839
{\an1}<i>Uh... I don't really</i>

{\an1}Hey... Sorry,
gramps, but I--

118
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,184

00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,786
{\an1}No way! Those eyes!

121
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,693
{\an1}Thou dost appear to possess
observant eyes.

122
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:41,700
{\an1}All that remains is for thee
to pragmatically comprehend
thy circumstances...

123
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:47,209
{\an1}Firstly, thou hast not died
as of yet... This place is
thine own inner mind.

124
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:48,710
{\an1}I understand thine haste--

Can't you just speak using
easy, normal words?!

00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,793
{\an1}Forgive me. I'm an
anachronism.

128
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:06,034
{\an1}Over the passage of much
time, cultural traditions
and notions, ethics, have

129
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,204
{\an1}managed to bring about some
rather significant changes.

130

{\an7}<i>In each instance where I</i>

{\an8}<i>however- </i>

134
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,659
{\an1}Shut up, already!

135
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:29,031
{\an1}I don't have the time to
be sitting around and
listening to some weird

136
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,633
{\an1}geezer prattle on, you
know?!

137
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,738
{\an1}Not just searching for
words... But there also
remains some ambiguity in

138
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:36,274
scholarship.

139
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:40,313
{\an1}If communication of wills
can't be achieved in
addition to difficulty of

140
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,381
definition...

141
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:44,151
{\an1}I can see that I shall have
to speak simply...

142

{\an1}...taking into account
current idealistic and
materialistic thinking.

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,366
{\an1}Listen, are you an alien or
something? I mean, you do
seem super dignified but...

144
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:00,907
{\an1}That's a bit much dontcha
think? An alien? Seriously?
[chuckling]

145
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,212
Huh...?!

146
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:08,317
{\an1}Well, maybe that ain't too
far off. Anyway...

147
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,487
Hmm?

148
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,791
{\an1}You still don't understand?

149
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,695
{\an1}That conversation would pose
such a complex challenge...

150
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:19,699
{\an1}No! No, no! That was fine
just now!

151
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:26,207
{\an4}No, I finally get you! I was
just shocked 'cause your
speaking style changed so
much, ya know?

152
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:30,447
{\an1}Oh, yeah, for real? Then
I'll keep going like this.
I'm much pleased!

153
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,314
Uh, yeah...

154
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,417
[groaning]

155
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:39,325
{\an1}Oh... uh... but those words
don't really match up with
your face at all, so it's

156
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,228
{\an1}kinda super-scary...

157
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,299
{\an7}<i>And he loses all dignity</i>
<i>too... </i>

158
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:48,204
{\an1}I guess... dial it back a
touch and be a bit formal...

159
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,939
{\an1}Or else you sound kinda
lame.

160
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:54,446
{\an1}Now you're going too far,
no? What do you mean by
lame?!

161
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:59,219
{\an1}Although, considering how I
was talking, I guess I
can't blame you...

162
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,056
{\an1}So... does this sound all
right, then?

163
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:05,094
{\an1}That's it! All right!
That's just perfect!

164
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,031
{\an1}Indeed. I'm getting the
hang of it, too.

165
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:11,168
{\an1}Oh, man, finally, I can talk
with you!

166
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:15,373
{\an1}So, anyway, who are you? And
if you know a lot about this
place, I want to know how to

167
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:18,512
{\an1}get out of here, all right,
gramps? I'm in a hurry!

168
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,647
{\an1}Don't ask everything all
at once!

169
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:24,619
{\an1}I'm someone from the past,
someone who is already dead.

170
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:29,092
{\an1}A monk wandering the world
as chakra, crossing
generations, ascertaining

171
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:31,796
{\an1}the course of Ninshu, the
Ninja Creed.

172
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:38,071
{\an4}My name's Hagoromo. I'm the
founder of Ninshu, the Ninja
Creed, known as the Sage of
Six Paths.

173
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,207
{\an1}The Sage of Six Paths?!

174
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:45,381
{\an1}You mean that you're the
sage that Nagato and Pervy
Sage told me about?! Really?!

175
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,416
{\an1}Oh, so you know of me?

176
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:51,855
{\an1}Yeah, of course I do!
You're the one who first
created Ninjutsu right?

177
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,061
{\an1}No, not ninjutsu, but
ninshu... the Ninja Creed
that I had meant to be

178
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,231
{\an1}something that gave birth to
hope.

179
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,504
{\an1}Do not confuse it with
ninjutsu, which just breeds
conflict.

180
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:07,310
{\an4}Oh, well, in any case, if
you're the Sage, I've
got tons of things that
I wanna ask you.

181
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:09,914
{\an1}<i>But first, right now...</i>

182
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,525
Huh?

183
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,533
<i>You are my son,</i>
<i>Ashura's.</i>

184
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:32,109
{\an1}In any event, right now a
lot of conditions have lined
up...

185
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:35,181
{\an1}There are things that I must
entrust you with.

186
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,119
{\an1}What is all this? Ashura?
Entrust me?

187
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:43,892
{\an1}Look, no offense, but quit
spouting nonsense and let me
get out of here, all right?!

188
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:48,265
I apologize, but
unfortunately that's not
something that I can affect.

189
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:51,202
{\an1}That all depends on the
actions of those outside.

190
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:54,206
{\an1}For now, I can only
relay things to you.

191
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,778
{\an1}We're back to this? You're
starting to lose me again
here, Gramps.

192
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:03,385
{\an1}It means that right now...
trying to rush won't make
any difference.

193
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:09,093
{\an1}So, I'd like you to listen
to me. No! You must hear
this.

194
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:13,633
{\an1}First, I'll tell you about
my mother and my sons.

195
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:26,049
{\an1}<i>My mother, Kaguya Otsutsuki,</i>
<i>came to this land of yours</i>
<i>from a faraway place in</i>

196
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:29,487
{\an1}<i>order to claim the fruit of</i>
<i>the Divine Tree. </i>

197
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,527
{\an1}<i>The chakra fruit of that</i>
<i>same Divine Tree that you</i>
<i>have seen in this very war. </i>

198
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:41,369
{\an1}<i>Kaguya consumed the fruit,</i>
<i>gained power, and subdued</i>
<i>this land. </i>

199
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:46,209
{\an1}So where did Kaguya come
from, anyway? And is she
stronger than you?

200
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:49,814
{\an1}Well, I guess that all moms
are pretty scary when
they're mad, huh?!

201
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:57,491
{\an4}It matters not from where
she came. Yes, Mother was
powerful. More powerful
than any other.

202
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:04,834
{\an4}<i>Some called my mother the</i>
<i>Rabbit Goddess and others a</i>
<i>demon. They both worshipped</i>
<i>and feared her.</i>

203
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:11,344
{\an1}<i>Later, Kaguya would give</i>
<i>birth to two sons. I was one</i>
<i>of them. </i>

204
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:16,316
{\an1}<i>We brothers, to atone for</i>
<i>the crimes mother left</i>
<i>behind, battled Ten Tails,</i>

205
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,357
{\an1}<i>an incarnation of the Divine</i>
<i>Tree, and sealed it inside</i>
<i>me. </i>

206
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,032
{\an4}<i>The Divine Tree, robbed of</i>
<i>its Chakra Fruit, went on a</i>
<i>rampage in an attempt to</i>
<i>recover it.</i>

207
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:33,306
{\an1}<i>And then... much, much</i>
<i>later, I had two sons of my</i>
<i>own. </i>

208
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:40,416
{\an1}<i>I named the elder Indra and</i>
<i>the younger Ashura,... and I</i>
<i>taught them the Ninja Creed.</i>

209
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:43,553
{\an1}But there was a huge
difference between the two
of them.

210
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:48,993
{\an4}One possessed the genes that
contained my powerful
chakra, and the other
one did not.

211
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,332
{\an1}This manifested in the most
extreme manner.

212
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,403
{\an1}Uh, it's starting to get
hard to follow you again,
you know?

213
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,338
{\an1}What does all
this stuff mean?

214
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,374
In short...

215
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:04,681
{\an1}<i>There was the exceptional</i>
<i>older brother Indra and the</i>
<i>dunce younger brother Ashura.</i>

216
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:10,723
{\an1}So he was a dunce, huh? Even
though his dad's the Sage
of Six Paths?

217
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,361
{\an1}Perhaps there's no need to
say this to you, but...

218
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:18,767
{\an1}<i>No matter how exceptional</i>
<i>both parents may be,</i>
<i>there's no guarantee one</i>

219
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:23,674
{\an1}<i>will inherit outright either</i>
<i>of their abilities. Sound</i>
<i>familiar? </i>

220
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:28,480
{\an1}<i>Just as it seems to have</i>
<i>been in your case, Naruto. </i>

221
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:33,654
{\an1}[sighing] For some reason, I
understand that completely.

222
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:40,496
{\an1}And you are truly quite
similar to Ashura. In your
actions, as well.

223
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,868
{\an1}Huh? What do you mean, my
actions?

224
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:47,706
{\an1}Indra and Ashura walked very
different paths in life.

225
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:52,145
{\an7}<i>Elder brother Indra</i>
<i>possessed strong Visual</i>
<i>Prowess and senses from</i>

226
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,715
{\an7}<i>birth... and was called a</i>
<i>genius. </i>

227
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:59,856
{\an7}<i>He always did everything by</i>
<i>himself, leaning only on his</i>
<i>own strength, and came to</i>

228
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,726
{\an7}<i>understand that his powers</i>
<i>were different and special. </i>

229
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,197
{\an7}<i>He perceived that power</i>
<i>could achieve everything. </i>

230
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:10,537
{\an7}<i>On the other hand, nothing</i>
<i>ever went well for little</i>
<i>brother Ashura from the time</i>

231
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,208
{\an7}<i>he was small, and he</i>
<i>couldn't do anything on</i>
<i>his own. </i>

232
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:18,480
{\an7}<i>In order to attain the same</i>
<i>power as his older brother,</i>
<i>he always needed the</i>

233
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:21,886
{\an7}<i>cooperation of others in</i>
<i>addition to his own effort. </i>

234
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,924
{\an1}While struggling through
training, the power of
bodily chakra awakened

235
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,562
{\an1}within him, and he attained
power rivaling his
brother's.

236
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:34,034
{\an1}He understood that he
became strong thanks to
the cooperation and help of

237
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,304
{\an1}those around him.

238
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:43,247
{\an1}<i>He learned of the love for</i>
<i>others that arises from</i>
<i>thinking about them... </i>

239
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:47,987
{\an1}<i>...and perceived that it was</i>
<i>love that can achieve</i>
<i>everything. </i>

240
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,193
{\an1}I believe that I caught
a glimpse of new possibilities

241
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:56,164
{\an1}within younger brother
Ashura's way of living.

242
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:02,539
{\an4}<i>I partitioned the power of</i>
<i>the Ten Tails that was</i>
<i>inside of me, named each</i>
<i>of the pieces...</i>

243
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:07,613
{\an1}<i>...and believed that the</i>
<i>bond known as cooperation</i>
<i>was true power. </i>

244
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,451
Hm.

245
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:16,725
{\an1}And I then named the younger
brother Ashura as the leader
and as the guardian of the

246
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,461
Ninja Creed...

247
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:23,068
{\an1}...believing that his older
brother Indra would cooperate
with his younger brother.

248
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,203
However...

249
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:28,407
Huh?

250
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:35,417
{\an1}<i>Indra did not accept my</i>
<i>decision. And thus, from</i>
<i>that day on...</i>

251
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:38,788
{\an1}<i>... interminable conflict</i>
<i>raged.</i>

252
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:47,500
{\an1}<i>Even after their flesh</i>
<i>perished, the chakra that</i>
<i>the two honed continued to</i>

253
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:53,041
{\an1}<i>reincarnate across time,</i>
<i>without vanishing...over and</i>
<i>over. </i>

254
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,979
{\an1}That's creepy. It kinda
sounds like being haunted
by a ghost.

255
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:59,750
{\an1}So, is it still possessing
someone even now?

256
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:03,122
{\an1}It possesses you,
Naruto.

257
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:05,424
{\an1}Huh?!

258
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:10,531
{\an1}Younger brother Ashura
has reincarnated as you.

259
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:03,283
{\an7}If all chakra were to be
reunited into one again,
a new Chakra Fruit would
take shape.

260
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:07,621
{\an7}That must be prevented at
all costs or this world will
end.

261
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:10,625
{\an7}I would like you to stop
Madara.

262
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,799
{\an7}I feel the possibility
exists there... in your
maverick nature.

263
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,971
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Sage of the
Six Paths."

264
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:22,975
{\an1}So you still believe
in us. Thank you.
