{\an1}[chuckle] Yeah! Don't you dare
undersestimate Lord Third!

156

{\an4}<i>To be honest, everyone needs to</i>

{\an1}<i>Medical Ninjitsu anymore. </i>

158

{\an4}<i>We've been using big attacks in</i>

159
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,258
{\an1}<i>We'll just have to trust young</i>
<i>Naruto to take care of Madara.</i>

160
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,759
{\an1}This could be our big chance,
Lor Orochimaru!

161
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,926
Not yet.

162

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,026
No way! No...!

164
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,993
Hey, shut up!

165
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,292
{\an1}This just- It can't be!

166
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:17,659
What is it?

167
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,458
Sa-...Sa-

168
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:23,758
{\an1}Something happened to Sasuke?!

169
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,058
{\an1}It seems I should jump in sooner
after all...

{\an1}[gasp] Naruto...!

Huh?

174
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:42,058
What's that?!

175
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:44,058
{\an1}I think it's Lord Gaara!

176
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:45,758
There they are.

177
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:50,491
Naruto!

178
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:56,224
{\an1}There's no time to explain right
now.

179
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,758
{\an1}Hokage, you must come with me!

180
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,391
{\an1}Try to heal him as much as you
can en route.

181
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:06,391
{\an1}I don't have enough chakra left
to perform Medical Ninjutsu.

182
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,291
{\an1}Take Sakura instead.

183
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:10,825
{\an1}I think she should be able to
help some.

184
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:12,691
{\an1}What happened over there?!

185
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:14,524
Naruto!

186
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,424
{\an1}How did he end up like this?!

187
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:17,758
Just come!

188
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:21,191
{\an1}<i>Don't waste time! I'll explain</i>

{\an1}Sakura, get up on the sand!

00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:24,391
Right!

191
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,424
{\an1}What's going on now?

192
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,791
{\an1}Is Naruto nearby?

193
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,758
{\an1}Yeah! he's over there! Hey,
wait, can't you use your
Byakugan to see?

194
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,625
{\an1}He took Madara down?

195
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:45,424
[gasps]

196
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,358
{\an1}Naruto's heartbeat is...

00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,358
{\an1}...getting weaker and weaker!

201
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,825
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki...

202
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:31,691
Hmm?

203
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,424
{\an1}He'll stubbornly cling to life
for a bit, since he's an
Uzumaki.

204
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,058
{\an1}But trying to heal him now is
completely useless.

{\an1}...for your forgiveness while
keeping you at a distance.

219

{\an1}That perhaps you...could have
changed Father,...Mother,...and
the rest of the Uchiha as well.
