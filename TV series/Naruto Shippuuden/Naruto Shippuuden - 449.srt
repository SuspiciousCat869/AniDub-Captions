1
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,941
{\an1}<i>Excuse me! </i>

2
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,243
<i>Yes, come in!</i>

3
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:23,584
Lady Tsunade,
everyone's here.

4
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,454
{\an1}Huh? Where's my Dad?

5
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:30,091
{\an1}Since this morning,
representatives from all
the villages have been in an

6
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:31,858
{\an1}emergency summit.

7
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:35,463
{\an1}Lord Fourth brought Kakashi
and the other jonin with him
to take part.

8
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:36,564
No wonder-

9
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,367
{\an1}But don't you worry, Naruto!
'Cause I'm here, too!

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,268
{\an1}What?! Pervy Sage!

11
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,238
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, what did you
want to see us about?

12
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:48,844
{\an1}It's regarding the news
that's been going around
recently.

13
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,945
{\an1}It's coming in from every
region...

14
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,948
{\an1}Um... what news?

15
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:59,454
{\an1}That Orochimaru is dead. And
it seems that Sasuke Uchiha
did it.

16
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:00,354
[gasping]

17
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:04,925
{\an1}It's disappointing... I
had always hoped in my heart
of hearts I could bring

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,461
{\an1}Orochimaru back...

19
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,162
{\an1}I'm sorry, Pervy Sage...

20
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:12,601
{\an1}But Sasuke not ending up as
Orochimaru's vessel makes
me glad!

21
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:16,638
{\an1}There's one more thing...
the Akatsuki have been
attacking shinobi villages,

22
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:19,940
{\an1}kidnapping Kage and Jonin
Class Shinobi.

23
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:24,780
{\an1}And word is also going
around... that Sasuke
is working with them.

24
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:25,847
No way!

25
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,818
{\an1}Yeah, I couldn't believe
it either. But the intel
that I gathered comes from

26
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,020
{\an1}quite a few trusted sources.

27
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:34,923
{\an1}It seems that it really is
true.

28
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:38,226
{\an1}The representatives from the
villages are likely
discussing sanctions

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,929
{\an1}on the Akatsuki
and Sasuke.

30
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:44,032
{\an1}Does that mean that Sasuke
is going to become a wanted
criminal, then?

31
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,668
{\an1}What did my dad have to say
about this?!

32
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,938
{\an1}Well, naturally, of course,
Lord Fourth wouldn't want
that to happen.

33
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:52,641
{\an1}And that's why...

34
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:56,011
{\an1}Right here is all the data
that we've gathered so
far.

35
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:59,414
{\an1}The Akatsuki members. All
about them. Including...

36
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:02,417
{\an1}...their special abilities
and where they've been
spotted.

37
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,922
{\an1}<i>Use this and find Sasuke</i>
<i>before any of the other</i>
<i>villages... </i>

38
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:07,289
<i>... and bring</i>
<i>him back!</i>

39
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:12,327
{\an1}<i>Doing that is probably the</i>
<i>only way that we're going to</i>
<i>be able to save Sasuke. </i>

40
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,265
Got it?

41
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,670
{\an1}On this mission, our team is
gonna be working with each
one of yours to track and

42
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,505
locate Sasuke.

43
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:26,342
{\an1}Don't take action on your
own. We have to work
together on this.

44
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,446
{\an1}Yes. Right. The reason
is because our goal
is to find Sasuke

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,714
{\an1}and bring him
back home.

46
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,484
So don't rush off,
especially you, Naruto!

47
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,586
{\an1}Gimme a break! I know that!

48
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,789
{\an1}All right, C'mon, let's
go!

49
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,532
{\an1}Hey, what is all this?!

50
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:34,739
{\an1}My art. My Human Puppets.
They number in the tens of
thousands.

51
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:38,743
{\an1}You've been making stuff
like this with the personnel
we gathered?!

52
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:42,246
{\an1}What are you planning
with all this military
build-up?

53
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,352
{\an1}We Akatsuki will rule the
world instead of the Five
Great Nations.

54
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,089
{\an1}First, we'll crush
the Leaf Village.

55
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,322
[gasping]

56
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,026
{\an1}So your strategy is to win
with quantity?

57
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,728
{\an1}Your idea of what art
is differs from mine.

58
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:59,597
{\an1}Art must be an explosion, or
it isn't art!

59
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:04,535
{\an1}Deidara, your aerial attack
will disorient and
disorganize the enemy. Then

60
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,641
{\an1}I'll send in my Human
Puppet army for an all-out
ground battle.

61
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:13,444
{\an1}[chuckling] After my artful
explosion, there won't
even be a blade of grass

62
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,747
{\an1}left to fight on!

63
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,084
{\an1}Are you an idiot? Then there
won't be anything left to
rule!

64
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,552
{\an1}<i>What did you say?! </i>

65
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,622
{\an1}Tsh! Do you have a
problem with my art or
something?!

66
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,557
<i>That's it, you</i>
<i>idiot!</i>

67
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:36,200
{\an1}I'm letting you handle the
destruction of the Leaf like
you wanted.

68
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:37,803
Aren't you satisfied?

69
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:42,441
{\an1}I just want to destroy the
current system that has the
Fourth Hokage at its helm.

70
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,544
{\an1}I'm not looking to destroy
the Leaf itself.

71
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:48,213
{\an1}Are you planning on
deserting the Akatsuki?

72
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,252
{\an1}I never agreed to be
your henchman in the
first place.

73
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:57,723
{\an1}We nursed you back from the
brink. And now you're
gonna betray us?!

74
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,944
{\an1}A few of them have broken
the barrier and slipped into
Akatsuki territory.

75
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,613
{\an1}The Five Great Nations
probably sent them.

76
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,385
[barking]

77
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,122
{\an1}So you caught the scent,
too, huh, Akamaru?

78
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,123
[barking]

79
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,892
{\an1}We found him! Sasuke is
close by!

80
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,028
{\an1}Are you sure that it's
Sasuke's scent?

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,096
{\an1}Which direction?

82
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,097
Follow me!

83
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,831
[barking]

84
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,750
What?

85
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,591
{\an1}It's the Akatsuki!

86
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,934
<i>Sasuke.</i>

87
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,674
{\an1}Itachi?! I thought
you were dead!

88
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:27,748
{\an1}I can't die while your
future and that of the
Uchiha are so uncertain.

89
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,453
{\an1}Healing from my wounds just
took longer than I expected.

90
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,956
{\an1}I'm glad you're okay.

91
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:40,461
{\an1}Look, Sasuke, what is it
that you're trying to do?

92
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,897
{\an1}And just where do you
belong?

93
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,298
Itachi, that's--

94
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,803
{\an1}You should already know what
it is that you must do.

95
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:54,008
{\an8}[cawing]

96
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,579
{\an7}Where's Sasuke? He's with
you guys now, isn't that
right?!

97
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,816
{\an1}He was with us until a
little while ago.

98
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,853
{\an1}But he didn't care for
the way we do things...
and he left.

99
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:10,158
{\an1}Listen, talking with these
guys isn't gonna accomplish
anything at all!

100
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:12,260
{\an1}I say that we just kill
'em off already!

101
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,728
{\an1}Hey, wait! You were at that
village!

102
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:19,366
{\an1}Oh, yeah! I remember you!
Well, guess what, punk!
It's payback time.

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,402
{\an1}Let me have that one, all
right?!

104
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,505
{\an1}Whatever you want.

105
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,739
Naruto!

106
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:28,243
{\an1}Huh-hey, what are you
guys doing here?

107
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:31,378
{\an1}I managed to track
you with my Byakugan!

108
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,381
That's Hidan. Just leave
him to us.

109
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,917
{\an1}But, you guys---!

110
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:40,421
{\an1}Relax! Thanks to Lady
Tsunade's data, I have his
jutsu all figured out.

111
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,423
{\an1}Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

112
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,026
{\an1}C'mon, I'm not falling for
that trick!

113
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,127
{\an1}You won't escape!

114
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,529
Let's go!

115
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:51,066
{\an1}Now that Hidan has taken off
what do we do?

116
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:55,070
{\an1}<i>You're his partner. So do</i>
<i>something! </i>

117
00:08:55,103 --> 00:09:00,709
{\an1}Who are you calling his
partner? Guess I have no
choice...

118
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,744
{\an1}I think his name is Kakuzu.

119
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:07,382
According to Lady
Tsunade's intel, that guy
possesses five hearts...

120
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,818
{\an1}My Gentle Fist can handle
it.

121
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:12,321
{\an1}Is there anything that
the rest of us can do?

122
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:16,458
{\an1}Seems he specializes in
mid-range attacks. But the
Gentle Fist is a just

123
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:18,060
{\an1}short-range attack.

124
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:22,198
{\an1}I understand! We will
distract him by creating
a diversion!

125
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,633
{\an1}When we do... take him down!

126
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,938
Here goes!

127
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,648
{\an1}You may run, but it is
useless.

128
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,051
{\an1}Guess it's time for my art
to make an appearance.

129
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,558
{\an1}What is that giant thing?!

130
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,426
{\an1}Didn't you read through
the data on him?

131
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,795
Oh... Uh, no.

132
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:56,666
{\an1}That's the C2 Dragon.
Deidara is an explosives
expert.

133
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,869
{\an1}If you're going to
compliment me, I wish
you'd say that I'm an

134
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,637
{\an1}"explosive artist",

135
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,342
{\an1}Quit messing around!

136
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:16,386
Huh?

137
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,422
{\an1}<i>Watch out, Naruto! </i>

138
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:23,060
{\an1}Hold up, there! That's a
land mine, you know!

139
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,895
{\an1}Step on one, and my art will
go off!

140
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:29,699
A land mine?!
Aw, come on!

141
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,911
It's Sasuke!

Huh?!

144
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,819

00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:23,268
{\an1}Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

297
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,237
{\an1}Inferno Style: Flame
Control!

[yelling]

299
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:34,379
[struggling]

300
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,760
It's over.

301
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,965
{\an1}Sasuke, come back to the
village.

302
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:55,602
{\an1}Look, couldn't we just...
I don't know, start over?

303
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:57,870
And then maybe
be friends?

304
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:02,642
{\an1}Sure, I'll return to the
Leaf.

305
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,879
{\an1}But don't get the wrong
idea.

306
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,081
Huh?!

307
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:12,184
{\an7}I'm not gonna join up with
you guys.

308
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:17,590
{\an7}I'll change the Shinobi
World and do it my own way.

309
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:18,791
Huh?!

310
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,497
{\an1}<i>My feelings won't change, no</i>
<i>matter what happens. As a</i>
<i>true friend, I'm gonna </i>

311
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,265
{\an1}<i>take you back</i>
<i>to the village!</i>

312
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:09,704
{\an1}<i>Remember when I first met</i>
<i>you? Back at the Academy</i>
<i>entrance ceremony? </i>

313
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:11,371
{\an1}<i>Yeah, what</i>
<i>about it?</i>

314
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:15,375
{\an1}<i>This has been destined to</i>
<i>happen since back then! </i>

315
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:19,379
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Rival." </i>

316
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,617
{\an1}<i>I don't know what you're</i>
<i>talking about! That was</i>
<i>a long time ago!</i>
