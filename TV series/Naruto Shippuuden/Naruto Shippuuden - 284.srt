1
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,523
{\an1}Captain Kakashi.

2
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,292
{\an1}What's the intel on the
enemy?

3
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,793
{\an1}There aren't any signs of
life anywhere, including
from the enemy.

4
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,794
{\an1}The battlefield's
completely quiet.

5
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:35,331
{\an4}I wonder what's going
on. I seriously doubt
that they'd just give up
the fight.

6
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:39,333
{\an1}Psychological warfare is
key to winning a shinobi
battle.

7
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:42,334
{\an1}I really don't like doing
exactly what the enemy
wants us to dÄ6

8
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,736
{\an1}... but we should use this
as a chance to rest.

9
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,471
{\an1}All right, everyone, rest
up! Take time to recover
your chakra!

10
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:54,539
{\an4}However... Stay on your
guard! We'll keep
scouting the area every
half an hour!

11
00:00:55,673 --> 00:01:02,043
{\an4}We must make sure we're
ready to begin fighting
again at a moment's
notice! Okay! That's all!

12
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,779
Guy, you should rest a
little, too.

13
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:11,148
{\an4}Ha! Get real, Kakashi!
You really think I could
sleep at a time like
this?!

14
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:13,982
I understand how you
feel, but...

15
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:15,317
<i>Captain Kakashi.</i>

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,650
We finally received the
item from Headquarters.

17
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:19,985
{\an1}Good.

18
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:38,161
This jutsu... it
really is unforgivable.

19
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:42,030
Sai, next up we'll use
the Foundation's Sealing
Jutsu.

20
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,263
So follow me!

21
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:46,131
{\an1}But Kakashi, I
haven't mastered that
jutsu yet.

22
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:49,532
Isn't it true that Danzo
valued you very highly,
Sai?

23
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:53,301
You don't have to
suppress your emotions
anymore!

24
00:01:58,437 --> 00:01:59,238
Hmm--

25
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:02,671
{\an1}Hey, Sai. Sorry to bother
you while you're
resting...

26
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,806
It's okay.

27
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,075
{\an1}This just arrived from
headquarters.

28
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,077
{\an1}You need this for your
Sealing Jutsu, don't you?

29
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,310
Mmm.

30
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:18,613
Lee.

31
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:21,614
{\an1}[panicking]

32
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:23,782
{\an1}Is it the enemy?!

33
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,217
{\an1}Well, looks like you can
still fight.

34
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:31,019
{\an1}Of course, sir! Because
I, Rock Lee, the Blue
Beast of the Leaf, do not

35
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,887
{\an1}know the meaning of the
word "exhaustion!"

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,321
{\an1}I want you to be Sai's
bodyguard.

37
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:40,724
{\an4}He won't be able to
defend himself well while
he's preparing his
Sealing Jutsu.

38
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,360
{\an1}Leave it to me, sir!

39
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,461
{\an1}I will risk my life to
protect him!

40
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,561
{\an1}[grunting]

41
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,729
Better get
to it, Sai.

42
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,963
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,801
{\an1}Okay! I look forward to
this!

44
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,369
{\an1}Do not worry one
bit, Sai. No matter
who the foe may be...

45
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,237
{\an1}I will not let them lay a
single finger on you!

46
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,138
{\an3}Lee...

47
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,604
{\an1}Sai!

48
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:15,840
{\an1}It is okay! You can skip
the formalities and call
me by a nickname the same

49
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:18,241
{\an1}way you do with Naruto
and Sakura!

50
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,911
Listen, Lee. Could
you leave me alone
for a while?

51
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:27,513
{\an1}Yes, I understand! Just
call me right away if
something happens!

52
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:45,922
{\an1}Sorry... But do you have
a moment, Kakashi Sensei?

53
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,223
Sure, what is it?

54
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,990
{\an1}It is concerning Sai's
Sealing Jutsu.

55
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,692
{\an4}Do you think it would be
possible for you to tell
me a little bit more about
it?

56
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,927
Yeah, I guess so.

57
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:01,029
I've just got to figure
out where I should
start.

58
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:06,432
{\an1}<i>You know that he used to</i>
<i>be a member of the</i>
<i>Foundation, right? </i>

59
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,333
{\an1}<i>I suppose that it all got</i>
<i>started back when</i>
<i>Orochimaru attacked the</i>

60
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,568
{\an1}<i>Hidden Leaf Village</i>
<i>during your chunin</i>
<i>exams.</i>

61
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:23,540
{\an5}Sai, it is imperative
that you learn and become
proficient with this
Sealing Jutsu.

62
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:24,639
{\an1}Yes, sir.

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,641
{\an1}The Third Hokage was
unparalleled in his use
of jutsu.

64
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:35,112
{\an4}But when Orochimaru used
the Reanimation Jutsu to
bring back the First and
Second Hokage, the Third

65
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:38,280
{\an1}<i>Hokage had to seal them</i>
<i>away with the Reaper</i>
<i>Death Seal...</i>

66
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:41,781
{\an1}<i>...and sacrificed his</i>
<i>life in doing so. </i>

67
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:45,649
{\an1}In order for things to
work in our favor, the
Foundation needs to

68
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:49,452
{\an1}possess a powerful
Sealing Jutsu without
that limitation.

69
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:53,854
{\an7}But... can I actually
master a Sealing Jutsu
that will work against

70
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,288
{\an7}someone as powerful as
Orochimaru?

71
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,023
{\an1}I believe that you can.

72
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,023
Uh!

73
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:04,625
{\an7}You've been taught that
emotions merely hinder a
shinobi, isn't that
right?

74
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:05,926
Yes.

75
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,927
{\an7}All of the feelings that
you've suppressed have
created a massive

76
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:12,829
{\an7}reservoir of energy
somewhere deep inside
your heart.

77
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:16,432
{\an1}And by releasing
that pent-up emotional
energy, you will be

78
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:20,067
{\an1}able to imbue your
Sealing Jutsu with great
power.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,301
{\an1}But be careful...

80
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:25,735
{\an1}Releasing your emotions
can make you susceptible
to the effects of your

81
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:29,238
{\an1}negative feelings. And
that can be very
dangerous.

82
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:40,767
{\an1}"The Helmet Splitter:
Jinin Akebino!"

83

Shift change.

84
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,170
Right.

85
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,271
{\an1}So how's everything going?

86
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:52,139
{\an1}Nothing's changed.

87
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:57,175
{\an4}It's morning and the
enemy still hasn't shown
their faces. It sure is
quiet.

88
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,610
{\an1}It feels like the calm
before the storm.

89
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:03,945
{\an1}I hope it means that this
whole thing is gonna be
over soon, know what I'm--

90
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:09,248
{\an1}They're here! The enemy's
attacking!

91
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:13,749
They're here.

92
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,719
<i>Over here! </i>

93
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,822
{\an1}He ran away?!

[screaming]

95
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,128
{\an1}Damn it! Where is he?!

96
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,198
Huh?!

97
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:52,335
{\an1}Hey... What just
happened....? Where'd
they all go?!

98
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:54,802
[grunting]

99
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,111
They're here. This way!

100
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,579
[grunting]

101
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,481
{\an4}It appears that even
though they're cornered,
they aren't gonna fight
us.

102
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:22,315
{\an1}<i>The enemy's moved their</i>
<i>weaker forces in. </i>

103
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:26,317
It seems that their main
tactic is going to be
guerrilla warfare.

104
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:31,087
{\an4}They want us to chase
these targets and get
split up so they can pick
us off one by one.

105
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:35,955
{\an4}I hate to admit it, but
they wanted us to become
overconfident after
defeating Zabuza.

106
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:39,424
{\an1}Now what? Things are
going downhill fast.

107
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:43,693
We need to regroup our
forces. Send a message
out to each team!

108
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,827
{\an1}Tell them to join up with
at least two other teams
and stick together!

109
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,663
{\an1}Okay, you got it! What
are you gonna do?!

110
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:54,098
{\an1}I'm worried about the
squads behind us. If I
were the enemy, I'd use

111
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,666
{\an1}this confusion to cut off
our support squads.

{\an1}<i>The rear guards are</i>
<i>battle-hardened... and</i>

understand. I'll just
leave it to you!

115
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:13,207
{\an4}All right, you heard him,
right?! Send a message to all
the teams! Do not pursue the
enemy if you see them.

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,942
{\an4}Tell them to stick
together and that we'll
destroy the enemy one at
a time!

{\an1}Perfect timing. Follow
me! We're going to

how this war goes!

{\an5}So, Sai... it takes some
time for you to prepare
your Sealing Jutsu, is
that correct?

126
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,386
{\an1}How do you know that?

127
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,820
{\an7}It was quite simple. I
just asked Kakashi Sensei
whether you need to stop

128
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:46,757
{\an7}and concentrate in
order to use emotional
energy.

171
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:32,035
{\an1}<i>You must assimilate the</i>

have to master them, Sai!

{\an7}<i>I couldn't suppress my</i>

{\an7}<i>I have to do this! </i>

181

at least a little bit of
