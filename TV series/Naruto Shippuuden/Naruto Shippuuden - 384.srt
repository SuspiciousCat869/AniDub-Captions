1
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:29,627
{\an1}Why do you get up?!

2
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,598
{\an1}There should be no
reason to keep fighting

3
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,333
{\an1}for a world like this.

4
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,571
No matter.

5
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:43,541
{\an1}It's coming to an
end in a few minutes.

6
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,646
So why do you
keep on fighting?!

7
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:01,092
{\an1}Because it's my Ninja Way.

8
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:08,533
{\an1}No matter what, I
never go back on my word!

9
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,671
{\an1}That is and always
will be my Ninja Way.

10
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,780
I thought I told
you to go to sleep.

11
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,085
{\an1}Let's end it with
our next move, Naruto.

12
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:27,520
Yeah!

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,926
{\an1}We'll sleep tomorrow and
we'll dream our own dreams!

14
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,033
{\an1}The Susano'o is...

15
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:04,419
Wait, that's!

16
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:08,423
{\an1}I believe this is
what Madara did

17
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,024
{\an1}once before, didn't he?

18
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,074
{\an1}Is that Naruto and Sasuke?!

19
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,407
{\an1}Nothing you try now
will change anything.

20
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,510
Look above you.

21
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,279
What do you see
through the hole at the top?

22
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,486
{\an1}I can see what Obito
sees and hear his voice.

23
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,755
It's resonating.

24
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,823
The moon.

25
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,659
{\an1}The time to enter the
dream world draws near.

26
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:51,397
{\an1}It'll finally be time for
the dreams of the moon to

27
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:56,770
{\an1}completely bury this
gaping hole of hell!

28
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,010
Look at me!

29
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:04,712
{\an1}There's nothing in my heart!

30
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,483
I don't feel
pain any longer.

31
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,253
{\an1}Reality is cruel.

32
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,591
{\an1}This hole is just going
to keep getting bigger.

33
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,461
{\an1}How will you seal
this hole by living in

34
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,029
{\an1}a world like this?!

35
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,536
{\an1}This sword is the Sage
of Six Paths' Divine

36
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,839
{\an1}Blade, the Nunoboko.

37
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,575
{\an1}You can no longer defeat me.

38
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,212
{\an1}Your strong emotions
dwell within it, this

39
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,947
{\an1}sword of the soul.

40
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,551
{\an1}The Sage created the
world using this blade.

41
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,724
{\an1}Hey guys, did you feel that?

42
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:48,959
Yeah...

43
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,027
Hold on!

44
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,227
{\an1}Tenten, is this-?

45
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,596
Yeah.

46
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,797
Let's go, Lee!

47
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,966
{\an1}-I think he's calling us.
-Mm-hmm.

48
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,939
{\an1}I will vanquish all of you.

49
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:04,408
{\an1}No matter how much you
resist, it's useless.

50
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:07,779
The power of the
Sage will stop you.

51
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,784
{\an1}Sasuke, let's focus
everything on a single blow.

52
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,086
{\an1}I think we'll only have a
small window to strike.

53
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,622
{\an1}Let's not miss it.

54
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:18,690
{\an1}[affirmative grunt]

55
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:32,771
{\an1}And I'll use this sword to
obliterate this whole world!

56
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,541
[defiant roar]

57
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,477
[gasp]

58
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,047
Obito...

59
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,449
{\an1}When people see someone
trying twice as hard as

60
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,553
{\an1}others, even if it's someone
they used to make fun of

61
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:50,423
{\an1}they instinctively start
wanting to lend a hand.

62
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:54,027
{\an1}That's because people
eventually learn that they

63
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,198
{\an1}only have each other to fill
the holes in their hearts.

64
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:02,502
[gasp]

65
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,942
{\an1}I'm giving a Rasengan
to each of you!

66
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,611
{\an1}Use them to blast through
and wreck his shield!

67
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:13,347
This, huh?

68
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,250
{\an1}Can I really do this?

69
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,386
You can!

70
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:23,558
{\an1}And he who possesses a
heart filled with comrades...

71
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:25,494
[gasp]

72
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,268
{\an1}...is truly powerful!

73
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,749
Why am I
seeing such images?

74
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,219
[roaring]

75
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,964
{\an1}Like we thought, their
chakra reacted to the chakra

76
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:42,467
{\an1}they gave you earlier so we
could pull out his Tailed

77
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,937
{\an1}Beast chakra in one shot!

78
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,538
That's right!

79
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,975
{\an1}But this stunt wouldn't have
worked if the other Tailed

80
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,811
{\an1}Beasts hadn't liked you
and shared their chakra.

81
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,649
I told you how
you could stop me.

82
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,685
{\an1}But I didn't actually tell
you how you could save me.

83
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,221
{\an1}You should have just
told me that right

84
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,056
{\an1}from the beginning!

85
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,790
{\an1}Man, why can't you
Tailed Beasts be more

86
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,559
{\an1}straightforward?!

87
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,895
[annoyed sigh]

88
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,696
{\an1}All right, what do I do?!

89
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,633
{\an1}Before I tell you,
there's something I want

90
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,468
{\an1}to pass on to you.

91
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,535
What?

92
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,104
{\an1}Hold out your hand.

93
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,740
You're gonna
give me something?

94
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,276
{\an1}It's something good.

95
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,378
{\an1}It'll come in handy
one of these days.

96
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,545
Now hurry up!

97
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,961
[chuckles]

98
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:45,901
{\an1}We assembled here because
of Four Tails' summons.

99
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:48,370
{\an1}And we hung around
after promising to tell

100
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:49,672
{\an1}and give you something.

101
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,541
{\an1}Wow, he really did all that?

102
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,711
[chuckle]

103
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:57,713
{\an1}Well, I'm glad that you're
all gathered together and

104
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,481
that you're all
getting along, too!

105
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,953
{\an1}Yes, but that only happened
after Four Tails and Roshi

106
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,754
{\an1}left here, Naruto.

107
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,990
{\an1}It's all thanks to you.

108
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,394
{\an1}Naruto, step forward.

109
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,330
{\an1}Extend your hand.

110
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,898
{\an1}We'll fulfill our
promise to Four Tails,

111
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,566
{\an1}or rather Son Goku.

{\an1}We've met before, huh?

116
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,982
{\an1}And I am Yagura, the
former Fourth Mizukage.

I'm Utakata.

00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,895
{\an1}I'm Lucky Seven Chomei.

{\an1}Naruto, you really
are something special!

125
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,050
Go now!

next, right, Naruto?

129

Damn!

132
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,578
{\an1}We can't grab One or
Eight Tails since we

00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:33,181
{\an1}don't have their chakra.

was linked to me.

weakness, this is key!

he'll have left is

And the Tree's
bud won't bloom!

{\an1}They've all stopped.

00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,952
Which means he
doesn't have control

{\an1}over the Divine Tree!

you that even a small

{\an1}power can be helpful?

{\an1}Our power will change
the course of this world!

00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:01,333
{\an1}His feelings will
flow into you, but

160
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,402
{\an1}don't get distracted!

161
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,670
{\an1}Don't underestimate me!

162
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:07,506
{\an1}My power's equal to
the Sage of Six Paths'!

163
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,055
{\an1}Just keep pulling, Naruto.

164
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:28,928
Naruto!

165
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,830
{\an1}You're the one who
asked us to lend a hand!

166
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,832
{\an1}So we're helping out
till the very end!

167
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,034
You guys!

168
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,569
[chuckle]

169
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:36,870
{\an1}And that isn't all...

170
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:48,416
{\an1}All right, everyone,
now grab onto my chakra!

171
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:51,886
[gasp]

172
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,994
{\an1}It's this, right?

173
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,429
All right!

174
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:03,231
{\an1}On my mark, everyone
pull together hard, okay?!

175
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,035
Now pull!

176
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,154
Are...

177
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,729
Are you saying
I've got regrets?!

178
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,572
You once told me
that you're nobody.

179
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,941
That you don't
want to be anybody.

180
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:17,878
No, stop it!

181
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,713
Don't step into
my thoughts!

182
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,787
But the truth is
that you wanted to be

183
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,988
{\an1}Hokage, just like me.

184
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:32,859
{\an1}It could've even ended up
being the case that I was

185
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:37,364
{\an1}chasing after your shadow
since becoming Hokage has

186
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,299
{\an1}always been my dream.

187
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:43,471
I threw away the
past and my naïve self!

188
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:44,772
Don't say--

189
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,741
{\an1}Then tell me why I'm
able to see this!

190
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,411
{\an1}You can hide behind a
mask, but it's pointless.

191
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:53,481
You were Kakashi
Sensei's friend, my dad's

192
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:59,922
{\an1}subordinate, an Uchiha like
Sasuke, my senior, and a

193
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:03,625
{\an1}Leaf shinobi who shared
the same dream as me.

194
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,160
{\an1}What is all this?!

195
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:07,796
Just tell me!

196
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,132
What is it that
you want with me?!

197
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,735
{\an1}I want to remind you
that you're Obito Uchiha.

198
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,711
{\an1}I told you that I'd tear
that mask right off your

199
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,446
face, remember?!

200
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,913
<i>Obito Uchiha?</i>

201
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:00,915
<i>What meaning is</i>
<i>there in that name or</i>

202
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,617
{\an1}<i>in that existence now?</i>

203
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,853
{\an1}<i>I've merged with Ten Tails,</i>
<i>and I've transcended and</i>

204
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:08,656
{\an1}<i>attained enlightenment.</i>

205
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,426
{\an1}<i>I am no longer human.</i>

206
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:14,597
{\an1}<i>I shall lead mankind</i>
<i>into its next stage.</i>

207
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,735
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Obito Uchiha."</i>

208
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:22,471
<i>I am the Second</i>
<i>Sage of Six Paths!</i>
