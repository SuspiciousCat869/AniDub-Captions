{\an1}<i>I'm going to restore my clan,</i>

154
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:50,421
and destroy a
certain someone.

155
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,761
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Good! you're each unique and</i>
<i>you have your own ideas.</i>

156
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,863
{\an1}<i>We'll have our first</i>
<i>mission tomorrow!</i>

157
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,833
{\an1}Hup! What kind of mission
are we going to have?

158
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,971
It's a task that the
four of us are going
to do together.

159
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,872
What? What?

160
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,976
{\an1}A survival exercise.

161
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,214
{\an1}I'll be your opponent,
but it's not just a drill.

162
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:22,285
And the chance that
you'll fail is at
least 66 percent.

163
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:27,589
Hey, wait up, Sasuke!

164
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,091
{\an1}Wanna walk home together?

165
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:29,825
No, thanks.

166
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,330
{\an1}I finally made genin,
and there's no way that
I'm going to get dropped now.

167
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,065
{\an1}I'm going to train by myself.

168
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,069
{\an1}Yeah...
Guess that makes sense...

169
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,639
{\an1}That jerk!
Always acting so cool!

170
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:51,747
{\an1}<i>All right!</i>

171
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,018
{\an1}If Sasuke's going to train
by himself, then so will I!

172
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:59,653
{\an1}I've had enough!
I'm not going to
lose to him anymore!

173
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:01,856
{\an1}Now grade this,
Professor Kakashi!

174
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,691
{\an1}Yahhh!

175
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:08,562
{\an1}I'm gonna become a genin,
no matter what!

176
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,402
{\an7}<i>Damn it!</i>

177
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:18,239
{\an7}<i>I had to get stuck in a</i>
<i>three-man cell with Sakura and</i>
<i>that loser, of all people!</i>

178
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,045
{\an7}<i>I will pass, all on my own!</i>

179
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,014
{\an8}<i>I just have to stay</i>
<i>focused on my goal.</i>

180
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,556
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>It's set for noon.</i>

181
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,392
Hmm?

182
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,761
{\an1}Your assignment is very simple.

183
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:45,166
{\an1}You just have to take
these bells from me.
That's all there is to it.

184
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,735
If you can't get
'em by noon, you
go without lunch.

185
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,277
{\an4}At least one of you will end up
tied to a post and ultimately
disqualified for failing to
complete the mission.

186
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,379
<i>That one goes back</i>
<i>to the Academy.</i>

187
00:13:58,845 --> 00:13:59,913
Rrrgh!

188
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:01,881
Get ready.

189
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,249
Annnd...

190
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:04,384
start!

191
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,223
{\an1}You n' me,
right now,
fair and square!!!

192
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,357
{\an1}Let's go!

193
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,262
{\an8}<i>Fool. </i>

194
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:25,771
{\an1}I'm gonna crush youuu!

195
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,646
Aaaaaggh!!

196
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:43,055
{\an7}<i>Rrrgh! I'm not going to</i>
<i>let it end like this!</i>

197
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,823
{\an8}<i>I'll attack</i>
<i>from the water!</i>

198
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:00,906
Uuagh!

199
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:07,613
Whooa!

200
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:10,349
Yah! Uagh! Hey!

201
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,346
{\an1}Fire Style:
Fireball Jutsu!!

202
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,995
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha!

203
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:03,367
Sensei said that no
bell means no lunch.

204
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,903
{\an1}But if I eat it right now,
then there's nothing he can do!

205
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:09,239
{\an1}It's chow time!!

206
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,073
Hi there.

207
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,142
{\an1}I was just...
joking sensei.

208
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,543
Nice try.

209
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,646
[alarm]

210
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:18,548
[stomach growl]

211
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,954
It's too late now,
but if all three of
you had come at me,

212
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,289
you might have been
able to take them.

213
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,391
Mmmmhh.

214
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:37,066
{\an1}All right. I'm going to
give you one more chance.

215
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,341
{\an4}But I'm going to make
it much harder on you.
You'll have three
hours to get a bell.

216
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:47,009
{\an1}<i>Eat lunch now to</i>
<i>build up strength.</i>

217
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,278
<i>But, Naruto</i>
<i>doesn't get any.</i>

218
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:54,984
{\an1}It's your punishment for
breaking the rules and
trying to eat by yourself.

219
00:16:56,418 --> 00:17:01,023
{\an1}<i>And if anyone tries to</i>
<i>feed him, that person</i>
<i>will immediately fail.</i>

220
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:06,729
{\an1}I make the rules, and you
follow them. Got it!?

221
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,704
[stomach growl]

222
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:20,975
{\an5}This is no big deal.
I can go without
eating for days.
For weeks!

223
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,445
Unnhhhh...

224
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:28,651
{\an7}<i>I have to get one of those</i>
<i>bells from Kakashi Sensei.</i>

225
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,886
{\an7}<i>But as much as I hate to admit</i>
<i>it, I can't do it alone.</i>

226
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,421
{\an7}<i>What's the best move?</i>

227
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,892
{\an7}<i>Combine the strength</i>
<i>of three into one.</i>

228
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,162
Here.

229
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,333
{\an4}What! No, Sasuke,
you can't do that!
You heard what the
Sensei said.

230
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:49,070
Kakashi's gone.
We need to get those
bells as a team.

231
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,641
{\an1}If Naruto's hungry,
he'll be weak and
ineffective.

232
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:58,011
{\an1}That would hurt the entire team
and jeopardize the mission.

233
00:17:59,113 --> 00:17:59,747
[gulp]

234
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,284

235
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:04,951
[chuckle]

236
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,253
{\an1}Thanks.

237
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,990
Yahhh!!!

238
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,191
You pass.

239
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,393
[chuckle]

240
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:14,861
Huh!?

241
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:15,896
Huhhh!?

242
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,900
In the ninja world,
those who break the
rules are scum.

243
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:25,906
{\an1}But, those who abandon their
friends are worse than scum.

244
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,310
{\an1}The exercise is over.
Everyone passes!

245
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,816
{\an1}Okay, it's picture time!
Look sharp, everyone!

246
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:40,187
{\an5}Yeah, but I still
don't understand why I
have to be in the same
picture as this guy!

247
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,724
Hmph. I should
be asking that,
you loser.

248
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,292
<i>Say that again!</i>

<i>Come on, you guys, quiet down.</i>
