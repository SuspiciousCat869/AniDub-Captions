1
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,078
{\an1}So this is Kabuto? He's
kind of gross, huh?

2
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,448
{\an1}This thing sticking out. It
looks like some kind of
huge--

3
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,650
Just leave him
alone, Suigetsu.

4
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,756
{\an1}She's still alive.

5
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:20,866
{\an4}Listen, what do you guys
want with me after all this
time? Why did you go out of
your way to look for me?

6
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,870
{\an1}Oh, yeah, that's the thing!
Wait, where is it?

7
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,840
{\an1}We found something
incredible in one of the
hideouts.

8
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:29,342
{\an1}Now where is it...

9
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,481
{\an1}Earlier, you said that you
and Itachi stopped Kabuto's
Reanimation Jutsu, right?

10
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:40,354
{\an1}But if it really worked the
way it was supposed to...
why's Madara still here?

11
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:46,460
{\an1}No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within
the Village...

12
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,330
I'm still Itachi
Uchiha of the Leaf!

13
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:52,234
{\an1}You're the only one I can
count on, best friend.

14
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:56,572
{\an1}Protect the village. And the
Uchiha name. Both of them.

15
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,976
{\an1}As I told you, There's
something important
I have to do.

16
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,246
I see...

17
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:06,649
So it wasn't
stopped, then...

18
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:10,820
{\an1}Can't you see that I'm
talking to Sasuke?! Don't
interrupt me like that!

19
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,323
{\an1}Anyway, never mind all that.

20
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:14,490
Here!

21
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,627
{\an1}Take a look at it!

22
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:26,003
{\an1}See? Amazing, isn't it?!

23
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:29,574
{\an1}With this scroll,
Taka can take over the
entire shinobi world!

24
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:30,774
This is it!

25
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,445
Huh?

26
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,947
The all-knowing...

27
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,118
Now...

28
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,723
{\an1}I need to go meet
up with someone.

29
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,558
I'm leaving.

30
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,892
Huh? Meet who?

31
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,462
Orochimaru.

32
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,831
{\an1}Huh?! What are you
talking about?

33
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,167
{\an1}You already killed
Orochimaru, remember?!

34
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,773
{\an1}I wanted you to use
this scroll to...

35
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:07,682
{\an4}Don't you think it's
possible that someone as
tenacious as Orochimaru
might not be killed so easily?

36
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:14,989
{\an1}Even though I find him vile
and repulsive... I still need
him to do something for me.

37
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:23,599
Clan... Village...

38
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,335
{\an1}It's time to go see
the all-knowing!

39
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,305
{\an1}I don't get it. How can you
talk to Orochimaru?

40
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:33,108
{\an1}And who exactly is this
all-knowing person?!

41
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,680
{\an1}That isn't something you
need to know right now.

42
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:44,354
{\an1}I don't get this. But it
doesn't really matter.
Anyway, you can't!

43
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:47,390
{\an1}'Cause Orochimaru must
never be revived!

44
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:52,128
{\an4}You're planning on asking
Orochimaru for help in
trying to control the power
of the scroll, aren't you?

45
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:55,865
{\an1}But you don't have to! You
can learn to do it on your
own, I know it!

46
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,837
{\an1}I mean, that's why I looked
for you. And that's why I'm
giving the scroll to you!

47
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,040
{\an1}There are still things only
Orochimaru can do.

48
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,910
{\an1}Sasuke, just listen...

49
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:11,350
{\an4}You were Orochimaru's
favorite, weren't you? His
star pupil? So why can't you
do it?!

50
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:12,484
Suigetsu...

51
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:14,986
Just don't.

52
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,855
[gasp]
What?

53
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,759
{\an1}Don't underestimate
Orochimaru.

54
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:27,568
{\an4}What?! You idiot! I don't
underestimate that guy at
all! It's just the opposite!
You do!

55
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:31,338
{\an1}The only reason that you
defeated Orochimaru was
because both of his arms had

56
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,708
{\an1}been rendered useless by
the Reaper Death Seal!

57
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,211
You've always
underestimated him!

58
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:41,649
{\an4}You know, even if he is
revived somehow, he probably
still won't be able to use
his arms!

59
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,551
{\an1}But he'll still be
dangerous!

60
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:46,287
{\an1}He's going to come after
your body again!

61
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:49,991
{\an1}If he finds out about this
war, he's gonna want to
be a part of it.

62
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,762
{\an1}He wants to destroy the
Leaf too, remember?!

63
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:56,632
{\an1}And that means Taka
will get all mixed up
in this war, as well!

64
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:58,601
{\an1}Is that what you want?

65
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:07,410
{\an1}We've only now surpassed our
mentors. This is supposed to
be our time to shine!

66
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:13,483
{\an4}Look, nobody wants to see
Orochimaru ever again!
Hasn't he caused us enough
trouble?

67
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:15,085
{\an1}Shut up, Suigetsu.

68
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:21,759
{\an1}Please, just go dig out a
piece of Kabuto's flesh and
bring it over here to me.

69
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:22,660
Huh?

70
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:28,065
{\an1}You don't listen to me, but
for some reason you expect
me to listen to you?

71
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,067
{\an1}Fine. I'll do it.

72
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,739
{\an1}[sigh] So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

73
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:37,008
{\an1}Are you really sure about
all this, Jugo?

74
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,944
{\an1}You want Orochimaru
to return?!

75
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:43,850
{\an1}I don't mind. Sasuke's
will is Kimimaro's will.

76
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,051
{\an1}I will abide by it.

77
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,796
{\an1}You're the same as always.
But what is even going on
here?

78
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:01,067
{\an1}This is called Sage
Transformation in my
village.

79
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,342
{\an4}Just like my original
transformation. But in all
my copies, it's called Curse
Mark Transformation.

80
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,966
{\an1}We've got to seal
that curse mark.

81
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,735
Curse Sealing!

82
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,808
{\an1}So the reverse is...

83
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,843
Curse Unsealing!

84
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,988
[gasping scream]

85
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,438
{\an1}Who would have imagined...

86
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:12,011
{\an1}...that it would be you of
all people who would
facilitate my return!

87
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:30,965
Oh! Hi, there!
Long time no see!

88
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:49,051
{\an1}Orochimaru, there's
something that I want
you to do for me now.

89
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:52,588
{\an1}You don't need to
bother explaining it.

90
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:56,558
{\an1}I have been watching
from inside Anko.

91
00:08:56,592 --> 00:09:00,663
{\an1}I secured my Sage Jutsu
Chakra into those Curse
Marks.

92
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,933
{\an1}They are like pieces of
my own consciousness.

93
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,936
{\an1}Then you know about
the war, as well?

94
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,671
Yes, of course.

95
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:12,943
{\an1}And I just have one thing
to tell you about that,
Suigetsu.

96
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:13,744
[gasp]

97
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,515
{\an1}And that is... I have no
interest in this war at all.

98
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,883
Huh?!

99
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,454
I mean... it is
someone else's war.

100
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:26,825
{\an1}The only thing I'm
interested in now...

101
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:32,230
{\an1}...is your body! Yes, that's
right, my dear Sasuke.

102
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,234
I told you!

103
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:41,506
{\an4}Then again, it's not as if I
currently possess the
strength to steal it away
from you.

104
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,476
{\an1}I wonder about that...

105
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,182
{\an1}What is your intent in
meeting with them?

106
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:53,020
{\an1}There's... too much
that I don't know.

107
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,155
{\an1}I plan to ask them
everything.

108
00:09:56,757 --> 00:10:03,296
{\an4}Everything, huh? There's no
need to know it all just
yet. You are still a child,
after all.

109
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,731
{\an1}No, you're wrong.

110
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:11,005
{\an1}I treated you as though you
were a child. I thought you
needed my protection.

111
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,775
I was unable to
trust your strength.

112
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,344
But now I think...

113
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:20,816
{\an1}Perhaps you could've changed
Father and Mother...

114
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:25,120
{\an1}...and the rest of the
Uchiha as well.

115
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:32,028
{\an4}If I had only come to you
from the start, looked
straight into your eyes and
told you the truth...

116
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,598
{\an1}I'm not a child anymore.

117
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,668
{\an1}I can't stay a child.

118
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,772
And whatever you
do from here on...

119
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,411
{\an1}I want to discover what
started all of it.

120
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:52,717
{\an1}To find out what I'm
supposed to be, and what
I'm supposed to do.

121
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,453
{\an1}Are you questioning
your vengeance?

122
00:10:55,486 --> 00:11:00,458
{\an1}Not at all. Not my quest for
vengeance itself, not a bit.

123
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:06,798
{\an4}After reuniting with Itachi,
my hatred toward the Hidden
Leaf has grown even
stronger.

124
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:08,934
It's just...

125
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,707
{\an4}I want to understand how
even in death, Itachi could
call himself a Leaf
Shinobi...

126
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,544
{\an1}...and care about and try to
protect the village that
dishonored his name.

127
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,850
{\an1}Who was Itachi? What is a
village? What is a clan?

128
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:29,123
{\an1}That is why... I have to know
everything, so I can finally
have the answer.

129
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,826
{\an1}I need to see and decide
for myself what to do.

130
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,370
{\an7}<i>He's no longer the boy who</i>
<i>was manipulated by Itachi...</i>
<i>or me... or Tobi.</i>

131
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,084
{\an7}<i>What a strange sensation...</i>

132
00:11:55,818 --> 00:12:00,723
{\an4}He's going to siphon all of
Kabuto's power and then kill
him! So you'd better stay
alert and watch out!

133
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,758
He might catch
you off guard!

134
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,661
The current you...

135
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,396
...isn't half bad.

136
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,649
{\an1}I told you he'd steal
Kabuto's power!

137
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:29,254
{\an1}No, you're wrong on
that. He undid the
Sage Transformation.

138
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:34,259
{\an1}He took back his own chakra
that was inside Kabuto, not
any of Kabuto's chakra.

139
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:37,162
{\an1}Very well, then. I
will help you out.

140
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,931
Come along.

141
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,800
{\an1}And just where are we going?

142
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:45,504
{\an1}[chuckle] A place you
actually know quite well.

143
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,511
{\an1}Shall we be on our way?

144
00:12:56,016 --> 00:13:01,521
[roaring]

145
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:19,574
{\an1}The statue's been acting all
weird since it swallowed
those objects earlier.

146
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:24,779
Wait, that was...

147
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,782
Don't tell me...

148
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:32,289
{\an1}I would have preferred
bringing it back in a
completed state, but...

149
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,065
{\an1}Watch closely! And surrender
yourself completely!

150
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:50,141
{\an1}The return of Ten Tails! And
the beginning of the end of
the world!

151
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,509
[angry roaring]

152
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:56,748
{\an1}So that's it! The Gedo
statue was Ten Tails'
actual body!

153
00:13:57,081 --> 00:14:00,286
{\an1}Huh?! What does he mean?!
What's the Ten Tails?!

154
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:05,324
{\an1}But what's going on? Back
when he declared war at the
Five Kage Summit...

155
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,993
[angry roaring]

156
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:12,131
{\an4}He claimed the purpose of
this war was to collect the
Nine Tailed Beasts' chakra
to revive Ten Tails.

157
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:17,370
{\an1}He doesn't possess Eight
Tails and Nine Tails yet...
So is he bluffing?

158
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:21,174
{\an1}Don't be careless.
Approaching him is deadly!

159
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,143
Oh!

160
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:28,682
{\an1}It's only a fragment, but it
is not lacking in power.

161
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:32,954
{\an1}Have we given him one
octopus arm's worth of
chakra?

162
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:36,958
{\an1}We're always dropping
rhymes, but maybe we messed
up big this time... Yo...

163
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,026
Yeah!

164
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:44,066
{\an1}He got a bit of Eight-O's
chakra from back in the day.
Now we're sweatin' 'cause

165
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,169
{\an1}holmes is here to stay.
It's not a-okay!

166
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:50,472
{\an1}Eight Tails' octopus
arm chakra, huh?

167
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:54,210
{\an1}So just a piece of a Tailed
Beast is sufficient?

168
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,512
{\an1}Naruto, you felt it
too, didn't you?

169
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:58,647
[angry roaring]

170
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,451
{\an1}That jar and gourd
contained my chakra.

171
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,986
Yup...

172
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,359
[angry roaring]

173
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:12,162
{\an1}Let me take over,
Naruto. I'll explain.

174
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:16,934
{\an1}About Ten Tails, too.
You listen from in here.

175
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,703
Kurama? You know
about Ten Tails?

176
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:22,407
Yeah! Of course!

177
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:26,845
{\an1}Listen up, all of you!

178
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:27,544
Huh?

179
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:28,813
That voice!

180
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:32,017
{\an1}Naruto's switched places
with Nine Tails, pow!

181
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:37,289
{\an4}So just relax, he'll explain
it to us. Nine Tails and
Naruto, they're real tight
now!

182
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:43,295
{\an4}If just a portion of a
Tailed Beast is sufficient,
that statue already has a
piece of Eight Tails'

183
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,765
{\an1}and my chakra in it.

184
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,867
{\an1}Nine Tails, too?!

185
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,975
{\an4}The jar and gourd that guy
summoned and fed to the
statue were two of Old Man
Six Paths' treasured tools.

186
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:04,285
{\an4}They possess powerful
Sealing Jutsu that can seal
away anything. Once you're
inside, you cannot get out.

187
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,719
So...

188
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:13,094
{\an1}Sealed inside the jar was
Kinkaku. And Ginkaku was
sealed inside the gourd.

189
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:21,103
{\an4}I suspect they were brought
back with the Reanimation
Jutsu, used in the war, and
then sealed away.

190
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,507
{\an1}Kinkaku, Ginkaku, the
Sage of Six Paths...

191
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:28,411
{\an1}Sure, all of them are
legendary names. But what in
the world do any of them

192
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,114
{\an1}have to do with Nine
Tails' chakra?

193
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:36,152
{\an1}There was a time long ago
when the brothers challenged
me to a battle.

194
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,622
{\an1}I simply devoured them.

195
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:47,832
{\an4}However, they survived and
fed on me from the inside.
And, in doing so, they
absorbed my chakra.

196
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:54,172
{\an1}So Kinkaku and Ginkaku both
possessed some Nine Tails'
chakra, then...

197
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,877
{\an1}And the guy in the mask took
the two of them from Darui's
First Company as an

198
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,746
{\an1}insurance policy for
reviving the Ten Tails.

199
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:06,084
{\an1}That's consistent with
the report from HQ.

200
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:12,191
{\an1}But since they're just
fragments of Eight Tails'
and my chakra, who knows

201
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,428
{\an1}what form the revived
Ten Tails will take?

202
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,534
{\an1}We must act before Ten Tails
fully comes back to life.

203
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,336
Kakashi...

204
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,074
You speak your
mind far too easily.

205
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:31,645
{\an1}You're a man for whom a
life of regret is fitting!

206
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:37,952
{\an1}You bastard... Just who in
the hell are you, anyway?

207
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:42,625
{\an1}What would be the point in
telling someone who can't
remember faces?

208
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:50,899
{\an1}Kakashi, like you said, if
we're going to make a move,
now's our chance.

209
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,835
[angry growling]

210
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:58,707
{\an4}Old Man Six Paths used to
say that Ten Tails' full
revival would signify the
end of this world.

211
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,710
So, is Ten Tails
really that terrible?

212
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:06,283
{\an1}I get that he's got Ten
Tails, but just how
powerful is he, anyway?

213
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:14,425
{\an1}He's the aggregate of all
the Tailed Beasts' chakra,
One Tail through to me.

214
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:19,130
{\an1}He was the beginning of
chakra and a creator-god
of many nations.

215
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:25,671
{\an1}Ameno-hitotsuno-kami,
Datara, Deidarabotchi: he
has many names.

216
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:30,841
{\an1}He drank the oceans, split
open the earth, hoisted up
the mountains. He's the

217
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:35,147
{\an1}progenitor said to have
created this very land.

218
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,653
{\an1}Simply put, he has the total
power of all nine Tailed
Beasts.

219
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:45,491
{\an1}Honestly, I couldn't take
him on by myself and hope
to win.

220
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:56,736
{\an4}But if he only has a piece
of Eight Tails and me, who
have the most chakra out of
the nine, it may be worth a try.

221
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,475
{\an1}You are all mistaken.

222
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:06,880
{\an1}I don't need Ten Tails to be
revived at full capacity.

223
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,351
[gasps]

224
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:15,390
{\an1}My end goal is a Super
Genjutsu, the Infinite
Tsukuyomi!

225
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:20,996
{\an1}I will put the entire human
population of this planet
under a single genjutsu.

226
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:27,803
{\an1}A single world that belongs
to nobody. One perfect world
without war or ill feelings.

227
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:32,743
{\an4}Only within a single
collective consciousness
where the individual has
been cast aside can

228
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,411
truth be found!

229
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,653
{\an1}The world no longer needs
hope, a future, or famous
heroes.

230
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:48,959
{\an4}Even if incomplete, once Ten
Tails is revived, the
Infinite Tsukuyomi Jutsu can
be achieved,

231
00:19:48,992 --> 00:19:52,063
and reality will
come to an end...

232
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:58,936
{\an4}And all that will exist will
be a single unending dream
that will last for all
eternity!

233
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,837
[angry roaring]

{\an7}<i>Kurama, switch back!</i>

235
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:05,911
Look, I had...

236
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:11,917
{\an1}I had my Father. I had my
Mother. And I had Pervy
Sage.

237
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,621
{\an1}Kids love looking up
to their heroes!

238
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:17,557
{\an1}That's why I can run forward
without hesitation!

239
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:21,494
{\an1}And I will become the
greatest Hokage of them all!

240
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:28,769
{\an1}That's my dream, and I won't
give up on it, you fool!

241
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:34,108
{\an1}Even if you don't want your
youth to reach an end...

242
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:37,411
{\an1}Your dreams still have to
come to an end at some
point!

243
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,549
{\an1}Yeah... Dreams must be
fulfilled.

244
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:45,554
{\an4}Yo, check it: Dreams,
dreams, lots o' dreams
abound, even out here on
this battleground.

245
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:51,293
{\an4}I dream of women's boobs, so
round! When dreams are
fulfilled, that is where
truth is found!

246
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:57,333
{\an4}You've got guts, Bee,
telling us about your, uh,
preferences at a time like
this...
