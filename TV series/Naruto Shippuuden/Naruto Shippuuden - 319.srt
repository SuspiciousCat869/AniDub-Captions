{\an4}The chakra threads wielded
by world-class puppet masters
are able to control human
beings as well as puppets.

{\an1}I thank you.

6

{\an1}I almost had to
slay an ally.

7

{\an1}There's a special way
Puppet Users fight
against each other.

I'm the only one here
who can do this.

{\an1}Isn't that right,

20
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,418

23
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:35,708
{\an7}<i>I felt that Sasori was too</i>

28
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:51,216
<i>Sasori! How've</i>
<i>you been?</i>

29
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:59,890
{\an4}Granny Chiyo told me that
your last puppet was a
really big hit with
everybody.

30
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:05,230
Someday I want to be a
shinobi everyone praises.
Just like your puppets!

31
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,934
Hey! Are you
listening to me?

32
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,603
{\an1}Hello? I'm right here!

33
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,672
{\an1}Komushi's here
to see you!

34
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,611
Come on, already!
Answer me!

35
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,957
I didn't mean to lose
my temper. Sorry about
that.

36
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:36,293
{\an5}It's just that you're
kinda treating me worse
than you'd treat a
puppet, you know?

37
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:43,267
{\an5}Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to wait until hell
freezes over to get an
answer out of you!

38
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,872
Anyway, I have a
message from Granny
Chiyo.

39
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,174
She wants you to finish
those puppets earlier-

40
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,709
{\an1}Crow, Black And,
and Salamander...

41
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:53,409
{\an3}Huh?

42
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:59,016
{\an1}<i>Everything she</i>
<i>requested is complete.</i>

43
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:03,153
So your new creations,
huh? Boy, you certainly
do work!

44
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:04,854
{\an1}I don't like to
make people wait.

45
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:07,891
Uh... Of course.
I'm sure that
you don't.

46
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,101
{\an1}<i>Whoa...</i>

47
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,404
{\an1}Wow, that's amazing!
They look just like
real human fingers!

48
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:30,313
{\an1}Hmm...

49
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,349
Oh! I almost forgot
to ask you...

50
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,188
{\an5}About that new one. She
wanted me to ask you if
you'd finished the recipe
for the Crow puppet's poison.

51
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:41,891
{\an3}Hm?

52
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:48,932
<i>All these are really</i>
<i>rare medicinal plants!</i>

53
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,267
{\an1}You're gonna make a
mixture out of all
of them?

54
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:56,905
<i>I'm gonna need to ask</i>
<i>permission about this.</i>
<i>All right!</i>

55
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,642
{\an5}<i>I, Komushi, will</i>
<i>negotiate it!</i>
<i>Give me a little</i>
<i>time-</i>

56
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,245
{\an1}I don't like
waiting around.

57
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,713
{\an1}Guess not... I'd
better go, then!

58

00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:16,692
Hm? What is it?

62
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,861
Oh, did you relay my
message to-?

63
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:27,402
{\an1}Granny Chiyo, Sasori
has a request to ask
of you.

64
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:28,937
What is it?

65
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:39,247
{\an1}Oh. Well, there's not much
I can say without knowing
the blending ratio.

66
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,490
{\an1}But since
it's you...

67
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,296
{\an1}I foresee no issues. I'll
go clear it with the
Pharmaceutical Division.

68
00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,001
{\an1}But right now, I'm in the
middle of some research,
so please leave.

69
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:04,406
{\an1}<i>Man, Sasori! You've got</i>

<i>still young but you're</i>

{\an1}<i>already contributing</i>

71
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:09,310

72
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:11,545
{\an1}<i>Are you listening?</i>

73
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:16,617
{\an5}I don't know if you know
this, but Granny Chiyo
always seems really
worried about you.

74
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,054
{\an1}I can't wait for the day
that I finally get
acknowledged as a full-

75
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,522
{\an1}fledged shinobi just
like your puppets!

76
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:28,829
{\an4}My own parents still treat
me like a kid! They keep
telling me that I'm not
suited to be a shinobi...

77
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:33,000
{\an1}But guess what? I just
got assigned to work
border security!

78
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,202
{\an1}I mean, yeah, it's
only guard duty,

81

What are you up to at
this hour?! I've been
worried sick about you!

82
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:42,776
Mom, cut it out!

83
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,346
{\an1}I'm gonna be working
border security from
now on!

84
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,216
{\an5}Oh, you don't have to go
out on missions like that!
I'll just take care of you
for the rest of my life!

85
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,384
<i>How's that sound?</i>

86
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,595
{\an1}Thanks, Sasori!

87
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:04,631
I heard...

88
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:07,100
...they said you were
injured while on guard
duty.

89
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:10,438
{\an1}Yeah, I messed
up... But look!

90
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:11,738
Huh?

00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:14,908

not all, either!

93

{\an1}I feel stronger
than ever before!

{\an1}Eh, pretty much the same
as usual. But, recently

{\an1}really small
puppet parts.

00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:41,836
{\an1}And don't take the
Reanimation Jutsu
so lightly!

141
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:44,673
{\an1}<i>If the jutsu caster</i>
<i>gets serious...</i>

142
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:48,076
{\an1}Speak of the devil!

143
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,218
{\an1}<i>Reverse Secret</i>
<i>White Technique!</i>

144
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,921
{\an1}Esematsu's
Ten Puppets!

145
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:14,635
Huh?

146
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,804
{\an1}<i>Wires?!</i>

147
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,108
[gasp]

148
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:36,724
<i>Sasori... and his</i>
<i>Mother and Father</i>
<i>puppets...</i>

149
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:39,025
{\an1}I recovered and
repaired all of
them...

150
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:57,845
{\an1}Sasori, a human who
wanted to be a
complete puppet.

151
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:02,215
{\an7}He said he was an
unfinished puppet
with a beating heart
at its core...

152
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:05,152
{\an7}Do you think he wanted to
be closer to his parents?

153
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,521
Since both of them had
already become puppets?

154
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,061
{\an1}<i>To think someone would</i>
<i>want to be a puppet</i>
<i>with no soul...</i>

155
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,231
It could be...

156
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,168
Although...

157
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:26,606
{\an4}Actually, I can sense the
souls of Sasori's mother
and father inside of
these puppets.

158
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,609
{\an1}<i>I'd like to believe</i>
<i>that he sensed them</i>
<i>as well.</i>

159
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:37,751
{\an5}Granny Chiyo said Sasori
was able to anticipate
the Mother and Father
puppets' attack.

160
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:40,386
But he didn't even
attempt to dodge it.

161
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,656
He let his
defenses down.

162
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,660
Yeah... It must have
gotten through to him.

163
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:49,361
<i>The cry that his</i>
<i>parents souls let</i>
<i>out...</i>

164
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,767
{\an1}I may well be
inexperienced...

165
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,437
{\an1}But I'm not so ignorant
that I couldn't feel your
regret and sadness pulsing

166
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:01,006
{\an1}through every last
inch of your Chakra
Threads.

167
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:06,178
{\an1}You say whatever pops
into your head! That's
why your a youngster!

168
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:11,884
{\an1}<i>There are many things I'd</i>
<i>like to atone for, but it's</i>
<i>too late. I'm dead.</i>

169
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,787
{\an1}<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>further I can do!</i>

170
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:19,124
{\an1}Sasori entrusted his
legacy to me...

171
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,830
{\an1}I entrust you with the
"Father" and "Mother"
puppets.

172
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:28,601
{\an1}Sasori?! He
did that?!

173
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:33,772
{\an4}<i>Puppets only Sasori</i>
<i>could create. Their</i>
<i>inner working's are</i>
<i>unbelievably delicate,</i>

174
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:35,808
{\an1}all the way down
to the fingertips.

175
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:42,748
{\an7}<i>So he shares a love and</i>
<i>passion for puppets,</i>
<i>just like Sasori did.</i>

176
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:46,584
{\an1}I believe Sasori's soul
still dwells inside
these puppets!

177
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:51,589
{\an4}<i>Thanks to his love, the</i>
<i>souls of his parents</i>
<i>have been instilled in</i>
<i>them, as well!</i>

178
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:57,061
In the end, I think
that Sasori sensed
that for himself.

179
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:59,597
{\an1}You speak of puppets
that have souls?

180
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:01,699
{\an7}There's even more,
Granny Chiyo.

181
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:07,872
{\an4}The love that you gave to
his Father and Mother
puppets, became a part of
their souls, as well.

182
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:08,773
Oh?

183
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:13,177
{\an1}Sasori was aware of that.
And he entrusted all of
it to me.

184
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,815
{\an7}Rather, he left it
behind for future
generations.

185
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:22,720
{\an7}And passing it on has
become my duty, as well,
one that I take very
seriously.

186
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,756
Sasori did that?

187
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:29,059
{\an7}I may still be a youngster,
and I suppose that to you,
I'm little more than a
stranger.

188
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:33,297
{\an7}<i>But my kid brother Gaara</i>
<i>received your soul and</i>
<i>came back to life.</i>

189
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,600
{\an7}<i>So I'm not a</i>
<i>stranger at all.</i>

190
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:40,203
{\an1}<i>That's not the only thing</i>
<i>I sense through the Chakra</i>
<i>Threads! Sasori, his mother</i>

191
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,740
{\an1}<i>and father, their family's</i>
<i>thoughts and love...</i>

192
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,010
{\an1}Their souls are crying
out to me now...

193
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,679
{\an7}They're saying, "Please
stop Granny Chiyo!"

194
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,852
{\an1}Family...

195
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:55,719
<i>Mother!</i>

196
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,722
{\an1}This is only a simple
family portrait. You
don't have to be so

197
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,390
{\an1}stubborn about
the whole thing!

198
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:01,592
You're a fool!

199
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,794
The word "shinobi"
means "stealth"!

200
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:07,297
I'm not going to take
a photo to be put up
as a decoration!

201
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:11,535
Just so that people can
say, "Oh, what a fine
portrait" at parties!

202
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,971
{\an1}Well, it wouldn't go
that far, I don't think.

203
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:16,473
Oh, please! Of
course, it will!

204
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:17,574
<i>Granny Chiyo...</i>

205
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,844
{\an1}Is it that you don't
want to take a photo
with us?

206
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:28,719
No! It's not that! Where
would you even get such
an idea?

207
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,854
Heh! What are we
going to do with
you?

208
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:35,592
Oh... What are
you doing?

209
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,464
[groaning]

210
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,667
Ah-Ahh!

211
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:04,720
{\an1}I must say, it seems that
they are in the hands of
a fine puppeteer now.

212
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,524
[gasp]

213
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,472
{\an1}Granny Chiyo!

214
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,612
{\an1}Ha! Ha! Just kidding!

215
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:34,717
{\an1}Playing possum
for real!
[laughing]

216
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,523
{\an4}Now let's see, Sasori
left his Mother and
Father to you as a
gift.

217
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:45,193
{\an1}It seems only fair that
I should leave you with
something, too.

218
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:50,765
{\an7}But the only things that
I have left to give you
now are my Secret Puppet
Techniques.

219
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,968
{\an1}You'll learn by
experiencing them!

220
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:53,868
Wait, hold on!

221
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,838
{\an1}Secret White Technique!
Army of Illusions!

222
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh no! This is
seriously not
good at all!

223
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,414
[laughter]

224
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:10,318
{\an4}<i>When I was a kid, I</i>
<i>begged you to train me,</i>
<i>but you said you didn't</i>
<i>care about the future</i>

225
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:12,320
{\an1}<i>of the village</i>
<i>and ignored me!</i>

226
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,723
<i>Well I guess I</i>
<i>was younger back</i>
<i>then!</i>

227
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,958
{\an1}You were already
an old hag!

228
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:20,695
<i>[laughter]</i>

229
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,660
{\an1}<i>Did you say that Omoi</i>
<i>deserted the battlefield?!</i>

230
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,162
<i>Is this true,</i>
<i>Kakashi?</i>

231
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,501
{\an4}<i>I'm afraid it is. Reports</i>
<i>say he ran from his post</i>
<i>after stating that he</i>
<i>needed to leave for a bit.</i>

232
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:13,471
{\an4}<i>Deserting under enemy</i>
<i>fire is a serious</i>
<i>offense in the Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud!</i>

233
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,244
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Run, Omoi!"</i>

234
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:21,914
{\an1}<i>Damn it, Omoi!</i>
<i>What were you</i>
<i>thinking?!</i>
