I feeding you!?

140
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:08,698
Listen, I never refuse
food if it's offered to
me. That is my ninja way!

141
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,365
Another one, please!

142
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:14,972
{\an1}You know, right when you
were first discharged,
you were still so skinny.

143
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,574
{\an1}But that sure didn't
last long, did it?

144
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:21,913
{\an1}Yeah, with that kind of
appetite, I'd say you're
completely back to normal.

145
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:25,984
Hey, Asuma Sensei...
after I'm done eating,
can you help me train?

146
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,486
{\an1}Choji! Have you lost
what's left of your mind?!

147
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,289
{\an1}I mean, you just got
better, remember?!

148
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:36,129
{\an1}Ridiculous. Everybody is so
stuck on training around here!

149
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,899
{\an1}How come you're so eager
to get back to it, Choji?

150
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:45,239
{\an1}For starters, I want to catch up
to Shikamaru, since he beat me
to becoming a chunin.

151
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:48,976
{\an1}After all, together we're the
Ino-Shika-Cho trio, right?

152
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,979
{\an1}You do your best too, okay, Ino?

153
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,849
{\an1}Yeah, of course! I don't
need you to tell me that.

154
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:02,158
All right.

155
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,664
{\an1}Now, don't get overconfident
because of one or two successes.

156
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:09,366
{\an1}You have to become faster
and more efficient

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,403
{\an1}No one waits for treatment on
the battlefield, you understand?

158
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,139
Yes!

159
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,185
Blargh!

160
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:26,787
Heh heh!

161
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,589
Huh...

162
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:30,291
Who's there!?

163
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,304
{\an1}Lady Tsunade! Please, will
you make me your apprentice?

164
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:47,944
{\an1}You're from the
Yamanaka Clan, right?

165
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:52,616
{\an1}Sakura was able to
learn to revive that
fish in three months.

166
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,386
{\an1}So I'll test you and see just
how far you can get.

167
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,623
{\an1}I'll give you three months, too.

168
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,997
{\an1}I understand. Please
let me try!

169
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:12,272
I have to work
with this thing?

170
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,575
{\an1}The usual way to go about
resuscitating a creature
that's asphyxiated

171
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:19,513
{\an1}is to use one's own chakra to
stimulate its heart or brain.

172
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:24,352
{\an1}<i>Octopi generally have one</i>
<i>systemic heart and two</i>
<i>branchial hearts.</i>

173
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,224
{\an1}<i>And separate from the brain,</i>
<i>they have eight nervous systems</i>
<i>in their arms.</i>

174
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:35,031
{\an4}You need to pay attention and
address each of these areas if
you're going to have any hope of
resuscitating it.

175
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,168
{\an1}In short, it has many
parts to take care of.

176
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,670
{\an3}Oh...

177
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,471
{\an1}You can quit if you
don't like it!

178
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:46,077
{\an1}Sakura! Be quiet!  You still
know practically nothing at all
when it comes to healing!

179
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,580
{\an1}I have to-- All of these?!

180
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,749
You can quit if
you don't like it!

181
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:53,118
[grunt]

182
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:25,855
Agh!

183
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:29,727
{\an1}That happened because your
chakra control is too rough.

184
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,299
{\an1}You have to fine-tune your
technique, or the octopus
will be ripped apart.

185
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,103
{\an1}You must learn to control
your chakra more carefully
and delicately!

186
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:40,505
Uh... Right!

187
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:43,608

Huh..!?
[snoring]

191
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:29,830
{\an1}Today is the three-month mark.
Let's see what you've got, Ino.

192
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,732
{\an3}Right!

193
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,539
Haaaaa....

[laugh]

197
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:57,362
You did it!
[giggles]

198
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,065
Hey! Sakura!

199
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:03,435
{\an1}You took too long and
made lots of mistakes.

200
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,839
{\an1}It took me three months, too,
but when I did it, I was able to

201
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,508
{\an1}complete it much more
smoothly than you did.

202
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:09,909
Oh, shut it, Sakura!

203
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:13,780
You just broke my
concentration since you
kept peeking over at me!

204
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,483
{\an1}What did you just say?!

205
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:21,657
{\an1}[chuckle] Alright, you pass.

206
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:33,036
{\an1}So uh... what made you want to
learn Medical Ninjutsu?

207
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:36,739
Huh? Well...

208
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:40,578
I wanted to create a
place where I belong.

209
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,279
Oh...

210
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:50,055
{\an1}See, Naruto... Naruto kept
his promise to me and got
all beaten up for it.

211
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:52,891
<i>He acted reckless...</i>
<i>all because of me...</i>

212
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:56,596
{\an1}<i>I was always... standing in</i>
<i>the back, following them...</i>

213
00:17:56,629 --> 00:18:05,772
{\an1}<i>But...  I'm a member of the</i>
<i>team, too.  I wanted to walk</i>
<i>shoulder to shoulder with them.</i>

214
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:11,379
{\an1}And so I made a promise to
myself: From that point on,
that is exactly what I'd do.

215
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,585
{\an7}This is all so that you can
keep up with them

216
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,322
{\an7}and to protect the Ino-Shika-Cho
tradition as well as our clan's
tradition.

217
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:23,727
{\an7}That's why I must pass our
Secret Ninjutsu on to you.

218
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,897
{\an7}After all, together we're the
Ino-Shika-Cho trio, right?

219
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,869
{\an7}You do your best too, okay, Ino?

220
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:39,578
{\an7}<i>Team 10 is where I belong. And</i>
<i>I want to walk shoulder to</i>
<i>shoulder with them, too!</i>

221
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,848
{\an8}<i>But...</i>

222
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:46,886
{\an1}But of course, mastering this
Secret Ninjutsu will take you
several years,

223
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,456
{\an1}even if you do continue
to train this hard.

224
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,729
{\an8}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Maybe I've just been running</i>
<i>away and taking the easy way out</i>

[gasp]

226
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,902
{\an1}Hey, you're wounded, Sakura!

227
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:05,107
Oh, Yeah, I guess I
hurt myself earlier.

228
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:06,909
That's not good!

229
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,482
{\an3}Ino...

230
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:18,556
{\an7}I have to thank you, Sakura.
Because of you, I'm going to
the place where I belong.

231
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,897
{\an1}All right! There! Done!

<i>awesome attack up her sleeve!</i>

236
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:54,029
{\an1}Both of you have really
progressed. I have to try
harder too!

237
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:58,167
Yeah, that's right!
Let's all do our best and
pass these Chunin Exams!

{\an1}[stomach growling]

239
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:04,274
{\an1}Good idea. But making sure we
eat is important, too.

240
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,748
Here ya go!

241
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:15,053
{\an1}I never turn down food when it's
offered. I mean, I know that's
my Ninja Way, but...

242
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:20,025
What's wrong? Once you
process it, that scorpion's
toxin becomes medicinal!

243

{\an1}Are you saying that fighting
this thing was partly to
gather provisions?!

244
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:27,000
Well, it's rich in amino
acids and great for
countering fatigue!

245
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,902
Come on! Let's eat!

246
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:43,285

one who's matured the most.
