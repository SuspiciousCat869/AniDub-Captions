00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:25,402
{\an4}<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>If you insist on going</i>
<i>after Sasuke, then you'll</i>
<i>get no training from me.</i>

2
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,403
[gasp]

3
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:30,873
{\an1}I'll have the Anbu Black Ops
assigned to guard you,

4
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:32,508
{\an1}to prevent you from
leaving the village.

5
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:39,113
{\an1}You're not just some
ordinary kid, you know.
You've got the Nine-Tails.

6
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,218
{\an1}Behave like a kid,
keep refusing to
listen to what I tell you,

7
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:47,920
{\an1}and I'll have no choice but
to do what I have to do.

8
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:54,826
{\an4}<i>Eventually, you're going to</i>
<i>have to face enemies far worse</i>
<i>than Orochimaru and it's time</i>
<i>you started preparing for them.</i>

9
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:59,464
{\an1}And the first thing is,
give up on Sasuke.

10
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:05,469
{\an1}<i>What happened was</i>
<i>destined to happen.</i>

11

{\an1}<i>Dismiss him from your</i>
<i>mind and move on.</i>

12
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:14,743
{\an1}To be a shinobi, you need
more than strength and jutsu.

13
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,978
{\an1}You must acquire the judgment
to make the right decisions.

14
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,415
{\an1}<i>You must become smarter.</i>

15
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,454
{\an1}The longer that you're a fool,
The harder it'll be for you to
live in this shinobi world.

16
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,558
All right, then fine.

17
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:40,263
{\an1}If being smarter means what
you say it does, I'll remain
a fool my entire life.

18
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,768
{\an1}I'm going after him, and I'll
do it alone if I have to!

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,536
{\an1}I'll make my own awesome jutsu!

20
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:51,239
{\an1}<i>And whenever the Akatsuki</i>
<i>show up, I'll smack 'em down!</i>

21
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,890
{\an1}The thought of my leaving you to
come up with Jutsu on your own.

22
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,760
{\an1}Like that idiotic
"Sexy Jutsu" of yours.

23
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:18,894
Rrh.

24
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:28,736
{\an1}This is more than foolish.
It's so colossally foolish
it might even work.

25
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,105
{\an1}We gotta lotta work to do when
you get outta the hospital.

26
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:34,207
{\an1}So be ready to hit
the ground running.

27
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,175
See ya.

28
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:40,945
You got it!

29
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:58,594
Oh!

30
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:06,367
<i>Just you watch.</i>

31
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,704
{\an1}C'mon, let's go!
Sometime this
year'd be nice!

32
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,840
Yeah, okay, okay!
I'm coming!

33
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:05,096
{\an1}Gutsy Master and Student:
The Training

34
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,665
{\an1}But I don't understand;

35
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:09,533
{\an1}why do I have to
train to break free
of genjutsu now?

36
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,935
[sigh]

37
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,170
Come on, Naruto,
think for a minute;

38
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,439
{\an1}don't you remember the
reason for this training?

39
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:18,373
Huh?

40
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,543
{\an1}Just listen to me, Sasuke!

41
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:26,814
{\an1}I'm telling you, I'm not
going to let Orochimaru
get ahold of you!

42
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:33,687
{\an4}If you won't listen, then I'm
just going to break single every
bone in your body if that's
what it takes to stop you!

43
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,290
{\an1}I have had enough!
What are you?!

44
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:42,260
{\an1}I'm your friend, Sasuke!

45
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:47,798
{\an1}That's why I'm telling you,
I won't let the likes of
Orochimaru get you!

46
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:55,303
{\an1}I was too weak. That's why
I wasn't able to stop him then.

47
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,306
{\an1}I couldn't
bring him back!

48
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,308
{\an1}That's the reason
I'm doing all this.

49
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:04,010
{\an1}So I can become
stronger, for his sake!

50
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,614
Yep. You got that right.

51
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:07,614
{\an1}But then, why--?!

52
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,115
'Cause Sasuke possesses
the Sharingan!

53
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:15,187
{\an1}<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>Someone with the Sharingan can</i>
<i>manipulate their visual prowess</i>

54
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,321
{\an1}<i>and naturally will</i>
<i>be good at genjutsu.</i>

55
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:22,493
{\an1}<i>Eventually, Sasuke will learn</i>
<i>to master his ability,</i>
<i>if he hasn't already.</i>

56
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,531
{\an1}<i>If you can't defend yourself</i>
<i>against it, how do you</i>
<i>expect to bring him back?</i>

57
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:29,465
{\an1}Ugh...

58
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,833
{\an1}Okay, I get it.

59
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:41,508
{\an4}Now as you know, genjutsu
is when the enemy takes
control of your inner
chakra and manipulates it.

60
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:46,212
However, if you can
create a disturbance
within your own chakra,

61
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:49,514
then you prevent the
genjutsu from working,
and you can break free.

62
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:53,018
{\an1}Uhh. I don't know if I can
do something like that.

63
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:57,054
Well, guess what, kid?
You already have some
experience doing that!

64
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,322
{\an1}What? I do?!

65
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,591
Sure you do!
During your
Rasengan training,

66
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:05,728
{\an1}you learned to release
your chakra and rotate it
in your palms, remember?

67
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,564
{\an1}Watch carefully!
All eyes on the balloon!

68
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,606
Hup!

69
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,442
{\an1}Oh! And that's it?!

70
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:26,812
Yep! Instead of
releasing and rotating
chakra into your palms,

71
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,313
you do it inside
your body.

72
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,015
{\an1}Then this training's
gonna be a piece of cake!

73
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:34,952
All right, then. Let's
get some real practice
at breaking genjutsu!

74
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,719
{\an1}Huh?!

75
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,421
Summoning Jutsu!

76
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:46,962
{\an1}Well, as I live and breathe;
if it isn't Jiraiya Honey!

77
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:50,631
First let me thank you
for coming all this
way, Mr. Gamariki.

78

No need to be so formal!

79

{\an1}Would ya get off me;
I can't breathe!

80
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,771
Oh, and who might
this cute boy be?

81
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:00,472
<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>That's Naruto.</i>

{\an1}Hwaah! Whoa,
who is this guy?!

83
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,077
{\an1}Nice to meet you,

84
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:08,412
{\an1}You know,
you're creeping me out.

85
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,815
{\an1}I have a favor to ask
you, Mr. Gamariki.

86
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:17,519
{\an5}I need to teach this kid
how to break genjutsu,
and I could really use
your help with that.

87
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:20,990
{\an1}All right. I suppose
I can help you out.

88
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:24,926
{\an1}Especially since none other
than Jiraiya Honey is asking!

<i>Ask him nicely!</i>

break this genjutsu fast and
get out of this creepy place!

Woah, so what
happened to him?

125
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,982
You happened to him.

126
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,085
{\an1}You tried to disrupt chakra
in the genjutsu world,

127
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,754
{\an1}but you ended up releasing
it into reality instead
and you hit him!

{\an1}[sigh] So I didn't
pull it off, did i?

129
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:29,828

to go back to basic chakra
control first and then we'll
move on to actual training.

{\an1}I'm close, Pervy Sage.

147
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,020
{\an1}Call it a day for now
and have some food;

148
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,122
{\an1}you need to keep up your
strength, all right?

149
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:45,990

Why'dja choose me, huh?!

153
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,402
{\an1}I must be a potential
genius in the making!

154
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:04,704
{\an1}Aw man, it's just like
I always thought!

155
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:10,341
{\an1}The truth is, kid,
a long time ago the
Fourth Hokage was my student.

156
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:15,113
{\an1}<i>And you bear such a striking</i>

157
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:15,814
Hmm?

158
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,016
{\an1}<i>Sorry, that's the only</i>
<i>reason I've got for ya.</i>

159
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,118

{\an1}Good! Guess we can move to
the next stage of training!

167
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,672
Why are we going
somewhere different to
practice this, anyway?

{\an1}Is there some great genjutsu
master where we're heading
or something like that?

169
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,780
{\an1}We're going to a village
that's surrounded by a forest,
a very special kind of forest.

170
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:43,318
{\an4}<i>A magnetic field runs</i>

{\an1}If someone takes the wrong
path in those woods,

172
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:49,623
{\an1}they could find themselves
in a situation similar to
being under a genjutsu.

173
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,560
{\an1}And that makes this forest
the perfect place to finish
up your genjutsu training.

174
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,529
{\an1}Cool! Sounds like
my kind of fun!

00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,430
{\an1}Hurry up!
Let's do this!

176
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,272

Are we gonna reach this
village anytime soon?

177
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,306
{\an1}Just relax;
we're almost there.

178
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,141

I can't see a thing!

179

{\an1}<i>Don't wander off or you'll</i>

Why is there
a wall here?!

183
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,489
{\an4}I don't know. There
was nothing like this
here the last time I
came through this way.

195

197
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:08,287
{\an4}How are your parents
Sukune and Yone doing?
I'd sure like to say
hello to them.

up with all that
back there?!

{\an1}But whatever's going on back
there, it's made villagers who
used to be friendly to travelers

211
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:49,321
{\an1}put up a wall to keep
everyone out and even take
up arms against them.

suspicious guys hanging around.
So stay alert!

I will.

217
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,105
{\an1}Bet you're tired from being
on guard duty all night.

218
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,173
Go ahead and get some
shut-eye, Tanishi.

219
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,274

{\an1}If we don't make trouble,
then no one will get killed.
That's our only option!

290
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:15,537
{\an1}Please, you guys. Don't do
anything to make this worse;
just leave before they find you!

291
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,772
{\an1}How can you call
yourself a--?!

292
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:18,839
Understood!

293
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
{\an1}Pervy Sage?

294
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,442
{\an1}Ah! You'll go?

295
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:22,577
Ooh...

296
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:23,644
{\an1}I'm sorry.

297
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,079
{\an1}I understand why you
want us to leave.

298
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:31,450
{\an1}<i>But I owe the people of this</i>
<i>village. And I won't leave them</i>
<i>to suffer through this alone.</i>

299
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,284
{\an1}Now that's more like it!

300
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:42,192
<i>Tanishi?!</i>

301
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:48,130
{\an1}Tanishi! Is this one of the
two suspicious men that you
mentioned seeing before?

302
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,499
Yeah! Damn right!
Ah, I mean, yes, sir!

303
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,437
{\an1}They call me the Great Jiraiya,
and yet I was so careless that
this mere boy caught me!

304
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,706
{\an1}We'd better take him
to see Lord Kandachi.

305
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:00,006
Yeah!

306
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,709
{\an1}The other one may still be
wandering around nearby.

307
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:04,943
{\an1}So keep your eyes open!

308
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,311
Got it!
Got it!

309
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:17,688
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>That must be the place!</i>

310
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,423
{\an1}Yeah, I think you're right.

311
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:23,225
{\an1}Looks like that's where
they've been keeping
all the hostages.

312
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,503
{\an1}<i>[Tanishi]</i>
<i>That's why I told you</i>

313
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:03,840
{\an4}<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>You're wrong. Did you actually</i>
<i>believe that he would ever</i>
<i>release the hostages?</i>

314
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:04,775
<i>[Tanishi]</i>
<i>But...</i>

315
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:08,110
{\an1}<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>Tanishi, don't forget</i>
<i>everything your father did!</i>

316
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:10,579
{\an1}<i>Think about why he</i>
<i>chose to fight back!</i>

317
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,549
{\an1}<i>If you keep on believing</i>
<i>that your father died a</i>
<i>senseless death,</i>

318
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,751
{\an1}<i>then this village</i>
<i>will never be saved!</i>
