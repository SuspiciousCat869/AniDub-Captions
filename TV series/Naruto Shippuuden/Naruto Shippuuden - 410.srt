00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:24,042
{\an1}We have both scrolls! Let's
just get to the central
tower!

7
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:28,011
{\an1}No way! I don't want to! I
still haven't made any
friends, yet!

8
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:31,379
{\an1}I just want to have a

is all over!

the Hidden Waterfall?!

{\an7}We may not beat the
ninety-seven-minute record
set by the Kazekage when he

12
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:42,516
{\an7}was a genin, but, if we just
focus, we could still take
first place!

00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:30,563
{\an1}Where are you-?!

34
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,931
{\an1}I'm heading to the central

00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,398

00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,908
{\an1}I agree. It's starting to
get really late.

00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:07,608
{\an1}Not now. I'm okay.

{\an1}Hey! Where are we headed?!

50
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,281
{\an1}The central tower, of
course.

51
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,180
{\an1}Wait, we don't have both
scrolls, yet!

52
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:33,282
{\an1}Use your head! The very
earth beneath us is to our
advantage!

53
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:38,884
{\an1}Actually,... we don't have
the "Earth" scroll. Just the
"Heaven" one.

54
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:40,752
{\an1}That's not what I meant,
Yukata.

55
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:45,653
{\an1}<i>Right now, any team with</i>
<i>both "Heaven" and "Earth"</i>
<i>scrolls knows that they'll</i>

56
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,754
<i>be targeted. </i>

57
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:50,721
{\an1}Which means they'll quickly
head straight for the
central tower.

58
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:54,088
{\an1}However, the whole area
surrounding it has been
filled with traps.

59
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:56,757
{\an1}Except this eastern route.

60
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:00,624
{\an1}What, seriously? The eastern
route is clear?

61
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:04,292
{\an1}That means everybody is
going to be using that
route, aren't they?

62
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:08,092
{\an1}Yes, but... it also has
natural but hidden quicksand
pits.

63
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,027
[gasping]

64
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,428
{\an1}Once you fall in, you can't
get out. So we'll get there
first, wait patiently, and

65
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:16,262
{\an1}steal a scroll off one of
the unlucky ones.

66
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,763
{\an1}You're so smart!

67
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:19,730
{\an1}It does sound a bit
cowardly, though...

68
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:24,064
{\an1}Do you want to pass the
Chunin Exams or not? We
can't let our pride get in

69
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:24,932
{\an1}the way, right now!

70
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,699
{\an1}Okay. Let's do it.

71
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:07,011
{\an1}So... you're Houichi.

72
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,979
{\an1}You're younger than I
thought you'd be.

73
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,413
{\an1}Yes, I can 'not deny that I
am young.

74
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:17,847
{\an1}However, since I was a
child, I've studied the
power of the Priest Bunpuku

75
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,648
{\an1}to mold currents.

76
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,148
You said...

77
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,583
...Bunpuku?

78
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,149
{\an1}Yes.

79
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:28,750
{\an1}Gaara was chosen to become
the Kazekage, but he still
poses a threat to this

80
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,518
village.

81
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:35,218
{\an1}Many fear what he could do.
I believe that measures must
be taken to control that fear.

82
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,955
{\an1}The Chunin Exams is a
perfect chance, to extract
Shukaku the One Tail.

83
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:45,322
{\an1}<i>Ultimately,... this means</i>
<i>that Gaara must die. </i>

84
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,089
{\an1}Yes.

85
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,191
{\an1}<i>First, we must make sure the</i>
<i>Kazekage is alone, and lure</i>
<i>him to the tower. </i>

86
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,593
{\an1}<i>Now, I'll release the</i>
<i>barrier that will obstruct</i>
<i>long-range sensory</i>

87
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,794
<i>perception. </i>

88
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,461
{\an1}<i>This place is called the</i>
<i>Demon Desert in part because</i>
<i>of its massive, deadly</i>

89
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:08,063
{\an1}<i>sandstorms, which offer</i>
<i>little hope of escape to</i>
<i>those trapped in them. </i>

90
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,630
{\an1}<i>That's why the Sand</i>
<i>Investigative Unit uses</i>
<i>long-range sensory</i>

91
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,197
{\an1}<i>perception and keeps a close</i>
<i>watch. </i>

92
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,701
What's that?!

93
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,268
{\an1}What could it be?

94
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,635
{\an1}Whatever it is, it doesn't
look good!

95
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:34,938
{\an1}<i>However, if long-range</i>
<i>sensory perception fails...</i>
<i>what would happen...? </i>

96
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:44,239
{\an1}<i>By now, chaos must be</i>
<i>breaking out at</i>
<i>headquarters... </i>

97
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,210
{\an1}What?! A massive sandstorm's
appeared all of a sudden!

98
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,877
{\an1}Why hasn't it been detected
until now?!

99
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,845
{\an1}I didn't sense anything
unusual occurring!

100
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,245
{\an1}<i>He's right. Me, either! </i>

101
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:06,014
{\an1}Could someone be trying to
interfere with our
long-range sensors...?

102
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,514
{\an1}You mean like trying to
block your perception with
some kind of barrier?!

103
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:12,515
{\an1}Who would do that?! And why?

104
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:16,116
{\an7}Forget that for now and
focus on the safety of the
exam participants.

105
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:19,618
{\an1}I thought that survival was
supposed to be a part of the
Chunin Exams.

106
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:24,019
{\an7}This sandstorm is way too
big for them to handle!
There will be hell to pay if

107
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:24,820
{\an7}they all die!

108
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:28,253
{\an1}Damn it! What a hopeless
bunch...

109
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:33,855
{\an1}The Second Exam is on hold.
We'll lead all the entrants
into shelters.

110
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,024
{\an1}I leave the Kazekage to all
of you. I get the feeling he
might go and take matters

111
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:39,590
{\an1}into his own hands...

112
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,858
{\an1}Make sure he doesn't set
foot outside.

113
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,758
Right!

114
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,892
Are you ready?

115
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,493
Yes!

116
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,660
{\an1}Teams One to Three are with
me.

117
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:51,928
{\an1}The rest, with me!

118
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,195
Let's go!

119
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,637
{\an1}<i>I can't believe we didn't</i>
<i>detect a sandstorm of this</i>
<i>magnitude! </i>

120
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,871
{\an1}If someone's interfering
with us, who could it be?

121
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:26,471
{\an1}<i>I just hope nothing bad</i>
<i>happens... </i>

122
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:27,705
{\an1}<i>Yeah... </i>

123
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:31,473
{\an1}<i>Me, too... </i>

124
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:35,340
{\an1}What in the world is going
on?!

125
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,307
{\an1}It is a sandstorm!

126
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,009
{\an1}I kinda figured that!
[coughing]

127
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:44,111
{\an1}So this is what one of the
Demon Desert's giant
sandstorms is like. It's far

128
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:48,078
{\an1}bigger than I thought it
would be. Well, we can't
stay here, that's for certain.

129
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,278
[struggling]

130
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,046
{\an1}This is bad, guys...

131
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,947
{\an1}Yeah, that's why I said we
should just go straight to
the central tower!

132
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:59,180
Huh? Watch out!

133
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:00,715
Huh? Oww!

134
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,116
Huh?!

135
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,049
[groaning]

136
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:04,549
{\an1}What's the matter?

137
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,950
What?

138
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,917
{\an1}Oh, uh, it's nothing.

139
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,685
{\an1}A sandstorm? That gives us
the home field advantage!

140
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:13,886
{\an1}You really think now's the
time to say that?!

141
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,520
{\an1}This is a bad one. We
haven't seen a storm this
big in a long time.

142
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,455
{\an1}I know! I hope all the
entrants are okay...

143
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,589
{\an1}Yeah, me too...

144
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,923
{\an1}Lord Kazekage...!

146
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,593
{\an1}Oh, good.

147
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:37,060
Yeah...

148
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,603
{\an1}I can barely even see an
inch in front of me!

149
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:16,805
{\an1}It is just a little sand!
The central tower is right
up ahead. Let us overcome

150
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,505
{\an1}this with gutsiness!

151
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,406
Byakugan!

152
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:24,573
{\an1}This'll take a lot more than
gutsiness to overcome...

153
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,042
{\an1}Let's look around and find
somewhere we can wait out
the storm.

154
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,078
{\an1}I can't even open my eyes!

155
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,979
{\an1}Yeah, the sand stings!

156
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,212
[coughing]
I... I can't breathe!

157
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,515
{\an1}I can't... I can't do this!

158
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,518
Here!

159
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,385
{\an1}This is a sand cloak!

160
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,485
[gasping]

161
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:09,554
{\an1}The Second Exam has been
postponed! Come on, let's
get to the shelter.

162
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:13,321
{\an1}Hey, don't just sit here and
give in to a sandstorm like
this!

163
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,057
Wind Scythe!

164
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,724
{\an1}All right, now's your chance
to get out of here!

165
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:25,358
Uh! [grunting]

166
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,592
Come on, hurry!

167
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,029
{\an1}Are you still doing
okay, Lee?!

168
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:39,496
{\an1}Yes, it is just that my
Hidden Leaf cloak is not
much help against a

169
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,931
{\an1}sandstorm as powerful as
this one, I am very sorry
to say!

170
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,564
{\an1}All right, that's it...

171
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,331
Huh?

{\an1}Eight Trigrams Palm!
Rotation!

173
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,133
{\an1}Now, Tenten!

174
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:55,835
{\an1}Just leave it to me! I'm
pretty sure I have something
that'll block this sandstorm!

175
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:07,204
{\an1}Come on, we need to get
inside. We'll be able to ride
out the storm in here.

176
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,204

178
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:17,507
{\an1}Yeah, well, situations like
these are about the only
times I really feel useful.

179
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,508
{\an1}That is for sure!

180
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,009
{\an1}As expected.

181
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:23,010
{\an1}You didn't have to agree
with me so quickly, you
know!

182
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:56,653
Uh!

183
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,921
{\an1}I can't... walk any more...

184
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,421
{\an1}Just hang in there! We're
almost at the central tower!

185
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:07,322
{\an1}Are you really sure about
that, though? You keep saying
that, but we're still not there!

186
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,390

{\an1}I can't stand this!

207
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,084
{\an1}We'd better reach the
central tower fast or we'll
be swallowed up.

{\an1}Huh?

{\an1}Why did you protect me,
Shibuki?

{\an1}Because you're very
precious to me. Why else?

Huh?

221
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,802

to you, too.

{\an1}So, the first thing you
should do is make a hundred
friends.

Um, Shibuki--?

be people who don't
understand you.

{\an1}But, still... you must hold
dear the people that
surround you...

{\an1}Hm?

261
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:08,147

I was reminded of a certain

was.

{\an1}I was forced to face
him in battle.

266
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:27,820
{\an1}And, he taught me that we
can learn to understand the
pain, sorrow, and joy of others.

{\an1}What?! Are you serious?!
You're a real lifesaver!

We can't.

277
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,063
{\an1}Sorry, we can't accept it.

278
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,065

new goal to pursue now, so I
don't need it anymore!

279
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:09,632
{\an1}It's simple. Lord Gaara has
taught all of us many
things...

280
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,600
{\an1}<i>To break down barriers,</i>
<i>those we make for ourselves</i>

{\an1}Believe me, we want that
scroll more than anything,

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,938
{\an1}but if we let you just
give it to us...

285
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:30,206
{\an1}...we can't honestly claim
that we fulfilled the conditions
of the Second Exam.

286
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:34,340
{\an1}We'll get one, all by
ourselves, and using our own
power.
