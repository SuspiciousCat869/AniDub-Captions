‐Excellent.

3
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,068
Yukimaru, are you ready?

4
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,104
‐Do I really have to
do it all over again?

5
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,073
‐You know full well
it's your duty.

6
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,442
It's going to make me
worse, I just know it.

7
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,681
‐Well, Guren, if you
prefer, I can always

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,783
inform Yukimaru for you.

9
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,053
That the kind, gentle
Guren, who he believes

10
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,956
is the one he can come
home to, is actually

11
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,959
the evil villain that
killed his mother.

12
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,360
‐Stop it!

00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,236
‐Fine, as long as you carry out
my orders without hesitation.

14
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,123
Time is short.

15
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,025
Come on, we need to hurry.

16
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:31,832
‐Well?

17
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,767
‐I'm not getting anything.

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,335
‐I see.

19
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,871
She used up a considerable
amount of chakra

20
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,106
during that last battle.

‐[grunts]

22

‐We have to find her before
she has a chance to recover.

23
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,881
‐I couldn't agree more.

24
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,616
I'll widen my perimeter a bit.

25
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,674
‐I'm so tired of waiting here.

26
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,844
Where the hell
did that woman go?

27
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:13,013
‐Patience is the key, Naruto.

28
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,247
‐Yeah, I know.

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,282
But if we let her
get away, Yukimaru

30
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:21,622
is going to‐‐ I
swear I'll find you!

‐Look at the two of
you, it's pathetic.

Seriously, you guys
look like you could just

35
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,994
die at any minute.

Speak for yourself.

‐Oh, man, I think I'm
about to pass out here.

39
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,238
‐No way I'm dying on
this miserable lake,

40
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,974
not after we survived
Orochimaru's hellhole

41
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,508
of a hideout.

42
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,480
‐That's the seal for
capturing the Three‐Tails.

43
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,152
‐This is a problem.

44
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,088
Looks like they're a good
ways into the ritual.

45
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,957
Now then, Yukimaru.

46
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,457
‐Uh.

47
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,637
‐‐[sighs] We don't
have time for this.

48
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,773
Guren, do something, will you?

49
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,642
‐Guren, please.

50
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:09,075

‐Huh?

53
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,253
Are you betraying us, then?

54
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,255
‐No, of course, I'm not.

55
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:25,559
But that jutsu is
going to harm Yukimaru.

56
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,461
Please, I know I can do it.

57
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,330
Just give me another shot.

58
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:33,333
‐The ones wasn't
punishment enough, huh?

59
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:36,202
This reluctance to
use them is foolhardy.

60
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,539
It's already cost
you some of your men.

61
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,642
And they roughed you
up pretty good as well.

62
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:45,779
You honestly think you
could survive another round?

63
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:48,048
‐Of course, I, uh‐‐

64
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:53,554
‐The most you could accomplish
now is‐‐ well, wait a minute.

65
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:58,191
There is one way to do
it without Yukimaru.

66
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:00,761
However, time will
be of the essence.

67
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:04,037
And mind you now, you're to
follow my orders to the letter.

68
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,238
Got it?

69
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,540
‐Understood.

70
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,576
‐If I sense even the
slightest bit of willfulness

71
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,614
or if you fail, I won't
hesitate to use Yukimaru.

72
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,649
‐All right.

73
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:20,253
‐Hm, very well then,
come, Yukimaru.

74
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,756
Don't worry, I'll take
him where he'll be safe.

75
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:31,464
‐So this plan, what is it?

76
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,934
‐I'll give all of
the details to Rinji.

77
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,069
You just do as he
tells you to do.

78
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:58,859
The Three‐Tails power
can't reach you here.

79
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,060
‐What about Guren?

80
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,502
Will she be OK?

81
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,670
‐She's the one who
wanted it this way.

82
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,473
She said she's going to do
it even if it kills her.

83
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:11,277
Now, don't move from this spot.

‐Hello there, Guren.

87
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:23,757
‐Just get on with it.

88
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,425
You're wasting my time.

89
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,728
‐All right, according
to Kabuto, there's

90
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:30,196
a pair of shinobi
guarding the seal.

91
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,666
One's a weapon
user; one, taijutsu.

92
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,835
We already hit them pretty
hard with an ambush,

93
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,638
so they're being
especially cautious now.

94
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,039
‐I'm with you.

95
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:43,309
We need a diversion‐‐ something
flashy to keep them busy.

96
00:08:43,343 --> 00:08:45,846
One of us will
have to be a decoy.

97
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,814
Hm, all right, then.

98
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,716
No point in delaying this.

99
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,918
I'll take care of
the two in front.

100
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,286
‐It seems a little risky.

101
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,255
Are you sure?

102
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:56,322
‐Don't worry about it.

103
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,959
I have enough chakra
to act as bait.

104
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,067
You just keep your eyes
peeled for an opening

105
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,402
and be ready to break the seal.

106
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:09,610
‐All right.

107
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,812
‐The Three‐Tails is completely
ensnared within the seal.

108
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,179
‐Perfect.

109
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,015
Now, we'll just have to narrow
the sphere of the Four‐Seal

110

is trapped for good.

‐Who is there?

‐A sealing this precious and
they got children watching it?

116
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,069
You're kidding me.

117
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,804
‐That jutsu.

118
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,973
You must be the
Crystal Style user.

to take care of her?

‐Poor baby, are you going
to run home and cry?

‐Nonsense!

00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:50,450
If you are this Crystal Style
user, we welcome the fight!

‐Stay with it.

Concentrate.

126
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,360
All right, we've
got him reined in.

127
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,002
Now, lock it from
all sides, and we'll

128
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,170
seal away the beast for good.

129
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,539

‐Hm?

‐Now, it's my turn!

00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,091
Heyaah!

‐Agh!

Something is strange about her.

It is like‐‐

covered in crystal?

GUREN (VOICEOVER):
Ugh, normally,

141
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:16,316
I'd have finished a pair
like this in no time.

142

‐All right!

143

‐Nah!

00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:39,573
‐Ugh!

Agh!

Aah!

I've got to end it now!

Hm, did we fail?

‐Sorry, Shizune.

‐The net hasn't been broken yet.

159

Just keep synchronizing.

It's not too late
to lock it up again.

Um.

‐That's awesome, we did it!

00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:43,910
‐Of course, we did.

What did you expect?

‐So you're the

‐Yamato.

‐We encountered the enemy's
diversionary team a moment ago,

187
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:47,113
exactly as you
predicted we would.

It didn't prove all
that formidable though,

and took off pretty quickly.

After that, I split
us up into two groups

and sent Lee and
Tenten over to the lake

‐Not so good.

We found a way to counter
the Crystal Style,

196
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:03,236
but she gave us the slip.

‐You guys should
go and help protect

quick as you can.

We'll never hold the

‐That shock wave
rattled my skull, kid.

This is getting ridiculous.

What the heck did you just
summon us into this time?

achieved our goal.

Your little jutsu for
sealing away the Three‐Tails
