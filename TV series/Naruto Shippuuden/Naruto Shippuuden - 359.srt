1
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,712
{\an1}Due to the increased number
of assignments, I'm adding

2
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,080
an additional
team to the ANBU.

3
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:01,516
{\an1}Itachi, I'm appointing
you as a captain.

4
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,451
Yes, sir.

5
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:04,286
{\an1}I'm not saying that
I'm opposed, but you

6
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,221
{\an1}still seem very young.

7
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:07,956
What's your age?

8
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,458
Thirteen, ma'am.

9
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,294
{\an1}There have been quite a
number of shinobi who were

10
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:15,197
{\an1}younger but nonetheless
became jonin.

11
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,200
{\an1}Two years in the ANBU
and already a captain...

12
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,968
He has to be the
youngest captain that

13
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,704
{\an1}the ANBU has ever had.

14
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:24,439
{\an1}Well, in any event, I shall
assign my personal ANBU

15
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,542
{\an1}agents to this new team.

16
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,684
{\an1}Does this mean you're
going to be transferred

17
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:36,719
{\an1}to Lord Danzo's ANBU?

18
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,254
{\an1}It remains uncertain.

19
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,623
{\an1}Well, try not to get
entangled in the higher-ups'

20
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:42,492
{\an1}political wrangling.

21
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,093
{\an1}Captain Kakashi...

22
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,463
{\an1}Thank you for the
past two years.

23
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:50,099
{\an1}Come on, now. You're
only changing sections.

24
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,268
You're still a
Hidden Leaf shinobi.

25
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,805
{\an1}It's not like you're going
somewhere far away.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,675
{\an1}He's only thirteen...

27
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,376
{\an1}And they're already
appointing him

28
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,879
to be a captain?

29
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:05,014
Well, he is an
extraordinary shinobi.

30
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,083
Sure, he has the
Sharingan, but making

31
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:10,119
{\an1}captain at thirteen is
simply unheard of.

32
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,556
{\an1}What's up, Yugao?

33
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:16,058
{\an1}Beginning today, I'm being
assigned to Team Ro.

34
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:18,796
{\an1}So you're the new
replacement, huh?

35
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,632
{\an1}I will do my best,
Captain Kakashi.

36
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,138
{\an1}All right, attention!

37
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,877
{\an1}I expect exemplary
work from all of you.

38
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,244
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,219
{\an1}I've gotten reports
that the Leaf Police

40
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:44,722
{\an1}Force is strengthening
their armaments.

41
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,725
{\an1}So tell me, what do
you make of this news?

42
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,328
{\an1}Among the Uchiha,
dissatisfaction towards the

43
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,129
{\an1}Village is running high.

44
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,500
Seems we can't
ignore it anymore.

45
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:56,568
No...

46
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,806
{\an1}You are aware of the
barrier system that the

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,708
{\an1}Leaf has in place?

48
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,677
{\an1}Yes, sir. It senses
when the Village

49
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,145
{\an1}has been infiltrated.

50
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,516
{\an1}It seems that someone's been
getting through the barrier.

51
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,352
{\an1}And they've also been
doing so undetected.

52
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,689
{\an1}Even among the citizens of
the Hidden Leaf Village,

53
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,824
{\an1}only a select few
know the secret code

54
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,793
to pass through
the barrier.

55
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:23,896
{\an1}Either there's a traitor in
our midst, or a jutsu user

56
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,632
{\an1}who can break the barrier
without alerting us.

57
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,502
{\an1}If the intruder's a traitor,
we can smoke them out

58
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,036
{\an1}with a new jutsu formula.

59
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,006
{\an1}But I believe it's someone
capable of passing through

60
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,209
{\an1}the barrier with a jutsu.

61
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:39,879
{\an1}I can't bring myself
to believe that...

62
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,749
{\an1}The new mission I'm
assigning you is to look

63
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,050
{\an1}into this matter...

64
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,220
{\an1}That is a map of the
barrier placements.

65
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,991
{\an1}Some areas have more
pings than others.

66
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,625
Where is this?

67
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,928
{\an1}Near the Uchiha District.

68
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,664
{\an1}If it were possible,
we'd install a barrier

69
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,900
{\an1}system there, but
it's a self-governing

70
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,101
{\an1}district so we can't.

71
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,103
Make sure your
investigation isn't traced

72
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,205
{\an1}back to the ANBU.

73
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,997
Hm...

74
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,166
Listen!

75
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,003
{\an1}There's no way I'm gonna
lose to a guy like you!

76
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,638
{\an1}Keep talking nonsense.

77
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,006
Hey, shut up!

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,576
{\an1}No, you shut up, you loser.

79
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,076
[sigh]

80
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,979
Curious finding
you here.

81
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,448
What brings you
to the Academy?

82
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,150
{\an1}My new appointment.
I'm a jonin leader,

83
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,652
{\an1}in charge of some genin.

84
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,989
{\an1}So you're gonna look
after a few genin, huh?

85
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,792
{\an1}Yeah, but I have to say, I'm
a bit worried about the kind

86
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,493
{\an1}of students I'll be getting.

87
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,629
Don't act so
stuck up, Sasuke.

88
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,200
{\an1}You are seriously annoying.

89
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,402
{\an1}I told you to shut up!

90
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,640
{\an1}[laughter] I bet students
like those are gonna

91
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:13,041
{\an1}be hard to handle!

92
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,078
Hey, come with
me, would you?

93
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,412
All right! You
wanna spar?

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,214
{\an1}Let's just take a walk.

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,187
{\an1}Hey, wait a minute. This
is the Uchiha District.

96
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,523
{\an1}This part of town
has character.

97
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,792
{\an1}Been a while since
I was here...

98
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,961
I used to come
here quite a bit...

99
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:34,630
...long ago.

100
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,966
{\an1}Hey, look! Now that's
a rice cracker shop

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,367
{\an1}with real character!

102
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,320
[kissy noises]

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,101
Hey.

104
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,002
{\an1}What're you doing?

105
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:16,439
{\an1}Come on. It's way past
our rendezvous time.

106
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,052
So is this
house special?

107
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:28,986
It's nothing.

108
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:31,187
{\an1}These rice crackers
are seriously tasty!

109
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,524
{\an1}They're worth making the
trip all the way down here!

110
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,861
{\an1}There are other specialties
you can only find here, too.

111
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,295
Oh! You've
gotta show me!

112
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,802
{\an1}What is this place?

113
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:48,106
{\an1}Nakano Shrine, home of
the Uchiha's patron deity.

114
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,108
{\an1}I don't believe in
stuff like that...

115
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,409
Look, just be
a good sport!

116
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,678
{\an1}Go take a fortune
for yourself.

117
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,350
Captain Kakashi!

118
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:01,719
Itachi!

119
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:04,221
{\an1}What are you doing here?

120
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,557
{\an1}Just thinking about
something from the past.

121
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,826
And you?

122
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,695
{\an1}Well, I'm from here,
Captain, you remember.

123
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,097
I'm often here.

124
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:13,430
{\an1}How's being captain?

125
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,699
It's the same.

126
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,602
{\an1}I still have missions just
like the ones I had before.

127
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:20,305
I see...

128
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,174
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi, check it out!

129
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,910
{\an1}The fortune I drew is
"Excellent Luck!"

130
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,318
{\an1}I'm sorry, there's not
enough intel to figure out

131
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,122
{\an1}who the infiltrator
is or what he wants.

132
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,689
Hmm...

133
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,925
{\an1}We would need to place
agents at each section of

134
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,027
{\an1}the barrier system
and we would have to

135
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:45,164
{\an1}coordinate their efforts with
those of the barrier team.

136
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,499
{\an1}Without anti-infiltration
tactics, it'll be almost

137
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:50,368
{\an1}impossible to track
down the culprit.

138
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:53,973
{\an1}Unfortunately, we can't
spare the manpower for an

139
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:55,808
{\an1}operation such as that.

140
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:58,210
{\an1}Well then the only thing we
can really do is ask the

141
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:00,446
{\an1}Police Force to step
up their patrols.

142
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,348
{\an1}What's bothering you?

143
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:03,315
It's just...

144
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,819
{\an1}I went down to the
Uchiha District recently.

145
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:08,320
It was the first
time in a while and

146
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:10,422
the atmosphere
had changed.

147
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:12,458
It was tense.

148
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:14,627
{\an1}Were they antisocial?

149
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:18,330
{\an1}Yes, they were. It felt to
me like they didn't want to

150
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,700
{\an1}have any outsiders
there whatsoever.

151
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:24,771
{\an1}Yes, I see. Well, I'll
discuss the Leaf Police

152
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,107
Force with the
executive committee.

153
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:29,576
{\an1}You completed your
mission, Kakashi.

154
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,648
How convenient.

155
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,818
{\an1}On the pretext of village
security, we'll have a brand

156
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,686
{\an1}new patrol unit created.

157
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,988
{\an1}We'll switch security duties
away from the Uchiha's

158
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:44,658
Police Force and
reduce their strength.

159
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:48,229
{\an1}No, that will only provoke
the Uchiha Clan further.

160
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:50,764
{\an1}We should make the Police
Force oversee the patrols

161
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:53,333
{\an1}and increase their
workload to show

162
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:54,734
our good faith.

163
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,337
{\an1}Why, when we should be
stopping their coup d'état,

164
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,942
{\an1}would you want to increase
the Uchiha's power now?

165
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,644
I won't let the
Uchiha stage a coup!

166
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,613
{\an1}Of course we won't!
That goes without

167
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,380
{\an1}saying, doesn't it?!

168
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:09,450
{\an1}Calm down, both of you!

169
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,386
{\an1}We're still uncertain if
there will be a coup at all!

170
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,655
{\an1}We should just bide
our time and see how

171
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,357
{\an1}everything pans out.

172
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,894
{\an1}Isn't that why we have
Itachi in the first place?

173
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,271
{\an1}Isn't Itachi coming today?

174
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,039
{\an1}He's off on a mission.

175
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,922
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan intends
to revolt against

176
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,357
the Hidden Leaf.

177
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,991
[gasps]

178
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,125
{\an1}You're sure of that?!

179
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,661
You've obtained
concrete proof?

180
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,996
I have...

181
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:00,736
Hey.

182
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,145
{\an1}There is something
that I would like you

183
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,512
to help me with.

184
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,459
We won't let the
Uchiha stage a coup.

185
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,462
{\an1}That's one thing, at least,
that the two of us can

186
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:28,298
{\an1}undoubtedly agree upon.

187
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:29,766
[sigh]

188
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,804
Wait, we haven't
reached a conclusion!

189
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:37,207
{\an1}If the Uchiha are getting
ready to act, then we're

190
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:40,009
{\an1}going to have to make
our preparations, as well.

191
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:42,379
Preparations
only, Danzo.

192
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,347
[grunt]

193
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:53,690
We move tonight.

194
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:57,628
{\an1}Fine. I shall assist
you as promised.

195
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,597
Very well, then.
I'm counting on you.

196
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,600
{\an1}I'll help you annihilate the
Uchiha because I have

197
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,103
another goal.
And for that...

198
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:09,707
{\an1}I want you to keep
your "eyes closed."

199
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,742
{\an1}So I'm not to use my
Sharingan against

200
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:13,378
whatever you're
planning?

201
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:16,147
{\an1}Yes, and I guarantee that
I won't kill your little

202
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:18,916
{\an1}brother. I have no use
for a child without

203
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,718
the Sharingan.

204
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,887
{\an1}You think that that is
supposed to reassure me?

205
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,991
{\an1}Although, at this point,
I have no other choice

206
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,691
{\an1}but to trust you.

207
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:31,662
{\an1}If you need refuge,
join my organization.

208
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,098
{\an1}Your organization?

209
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,598
The Akatsuki.

210
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,416
{\an1}It's an Emergency
Alert, Level One!

211
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:52,251
Get ready to
move out! Hurry!

212
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:56,588
Who are you?!

213
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:19,945
{\an1}We're moving out!

214
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,282
{\an1}Those on my team to the Leaf
Police Force Headquarters!

215
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,618
My team, to the
Uchiha District!

216
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:33,826
{\an1}This is horrible!

217
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:35,362
What happened?!

218
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,367
{\an1}Rescue anyone who
still remains alive.

219
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,569
Lord Third!
There's a survivor!

220
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,073
Get him to the
Medical Unit!

221
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,147
{\an1}No one else made it.

222
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,952
Take away all
of the corpses.

223
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,923
{\an1}I mean every single one.
Search the buildings, too!

224
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:04,724
{\an1}Who do you think could
have done something

225
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:07,160
{\an1}as monstrous as this?

226
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:08,895
Itachi Uchiha.

227
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,630
Itachi?!

228
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,100
{\an1}Itachi Uchiha harbored
a secret about his

229
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,701
{\an1}clan: he despised it.

230
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:18,139
{\an1}That is why he killed Shisui
and took his eyes for his

231
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:21,242
{\an1}own, and also why
he caused infighting

232
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,809
{\an1}among his brethren.

233
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,245
{\an1}And in the end...

234
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,781
{\an1}He committed this atrocity.

235
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,150
{\an1}But why would he?

236
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,753
{\an1}That's enough chatter.
Now get to work!

237
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,659
{\an1}It would appear that
this settles everything.

238
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,796
{\an1}What does it settle?
Are you really not able

239
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,032
{\an1}to see the huge problem
that we're still left with?

240
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,101
{\an1}I consider it minor.

241
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,472
{\an1}Hear me, Danzo, I can't
allow you to act on your

242
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,541
{\an1}own authority anymore.

243
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:56,578
{\an1}You are now relieved of your
duties as second in command.

244
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,846
Listen, Hiruzen,
I did this for-

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,449
What, "for the
good of the Leaf?"

246
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,018
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan was
a part of the Leaf!

247
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:06,955
{\an1}Your ANBU and Foundation
will be dissolved. And

248
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,558
later, I'll deal
with you personally.

249
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,528
{\an1}Till then, you're
under house arrest.

250
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,067
{\an1}Lord Danzo, the body
count doesn't match up.

251
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,135
What's that?!

252
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,438
{\an1}It's like they just
disappeared.

253
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,210
{\an1}I witnessed everything.

254
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,782
And I will
continue to watch.

255
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,288
{\an1}If you so much as touch
Sasuke, I'll pass on

256
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:41,891
{\an1}classified Village intel
to every enemy nation.

257
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,996
Itachi...

258
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,970
{\an1}If this is the scope
of Itachi's hatred,

259
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,438
it ran deep...

260
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,041
Only one of
them survived...

261
00:15:58,609 --> 00:15:59,842
{\an1}Start removing them.

262
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,345
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,814
What a mission,
even for the ANBU.

264
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,561
Hm?

265
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,567
{\an1}<i>What's up with him?</i>

266
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,241
Uh... [grunt]

267
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:32,476
[laughter]

268
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,578
Hey!

269
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:40,385
The entire clan
was wiped out...

270
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,455
{\an1}Not quite all of it...
The rumor I heard is

271
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,357
{\an1}one child survived.

272
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,192
{\an1}What's the difference?

273
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:50,128
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan is
essentially extinct now.

274
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,397
All except one.

275
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,469
{\an1}I never imagined that
Itachi Uchiha would be

276
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,571
{\an1}put in the Bingo Book.

277
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,274
S-class right
from the start.

278
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,679
{\an1}Well, he did slaughter
his entire clan.

279
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,848
Hey, what's the
matter, Captain?

280
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,917
{\an1}It just goes to show
in the end, I really

281
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,886
{\an1}knew nothing about him.

282
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,122
{\an1}I understood nothing...

283
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,992
{\an1}What'll happen to
the Uchiha District?

284
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,762
{\an1}Will it be torn down?

285
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:23,928
Torn down?

286
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:27,199
{\an1}Well, a terrible incident
took place there.

287
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,734
{\an1}No one'll want to go
near it after everything

288
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:29,769
that's happened.

289
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,551
Obito, what have
I been doing...

290
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,486
{\an1}...since that day?

291
00:17:57,431 --> 00:18:00,567
{\an1}I know you have something
that you want to say to me.

292
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,337
{\an1}We are quite alone here.

293
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,605
{\an1}I appreciate your
discretion.

294
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,840
First, you have
my thanks.

295
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,843
{\an1}Your actions averted
civil war within the Leaf.

296
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,313
We've maintained
peace despite all odds.

297
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,181
Yes...

298
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:18,085
{\an1}But even so, I sincerely
regret that there was no

299
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,087
{\an1}other way to achieve it.

300
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,122
{\an1}I apologize, Lord Third.

301
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,424
{\an1}I'm the one who should
apologize. You will be

302
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,893
{\an1}branded as a Rogue
Ninja who killed his

303
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:29,429
{\an1}whole clan and be
listed in the Bingo Book

304
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:32,366
as a fugitive,
wanted dead or alive.

305
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,468
Of course.

306
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,536
{\an1}What will you do now?

307
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,872
{\an1}I've found aid from a
group named "Akatsuki."

308
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:42,109
{\an1}I intend to stay close to
them in order to make sure a

309
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:44,212
{\an1}promise is not broken.

310
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:47,682
You're going to
join the Akatsuki?

311
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:51,285
{\an1}Lord Third, will you make a
promise to me that you will

312
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,388
{\an1}continue to protect Sasuke?

313
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,891
{\an1}Your younger brother will
study at the Academy and

314
00:18:56,924 --> 00:19:00,194
{\an1}will grow up to become
a Hidden Leaf shinobi.

315
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,698
{\an1}I'll ensure that he
wants for nothing.

316
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:06,267
{\an1}But I doubt that I can erase
the hatred that he is bound

317
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,269
{\an1}to harbor for you
once he learns what

318
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:09,838
you have done.

319
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:13,274
{\an1}I know. I am prepared
to bear his hatred.

320
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:16,210
{\an1}Now, then go, I'll
leave the jutsu

321
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:18,980
{\an1}formula for the barrier
unchanged, so if

322
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,048
you ever worry
about Sasuke.

323
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,352
{\an1}You can sneak back
in to check on him.

324
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,154
Lord Third, I...

325
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:29,258
{\an1}It is very unfortunate that
the Uchiha Clan did not

326
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,126
{\an1}understand your compassion.

327
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,831
{\an1}That wasn't it. I'm afraid I
was simply too weak...

328
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,267
{\an1}That is what precipitated
this tragedy.

329
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,505
{\an1}I'm thinking of undertaking
a complete overhaul of

330
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,140
{\an1}Danzo's Foundation.

331
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,445
{\an1}And also turning my
attention to my ANBU.

332
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,380
{\an1}In addition to that,
we're going to need a

333
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,682
{\an1}new Leaf Police Force.

334
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:55,318
{\an1}Instead of sticking to one
clan, let's have an open

335
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,787
recruitment for
the Police Force.

336
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,323
{\an1}We must think of the Leaf's
future, and find the right

337
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,425
{\an1}person for the right job.

338
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,203
{\an1}You wanted to see me, sir?

339
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,372
{\an1}Tell me this, Kakashi.
How many years have you

340
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,608
{\an1}been in the ANBU so far?

341
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:21,211
{\an1}I joined during the
Fourth Hokage's tenure,

342
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:23,781
{\an1}so about ten years.

343
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:26,717
{\an1}Originally, Minato's
purpose in having you join

344
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,018
{\an1}the ANBU was to help
you deal with the

345
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,455
darkness inside
your heart.

346
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,057
{\an1}He also wanted to
keep you close to him.

347
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,360
{\an1}I kind of figured that.

348
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,964
Then when Minato
died, I resumed the

349
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,998
{\an1}position of Hokage.

350
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,102
{\an1}And I took Minato's ANBU
under my command.

351
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:46,337
However...

352
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,240
{\an1}I do not believe that
keeping you by my

353
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,910
{\an1}side is going to be
of any help to you.

354
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:55,112
{\an1}In fact, it will only
darken your heart.

355
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,147
{\an1}Please remove your mask.

356
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:00,619
{\an1}Ten years, you say?

357
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,288
{\an1}Yes, perhaps I have
asked too much of you.

358
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:11,630
{\an1}You are hereby relieved of
your ANBU duties and will

359
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:13,465
{\an1}assume a new position.

360
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:14,766
Yes, sir.

361
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,168
You'll become
a jonin leader!

362
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:18,068
[gasp]

363
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,871
What?!

364
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,674
{\an1}<i>There's no way I'll allow</i>
<i>people who can't work</i>

365
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:02,309
{\an1}<i>together as a team</i>
<i>to become shinobi!</i>

366
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:05,913
{\an1}<i>All of you fail! You're</i>
<i>going back to the Academy!</i>

367
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:10,051
{\an1}<i>That icy glare of his. In</i>
<i>the depths of that gaze</i>

368
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,986
{\an1}<i>lies darkness itself.</i>

369
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,490
{\an1}<i>The darkness has not yet</i>
<i>been driven from his heart.</i>

370
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,527
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Jonin Leader."</i>

371
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:23,899
<i>It seems he</i>
<i>needs more time.</i>
