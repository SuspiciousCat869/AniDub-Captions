{\an1}What is that..? A bug..?

00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:43,022
{\an4}What are ya doing here?
Long way from home, you
must be the adventurous
type. You headed for the

5
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,691
{\an1}Land of Lightning, too?

6
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:49,027
{\an1}Oh hey, speaking of bugs,
why does this remind me
of someone?

7
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,864
{\an1}Lemme see... who
was it?

8
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:43,287
{\an1}Hey. Is it true what they
say about a war starting?

9
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:48,124
{\an4}Yeah. My Dad was telling
me all about it. Says
we're gonna pulverize
the Akatsuki.

10
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:53,463
{\an7}It's true. We face a
conflict that will decide
the future of the shinobi
world.

11
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,365
{\an1}Will you be going into
battle too, Shino Sensei?

00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:57,333
{\an1}Yes.

Oh man, aren't you
scared, Sensei?

14
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:02,370
{\an1}You dummy. Our sensei
isn't scared of
anything!

00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,205
{\an1}<i>No. You're wrong. </i>

00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,543
No way...

19
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:13,045
{\an7}But I'm confident that I
will come back alive.

20
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,080
How come?

21
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:19,784
{\an1}It's because I have
friends. People I trust.

00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,286
{\an1}We really screwed up.

{\an1}Don't beat yourself up
about it.

37
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:50,526
{\an1}Anyway. We received more
intel after your
encounter with him.

38
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,496
{\an4}Turns out, he's a rogue
Jonin from the Hidden
Waterfall who's stooped
to banditry.

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,834

weren't a match for

And don't blame Shino
either, he did what he
could.

43
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:13,178
{\an7}We would never do that.
But try telling that to
him-he's shut himself
up inside his of house.

44
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,146
{\an7}That guy has so much
pride it's ridiculous.

45
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,182
{\an1}Well, that's a problem...

46
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:22,920
{\an1}Listen. I want you two to
help Shino get back on
his feet.

[gasping]

48
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:27,456
{\an1}How are we supposed to do
that? He's never listened
to us before,

49
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,291
{\an1}don't know how we'd
get him to start now.

50
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:32,593
{\an1}Maybe so. But this is an
order.

51
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,631
{\an4}I want you to head
over to the hot springs
on the south side of the
village.

52
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,232
{\an1}Help Shino
unwind a little.

00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:40,967
Uhh---

54
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,310

00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:54,712
{\an1}Man, you're on to us.

56
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:57,447
{\an1}Shino? How is your wound?

57
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,716
{\an1}Nothing to worry about.
What is it?

58
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,987
{\an4}Ah come on, what's wrong
with us just coming to
visit? I mean, aren't we
all on Squad 8?

59
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:10,859
{\an7}Chill, will ya? There's
no shame in getting your
butt handed to you now
and then.

60
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:14,595
{\an7}And anyway, look, that
guy was a Jonin. Of
course he came out on

61
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,195
{\an7}top, we're not even
Chunin.

62
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,631
{\an7}It was practically a
forgone conclusion.

63
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:22,101
{\an7}Buuut, then again, I know
you've always rated
your own skills pretty

64
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:26,438
{\an7}highly and all, so maybe
it came as a bit of a
shock to you.

65
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,739
Kiba..!

66
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:30,941
{\an1}There isn't some other
reason you've been
moping around, is there?

67
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:35,445
{\an4}Don't tell me you
still let it get to you
that Naruto's always
forgetting your name?

68
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,351
{\an5}Ah whatever, just shrug
it off. Not everyone can
be as keenly attuned to
people's feelings as we are.

69
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,789
{\an4}No wait, I've got it!
You're bummed out
'cause you're the
only one who didn't get

70
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:50,725
{\an1}tapped for the mission
to bring back Sasuke,
am I right?

71
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:51,558
[grunting]

72
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:57,196
{\an8}Sure, it stunk, but hey,
you were already assigned
to another mission-I mean what
are they supposed to do, Shino?

73
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,365
{\an1}Will you get lost!

74
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:04,502
{\an4}'Fraid I can't do that.
But I was thinkin'. Maybe
we could head over to the
hotsprings south of the village.

75
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,203
{\an1}Why?

76
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:10,641
{\an5}Oh, it will be great,
Shino, just think how
much faster your wound
will heal!

77
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,476
{\an1}I'm not going.

78
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,879
{\an4}Yeah, I kind of figured
you were gonna say that.
Unfortunately, you're
coming whether you want

79
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:20,149
{\an1}to or not. It's
Kurenai's orders,
old buddy.

80
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:29,422
{\an7}Unbelievable. He's so
freakin' hard to be
around. Hasn't spoken

81
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,992
{\an7}a single word to us since
we set out.

<i>difficult as he can,</i>

00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:39,732
Well! We made it!

84
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,867
{\an1}Time for some rest and
relaxation!

85
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,468
{\an1}Yep!

86
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:51,441
{\an1}Alright! Let's go have
a little soak, Akamaru!

{\an1}Nothing.

107
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:12,340
{\an1}Oh come on, Shino, why
are you giving us the run
around?

108
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:15,677
{\an5}There's no
reason to hide it,
you're practicing
Taijutsu, right?

109
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,313
{\an1}Hey, what if the three of
us trained together! I
mean, it is part of the

110
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,115
reason we came out here,
isn't it?

111
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,649
{\an1}What's your angle here?

112
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,885
{\an1}We're all gonna train out
here and make sure you
get stronger.

113
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,388
{\an1}Look the truth is, we all
know that losing to that
guy bruised your pride.

114
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,490
{\an1}Maybe this'll get you
back on your feet.

115
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:36,161
{\an1}And hey, if we can get
some training in, and get
you feeling closer to

116
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,896
{\an1}normal, we'll be
killing two birds
with one stone.

117
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,466
{\an5}You're concerned you'll
be forced into close
combat while manipulating
your insects, right? So

118
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,269
you want to hone your
taijutsu skills. We
understand.

119
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:51,706
{\an5}You want to
be ready for hand-to-hand
situations, in case any
enemy zeros in on you.

120
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,541
{\an1}That's correct.

121
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:57,312
{\an5}So why don't you let us
help you then, Shino!
Taijutsu training is
always more effective

122
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,680
when you have a partner
to work off of.

123
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:03,183
I know that my Taijutsu
skills might not be the
best compared to some,

124
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,785
{\an1}but all the same, I still
think it would be a help!

125
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,660
{\an8}I think the first thing
we work on is speed. If
you can overwhelm your
opponent with a constant

126
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:20,897
{\an8}barrage of strikes, then
you can prevent them from
ever weaving any hand
signs.

127
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,032
{\an1}No objections here.

128
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,700
{\an1}OK, let's begin.

129

Alright then, time to
pick up the pace!

00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,547
Whoa, Hinata's not
messing around!

132
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:49,621
{\an4}Ah come on, man, she's
wiping the floor with
you-that doesn't bother
you at all?!

133
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:53,390
{\an1}Of course not..! It's
because it's not my
place to judge anyone!

134
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:56,894
{\an1}Uch! He even takes the
fun out of razzing him.

135
00:10:56,927 --> 00:11:01,063
{\an7}Shino! I want you to
imagine that you're
fighting that bandit
shinobi again!

136
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:01,864
[gasping]

137
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:07,302
{\an1}So weak. But what do
you expect from an
insect user?

138
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:13,406
You're starting to get
the hang of it!

139
