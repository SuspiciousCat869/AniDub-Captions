1
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,147
{\an1}You actually tailed Samui.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,116
{\an1}<i>You guys are pretty impressive.</i>

3
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:21,917
But, but you--

4
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:25,856
{\an1}How dare you, Naruto!
You tailed us here?!
What's the big idea?!

5
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,828
Hey, boss. That guy?
The one standing
there on the right?

6
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,030
It's Kakashi Hatake.

7
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,032
{\an1}Come on. I know that much!

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,004
{\an1}You the Hokage's errand boy,
Kakashi Hatake?!

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,408
No sir, today I've
come to ask a favor.

10
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,945
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki of the Leaf
would like to petition you.

11
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,150
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

12
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,953
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>I was hoping you could</i>
<i>hear his supplication.</i>

13
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:55,492
Don't you think
this is a bit rude?

14
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:59,364
{\an1}To interrupt us on the
way to the Summit without
any prior notice at all?

15
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:01,900
{\an1}Yes, we're quite
aware of that.

16
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:04,336
Enough of this.

17
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:08,074
{\an1}All right, you there, boy!
Start talking!

18
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:13,047
It's Sasuke.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,618
{\an1}I want you to cancel the
elimination of Sasuke Uchiha!

20
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:17,486
[gasps]

21
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,191
Hey, Naruto, This
isn't really the
time or place--

22
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,660
{\an1}Are you still going
on about that?!

23
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:23,993
Pretty brave.

24
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:25,629
{\an1}Just what are you
talking about?

25
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:28,567
{\an1}I know what I'm asking may
sound ridiculous to you,

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,336
{\an1}But this is the only way that
I really know how to say it!

27
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:33,940
{\an1}<i>Sasuke is my friend!</i>

28
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:38,212
{\an1}<i>And I can't just stand around,</i>
<i>and watch my friend get killed!</i>

29
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:44,886
{\an1}And besides, I don't want
Leaf and Cloud ninja killing
each other because of Sasuke!

30
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,156
{\an1}<i>I don't want my</i>
<i>friends or yours,</i>

31
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,792
To get lost in their
need for revenge!

32
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:15,691
{\an1}Look, I'm begging you!

33
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:19,061
{\an1}I don't want us taking
each other down for
vengeance anymore!

34
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:31,410
{\an1}Sasuke has always been
all about vengeance!

35
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:37,183
{\an1}<i>He's obsessed with it.</i>
<i>It changed him!</i>

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,257
{\an1}<i>Vengeance... drives you mad.</i>

37
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:46,061
{\an1}<i>It turns you into someone</i>
<i>you don't even recognize.</i>

38
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,067
{\an1}<i>I don't want anyone else</i>
<i>to become like Sasuke!</i>

39
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,572
{\an1}<i>I don't want the Leaf and</i>
<i>Cloud to kill each other!</i>

40
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,877
{\an1}And that's why...

41
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,414
[sobs]

42
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,874
{\an1}All right, I have work to
do so I'm going back.

43
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,112
{\an1}Would you mind taking
the mission report to
Kakashi Sensei?

44
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,881
Yeah! Sure, no
problem, Sakura!

45
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:31,551
See ya!

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,161
{\an1}I have a question, Naruto.

47
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:40,995
Mmm?

48
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:46,068
You like Sakura,
don't you?

49
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:46,969
{\an1}What?!

50
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:53,177
{\an4}I saw it in a book,
that one tends to
smile when they're
with someone you love.

51
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:57,216
{\an1}Around Sakura, you're like that.

52
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,650
{\an1}Have you told her?

53
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:19,276
{\an1}How can I? After all,
I'm the guy who couldn't even
keep a promise to her.

54
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,117
{\an1}She's right. Just stay
out of this, Sai.

55
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:34,261
{\an1}No. I won't. I can't just
sit still either, Naruto.

56
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,732
[sobbing]

57
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:44,741
No matter what,
we will dispose
of Sasuke!

58
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,545
<i>You all ought to hold</i>
<i>your ground afterwards!</i>

59
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,247
{\an1}That's right.
You're a fool!

60
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:53,852
{\an1}We're in a rush, so, sorry.
Your time is up.

61
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,890
Lord Raikage, please.

62
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:03,530
{\an1}<i>The incident in which you tried</i>
<i>to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan is</i>
<i>still unresolved on our side.</i>

63
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,370
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>The Hidden Leaf swallowed our</i>
<i>tears of blood to avoid war,</i>

64
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:12,641
{\an1}<i>a war whose seeds you</i>
<i>of the Cloud had sown.</i>

65
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:17,013
Because of those
noble sacrifices,
your people still exist.

66
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:19,584
<i>Do not forget that.</i>

67
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,323
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Right here and now, this young</i>
<i>shinobi, no matter how awkward,</i>

68
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:29,662
{\an1}<i>is bowing his head with respect</i>
<i>and affection for the Cloud and</i>
<i>Leaf, village and nation.</i>

69
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,534
{\an1}So, Lord Raikage.
As one of the Five Kage,

70
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,337
{\an1}<i>Tell me, what do you</i>
<i>think of this?</i>

71
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,444
[sobbing]

72
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,347
{\an1}Shinobi shouldn't lower
their heads so easily!

73
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,852
{\an1}Action and power are the things
that a shinobi should respect!

74
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:51,523
{\an1}<i>Concessions are forbidden in</i>
<i>agreements between shinobi.</i>

75
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:55,294
{\an1}<i>The history of mankind</i>
<i>is a history of war.</i>

76
00:05:55,761 --> 00:06:01,201
{\an4}<i>Since the Three Great</i>
<i>Ninja Wars, every nation</i>
<i>has tried to obtain</i>
<i>powerful ninjutsu.</i>

77
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,938
{\an1}Those who are weak
are trampled!

78
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,009
{\an1}<i>That is the truth of</i>
<i>the shinobi world.</i>

79
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,346
{\an1}We'll brand the Akatsuki
as wanted criminals.

80
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:15,686
{\an1}Once we do, not only I,
but the whole world
will hunt Sasuke down.

81
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:20,926
{\an1}<i>You bow your head for a</i>
<i>criminal and beg mercy to</i>
<i>keep your comrade safe.</i>

82
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:24,030
{\an1}<i>In the shinobi world,</i>
<i>that is not friendship!</i>

83
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,671
{\an1}<i>You Hidden Leaf brat!</i>
<i>think more deeply on what</i>
<i>it is you ought to do.</i>

84
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:34,409
{\an1}The shinobi world is not so
indulgent as to suffer fools.

85
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:37,680
{\an1}<i>Let's go!</i>

86
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:43,453
Hmf.

87
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,294
Naruto, enough.

88
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:52,798
Raise your head.

89
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:00,374
[frustrated sob]

90
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,198
Sir, we've been
waiting for you.

91
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,102
<i>[White Zetsu]</i>
<i>That's him.</i>

{\an1}<i>The geezer in the middle.</i>

93
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,012
So that's...

94
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,047
Danzo!

95
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,327
{\an1}<i>[Mifune]</i>
<i>Place your Kage</i>
<i>headpieces before you.</i>

00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:25,645
{\an1}<i>You, the Five Kage, assemble</i>
<i>here today in response to</i>
<i>Lord Raikage's summons.</i>

97
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,559
{\an1}I, Mifune, will preside
over these proceedings.

98
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,130
{\an1}<i>And now, let the Five</i>
<i>Kage Summit commence!!</i>

Naruto's Plea

100
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,790
{\an1}I, Mifune, will preside
over these proceedings.

101
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,362
{\an1}And now, let the Five
Kage Summit commence!!

102
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:58,666
{\an1}Then allow me to begin.
Listen--

103
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,969
<i>[Tsuchikage]</i>
<i>Heh! My, my...</i>

104
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,072
{\an1}How the Kage have changed.

105
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:08,245
{\an5}To be named Kage at
your young age is
quite impressive,
Lord Kazekage.

106
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:13,151
{\an1}<i>Yet despite your father's</i>
<i>obviously brilliant guidance,</i>

107
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,888
{\an1}He seems to have not
taught you any etiquette.

108
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,356
Tch!

109
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:19,960
{\an1}Yes, probably.

110
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,996
{\an1}That's why I was
chosen as Kazekage.

111
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,601
Bah hah hah hah!
You cheeky young rascal!

112
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:30,339
{\an1}Lord Tsuchikage, Please
don't interrupt any more.

113
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,143
{\an1}Please continue,
Lord Kazekage.

114
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,712
{\an1}I am a former Jinchuriki.

115
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,716
{\an1}<i>The Akatsuki captured me.</i>

116
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,618
What's with that
Tsuchikage?

117
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:42,020
{\an1}Just be quiet!

118
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:48,728
{\an1}And that's why I consider
the Akatsuki to be an
extremely dangerous group.

119
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,402
I sought the aid of the
Five Kage many times,
but was ignored.

120
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:56,538
{\an1}Except for the previous Hokage.

121
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,343
{\an1}<i>Jinchuriki from all your</i>
<i>nations have been taken.</i>

122
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:04,314
To collaborate at
this point is simply
too little, too late.

123
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:06,083
Hah.

124
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,422
The Five Great Nations'
Hidden Villages can't
afford to alert others

125
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,591
that their Jinchuriki
were taken; it's an
embarrassment!

126
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,795
{\an1}<i>Covert rescue and</i>
<i>recovery is the norm.</i>

127
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:21,202
{\an1}<i>No one seeks aid from other</i>
<i>lands when Jinchuriki disappear!</i>

128
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,506
{\an1}Appearances, and status.

129
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:28,444
{\an1}<i>Such foolish,</i>
<i>outdated concepts.</i>

130
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:30,913
{\an7}<i>Hmph! How dare that</i>
<i>stripling...</i>

131
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:34,218
{\an1}Setting aside whether those
beliefs are outdated or not,

132
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,356
{\an1}I will acknowledge that as
Mizukage, I refrained from
acting on this issue.

133
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,663
{\an1}However, I don't believe that
having our Tailed Beasts stolen
is cause for immediate alarm.

134
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:50,604
{\an4}After all, it still takes
significant skill,
knowledge, and time to
achieve control over them.

135
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:56,278
{\an1}A Jinchuriki needs to mature
along with their Tailed
Beast to adapt to it.

136
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,783
And even then, control
remains difficult.
It's not a simple task.

137
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,953
{\an1}Wouldn't you agree with that,
Lord Kazekage?

138
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,795
{\an1}Very few have achieved
control over Tailed Beasts.

139
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:13,698
{\an1}Madara Uchiha and
First Hokage
Senju Hashirama.

140
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,569
{\an1}And of cousre the
Fourth Mizukage Yagura,

141
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:20,274
{\an1}as well as Lord
Raikage's brother,
Killer Bee.

142
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,177
<i>However...</i>

143
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:23,611
Chojuro!

144
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:24,412
{\an1}Yes, sir!

145
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:27,016
Enough...

146
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,353
{\an1}...of this nonsense!

147
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:52,780
[sigh]

148
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,486
{\an1}This Summit is a
place of discourse.

149
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,457
{\an1}So, please refrain
from any more behavior
that lacks civility.

150
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,694
Stand down, Foo, Torune.

151
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:08,666
{\an1}You too, Kankuro, Temari.

152
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:12,004
Ao, Chojuro.
It's all right.

153
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,172
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:15,942
Mmm.

155
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,164
Now let's continue
our discussion.

156
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,900
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf. The Stone.

157
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,536
The Sand. The Mist.

158
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:42,275
{\an1}The Akatsuki's membership
is composed of Rogue
Shinobi from your villages!

159
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:43,776
That's not all, either!

160
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:51,419
{\an4}<i>From our investigations, we</i>
<i>know that among you and the</i>
<i>earlier Kage, there are those</i>
<i>who've even used the Akatsuki!</i>

161
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:53,155
{\an1}The Kage used them?!

162
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:58,628
{\an1}And that's why I don't trust
any of you! I have no
interest in any discourse.

163
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,333
But the reason I've
summoned you all to
this Summit,

164
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:05,370
is to ultimately
question your loyalties.

165
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:09,408
{\an1}What do you mean, that
they used the Akatsuki?

166
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,879
You're the Kazekage,
and yet you don't
know anything?

167
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,382
Just ask your village
elders back home!

168
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,487
{\an1}You of the Sand have previously
used the Akatsuki in battle!

169
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:25,261
{\an1}Currently, all Five Great
Nations are equally stable.

170
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:29,032
{\an1}They're moving from military
expansion to disarmament.

171
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:34,272
{\an1}As strained relations
between nations ease and the
threat of war diminishes,

172
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:40,145
{\an1}Hidden Villages, considered
military powers by their nation,
merely become costly hindrances.

173
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:46,187
{\an4}And yet at the same time,
completely eliminating
such villages poses its
own risks, as well.

174
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,190
What if war suddenly
breaks out?

175
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,729
Relying on ninja with
no battle experience
would be problematic.

176
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,431
{\an1}You'd lose the battle,
without question!

177
00:15:55,832 --> 00:16:01,839
{\an1}The Kage would realize that
one way to avoid that risk,
is to use mercenary soldiers.

178
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,843
{\an1}Namely, soldiers
from the Akatsuki?

179
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:26,569
{\an4}It takes effort and money
to cultivate accomplished
ninja from within one's
own Hidden Village.

180
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,842
{\an1}<i>The Akatsuki makes war its</i>
<i>livelihood and is made up of</i>
<i>experienced professionals.</i>

181
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:34,913
{\an1}<i>Furthermore, they can</i>
<i>be hired quite cheaply.</i>

182
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:36,815
<i>Best of all,</i>

183
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,953
{\an1}Their solders have always
delivered superior results.

184
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,157
Don't be pompous,
Tsuchikage!

185
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:44,558
{\an1}Hmf.

186
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,231
{\an1}The Sand once used the
Akatsuki to try to destroy
the Hidden Leaf.

187
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:55,572
{\an1}I'm talking about Orochimaru!
Though he may have already
left the Akatsuki by then.

188
00:16:56,907 --> 00:17:03,047
{\an1}But as a result, your father,
the Fourth Kazekage, and the
Third Hokage, Hiruzen, perished.

189
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,023
{\an1}It's also hard to dismiss the
possibility that this was all
part of an even larger plot.

190
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,797
{\an7}<i>That crafty old badger.</i>

191
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:19,034
But the most
suspicious of all
is the Hidden Mist!

192
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,472
<i>The Mist never</i>
<i>engages in diplomacy.</i>

193
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,941
{\an1}<i>And it's rumored that the</i>
<i>Akatsuki started there!</i>

194
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,489
{\an1}Since it's come to this,
I'll be honest.

195
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,024
{\an7}<i>Don't tell me Lady Fifth</i>
<i>is going to mention--!</i>

196
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,328
We suspect,

197
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:48,136
{\an4}that someone from behind the
scenes was secretly
manipulating Yagura, the man
who was Mizukage before me.

198
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:52,007
{\an1}There's a possibility that
that someone was the Akatsuki.

199
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:57,948
{\an1}And that, is exactly why I
didn't want to talk big and...
[trails off]

200
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,184
{\an1}Each and every one of you!

201
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,855
{\an1}You just watch your
tone, Raikage!

202
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:07,627
{\an1}<i>In fact, it's because you</i>
<i>of the Cloud went around</i>
<i>collecting ninjutsu.</i>

203
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,898
{\an1}...seeking more power in
this era of disarmament!

204
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:16,337
{\an1}We had no choice but to hire
the Akatsuki in order to try
to counter your growing power!

205
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:17,706
What was that?!

206
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,141
{\an1}Mgh.

207
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:21,444
{\an1}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>Before you start arguing</i>
<i>each other's merits,</i>

208
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:25,315
{\an1}I would like to state
the point that I was
about to make earlier.

209
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,517
What's that?

210
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:30,221
{\an1}It's probable that the
leader of the Akatsuki,

211
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,192
{\an1}is Madara Uchiha.

212
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,176
{\an1}Are you sure of that?!

213
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,180
But how could that
even be possible?

214
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,383
Hasn't he been dead
for several decades?

215
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:58,423
{\an1}The Kazekage's right!
Madara has been dead
for a long, long time.

216
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,960
{\an1}Well, I don't know
all of the details.

217
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,630
{\an1}But the information is from
quite a reliable source.

218
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,200
Are you saying
he's immortal?!

219
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:08,870
<i>Perhaps.</i>

220
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:13,307
{\an1}So, then, he really is some
kind of inhuman monster.

221
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:20,316
[ahem]

222
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,489
{\an1}I'd like to say this as the
leader of a neutral nation.

223
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:30,095
<i>The leader of the</i>
<i>Akatsuki has been able</i>
<i>to read the times well.</i>

224
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:35,234
{\an1}<i>Despite stabilizing, </i>
<i>the Great Nations harbor</i>
<i>suspicions about each other.</i>

225
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:39,239
{\an1}<i>And the Akatsuki seized on that</i>
<i>weakness to amass its power.</i>

226
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,208
Would you just
get to the point!

227
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:43,144
{\an1}Now, please just stay calm.

228
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,815
{\an1}We can turn this misfortune
into a blessing.

229
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:51,421
{\an1}<i>It's very rare for all five Kage</i>
<i>to convene in one location.</i>

230
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,324
{\an1}What do you all say to this:

231
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,929
{\an1}Until the Akatsuki
are disposed of,

232
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:03,570
{\an1}<i>why not establish the world's</i>
<i>first Allied Shinobi Forces of</i>
<i>the Five Hidden Villages?</i>

233
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,105
An allied ninja force?

234
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:11,211
{\an1}That's a splendid idea.
We're practically in a
state of emergency.

235
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,950
{\an1}Cooperation will be crucial now.

236
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,520
{\an7}<i>This is going perfectly.</i>

237
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:23,527
{\an1}Moving forward with this plan,
a standardized chain of command
would also be ideal.

238
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,997
{\an1}Further chaos must be avoided.

239
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:32,906
{\an1}All right, and whom do you
propose handing the reins of
these allied forces to, then?

240
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:36,276
{\an1}If the choice were left to
you, you'd all just argue.

241
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:43,352
{\an4}Therefore, since you have deemed
me to be a neutral party worthy
of presiding over you, I would
like to make this suggestion.

242
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:49,459
{\an1}I will decide who among
you five Kage is the most
suitable to lead.

243
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,799
{\an7}<i>This spells the end</i>
<i>of Tsunade's era.</i>

244
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:01,674
{\an1}The Leaf has the last
Jinchuriki, the one
containing the Nine-Tails.

245
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,945
{\an1}I feel that how he is
guided will be the key.

246
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:13,422
{\an1}<i>I say, why not allow the</i>
<i>Hokage to lead the</i>
<i>Allied Shinobi Army?</i>

247
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:14,890
Grr.
Wha?

248
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:15,825
