00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:17,530
[cheering]

2
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:27,603
[cheering]

3
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:37,544
[cheering]

4
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:48,019
[cheering]

5
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:52,755
{\an1}So, um, which one of them
is our captain, again?
I can never remember.

6
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,523
{\an1}He's that kinda
spacey looking
guy over there.

7
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,295
I... I'm starting
to feel really
nervous.

8
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,430
Heh. In war, you've
always gotta stay
calm and composed.

9
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:08,033
{\an1}Hey, hold on a minute.
My dad's going to be
our Captain?!

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,402
{\an7}<i>Finally! I'll turn the tide</i>
<i>of battle with Kurotsuchi!</i>

11
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:16,039
{\an1}Oh, no! Are you all right,
Guy Sensei?

12
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:19,741
{\an1}The fighting hasn't even
started yet, you know!
What did you do to yourself?

13
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,481
I gotta eat while
I still have the
chance or else!

14
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,784
{\an4}Gaara may be our captain
here in the Fourth
Company, but he's also
our commander-in-chief.

15
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,221
{\an1}And as his deputy, you're
essentially the captain
of the Fourth Company.

16
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:38,988
{\an1}Better stay sharp!

17
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,357
This is turning into
a really bothersome
assignment!

18
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,525
What a drag.

19
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,564
I'm gonna make a name
for myself in this war
and become Hokage!

20
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:54,933
{\an1}You fool! Don't you
dare make light of war!

21
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,334
{\an1}We all must avoid
flashy behavior.

22
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,570
{\an1}I think you're going to
be just fine, Shino.

23
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:09,610
{\an4}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Now then, Gaara, you're the</i>
<i>commander-in-chief of the</i>
<i>main battle regiment.</i>

24
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:12,045
{\an1}Please address everyone
once they settle down.

25
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:02,158
"For My Friend"

26
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:03,159
[gasp]

27
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,096
{\an1}They're on the move!
And there's a whole
lot of them, too!

28
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,165
You all go back and
report what we've found
to the main forces.

29
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,667
{\an1}I'll remain here and learn
whatever I can about
the enemy's hideout!

30
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,635
{\an1}But it's too dangerous
to stay here alone!

31
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,370
Shut up!
Just get out of here!

32
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:22,005
{\an1}I'm well aware of the risks!

33
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:25,674
{\an4}But if we don't get the word
out to all of our comrades,
then they're going to be in
serious danger!

34
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,109
Mm.

35
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:50,360
Master Zabuza.

36
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,095
{\an1}Yes. This doesn't appear
to be the next plane.

37
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,565
I'm completely conscious
right now, But my body
is moving on its own.

38
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,268
{\an1}It's a Forbidden Jutsu,
the Reanimation Jutsu.

39
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:08,705
{\an4}It appears that someone has
summoned us back to the
corporeal plane in order to
have us do their bidding.

40
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,208
{\an1}That means we're all going to
be made to fight for them.

41
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,912
{\an1}Someone who'll even
manipulate the dead, huh?

42
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,947
{\an1}I do not appreciate
being used like that.

43
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,585
{\an5}[Kabuto]
You will be our
Commando Unit.
Go by air!

44
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:30,922
{\an1}Sasori and Deidara will lay
traps and conduct raids.

45
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,991
{\an1}<i>Chukichi of the Mist and you</i>
<i>Leaf Foundation Ninja...</i>

46
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:38,861
Your job will be to
provide sensory intel
and also support.

47
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:40,095
[gasp]

48
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,630
What's this?!
Where am I?

49
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,532
{\an1}You're with the
Akatsuki, aren't you?!

50
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:50,236
{\an1}Let me make this clear:
if you think you can
make us do your bidding--

51
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,102
Huagh!

52
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:58,441
{\an4}[Sasori]
The Akatsuki has truly fallen
far if a wimp like this guy
here is manipulating it.

53
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:03,544
{\an4}And Zetsu and my
replacement Tobi are
really the only survivors
that are still left?!

54
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:06,948
{\an1}I must say, you're awfully
brash for a dead man, Sasori.

55
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:10,750
{\an1}And you used to insist that
eternal beauty is art. Hah!

56
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:15,987
{\an5}By the way, It's your
fault for exposing
that weak spot on
your chest. Hmph.

57
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:19,157
{\an1}Look, Deidara,
do you really want
me to kill you?

58
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:23,626
{\an1}I'm telling you, we're
already dead! You can't
kill what's dead! Hmph!

59
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:27,262
Are you sure this
is going to work?

60
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,030
{\an1}I admit it can be a little
bit difficult to control

61
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:32,765
{\an1}the reanimated shinobi when
there are so many of them.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,468
{\an1}And that is why I'm only
focusing on getting them
into place right now.

63
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,937
{\an1}But once I get them there,
I'll be in total control.

64
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:46,475
{\an1}I'll erase their personalities,
and they'll turn into pure
killing machines in battle.

65
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,610
{\an1}There's no need to worry.

66
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:55,182
{\an1}Although, with some, it's better
not to change them. If they keep
their annoying personalities,

67
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,516
{\an1}then they could agitate
the enemy even more.

68
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,885
{\an1}And that could work
to our advantage.

69
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:06,023
Is that really you,
Master Dan?

70
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:09,792
{\an1}Yes, it is. It appears
that you and I have been
reunited in death.

71
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:15,364
{\an1}This must be a Forbidden Jutsu
where the dead are summoned back
to inhabit sacrificial bodies.

72
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:18,332
{\an1}What in the world's going on?
Why has this happened?

73
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,068
{\an1}I've got a bad
feeling about this.

74
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:26,138
{\an1}Aren't you going to take
Black and White Zetsu along?

75
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,741
Zetsu will stay behind
as Sasuke's guardian.

76
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:33,809
So you won't try
to whisk him away
while I'm at war.

77
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:35,911
[chuckle]

78
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,347
{\an1}The hundred thousand White
Zetsu will travel underground.

79
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:42,483
{\an1}Such a large army would
attract attention up above.

80
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:19,243
{\an1}It's time for us
to head out, too.
But first...

81
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:26,881
{\an7}<i>Forgive us, Captain Anko!</i>
<i>Please stay safe!</i>

82
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,559
{\an7}<i>This sensation.</i>
<i>is it Orochimaru?!</i>
<i>No!</i>

83
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,994
{\an1}[both]
Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes!

84
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:52,933
{\an4}Heh. Just because you have a
Curse Mark, you think you're
like Lord Orochimaru,
Anko Mitarashi!

85
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,936
{\an1}And the same goes for you.
Are you the leader now,
Kabuto Yakushi?!

86
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,443
{\an1}Taijutsu from some
bookworm won't work on me!

87
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,478
Ah!

88
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:09,711
{\an1}Ngh!

89
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:21,854
{\an1}Of course, I have no
intention of fighting
you with taijutsu.

90
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:24,889
I am a bookworm,
after all.

91
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,024
Ungh!

92
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,027
{\an8}<i>Poison? How?</i>
<i>But I should</i>
<i>have immunity!</i>

93
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:34,564
{\an1}[chuckle] So who is
in charge here now?

94
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:39,767
{\an1}The anti-venoms that Lord
Orochimaru developed won't
work against this poison.

95
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,444
{\an1}Over... there.

96
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,114
It's just as Kabuto
told us it would be:
there are three of them.

97
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,548
{\an1}There, toward two o'clock.

98
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:04,552
What's wrong?

99
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,488
{\an1}Muta! Ranka! Go!
The two of you keep moving!
I'll stall them!

100
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:12,958
No matter what happens,
we have to get that
intel to Headquarters!

101
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:36,207
{\an1}Can someone who's so
young really handle being
Commander-in-Chief?

102
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,610
{\an1}Listen, Lord Gaara
is not your
average young man!

103
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,478
{\an1}And how dare you
make such ignorant
assumptions!

104
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,779
And how the hell would
I know about him?!

105
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:47,115
We've barely been on the
same side for a minute,
here, you numbskull!

106
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,350
{\an1}Right back at you!

107
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,851
{\an1}We were enemies for a long
time, and I don't trust you.

108
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,786
{\an1}So you'd better
watch what you say!

109
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,256
To tell you the truth,
I feel the same way.

110
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,156
Me too.

111
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:58,656
Huh??

112
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,125
{\an1}Hold on, what did you
just say, Hoheto?

113
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:07,096
{\an4}Even if Orochimaru did deceive
them, the Sand was still
behind the plot to destroy
the Hidden Leaf Village.

114
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:11,032
{\an1}That means if it weren't for
them, Lord Third would still--

115
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,637
{\an1}Just stay calm, okay?

116
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,239
{\an1}Both of us were lucky enough
to be named to the Commando
Unit like we wanted.

117
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,240
{\an1}Everything is just
about to start!

118
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:25,009
Yeah, I know!
I'm a shinobi!

119
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:28,112
I won't go against
what our nation and
village have decided.

120
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:32,582
{\an1}That was only my
personal opinion,
and nothing more than that.

121
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:36,150
{\an1}Still, you Leaf
don't have the right
to talk that way!

122
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:41,655
{\an4}A rogue ninja from the
Hidden Leaf Village attacked
Lord Killer Bee, as well as
the Five Kage summit!

123
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:45,357
{\an1}Will you take responsibility for
the loss of Lord Raikage's hand?

124
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,090
What's that?!

125
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:50,495
It seems that no one
here is really ready to
trust each other yet.

126
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:52,496
{\an1}I know, but it
can't be helped.

127
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,999
{\an4}After being on opposing
sides for years, you can't
expect them all to bond in
only a day or two.

128
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,001
{\an1}Especially not the
Sand and Stone.

129
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,203
Why you-!

130
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:02,702
You jerk!

131
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,805
{\an1}Humph. This is typical
of the Hidden Stone.

132
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,541
{\an1}Hey, you from the Mist!
What did you just say?

133
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,809
You heard me.
But in case you
didn't get it,

134
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:18,348
{\an4}I was saying that you of the
Hidden Stone are little more
than thugs who don't know
how to follow the rules.

135
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,616
{\an1}Say that again!

136
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:25,786
{\an4}The Hidden Stone betrayed us
in the tragedy of Yosuga Pass.
We are never, ever going to
forget your treachery!

137
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,256
{\an4}What? Yosuga Pass?
You're seriously
bringing up ancient
history like that?!

138
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:31,756
We agreed to
form this unit,

139
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:38,262
{\an4}in order to honor Master
Ganryu, who wishes for peace
from inside the prison where
he's been incarcerated.

140
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,439

never really be true allies!

{\an1}Why, you Leaf bastard!

143
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:03,614
Do something
about it, Cloud!

144
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,116
{\an1}The Hidden Stone is just
gonna betray us again!
Isn't that right?!

145
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,652
{\an1}You Mist are all talk!
If you've got a problem,

{\an1}That's it!
You wanna fight?

Yeah, you bet I do!

149
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,359
You Hidden Sand
killed my father!

150

And I'll avenge him

Yagh!

157
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,640
{\an1}In the name of gain and profit
for one's nation and village...

158
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:43,476
{\an1}Shinobi have hated and hurt
each other for many years,

159
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,712
{\an1}from the First to the Third
Great Ninja Wars and the
conflicts in between.

160
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:51,914
{\an1}All of that hatred cried out
for power. Thus, I was born.

161
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:58,252
{\an1}In the past, I was hatred...
and power... And a Jinchuriki.

162
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,557
{\an5}<i>I hated this world</i>
<i>and all its people.</i>
<i>And thought about</i>
<i>destroying both.</i>

163
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:08,793
{\an1}That's exactly what the
Akatsuki is trying to do now.

164
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:18,367
But then, a single
shinobi from the Hidden
Leaf Village stopped me.

[Naruto]
[struggling breaths]

{\an1}It's almost unbearable,
isn't it?

167
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,215
The feeling of
being all alone.

168
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:40,684
{\an1}I know that feeling.

169
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:44,052
{\an1}It really is almost
unbearable, isn't it?

{\an1}<i>Naruto.</i>

172
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,541
Ya sure had us
worried there!

173
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,740
He cried for me.

174
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,007
I was his enemy,
yet still he
cried for me!

175
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,111
{\an1}And he called me his friend
even though we had battled.

176
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,247
He saved me!

177
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,584
{\an1}We were on different sides,
but we were both Jinchuriki.

178
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:19,254
{\an1}Between those who have
experienced the same pain,
there can be no hate!

179
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,425
{\an1}There are no enemies here, now!

180
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,795
{\an1}Because each one of us
bears the pain of having
been hurt by the Akatsuki.

to forgive the Sand,

Then you can come back
and face me after this
war is over!

191
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,716
The looks on their
faces have changed.

192
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:51,520
{\an1}The friend I spoke of who saved
me is the target of our enemy.

193

{\an1}If he falls into their hands,
our world's finished!

{\an1}I want to protect my friend!
And I want to protect this
entire world!

195
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,130
{\an1}I am too young and
inexperienced to do that.

196
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,599
So I ask you,
All of you,

197
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:11,067
Please, lend me your
strength for this fight!

{\an1}Thank you.
But I was in
the wrong, too.

203

{\an1}I apologize for
what I just said.

204

felt the same pain must
come together now.

if I held no grudge.

that they'll accept help
even from someone like me.

We are united
as shinobi.

together as one, and we'll
defeat the Akatsuki!

All of us are
comrades now.

Well, it's sure gonna
be a real nuisance,

just going to have to
learn everybody's scents.
