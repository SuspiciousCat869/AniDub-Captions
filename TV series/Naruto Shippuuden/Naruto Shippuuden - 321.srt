{\an1}I've detected a new

{\an1}It's a small unit,
but the chakra
is unusual.

{\an1}I think...

who's in this unit?

{\an1}This chakra is...

{\an1}The Fourth Mizukage!

50
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:22,882

who was a Jinchuriki?

51
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:27,452
{\an7}There's no doubt about it.
And all the others are
Jinchuriki, too!

52
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:36,491
{\an1}I can't believe he
had more pawns under
his control...

00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,459
{\an1}And Naruto...?
Where is he?!

54
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,837
{\an1}Finally caught up
with you, Naruto!

you long enough!

{\an1}Well...had other
problems, too.

60
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:46,945
{\an1}Anyway, one of your
shadow clones contacted
me earlier.

61
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,179
{\an1}How are all the others
doing, by the way?

62
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:53,815
{\an1}They should arrive on the
frontlines of every last
battefield right about now.

63
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,118
{\an7}Then all the fakers we're
gonna seek out. All the
bad guys we'll defeat,
no doubt!

64
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,920
{\an7}Yeah, that's the plan.
But we gotta hurry!

65
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:12,761
{\an1}Shikamaru...Just how
long do we have to
stay like this, anyway?

66
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:16,865
{\an1}If that big statue thing
comes back anytime soon,
then we're gonna be toast!

67
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,465
{\an1}Relax, it's only
until Naruto arrives.

68
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:23,468
{\an1}And until he does, no
one steps inside of
anyone else's circle!

69
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,071
{\an1}Or they'll be tagged
as an enemy, even you.

70
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:30,206
{\an1}But can't we just confirm who
people are using secrets only
their friends would know?

71
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,209
{\an1}No way! I mean, we already
lost some people trying
that method, remember?

ends up being right.

Thank you for coming.

I'm surprised Lord
Raikage gave the okay for this.

89
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,140
{\an1}Well, you can thank
Granny Tsunade for that!

90
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,975
{\an1}She convinced Pops
Raikage to let me
do this!

91
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,678
{\an1}Tsunade sent that boy
out here? Exactly who
is he, anyway?

92
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:34,149
{\an4}He has the Nine Tails sealed
inside him. He's what
all the adults call a
Jinchuriki.

93
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:35,950
{\an1}What? That boy?!

94
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:41,654
{\an4}His name is Naruto,
my idiot classmate who's
yelled about becoming Hokage
since he was a kid.

an idiot, idiot?

I can find all the enemies
for you.

97
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:52,627

believe it actually
might be possible
for him to become Hokage.

to successfully groom
that brat Nagato.

{\an1}<i>[amused chuckle]</i>

175

{\an1}If I'm not mistaken,
you are...

176
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:22,072
{\an4}The caster of
the Reanimation
Jutsu has a keen
understanding of war...

177
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,441
{\an1}To think of using you...

178
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:31,712
{\an1}Did you say Reanimation
Jutsu? Then this is not
the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu?

179
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,449
{\an1}Why didn't you tell
us sooner that Naruto
had arrived?

180
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,585
{\an1}Because he just got
here, that's why.

181
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:43,753
{\an4}Sure I happened to run
into him first, but I was
still in the middle
of fighting.

182
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:47,755
{\an1}Naruto smells different
than he did before, so I
didn't notice him.

183
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:50,091
{\an1}And besides, you're the
one with long range vision.

184
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,426
{\an1}But he looks different
than before.

185
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,694
{\an1}Even his chakra
nature's changed.

186
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:58,530
{\an1}Then who are you to
talk if you can't even
recognize him now?

187
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:00,030
{\an1}Are you really Naruto?

188
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,832
{\an1}I hope you're not
a transformed white
one, too.

189
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,766
{\an1}I'm really Naruto.

190
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,702
{\an1}So you say, but
can you prove it?

191
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,137
{\an1}No! It is Naruto!

192
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,971
{\an1}You can tell by his eyes.

193
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:11,938
{\an1}But Hinata...

194
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:15,407
{\an1}And besides, he saved me.

195
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,809
{\an1}Actually, Naruto saved
me, as well.

196
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,710
{\an1}Wait, hold on! When
did you get here, Shino?

197
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,712
{\an1}Did you know a fake you
showed up just a while ago?

198
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,581
{\an1}Well I'm the real deal.

199
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:27,916
{\an1}I've been with Naruto
since shortly after he
arrived on the battlefield.

200
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,586
{\an1}Naruto, I'm sorry about
this. We've all become
so distrustful.

201
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,921
{\an4}At least now that I'm
here, you don't have to
fight a defensive battle
anymore.

202
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,991
{\an1}I'll find all the
fake ones one by one.

203
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,626
{\an1}All right! That
sounds good to
me, Naruto.

204
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,860
{\an1}And I've memorized
your new scent.

205
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:46,462
{\an1}And your chakra.

206
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:51,398
{\an1}Well, unfortunately, smell
and chakra don't matter
much with their transformations.

207
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,900
{\an1}Those guys can mimic
everything, even chakra.

208
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,867
{\an1}But don't worry,
I'll take them down.

209
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,703
{\an1}And when I do, as you saw,
they even turn into trees!

210
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:03,805
{\an1}When I'm in this mode,
I can sense all the malice
and hatred they give off.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,910
{\an4}I'm gonna find every last
one of those fakes, and then
together, we can defeat all
of them!

235
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,679
{\an1}You all right, Sai?

236
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,981
{\an1}Yes, I can keep going.

There's a whole lot
of them, too.

239
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,824
{\an1}They're the white ones...

240
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:15,594
{\an1}Are these the ones that
can transform their chakra
as well as their bodies?

241
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:18,061
{\an1}It's gonna start
getting wild, Kakashi.

242
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,997
{\an1}Our reinforcements are here.

243
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,633
{\an1}Or should I say
reinforcement, singular?

244
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,501
{\an1}But Naruto can make
multiple Shadow
Clones, as well!

245
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:30,036
{\an1}But, uh, actually, not
right now, I can't do that.

246
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:33,872
{\an1}Today, I'm going for
quality instead of
quantity.

247
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,408
{\an1}And so, here goes...

248
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:41,111
{\an1}Things have changed around
here, Kimimaro!

249
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:45,079
{\an1}Yes, I can tell that
time has passed simply
by looking at you.

250
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:49,483
{\an1}It appears that you've
grown up in ways other
than just your height.

251
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,851
{\an1}Get ready! Here I come!

254
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,925
{\an1}What's going on?

255
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,528
{\an1}He's just as rash and
scatterbrained as ever.

256
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,928
{\an1}That's for sure.

{\an1}You're kidding. Is
that him?

258

{\an1}Oh, yeah. It's
him all right.

259
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,800
{\an1}It appears that Naruto
has now reached all
of the battlefields.

260
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,268
{\an1}That's good.

261
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:23,338
{\an1}Naruto has managed to join
up with Gaara and the
rest of the Fourth Company.

262
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:29,710
{\an4}And all their enemies-the former
Kage of the Wind, Lightning,
Earth, and Water-have been
successfully sealed.

263

What do we do now,

{\an7}We should rendezvous
with another company
and keep fighting.

266
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:42,084
{\an7}Our real enemy isn't
all the reanimated
shinobi.

267
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,285
{\an1}It's Madara!

268
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,020
{\an1}You're right. This war
will not end until
he's brought down.

269
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:48,988
{\an1}Our target should
be Madara.

270
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:52,792
{\an7}Octopops and the real
me should be heading
over this way right
about now.

00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,696
{\an1}The Medical Unit has
suppressed all their enemies.

288
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,431
{\an1}Seems the plan worked. The
tide of battle has
undoubtedly turned.

289
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,499
{\an1}It's overwhelmingly
in our favor.

290
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:56,667
{\an1}See?

291
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,201
{\an1}Hmph.

292
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:03,104
{\an1}Now all we need to do
is to stop Madara, who's
approaching with the Jinchuriki.

293
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:08,375
{\an4}We should focus all our
remaining strength there
and hit him with everything
we've got!

294
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,209
{\an1}<i>[heavy grunt]</i>

295
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,310
{\an1}Please, hold on!
Just wait one second!

296
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:12,811
{\an1}What is it?!

297
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:16,646
{\an1}I suddenly sense a
new enemy near Gaara's
Fourth Company.

298
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,781
{\an7}<i>[struggling grunt]</i>

299
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:20,349
{\an7}<i>But what is this chakra?!</i>

300
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,819
{\an1}<i>[panicked gasp]</i>
Wait, was is that?!

301
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:27,554
{\an1}What's the matter?
What are you sensing?

302
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:28,955
{\an1}It's right over there!

303
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,457
{\an1}What now?

304
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:33,825
{\an1}Hm?

305
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,827
{\an1}The Second Tsuchikage!

306
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:40,396
{\an7}I thought that you had
him sealed away, Gaara?!

307
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,564
{\an7}Impossible! In that
state, he fragmented
himself?!

308
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,965
{\an7}What do you mean?

309
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:49,468
{\an7}Lord Mu was able to split
his body, and in doing
so, he created clones.

310
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:54,773
{\an7}Well, no. Not clones.
It's closer to say that he
splits his body into two
pieces.

311
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,508
{\an1}Although each one only
has half his normal
strength.

312
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,777
{\an7}No, I don't mean him.
Someone else is here!

313
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,678
{\an1}What?!

314
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,713
{\an1}Really?! There's
another one?!

315
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,381
{\an1}[shocked gasp]
That one is...

316
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,314
{\an1}<i>[stunned breath]</i>

317
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,349
{\an1}Who is it?!

318
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:15,853
So he's come...

319
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,991
{\an1}That...is
Madara Uchiha!

320
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,329
{\an1}That's him...?!

321
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,031
{\an1}So that's what he looks
like beneath his mask, huh?

322
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,534
{\an1}But he looks exactly
the same as he did before!

323
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,067
{\an7}What is going on here?!

324
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,536
{\an7}What do you mean?

325
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,870
{\an7}Take a close look
at his eyes.

326
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:45,839
{\an7}He's a reanimated
shinobi!

327
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:50,643
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu
brings the dead back
to this realm.

328
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:53,578
{\an1}Which means he's
been dead...

329
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:55,379
{\an1}Wait just a second!

330
00:20:55,412 --> 00:21:00,015
{\an4}HQ reported Madara elsewhere,
approaching in the other
direction with a bunch
of Jinchuriki.

331
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:01,216
{\an1}Isn't that correct?

332
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:05,719
{\an1}But there's no mistaking
it! He's definitely
Madara Uchiha!

333
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:08,888
{\an1}He's the one I fought
against back in my
younger days!

334
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:15,859
{\an1}But then who could
possibly be the man...

335
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:23,397
{\an1}...behind the mask?

336
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:58,059
{\an1}<i>If that guy up there</i>
<i>is the real Madara...</i>

337
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:01,762
{\an4}<i>...that means the guy</i>
<i>with the mask who we</i>
<i>thought was Madara</i>
<i>isn't actually him?</i>

338
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:04,297
{\an1}<i>Yes, so it seems.</i>

339
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,565
{\an1}<i>What is this?!</i>

340
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,900
{\an1}<i>It can't be...</i>

341
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,601
{\an1}<i>Is this ninjutsu?!</i>

342
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:12,770
{\an1}<i>We can't outrun it!</i>

343
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:16,006
{\an1}<i>Woah...This is way</i>
<i>out of our league!</i>

344
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,009
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Madara Uchiha."</i>

345
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,711
{\an1}Is this the power
of a God?
