{\an4}Uhh... Have you
decided to go out
with Shikamaru
or Choji?

21

{\an1}[annoyed groan]

either one of you guys, anyway?!

{\an4}But the worst thing is that he
had the nerve to enter a woman's

knock! Can you believe that?!

23
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:28,491
{\an1}Look, I get that you're upset,
but why are you taking it out
on the two of us?

24

{\an1}Both of you just relax. Ino,
Inoichi's just worried about
you.

00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,192
{\an1}Come to think of it...
you did cry a lot over Sasuke
when you found out about him.

it was so sudden.

29
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:56,860
{\an1}It doesn't matter now
anyway. Worrying about
Sasuke won't do any good.

to leave it to Sakura

are you
going to--

{\an1}It's all

{\an1}Huh?

{\an1}Mmm..
Delicious!

144
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:25,319
{\an4}[chuckle]
Little things like this
are the only things I've
ever been good at.

145
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:31,219
{\an7}Oh... Don't sell yourself
short. Sitting down to a
meal is the best part of
a mission.

146
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:40,654
{\an1}You know, there have been many
shinobi who have specifically
requested you for their teams.

147
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:45,787
{\an4}No matter how risky
the mission, if you
order me, I'll go
on it.

148
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:53,654
{\an7}You shouldn't take
your life so lightly,
Kosuke.

149
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,021
{\an1}Thank you
for the food.

150
00:10:56,053 --> 00:11:00,221
{\an1}It really was delicious;
some of the best I've had.

151
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,087
{\an1}By the way,
Kosuke...

152
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,488
{\an1}Would you be willing
to accept a mission
right now?

153
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,121
{\an1}Huh?

154
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:13,288
{\an1}The Chunin Exam is an
opportunity to check the balance
of power among the villages..

155
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:17,022
{\an1}..so some mutual distrust
is always to be expected.

156
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:22,589
{\an1}However, this time,
I feel a deep unease...

157
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:27,023
{\an1}But hopefully, it's
nothing more than an
old man's imagination.

{\an1}[crowd chatter]

159
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,890
{\an1}What?  A message from
the Third Hokage?

160
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:40,590
{\an1}Quiet, Choza!

161
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:42,390
{\an1}Not so loud,
you fool!

162
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,356
{\an1}Oh, right.
Sorry.

{\an1}[moan]

164
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:49,790
{\an1}So what did
Lord Hokage say?

165
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:55,523
{\an1}It's too early in the season
for the leaves to dance. He
said that you would understand.

166
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,457
{\an1}Message received
and understood.

167
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:09,858
{\an1}A special code between the
Sarutobi Clan and the three
houses, huh?

168
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,691
{\an1}[gasp]

00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:43,262
{\an1}I know, it's a reunion
of the Ino-Shika-Cho Trio.

192
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:48,362
{\an1}I'm a shinobi of the Leaf, not
as skilled as they are; but I'll
gladly give up my life.

193
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:49,963
{\an1}For the sake
of the village!

00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:53,396
{\an1}What?

195
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,096
{\an1}I won't allow you
to ravage the Leaf!

196
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,997
{\an1}Even if it means sacrificing
this old body, I'll take as many

{\an1}It's Kosuke.

{\an1}He charged right
into the middle
of the enemy, huh?

{\an1}We can't just
let him go!

200
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,363
{\an1}Then let's do it!

201

{\an1}You mean, the
Ino-Shika-Cho
Formation?

{\an1}I sure hope
you haven't
forgotten how!

203
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:22,565

I don't deserve

from the Leaf's most powerful

opponents while filling
your comrades with courage!

your comrades' fears to
bravery.

or not.

but don't tell
anyone, okay?

ourselves look bad in

will surpass us in no time at
all, I'm sure of that much.

of the Leaf grow into

that?!

pretty amazing,
don't you think?

261
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:34,878
{\an4}Yeah. They are. But here I
was, just thinking that our
own formation had gotten so
much better...

262
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:38,778
{\an1}Compared to our dads,
we still have a really
long way to go, don't we?

00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,511
{\an1}[sigh]

264
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:48,811
{\an1}If you don't
mind my saying...

265
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:52,145
{\an1}...A shinobi is not
made in only one day.

266
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:56,178
{\an1}I'm looking forward to seeing
your Ino-Shika-Cho formation...

267
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,712
{\an1}...when it has
fully matured.

268
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:05,712
{\an7}Until then, I'll have to learn
to be more careful, so you don't
have to keep coming to my rescue
all the time!

{\an1}[chuckles]

270
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,913
{\an4}Well, our dads had
their way of doing
things and we three
have our own way.

271
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:22,047
No sense getting
worked up over
this.

272
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,379
{\an1}Yeah! You're right.

273
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,780
{\an1}Hm.

274
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,880

{\an7}<i>There's no doubt that despite</i>
<i>our skill, we haven't gotten</i>
<i>up to our dads' level...</i>

277

<i>they are...</i>

278
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,647
{\an7}<i>Which means,</i>
<i>this upcoming war.</i>

279
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:53,148
{\an7}<i>I wonder what kind of enemy</i>
<i>we're going to have to face.</i>

280
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:59,081
{\an1}[chuckle]
Huh?

281
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,982
{\an1}Ever since we were genin,
practically all we thought
about was running away.

282
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:09,249
{\an1}It's true. We were always
scared and just kept trying
to find the easy way out.

283
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,449
{\an1}Mhm.

284
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:15,849
{\an1}I guess to put a positive
spin on it, you could say
that we knew ourselves well.

285
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:19,482
{\an4}[grunt]
But face it!
We're still
too weak!

286
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:20,616
{\an1}What?!

287
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,349
{\an1}That's why we use
our heads to think
of solutions...

288
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:25,416
{\an1}...like how to
stay alive...

289
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:29,550
{\an4}...and strategy,
like how to beat an
enemy that's stronger
than we are.

290
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:30,317
{\an1}Oh!

291
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,283
{\an1}I'm counting on you,
Ino and Choji.

292
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:39,750
{\an1}We may never fully measure
up to our dads. But we're not
going to war alone, either.

293
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:43,450
{\an1}We just have use
our strengths as
best as we can.

294
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:47,418
{\an1}All we can do is
our best as who
we are right now.

295
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:51,785
{\an7}<i>Up to now, we've stuck</i>
<i>together and done all</i>
<i>right for ourselves.</i>

296
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,885
{\an7}<i>So even with</i>
<i>this next war...</i>

297
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:57,084
{\an1}We'll be okay,
don't you guys
think?

298
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:59,318
{\an1}Huh? Oh. Yeah...

299
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:02,217
{\an1}We'll be fine, you guys!
Show a little spirit!

300
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:03,518
{\an1}Come on!

301
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,952
{\an1}(Ino)
We can do this!

302
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,019
Right!

303
00:22:55,424 --> 00:23:02,357
{\an4}Damn it, what a miserable
morning!  First, that weird
dream, and now, all anyone
can talk about is Naruto!

304
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,391
{\an1}It can't be helped.
Naruto's the village
hero right now.

305
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:11,692
{\an4}When we were kids, he was
such a loser. If he hadn't
farted during the Chunin
Exam, I would've won!

306
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,391
{\an1}There are no "ifs"
in battle. That's
because-

307
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,725
{\an1}You're so annoying!
I'll catch up to him!
Just watch!

308
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:21,625
{\an1}Next time on
Naruto Shippuden:
Kiba's Determination.

309
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:25,092
{\an1}I won't be
left behind!
