I'm at the end of my rope here.

-Hah, we're talking about
the Northern Hideout.

If you're this weak
now, you'll probably

be killed the instant
you get there.

seeing it on a map.

I didn't know that place was
going to be that dangerous.

can never leave this place.

Never.

-Suigetsu, why the hell are
you following Sasuke around?

-Hm, Sasuke is not the
only one with a goal.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,133
And I have reason to believe
he can help me reach mine.

72
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:48,766
But really, I should be asking
you the same question, Karin.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,466
-I may not know exactly what
goals you two are after.

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,833
But if you knew what
Jugo's really like,

75
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,100
you wouldn't want
to recruit him.

76
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,800
-Well, actually, I
know him a little.

77
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,000
I was forced to fight him once.

78
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,266
He used some interesting
powers and was pretty strong.

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,666
But I couldn't figure out
what was going on in his head.

80
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,966
I could never come
around to liking him.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
I heard he actually asked
Orochimaru to lock him up

82
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:13,800
in that place.

83
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,866
It tells you how
crazy he really is.

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,400
-According to all the
rumors I've heard,

85
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:24,033
Jugo has bizarre impulses
but manages to control them.

86
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,733
When he snaps, he becomes
a homicidal maniac.

87
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,533
And his personality changes
along with his looks.

88
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,900
-Hah!

89
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,333
In other words, he's an angry
guy who loves to kill people.

90
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,933
Does that sum it up pretty well?

91
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,966
-Even so, to
Orochimaru, Jugo's power

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,533
was something very fascinating.

93
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:44,033
Orochimaru developed an enzyme
from Jugo's bodily fluids

94
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:47,466
which allowed other shinobi
to achieve the same state.

I mean, don't you?

the Curse Mark.

97

It originated with Jugo.

00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,567
It started with the
rumors of Orochimaru--

168
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,601
that he'd been killed.

169
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,401
The prisoners all
went wild and rioted.

170
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:34,901
And the way it's going-- [gasps]

171
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,434
-Look at that.

172
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,034
He just died.

173
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:38,534
-Hm.

174
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,434
-I know you.

175
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,234
I'm sure I do.

176
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,101
-What the heck is that?

177
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,867
-That's Curse
Mark's second state.

178
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,234
He has already transformed.

179
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,734
-Uhh.

180
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:19,667
Ugh.

181
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,967
-The Northern Hideout
is just ahead.

182
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,001
Let's go get Jugo.

183
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:27,567
-Hey, hey!

184
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,434
Wait up!

185
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:28,901
Sasuke!

186
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,501
-Huh?

187
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,367
Who is this guy?

188
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,467
-A man.

189
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:51,001
The next one I kill will
definitely be a man.

190
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,334
OK, it's settled.

191
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:03,434
If the next one through the
door is a woman, I'll kill her.

192
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:12,434
-All the wardens
have been killed.

193
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,867
And all of the inmates
have broken out.

194
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,367
-At this rate, we can't tell
which one is Jugo, right?

195
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,667
Sasuke?

196
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:23,134
-Karin, can you detect Jugo
among all those prisoners?

197
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,667
-Oh, what a huge pain.

198
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,601
Wait just a second.

199
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,401
[growls]

200
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,434
No.

201
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,801
He's not among them.

202
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,167
-Then we won't have to worry
which of them we take down.

203
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:47,634
-Just don't kill any of them.

204
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,934
-[sighs]

205
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,734
Boy, you really are from
the Hidden Leaf Village.

206
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:52,901
We shouldn't hold back.

207
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,301
And you should have
killed that last guy, too.

208
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,001
You're so soft.

209
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:58,534
-Let's go.

210
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,107
-Ugh!

211
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:11,907
-All of you, stay back!

212
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,341
[grunts]

213
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:32,807
-Arrgh!

214
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,507
-Ugh!

215
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,041
You're really a strong, oh--

216
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,474
-[sighs]

217
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:57,707
-The keys!

218
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:58,674
I found the keyring.

219
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,974
-Kill.

220
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:08,207
I'll kill them.

221
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,174
-Karin, which way?

222
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,707
Tell us.

223
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,541
-Hey, Sasuke, quit
bossing us around.

224
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:33,674
-[sighs]

225
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:36,607
Just calm down and
figure it out, would you?

226
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,207
If you're so proud of
your ability, then use it.

227
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:42,641
-It's that way.

228
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:46,507
-[sighs]

229
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,674
-What's wrong?

230
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,807
-It's actually this way.

231
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,741
Now, come on, let's go.

232
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:07,707
-Why did you lie, Karin?

233
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:09,507
Suigetsu went the wrong way.

234
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,607
-Suigetsu has a big mouth.

235
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,207
I don't like him.

236
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,541
Come on.

237
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:15,641
-Let go.

238
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:19,207
I can walk on my own.

239
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,874
-You know, I didn't realize
the Curse Mark could transform

240
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:25,641
one's body to such
a grotesque degree.

241
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:29,174
Sasuke, I wonder, has that Curse
Mark changed you like that,

242
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,774
too?

243
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:31,707
Sasuke?

244
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:33,374
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

245
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,974
That woman.

246
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,874
-A woman.

247
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,441
If a woman comes in,
then I'll kill her.

248
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,507
-This it?

249
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,174
-Yeah, Jugo's in this cell.

250
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,674
-Someone's here.

251
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:07,641
[keys rattling]

252
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,541
So which is it?

253
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,441
-OK.

254
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:12,774
I'm going to open it.

255
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,141
-No, I'm going in first.

256
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:24,774
Now, just stay behind me.

257
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,641
-Uh, right.

258
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:29,141
-Now.

259
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,074
A man, yeah, a man.

260
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,074
If a man walks in,
I'm killing him.

261
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:39,741
Bingo!

262
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:40,241
You're dead!

263
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,674
-Aah!

264
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:45,141
-Yaah!

265
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,374
-Hey, wait.

266
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,207
I'm right back where I started.

267
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:56,007
Guess I should have
turned right back there.

268
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,507
I'm going to get that wench.

269
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,407
-You--

270
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,341
-Huh?

271
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,941
-I saw you and your friends.

272
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,674
Why did you come to this place?

273
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,274
What do you want here?

274
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,541
-That is none of your business.

275
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,307
But we came for Jugo.

276
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,774
We want him to join us.

277
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,841
-[chuckles]

278
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,541
You don't know him.

279
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,641
Because if you did, you'd
have stayed far away

280
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,707
from this place.

281
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:22,174
You don't know what
you're messing with.

282
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:23,874
You can't let him get out.

283
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,741
He just can't control himself.

284
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,774
-Hah, believe me, I know.

285
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,107
I'll make him see reason,
by force, if necessary.

286
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,474
-Tch.

287
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:39,041
No matter how strong you may
be, you're no match for Jugo.

288
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,241
Ugh!

289
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:43,174
-Listen, if it wasn't
for Sasuke's silly rules,

290
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,041
I would have killed you already.

291
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:46,707
-[snickers]

292
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:47,641
Do what you want.

293
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,807
Jugo will still kill all of you.

294
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,074
-I think he'll forgive
me just this once.

295
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,141
-Sasuke!

296
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,407
-[guffaws]

297
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,741

[sighs]

299
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:13,707
I'm so sorry, Lady Tsunade.

300
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,941
Naruto never knows when to quit.

301
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,207
Stupid Naruto, don't
just stand there!

302
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:18,907
-Hey!

303
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:19,507
-Say you're sorry.

304
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,174
-Ow, Sakura!

305
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,141
That hurts.

306
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,241
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

307
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:25,274
-[grunts]

308
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,607
So, what did you want to
tell us, Lady Tsunade?

309
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:29,941
-Huh?

310
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:32,141
[sighs]

311
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:33,874
-Hm?

312
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,274
What is it?

313
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,374
Don't leave us hanging?

314
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,007
Do you have something
to talk to us about?

315
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,741
Or what?

316
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:41,241
-Yes, I do.

317
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:44,207
It's just that we've been
seeing some intel floating

318
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,941
around multiple channels.

319
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,141
That's what I need
to talk to you about.

320
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,307
-Some intel?

321
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:50,841
-What?

322
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:51,807
What is it?

323
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,107
-That Orochimaru is dead.

324
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,874
-[gasps]

325
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:03,307
-And that Sasuke
Uchiha killed him.

326
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:14,907
-What?

327
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,441
Really?

328
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,641
Are you sure?

329
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,374
-Yeah, that's the
story we've heard.

330
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,474
And we believe it's true.

331
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,974
It comes from a reliable source.

332
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:33,941
-Then that means--

333
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,407
-[laughs]

334
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,841
I just knew there was no
way Orochimaru could ever

335
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,107
break Sasuke!

336
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,574
That must mean Sasuke is
coming back to the Hidden Leave

337
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,074
Village, right?

338
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:43,574
Right?

339
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:49,341
Uh.

340
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:54,907
-I'm afraid that doesn't
seem to be in his plans.

341
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,907
-Uh?

342
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,874
-[laughs hysterically]

343
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:00,874
-Ugh.

344
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,374
-No, not just yet.

345
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,207
-Oh!

346
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,074
KARIN (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke's chakra.

347
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,441
-Huh?

348
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,907
-He just transformed!

349
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,407
-[laughs]

350
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,774
So you're just another
copy of me, are you?

351
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,274
[laughs]

352
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,607
KARIN (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

353
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,574
-Still, it's pretty
impressive you could pull up

354
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,907
a partial transformation
like that.

355
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:54,841
Ugh!

356
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,574
[grunts]

357
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:59,441
You know, you're pretty good
at using the Curse Mark.

358
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,674
-I'm not here to fight you.

359
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:26,341
The only reason I'm here
is to talk to you, Jugo.

360
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:36,254
[music playing]

361
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:05,976
-[laughs]

362
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,743
You're pretty impressive.

363
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:10,143
You're pretty good at
using the Curse Mark.

364
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,509
-I'm not here to fight you.

365
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:14,009
The only reason I'm
here is to talk.

366
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,143
JUGO: Talk?

367
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,876
-That's right, Jugo.

368
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,943
I came to take you out of here.

369
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,643
JUGO: [laughs]

370
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,343
You're just a fool.

371
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,309
You don't know anything
at all, do you?

372
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,609
SASUKE: What do you mean?

373
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:26,709
JUGO: He's gone.

374
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:27,976
Don't you see?

375
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:30,743
Without him, I can
never leave this place.

376
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:33,476
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, "Formation!"

377
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,843
-Ha-ha, thanks for the raffle
tickets, Captain Yamato.

378
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:40,476
That first prize is mine-- a
year's supply of ramen noodles!

379
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,009
Huh?

380
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:42,009
This is it.

381
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:44,376
-Welcome to-- oh
great, it's only you.

382
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,009
-Hey, knock off the attitude!

383
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:48,709
Uh, has anyone won
my cups of ramen yet?

384
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,509
-They're only yours if you're
lucky enough to win them.

385
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,376
But no one's gotten them yet.

386
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,143
-All right!

387
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:56,643
-OK, you get three tries.

388
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,376
-Come on, ramen!

389
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:00,209
-Sorry.

390
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:01,343
But here's a consolation prize.

391
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,043
-This time, for sure!

392
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,476
-Nope, but here's another candy.

393
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,576
-I'm giving this last
try everything I've got!

394
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,976
Aah!

395
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,409
[both gasp]

396
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:14,276
-We have a winner!

397
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:14,776
-Yeah!

398
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:15,243
-Here.

399
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:16,443
-Huh?

400
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:17,909
-The grand prize is "The
Make-Out Tactics" trilogy

401
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:21,076
signed by the author,
Jiraiya Sensei.

402
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,076
-What?

403
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,309
Who would want that?

404
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:26,443
Ah, this whole thing's
stupid, I'm going home!

405
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,509
-Somebody already
won the grand prize?

406
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:31,443
Oh, and I got all these
raffle tickets, too.

407
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,376
How depressing.
