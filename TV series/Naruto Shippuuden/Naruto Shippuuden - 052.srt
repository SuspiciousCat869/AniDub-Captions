[theme song]

2
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,337
-You see?

3
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:22,574
I have a different bond now.

4
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,743
Between my older brother and me.

5
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,581
It's the bond of hatred.

6
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:33,351
-Having too many
ties in this world

7
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,485
will only lead you astray.

8
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:40,892
-It weakens one's ambition.

9
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,894
Distracts you from
what truly matters.

10
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,867
-Now let's go.

11
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,634
Enough is enough.

12
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,369
Snap out of it, already.

13
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:52,370
Get up, Sasuke!

14
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:59,344
-Just shut up for once.

15
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:02,213
What the heck do
you know about it?

16
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:06,451
It's not like you ever had
a family in the first place.

17
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,220
You were on your own
right from the beginning!

18
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,756
What makes you think you
know anything about it, huh?

19
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:18,396
I'm suffering now
because I had those ties.

20
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,266
How on Earth could you
possibly understand

21
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,268
what it feels like
to lose all that?

22
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,810
-It's true.

23
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,447
I have no idea what it's like
having parents or a brother.

24
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:42,387
If that's how you felt, Sasuke--

25
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,965
-Why, Naruto?

26
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,834
Why would you go so far from me?

27
00:03:56,868 --> 00:04:00,705
-Because this is the first time
I've ever had a bond like this.

28
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:08,613
That's why I'll do
anything I can to stop you.

29
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,551
-Then why didn't you?

30
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,822
-I can't turn back.

31
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:28,900
If that's how it is, I'll
just have to sever that bond.

32
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:33,738
-If that's all true then why
didn't you kill me that day?

33
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:36,874
Weren't you gonna
break our bond, Sasuke?

34
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:46,250
-Naruto.

35
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,285
-The reason is simple.

36
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:55,793
It's not that I couldn't
break our bond, Naruto.

37
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,730
-Like me, you may
be one of the few

38
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,665
who can use Mangekyo Sharingan.

39
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,505
But there is a catch.

40
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:11,209
Take the life of
your best friend.

41
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,545
You must kill him.

42
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,513
-No.

43
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:16,881
That's a lie.

44
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:21,619
-I was simply doing as my older
brother had done before me.

45
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:25,189
It was nothing more than
a strategy to gain power.

46
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,495
-What are you talking about?

47
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,897
-I don't owe you
any explanations.

48
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:42,306
All I can tell you is that day--

49
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,871
-[inaudible]

50
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,277
-Rasengan!

-[shouting]

52
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,366
-Naruto.

53
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:21,739
I'm--

54
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:07,618
-That day, when I
left you lying there,

55
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:09,887
I only spared your
life on a whim.

56
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:10,621
Nothing more.

57
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,217
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): He's fast.

58
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,319
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
How did he do that?

59
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,589
-You know, come to think
of it, wasn't it always

60
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:48,226
your dream to become the Hokage?

61
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,928
All of the time you spent
chasing after me would've

62
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,764
been better spent in training.

63
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:57,368
Wouldn't you agree, Naruto?

64
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,704
-Sa-- Sasuke, what are you--

65
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,473
-But this time my
whim is telling

66
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:06,310
me to finish what I started.

67
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:18,923
-How could I ever be Hokage?

68
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:20,591
I can't save a friend.

69
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,496
Isn't that right, Sasuke?

70
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:32,770
-Sasuke!

71
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:56,661
-That block you selected
was the correct one.

72
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:05,903
-All right.

73
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,741
-Chidori stream!

74
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,299
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He's emitting chidori

75
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,300
from his entire body.

76
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,126
-Sorry, Naruto.

77
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,102
It means you may have to
wait for me a little bit.

78
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:20,108
But next time I promise
I won't be dead weight.

79
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:27,115
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

80
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,087
I'll stop you.

81
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,688
On my own, if I have to!

82
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:57,946
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Those eyes.

83
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:59,014
He's not messing around.

84
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,796
-Captain Yamato!

85
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:26,675
-The block that you chose--
was the incorrect one.

86
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:33,782
My snake sword is
somewhat special.

87
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,750
It's impossible to block.

88
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,759
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
My body's going numb.

89
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,699
Is he-- running chidori
down through the sword?

90
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:52,133
I see.

91
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:56,171
It hones the blade to
the utmost sharpness

92
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:59,140
and paralyzes as it cuts.

93
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:41,449
-Well, it's about time.

94
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,918
Things must be getting
interesting over there.

95

[ominous laughter]

96
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:21,256
NINE-TAILS: Now's
your chance, Naruto.

97
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,028
You know what to do.

98
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:28,029
Come.

99
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,965
Give him a glimpse of our power.

100
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,873
Ah, what's the matter?

101
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:48,850
Why do you hesitate?

102
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:56,157
You need my power, don't you?

103
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:04,065
Now then.

104
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,007
Who do you want to kill?

105
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:15,009
-Forget it.

106
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,244
Don't you ever come out.

107
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,112
Do you hear me?

108
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,020
-What are you afraid of?

109
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,921
-You shut up!

110
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,124
Do you think I need your power?

111
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,893
I don't want anything
to do with you!

112
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,828
[laughter]

113
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,712
-Who was the one
with the impudence

114
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:57,051
to come begging for help
at every step of the way?

115
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,992
You understand by
now, don't you?

116
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:09,297
Without me, you couldn't
do anything at all.

117
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,899
Now do it.

118
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:13,868
Break the seal completely.

119
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:17,272
If you do, I'll grant
you all of my power.

120
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:21,242
-I don't need you.

121
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:24,779
-You're--

122
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:30,385
-How did you--

123
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:35,190
-I see.

124
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,059
You're one of the Uchihan.

125
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:43,231
You've advanced well beyond
your years, haven't you?

126
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:45,733
-How are you even
able to be here?

127
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:48,002
-I can see everything.

128
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:51,973
So this is where all
that power's coming from.

129
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,775
Interesting.

130
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:57,712
I never would have guessed
you had this inside of you.

131
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:01,883
-That you can even see me here
inside of Naruto is impressive,

132
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,951
my boy.

133
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:06,287
It's that repugnant Sharingan.

134
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,256
The true power behind
your cursed clan.

135
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,262
-I take it this isn't your
first time seeing the Sharingan.

136
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:20,401
So, you're the Nine-Tails, huh?

137
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:29,744
-With your visual prowess and a
chakra more ominous than my own

138
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:33,348
you are the spitting image of
Madara Uchiha from the elder

139
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,148
days.

140
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,250
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Uchiha.

141
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:43,057
-Never heard of him.

142
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,425
Am I supposed to care?

143
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:52,333
NINE-TAILS: To think you could
actually suppress my power.

144
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,843
This may be my undoing.

145
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:07,181
But before I go,
let me say this.

146
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:12,720
Whatever your plans
are, don't kill Naruto.

147
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,396
If you do, you'll regret it.

-Wood style.

look like we'll be

153
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:04,093
talking any sense into Sasuke.

154
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,461
SAKURA: Captain Yamato--

155
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:07,129
YAMATO: We can't
let a shinobi who's

156
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:09,065
gone rogue continue
to roam free.

157
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,801
Out of consideration
for the two of you

158
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:15,438
I haven't taken any drastic
measures against Sasuke, but--

159
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:17,039
NARUTO: What do you plan to do?

160
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:18,841
YAMATO: We're bringing
him back to the Leaf

161
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,476
by any means necessary.

162
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,877
I'm sorry.

163
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:23,112
I can't hold back anymore.

00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,386
[music playing]

166
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,691
Notable people of Leaf Village.

167
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:44,126
Today we'll be
taking a look back

168
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,963
at the days when Sasuke and
his brother still got along.

169
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,766
Itachi was always
hailed as a genius,

170
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,234
and Sasuke found
himself eclipsed

171
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:54,103
by his brother's shadow.

172
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:57,573
Everyone seemed to place all
their hope solely in Itachi,

173
00:22:57,606 --> 00:23:00,075
yet ironically it
was his brother

174
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,144
who took the greatest
interest in him.

175
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:03,512
-Sorry, Sasuke.

176
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:04,880
Maybe some other time.

177
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,715
-Ow.

178
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:09,151
-Sasuke wanted to keep up
with his elder brother,

179
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:10,853
so he worked relentlessly.

180
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:11,987
However--

181
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:12,927
-Big brother.

182
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,763
He's so distant.

183
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,197
-You probably hate me, huh?

184
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,366
-That's not how I feel.

185
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,023
-I'm always going
to be there for you.

186
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:25,060
Even if it's only as an
obstacle for you to overcome.

187
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:27,596
Even if you do hate me.

188
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,032
-Who would have thought the
kindness in Itachi's eyes

189
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,733
was all just an act?

190
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,102
And ever since the
unthinkable happened

191
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:37,005
he's been Sasuke's mortal
enemy, the lone man

192
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,608
he yearns to defeat.
