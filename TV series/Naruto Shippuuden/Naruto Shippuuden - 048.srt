1
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,007
-I had a hunch
we'd find you here.

2
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,440
-I'd expect no less from
the Hokage's ANBU Black Ops.

3
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:58,729
I take it that fake corpse
didn't fool you, then?

4
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,700
-Start talking.

5
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:01,768
What's going on here?

6
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:08,516
[theme music]

7
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,795
-Spill it, jerk.

8
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,568
Why would you betray
your own teammates?

9
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,376
-If I were you, I'd take care
not to make too much commotion.

10
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,784
Things could turn quite ugly.

11
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:11,785
-I'm gonna kick your--

12
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,388
-Naruto.

13
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:20,873
Here, Sai.

14
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:21,775
Take this.

15
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,621
It's yours, isn't it?

16
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,534
-Thank you.

17
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,943
-You were under
orders from Danzo.

18
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,948
Isn't that right?

19
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:42,787
We know Danzo and
Orochimaru have teamed up,

20
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,295
and we know that they're
planning something big.

21
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,967
You were chosen to be Danzo
and Orochimaru's go between.

22
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,343
So spit it out.

23
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,014
What are they planning?

24
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:03,967
-Orochimaru is easy to read.

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,973
He wants to try and destroy
the Leaf Village again.

26
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:07,976
Isn't that right?

27
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:26,482
-No.

28
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:27,685
That's not--

29
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,357
-Look, why don't you wipe
t phony grin off your face?

30
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,361
I can already tell that
every word you're saying

31
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,598
is a dirty pack of lies!

32
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:14,453
-The truth of the
matter is you people

33
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,692
have discovered my location.

34
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,663
My mission is a
complete failure.

35
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:24,075
Even if we fought, I couldn't
possibly beat all of you

36
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,611
by myself.

37
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,819
I know that, and I think
you know that as well,

38
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,523
so there's no point
in hiding anything.

39
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,769
You are correct.

40
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,609
The plan was to crush
the Hidden Leaf Village.

41
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,814
-You were what?

42
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:45,823
-My true assignment was to form
an alliance with Orochimaru,

43
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:50,099
and to orchestrate a conspiracy
with him, so that together we

44
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,702
could destroy the village.

45
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,978
-Wait a sec.

46
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,550
Do you have any idea
waht you're admitting to?

47
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,486
How could you--

48
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,856
-I'm not finished yet.

49
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:10,678
The other half of my mission was
to gather intel on Orochimaru.

50
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:15,554
In short, to report his
activities back to Lord Danzo.

51
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,826
-That's right,
Sai, keep talking.

52
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:22,602
Own up to everything
you've been hiding.

53
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:24,574
-So let me get this straight.

54
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:28,015
You found Orochimaru and made
sure you earned his confidence

55
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,885
so you could defeat him later?

56
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,867
That's a suicide mission.

57
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,774
-If the Leaf Village
did fall, we fully

58
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,115
expected Orochimaru
would try to betray us.

59
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,887
But this way, we make
sure we've always have

60
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,726
the advantage over him.

61
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,898
-I understand.

62
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,200
-So it's Danzo.

63
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,107
He wants to take over
the Hidden Leaf Village.

64
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:56,644
But hold on.

65
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,782
You were sent in alone to
set all this in motion?

66
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:06,266
-The intelligence
I write down in ink

67
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,103
can transform itself
into little creatures.

68
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,681
They can defend themselves
while traveling back

69
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:14,651
to the Leaf Village.

70
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:20,196
You see, I was chosen
for this mission

71
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,868
specifically because
of my abilities.

72
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,940
-But if the village
were to fall,

73
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,242
then innocent people would die!

74
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:40,640
Do you understand
what you're doing?

75
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:44,015
Didn't you stop and
ask yourself why?

76
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,584
-No.

77
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:48,291
I follow orders.

78
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:49,225
-Oh, Said.

79
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,230
How could you?

80
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,769
-Oh, and one other thing.

81
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:58,679
Sai is just a made up name I
was given for this mission.

82
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,918
I'm nobody.

83
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,793
I'm merely a tool
for Lord Danzo.

84
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:06,830
I don't even exist.

85
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,804
So no matter what you say
or do, it's meaningless.

86
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,349
-Then why the book?

87
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:32,152
What about the book?

88
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,191
Why do you treat that
picture book with such care?

89
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:09,835
The two kids on the cover
of the picture book--

90
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,808
it's you and your
older brother, right?

91
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:16,116
The reason that book
means so much to you

92
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,320
is because it's the only
thing in this world that

93
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:19,355
proves your existence.

94
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,192
Isn't that right?

95
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,770
You're not as emotionless as
you'd have everyone believe.

96
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:33,920
Even a veteran shinobi can't
push all their feelings away.

97
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:38,364
I could see it, the moment I
handed back your picture book.

98
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,735
It was the way you
casually said thank you

99
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,840
as you took it out of my hand.

100
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,380
Of course you were
relieved to get it back.

101
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:50,157
That book is the very thing
that proves who you are.

102
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,862
-I don't understand.

103
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,136
Why does having this
book prove my existence?

104
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,875
-You can't bear to part with
it because it means something

105
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,179
to you.

106
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,717
It means you're somebody's
younger brother,

107
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:05,690
and you don't want
to forget that.

108
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:07,093
Don't you understand, Sai?

109
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,042
He was your family.

110
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:16,047
The bond you shared
with your older brother

111
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,084
must be incredibly
important to you.

112
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:23,195
Losing that book means
erasing that bond,

113
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:24,765
and you don't want
that to happen.

114
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,087
-Uh, a bond we shared?

115
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,060
-Sorry, Sai.

116
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,932
We had a peek inside that book.

117
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:47,115
Only the drawing along the
middle fold is unfinished.

118
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:53,996
Sai, I'm also aware that you
come from the Foundation.

119
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,809
That's why you're like this.

120
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,513
Danzo gave you
specialized training

121
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:04,018
to make you suppress
your emotions.

122
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,087
-Specialized training?

123
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,231
-I've seen the practice before.

124
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,069
It was once used by
the Village Hidden

125
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:16,345
in the Mist, aka Blood Mist
Village to numb one's feelings.

126
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,415
-The Village Hidden in the Mist?

127
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:21,122
Blood Mist Village.

128
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:23,194
-That's where Zabuza's from.

129
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:31,379
That means that you--

130
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,151
-Long ago, in the Village
Hidden in the Mist,

131
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,389
also known as
Blood Mist Village,

132
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,560
before a student
could become a ninja,

133
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,068
there was one final test.

134
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,942
-Do you know about
the graduation exam?

135
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:47,579
-What graduation exam?

136
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,918
[laughter]

137
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,955
-What's the big deal, anyway?

138
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,261
We had graduation tests, too.

139
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:59,038
[laughter]

140
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:02,145
-Did you have to annihilate
the other students to pass?

141
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:11,131
Imagine young ninja like you,
eating together, training

142
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,940
together, and then
comes the final exam.

143
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:17,077
Only they changed the rules.

144
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,953
You couldn't stop until you
destroyed your opponent.

145
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:23,959
He was your friend,
shared your dreams.

146
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,562
Now it's him, or you.

147
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,901
-If we follow the
pages of the book,

148
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:46,609
it begins with you
defeating various enemies,

149
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:49,114
then taking away their
weapons and armor.

150
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,671
Then, on the fold in
the middle of the book,

151
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,476
you would have ended up fighting
against your older brother.

152
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,002
You killed him, didn't you, Sai?

153
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:14,670
-You're wrong.

154
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,356
This book was going to
be a present for him.

155
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,126
But right when I
was about to finish

156
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:32,208
drawing the final pages,
my older brother-- well,

157
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:35,181
he-- he succumbed to illness.

158
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:42,564
-But you don't
really mean you can't

159
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,305
feel any emotion about anything?

160
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:46,707
-Yes, exactly.

161
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:50,148
I meant what I said.

162
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,753
-You say that, but if
you have a brother,

163
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:55,359
try and imagine what it
would feel like to lose him.

164
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,530
Surely you should
be able to do that.

165
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,301
-Hm?

166
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,036
Oh, yes.

167
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,038
That.

168
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:05,047
Well, you see, my
brother is already dead.

169
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,584
-Then all the more reason--

170
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,190
-I suppose I should have
looked like that, shouldn't I?

171
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,542
-What are you trying to say?

172
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:22,618
-Well, it's just that I simply
didn't know what kind of look

173
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:24,490
a person makes when
his brother dies.

174
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:39,522
Within the Foundation,
there were many children

175
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,161
from families torn
apart by warfare.

176
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,634
He and I instantly
became inseparable.

177
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,639
He even trated me like
I was a real sibling.

178
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,121
We weren't related by
blood, but he often

179
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,558
said nice things
about my drawings.

180
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:06,515
In this book, the picture I
wanted to show him most of what

181
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:08,085
was the final one.

182
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:11,124
The final one in the centerfold.

183
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:14,833
But then he died, and I forgot.

184
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,137
I couldn't remember what
I was going to draw.

185
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,474
-I apologize, Sai.

186
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:22,481
But I'll be leaving behind my
clone to stand guard over you.

187
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,897
-All right.

188
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:34,240
The way I see it, we're
right back at square one.

189
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,910
The mission is to save Sasuke.

190
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,692
-I wouldn't bother,
if I were you.

191
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:45,431
-Hm?

192
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:49,540
-It's just that-- you
see, I met Sasuke.

193
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:09,951
Wherever Sasuke goes,
Orochimaru is always with him.

194
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:18,202
That is to say, if you
want to rescue your friend,

195
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,672
you'll have to get
through Orochimaru.

196
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,320
If you pursue them,
he'll tear you to bits

197
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:29,961
and make you one of his
test subjects And besides--

198
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:34,839
-Besides what?

199
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,324
-It won't matter.

200
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:45,963
Sasuke told me he
doesn't care about you.

201
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,567
That's the truth.

202
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,572
According to Sakura,
you look up to Sasuke

203
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:52,644
as if he's your
brother, or something.

204
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:53,614
So why, then?

205
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,628
Why save someone who
doesn't respect you?

206
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:22,776
Why stand up to the
likes of Orochimaru?

207
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:26,351
Why risk your life for someone
who doesn't want to be saved?

208
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,300
Why would you, when no one is
even ordering you to do so?

209
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,985
-It's funny.

210
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:44,625
There was a time when I
really hated Sasuke's guts.

211
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,408
Neither of us had
families, but that

212
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,446
didn't bring us any closer.

213
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,983
I was always at the
bottom of the class,

214
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,054
and Sasuke was always on top.

215
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:00,593
But when I look
back, I gotta admit,

216
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,931
it was always fun
being around the guy.

217
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:09,112
I mean, after all--
after all, Sasuke's

218
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,751
the person who accepted
me more than anybody else.

219
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,458
Sasuke is my best friend.

220
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:36,571
It took a while, but now
we have a special bond.

221
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,879
-A bond?

222
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,819
You may have a bond,
but you'll still

223
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,622
have to battle Orochimaru.

224
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:45,791
-Don't you get it?

225
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:49,900
It doesn't matter how
strong my opponent is.

226
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:54,744
If he tears off my arms,
I'll just kick him dead.

227
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:58,185
If he tears off my legs,
I'll bite him dead.

228
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,661
If he tears off my head,
I'll stare him dead.

229
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:06,470
If he gouges out my eyes,
I'll curse him dead.

230
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,790
Even if i get
chopped into pieces,

231
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,632
I'm gonna beat Orochimaru, and
take my friend Sasuke back,

232
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:20,735
once and for all!

233
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:34,355
[theme music]

234
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,980
NARUTO: Man, there's
so many rooms.

235
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,981
SAKURA: Sasuke's in one.

236
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,553
We've gotta find him.

237
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,723
YAMATO: Let's split up here,
and search high and low.

238
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:09,863
SAKURA: But captain, what if
we stir up the hornet's nest?

239
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,099
YAMATO: It's OK.

240
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:13,138
The seeds will respond if
you build up your chakra.

241
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:15,475
If that happens, I should
be able to make it through.

242
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:16,344
SAKURA: Got it.

243
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,948
NARUTO: Fine by me.

244
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,953
YAMATO: OK, you
all know the plan.

245
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:22,592
It's time to make our move.

246
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,660
Fall out!

247
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:28,871
NARUTO: Next time,
Something Important

248
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:33,381
[theme music]

249
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:41,699
NARUTO: Hey, Captain?

250
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:44,473
About that seed you had me eat?

251
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:45,508
-Yeah, what about it?

252
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,878
-Well, I was kind of curious.

253
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:48,515
How long before it wears off?

254
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,654
-Why are you worrying about
that at a time like this?

255
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:53,158
-It's kind of creepy, isn't it?

256
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:55,664
I mean, it's useful
in this situation,

257
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:58,770
but we're not always gonna
be on a mission like this.

258
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,775
It would be weird if the
captain knew everything

259
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:02,445
about our lives.

260
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:04,917
Some stuff, I sort of
want to keep private.

261
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,556
-There's no need to
worry about that, Naruto.

262
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,660
Me being able to know
what my subject is doing

263
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,730
doesn't last forever.

264
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,736
-Specifically, how long
are we talking, here?

265
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,176
-It depends on how the
seed stays in the body.

266
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,079
Somewhere around
two or three days.

267
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:20,685
-Oh, that's not so bad, then.

268
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:27,700
So does that mean I just gotta
let nature take its course?

269
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:29,891
Well, I gotta tell
ya, it's a big relief

270
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,594
to hear you say that.

271
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,626
Now, aren't you glad
I asked, Sakura?

272
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,195
-I think you need to
learn some manners.

273
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,863
Ow!
