{\an1}You can't touch Guy
right now, Naruto!

cause him intense pain!

we're going to have to
move Bee and Naruto out
of here immediately.

that the enemy is going
to be upon us soon.

them on the island?

assume that the
enemy knows this.

{\an1}But this island is still far
safer than any boat to travel to
the Hidden Cloud Village .

42
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:40,099
{\an1}Besides, Naruto thinks that he's
here for a top-secret ecological
survey.

43
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,604
{\an1}If we move him off

get suspicious.

00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:03,800
Huunh?

145
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,102
Uh, what is that?

146
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,056
{\an1}Uh, what is this?!

147
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:25,859
Urr?

[manly grunts]

00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,366
Augh.
This is mayhem.

150
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,204
Huh? What's going
on with him?

151
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,839

{\an3}What?!

154
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,419

[stunned growl]

She said,
"I'm not your

159
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:57,498
Huh?

[lovey]
Urrrr ur urrrurr!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

162
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,739
Whaaaaat?!

[angry roaring]

{\an1}They said they're
going to beat you up.

168
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,947
[nervous chuckle]
Ahahah!

169
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:14,017
[humming]

170
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,720
GYAHHHHH!

171
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:24,464
Ha! This is perfect!
Now's my chance to slip
away and disappear!

172
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:29,169
{\an1}No way am I going to war!
I'm free, and I'm gonna
stay that way!

173
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:35,576
{\an1}Freedom! Freedom!
I must have my freedom!

174
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:43,986
<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Wait.</i>

175
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,690
{\an1}I'll go to the location where
the Eight and Nine Tails are.

176
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,063
{\an1}And why would you do that?

177
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:56,368
It's a good chance to
build trust and solidify
our relationship.

178
00:11:57,403 --> 00:12:05,145
{\an4}Plus, the First Hokage clone
known as Yamato is almost
always at the side of the Nine
Tails' Jinchuriki, Naruto.

179
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:08,483
{\an1}I want that clone
for my experiments.

180
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,355
{\an1}But if I can't get him, I can
just make do with Zetsu here.

181
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,625
{\an1}You don't mind sharing
part of him, do you?

182
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:21,398
{\an1}<i>It won't delay Ten Tails'</i>
<i>resurrection, I promise.</i>

183
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,071
{\an1}You seem very well informed.

184
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:31,110
{\an1}I knew Orochimaru was
secretly checking around,
but not to this degree.

185
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:35,948
{\an1}According to the intel
that Kisame sent,

186
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:42,423
{\an1}<i>The Allied Shinobi Force is</i>
<i>eighty thousand strong. And we</i>
<i>know their military formation.</i>

187
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:46,794
{\an1}<i>But the real key to our</i>
<i>army is Zetsu, right?</i>

188
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:48,964
{\an1}[Black Zetsu]
Just how much do you know?!

189
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,334
With the knowledge
that I've gathered,

190
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:54,905
{\an1}I have the ability to
make Zetsu even stronger.

191
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:56,740
But!

192
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,711
{\an1}Only if you take me there
and show me exactly
what you're up to.

193
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,450
[White Zetsu]
Tobi, what will you do?

194
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,886
Do you really believe
you can trust him?

195
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:18,066
{\an1}Bring me Nine Tails, and
I'll give you one of Zetsu.

196
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,203
Come with me.

197
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:31,082
So this is it.

198
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,620
The Gedo Statue!

199
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,223
[chuckle]

200
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,030
Down here.

201
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,525
Is that?

202
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,396
Yes. It's alive.

203
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,635
{\an1}First Hokage
Hashirama Senju.

204
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:23,545
{\an4}<i>Or rather. something</i>
<i>replicated from living</i>
<i>cells that I stole from him</i>
<i>during our infamous battle.</i>

205
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:29,519
{\an1}It has no consciousness.
But that doesn't matter.

206
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,188
{\an1}<i>What I want to</i>
<i>show you is below.</i>

207
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,361
{\an1}This is incredible.
How did you...?

208
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,797
It wasn't easy.

209
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,071
{\an4}I had to use a considerable
amount of chakra from the
Tailed Beasts inside
the Gedo Statue.

210
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:48,074
{\an1}I'd like to preserve them
as much as possible.

211
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:53,213
{\an1}A delay in the Ten Tails'
resurrection will also
delay my own plans.

212
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,717
{\an1}How many of
them are there?

213
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,336
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>Roughly one hundred thousand.</i>

214
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,247
{\an1}<i>[Tsuchikage]</i>
<i>To have an intel leak now!</i>

215
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:24,452
{\an1}We'll have to reformulate
our tactics, then.

216
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:29,191
{\an1}But since they know that
the Allied Shinobi Forces
are aware of the leak,

217
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,460
they'll cautiously
watch the situation.

218
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,064
That makes it easier
for us to set traps.

219
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,534
{\an1}But what about the island?

220
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:41,004
{\an1}Even if it's mobile, we can't
afford to let our guard down.

221
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:44,943
{\an1}They want the Jinchuriki.
The Akatsuki's going to
come looking for them.

222
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,946
{\an1}I've already set up a
contingency plan and

223
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,649
{\an1}plotted a specific route
for the island to follow.

224
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,688
{\an1}The clouds hide it, too.
The enemy won't find it easily.

225
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:59,694
{\an1}If they do go searching, the
enemy will most likely send
a small reconnaissance team.

226
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,163
{\an1}I seriously doubt that
they're going to attempt

227
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,867
{\an1}any large-scale tactical
maneuvers at the moment.

228
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:09,172
{\an1}I'm certain that Kisame
marked the island's
coordinates on a map.

229
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:14,812
{\an1}So even if we move the island,
we can't let our guard down.
They'll keep looking.

230
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,716
{\an1}Yes, we must also
send reinforcements.

231
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:21,788
{\an1}However, it'll be
meaningless if they spot
us mobilizing our forces.

232
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,258
{\an1}Send a small,
elite unit to
avoid suspicion.

233
00:16:26,225 --> 00:16:27,661
Why don't I go?

234
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,696
{\an1}Lord
Tsuchikage!

235
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,199
Huh. Old man
Ohnoki, huh?

236
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,535
I have no
objections.

237
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,437
Me, either.

238
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,740
{\an5}And since you
can fly, you can
get there faster
than anyone.

239
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,342
{\an1}Tell the truth: can you do this?

240
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,311
{\an1}Don't you worry, Kazekage!

241
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:47,317
{\an1}I am Ohnoki, the Tsuchikage,
feared as the Fence Sitter
of the Hidden Stone!

242
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,253
[crack]

243
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,255
<i>Agh! My back!</i>

244
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,928
{\an4}<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>[sigh] That's that. I'll go.</i>
<i>My sand can get</i>
<i>me there quickly.</i>

245
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,162
<i>[Tsuchikage]</i>
<i>No, fool!</i>
<i>I said I'd go!</i>

246
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,096
<i>[crack]</i>

247
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,566
<i>Yaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>
<i>I'm okay!</i>

248
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,741
You can both just
relax for now.

249
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,778
{\an1}We're heading out.

250
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:19,156
{\an1}It's all ocean from here on.
So we're going to have to fly.

251
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:24,229
{\an1}Yeah! I'm gonna
get to fly again!
I'm so excited!

252
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,331
Settle down,
Akatsuchi!

253
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:28,734
We could be heading
straight for a battle
for all you know!

254
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:32,539
{\an1}Wahaa! Yeah!

255
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,275
{\an1}I told you to settle down!
You're so embarrassing!

256
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,546
{\an8}<i>Damn it! That really</i>
<i>does look like fun!</i>

257
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,617
{\an7}<i>But I can't afford to be</i>
<i>acting childish now.</i>

258
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,084
{\an8}<i>Damn that Akatsuchi!</i>

259
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:44,586
{\an1}You're up next,
Kurotsuchi.

260
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:47,690
{\an1}Huuh? Oh, right.
Guess I have to.

261
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,597
{\an1}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Well, looks like</i>
<i>you're finally awake.</i>

262
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:57,936
{\an1}Now, my jutsu is a
little different than
Lord Orochimaru's.

263
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:02,173
{\an1}With this method, you won't
be completely held back,
Hear me, Deidara?

264
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:07,614
{\an1}I must tell you, I know
little about art. And not
a lot about you, either.

265
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,650
Yes, of course.

266
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:14,622
{\an1}My artistic ninjutsu is simply
too sublime to be easily
understood or appreciated.

267
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,627
{\an1}However, I am quite
grateful to you.

268
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,431
{\an1}I've already perfected one
ultimate art, after all.

269
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,434
But now I can take
my art even further.

270
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:28,573
{\an1}Actually, speaking
of which, that final
explosion of yours,

271
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,443
{\an1}It didn't really
create the buzz that
you wanted, did it?

272
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:31,877
Ah!

273
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,480
{\an1}I already told you! My art
is not easily understood!

274
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,285
It takes time!
A long time! Hmf!

275
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,060
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I said Line up single file!</i>
<i>Damn it!</i>

276
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,296
Hurry up and get into
the tunnel, already!

277
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,133
{\an1}Listen! We'll start the
ecological survey inside.

278
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,403
{\an1}Rgh! Come on, cut it out.

279
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,341
{\an1}Huh? What, you want
to fight again?

280
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,714
Man! Damn it!

281
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:06,685
{\an1}It is way tougher than I ever
thought it would be getting all
of these animals inside there.

282
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,422
{\an1}Looks like I win again at
Rock, Scissors, Paper!

283
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,759
I'll keep winning
forever and ever!

284
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,161
Hey, you two! The
octopus and the crab!

285
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,731
Line up already,
would ya?!

286
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:19,668
{\an1}[Motoi]
Since the Akatsuki
might come here,

287
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,805
{\an1}we'll hide the animals
inside the giant turtle
shell, just in case.

288
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:29,312
{\an4}Naruto is taking this
ecological survey cover
story way more seriously
than I thought he would.

289
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:33,484
{\an5}If Naruto finds out
about the war, then
there's going to be a
big mess to clean up.

290
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:37,322
{\an5}He wouldn't take
the news quietly;
he'd rush right to
the battlefield.

291
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,792
It's essential
we prevent that.

292
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,795
This entire war is
about protecting
Naruto, after all.

293
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:50,672
{\an1}According to the intel that
Kisame sent, the island
should be right around here.

294
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:53,274
{\an1}They must have already moved.

295
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,386
{\an1}What a lousy punch.

296
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:05,556
{\an7}<i>If I recall, he's...</i>

297
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,292
{\an1}Ambushed by the
Tsuchikage himself?!

298
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,696
I was only
testing you out.

299
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:14,133
And judging from your
response, you're
nothing but a clone!

300
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,137
{\an8}<i>So it's not</i>
<i>Madara, after all.</i>

301
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:19,006
And...

302
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,542
{\an1}What's up with that
bird and Deidara?

303
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,613
{\an1}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Oh, it's really him,</i>
<i>I assure you.</i>

304
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,349
{\an1}Hmph. However, you...

305
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:31,219
...are a clay clone.

306
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,557
<i>[Deidara]</i>
<i>Hey there,</i>
<i>Old Man Ohnoki!</i>

307
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,494
{\an1}Long time no see!

308
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,528
You too, huh?

309
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:46,171
Hut!

310
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,096
{\an1}<i>[Deidara]</i>
<i>What's so special about</i>
<i>that turtle island?</i>

311
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:32,099
{\an1}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>The Eight and Nine</i>
<i>Tails are on it.</i>

312
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,501
{\an1}<i>[Deidara]</i>
<i>The Eight and Nine Tails</i>
<i>are both right here?</i>

313
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:37,638
{\an1}<i>Then that damn Naruto is</i>
<i>down there, huh? Hm!</i>

314
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:41,310
{\an1}<i>[Kabuto]</i>
<i>Isn't he the perfect opponent</i>
<i>to "exhibit" your art to?</i>

315
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,179
{\an1}<i>First, we stop that island.</i>

316
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:45,014
<i>Give me a big</i>
<i>one, Deidara.</i>

317
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:51,356
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>The Artist Returns.</i>

318
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:53,658
{\an1}<i>[Deidara]</i>
<i>Let's make this one flashy! Hm!</i>

319
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,334
{\an8}<i>Guy Sensei!</i>

320
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:05,373
{\an1}Now, Lee. When it becomes
necessary to use Drunken Fist.

321
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:08,475
Eat this! It's a
Chocolate Bomb!

322
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:10,379
And only good
kids can eat it!

323
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,247
Aah! Yes,
Guy Sensei!

324
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:15,285
Down the hatch!

325
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:17,754
Huh, that's
really weird.

326
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:18,554
{\an1}What is it?

327
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:21,158
I had a bomb here,
but now it's gone!

328
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:21,658
[boom]

329
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,694
{\an1}Yaaahh!
