His use of the word "King."

think these guys are

some of the Shinobi
who didn't survive?

41

-The enemy must have used
some kind of reanimation jutsu

to bring them back to life.

under one king.

paid a terrible price.

Asuma, chose the other king.

-Yes, Naruto.

154
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:08,982
He was ordered by the Hokage
to eliminate my father.

155
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,584
And those living
under the Hokage

156
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,320
must obey his orders,
no matter what.

157
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,855
That's why my father
did everything

was when you cleared that up

For a moment, I thought
maybe there was no need

169

to avenge my father, after all.

170
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:52,392
I even thought taking revenge
might stain his honor.

171
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:54,394
So I thought.

172
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:54,961
-Sora.

173
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,297
But-- Come on.

174
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,532
There's no way.

175
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,567
The Third Hokage
wouldn't do that.

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,369
He would never make
Asuma-sensei do

177
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,204
something-- something
that terrible.

178
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:06,540
-But you can't be sure, can you?

179
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,910
-Well, I-- but the
same goes for you.

180
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,847
How can you so sure
that it's true, anyway?

181
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,616
After all, you never
felt like Asuma-sensei

182
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,618
was your father's
enemy, did you?

183
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,655
Not until-- who told you he was?

184
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,356
Who was it that convinced you?

185
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,258
-That's none of your business.

186
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,627
-Don't tell me you're
actually working

187
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,130
with that group causing
all the trouble down there.

188
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:32,866
The ones who are planning
to wipe us all out?

189
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,433
-Never!

190
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,168
I had no idea!

191
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,471
He never told me
about that part.

192
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,406
-He?

193
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,042
-The only target
was the Leaf's king.

194
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,443
No one else.

195
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,412
Not even Asuma was
supposed to be--

196
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:46,513
-OK, then.

197
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,715
So what went wrong with
this plan of yours?

198
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:54,387
-That's what I'm trying to find
out, if you'd just get lost!

199
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:54,888
-Ahh!

200
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:11,271
-I understand what
it's like to be lonely.

201
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:13,507
I know what you're
going through, Sora.

202
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,609
I really do.

203
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:19,513
I was thinking, we
have so much in common,

204
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:21,781
we might even be friends.

205
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:24,651
You've got to decide who
you're going to believe.

206
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:29,756
Us or-- Sora!

207
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,658
Wait!

208
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,593
[laughter]

209
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:36,363
-Long time no see, little boy.

210
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,532
-Not you again.

211
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:41,535
-It's time to finish
this once and for all.

212
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:42,736
Haha.

213
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,038
Those lips of
yours will be mine.

214
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:48,942
This time, I'll make sure of it.

215
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:49,609
-Listen.

216
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:50,710
All of you.

217
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:54,247
-I am sorry, Asuma,
but we don't have time

218
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,449
to wax nostalgic
over this reunion.

219
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:02,923
-No.

220
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:05,725
You're not going
to use Limelight.

221
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,226
Wait!

222
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:06,726
Tou!

223
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:09,596
Saito!

224
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,067
Nauma!

225
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,902
-Don't interfere.

226
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,704
-Kitane.

227
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,806
-I have no other choice.

228
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,676
I've been restored to life
by a reanimation jutsu,

229
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,313
and I must obey the will
of he who cast the jutsu.

230
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:28,815
I'll kill anyone who interferes.

231
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:32,152
Even if that person
was a friend.

232
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:35,188
Very well, then.

233
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,124
-Ahh!

234
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:41,127
-You have grown old, Asuma!

235
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:46,199
[groans]

236
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,267
-Asuma!

237
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,768
-Asuma-sensei!

238
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,971
-Konohamaru said you'd be here.

239
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,973
-Who was that?

240
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,174
-Kitane.

241
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,676
One of the guardian
Shinobi 12 whose bodies

242
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,378
were stolen from
the hidden tombs.

243
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:00,447
-Wait, what are you saying?

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,183
-He and the others
were restored to life.

245
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,618
-Reanimation?

246
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:06,686
That's an advanced jutsu.

247
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,855
-But then, where
are the other three?

248
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:10,390
-They've gone to
take up positions

249
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,959
to the east, west, and
south of the village.

250
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,060
-Huh?

251
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,362
Why do you think they
split up like that?

252
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,696
What's their plan?

253
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,466
Of all the 12, these four had
the most powerful Lightning

254
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,935
Style jutsu.

255
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:24,771
They're planning to unleash
the Limelight, renowned

256
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,940
as the greatest and most
powerful Lightning Style

257
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:29,075
Jutsu of all time.

258
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:33,079
-What exactly is this Limelight?

259
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:37,984
-A jutsu whereby four people
in position to the north, west,

260
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:41,154
east, and south of an area
can incinerate everything

261
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:43,490
within that area in an instant.

262
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:46,393
The moment those
four are in position,

263
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:50,530
the village will be destroyed.

264
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,666
-It can't be.

265
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:53,933
-What do we do?

266
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:56,770
-Prevent the other three
from getting into position.

267
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,204
If you can stop
even one of them,

268
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,573
the jutsu can't be activated.

269
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:01,408
Go.

270
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,075
Yamato.

271
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:03,710
Sakura.

272
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,412
I'll take care of things here.

273
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,714
You go after the other three.

274
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,648
-Hmm.

275
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:09,783
-Understood.

276
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:10,650
-Now.

277
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,419
Having made that
boast, I'll have

278
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:15,221
to do my best to live
up to it somehow.

279
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:17,357
-You always were that way.

280
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,125
The more hopeless
your chances were,

281
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,562
the more eagerly you threw
yourself into the battle.

282
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,963
-And you.

283
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,666
You never made a move
without carefully calculating

284
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,569
every possible outcome, Kitane.

285
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:30,570
-True.

286
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:33,139
But in this case,
I have no choice.

287
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:35,575
I'm at the mercy of the jutsu.

288
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,342
Die, Asuma!

289
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:52,739
-Water Style!

290
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,141
Mouth of the Serpent!

291
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:55,075
-Woah.

292
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,077
Now it's water style?

293
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,145
-(VOICEOVER) That's right.

294
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,013
She can use all
five chakra natures.

295
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,119
Ahh!

296
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:08,021
[laughter]

297
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,959
-Oh, no.

298
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:15,129
After water comes--

299
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,530
-That's right.

300
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,932
A touch of a lightning!

301
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:22,903
[screaming]

302
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:25,973
[laughter]

303
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:05,312
[moaning]

304
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:12,819
[grunt]

305
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:16,356
-What's going on here?

306
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,258
-Where are the reinforcements?

307
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:18,959
-Come on.

308
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,260
You guys are pathetic.

309
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,262
We're going to have to
do this job on our own.

310
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:26,366
-That's right.

311
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,001
We are Shinobi of the Leaf.

312
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,204
Complaining is
strictly forbidden.

313
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:31,605
-Yeah, but even so.

314
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,975
If these guys keep
popping up like this--

315
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,311
We've got to find the
source of this jutsu.

316
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,446
-The village will be
buried under these things

317
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,514
soon if this continues.

318
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:41,114
[growl]

319
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,749
-Ahh!

320
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,618
There seems to be an
endless supply of them!

321
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,786
-You're telling me.

322
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,458
-Hey, what's going on?

323
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,293
Where's Shikamaru, anyway?

324
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,396
We thought he was supposed
to be helping us out, here.

325
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,199
-In a word, the
situation is grim.

326
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,335
From what we found
out, the enemy

327
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,537
can come and go as they
please through the defense

328
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,106
barrier, which
begs the question,

329
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,009
why concentrate all their
forces on the main gate in such

330
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,944
a big, splashy show of strength?

331
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,847
Unless, of course,
that's the whole point.

332
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,316
-In other words,
it's a diversion.

333
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,253
-I suspect another unit is
already secretly at work

334
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:19,987
elsewhere.

335
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,389
[approaching footsteps]

336
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:23,790
-We've got trouble!

337
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:26,727
The whole village is about
to be burnt to a crisp!

338
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,732
[gasp]

339
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:32,733
-(VOICEOVER) That's him.

340
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,237
Oh!

341
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,551
-Oh, no.

342
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,654
This jutsu again.

343
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,390
[laughter]

344
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,358
-That's right.

345
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,860
Amazing.

346
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,462
I can't believe
you're still alive.

347
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,398
-Seeing is believing.

348
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:05,465
-Ha!

349
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,135
Well, this time I'll
finish you for sure.

350
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:11,038
-Huh!

351
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,506
-Grr!

352
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,876
[gulp]

353
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:23,183
[roar]

354
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,051
-Ahh!

355
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:24,551
Oh.

356
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:38,999
[laughter]

357
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:45,972
[gulp]

358
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,386
-What is this?

359
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:04,391
-Hmm.

360
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,196
What a shame.

361
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:12,399
I was so hoping for a
reunion with the young man

362
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:13,333
I met before.

363
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,068
I despise girls.

364
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,036
[gasp]

365
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:16,970
-Oh, no.

366
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:19,272
I feel a chill.

367
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,708
-You're so annoying.

368
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:27,047
[screaming]

369
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,515
[laughter]

370
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:31,518
-I could leave you to fry
with the rest of them.

371
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,920
But I'd rather do it myself.

372
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:37,624
Lightning Style.

373
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,059
Earth Flash!

374
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:39,559
-Augh!

375
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:46,833
[laughter]

376
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,935
-It won't be long now, will it?

377
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,004
Before those lips
of yours are mine.

378
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,716
-What's the matter
with you, Asuma?

379
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,352
I thought you meant to stop me.

380
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,953
If you can't do
better than that,

381
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:11,024
your village is as good as lost.

382
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:15,762
Show me you can do
it, Asuma, or die.

383
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,834
-Where are you?

384
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,002
Come out.

385
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,503
We have to talk.

386
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,337
-Over here.

387
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:28,575
Ahh!

388
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,246
-Yao.

389
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,915
-Furido.

390
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:36,983
It's time we had a talk.

391
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:37,918
-Hmm.

392
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,786
Before that, don't
you want to take

393
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,888
a look at the Leaf village?

394
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,523
Check out the fireworks.

395
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,491
Aren't they lovely?

396
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:44,991
-Huh?

397
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,508
What are those lights?

398
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,145
-Well, you see, when those
four lights get into position,

399
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:07,080
the village will vanish.

400
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:10,050
-Then you really do mean to
destroy the Leaf village.

401
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,618
-Yes.

402
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:13,620
It will burn.

403
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:18,291
The Leaf will be burned
away by the light.

404
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:30,048
[theme music - in japanese]

405
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:59,938
-The latest word is
that our attempts

406
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:02,607
to turn back the undead
invaders are failing.

407
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,642
It's only a matter of
time before our defenses

408
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:05,843
are overrun.

409
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:07,579
-What about reinforcements?

410
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:09,981
-I've already sent Kiba,
Ino, Chogi, and Lee,

411
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:11,816
but they're heavily outnumbered.

412
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:12,750
-Unlike us.

413
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:15,119
The enemy has
unlimited resources.

414
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,221
-We'll eventually be
overwhelmed, unless we

415
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,490
can find whoever's
casting the jutsu.

416
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:20,592
-Lady Tsunade.

417
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,161
I request permission
to join the front line.

418
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:24,128
-Next time.

419
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,364
Everyone Struggle to the Death.
