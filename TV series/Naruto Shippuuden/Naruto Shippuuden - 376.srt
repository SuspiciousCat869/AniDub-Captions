[chuckling]

2
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,413
{\an1}I'm sure this will surprise
all of those inefficient

3
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:34,615
Akatsuki.

4
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:51,130
[laughter]

5
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,902
{\an1}It's overloading, Lord
Orochimaru! The whole

6
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,970
{\an1}system's going to collapse!

7
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,907
It's fine!
Excellent, in fact!

8
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,610
[gasp]

9
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:09,581
Yes, yes!

10
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,321
{\an1}Now rise, my creation! Take
the Nine Tails from the

11
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,055
{\an1}child of the Fourth!

12
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,591
{\an1}It's out of control!

13
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:23,326
{\an1}You'll be the ultimate
being, one that surpasses

14
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,094
the Jinchuriki!

15
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,698
{\an1}What-? What are you doing?

16
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,636
{\an1}No, I created you!
I am your master!

17
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:36,939
[roaring]

18
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,510
Lord Orochimaru!

19
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,647
[angry growling]

20
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,751
{\an1}I'd come so far...

21
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:52,621
{\an1}Please, Lord Orochimaru!

22
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:55,089
{\an1}Come with me! Let's
get out of here!

23
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,763
{\an1}Curse that Orochimaru...

24
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,300
{\an1}Not only did he desert the
Akatsuki, he stole the inner

25
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,236
{\an1}workings of the Gedo Statue
and made this thing.

26
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,005
{\an1}So is this really
for capturing the

27
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,206
Tailed Beast?

28
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,242
I wasn't able to
ascertain all of its tricks,

29
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:55,012
{\an1}but I was able to
restore its mobility.

30
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:58,914
{\an1}And I also added a couple of
additional features.

31
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,624
{\an1}This thing is now
ours to control.

32
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,528
{\an1}Itachi, go and capture
the Nine Tails.

33
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:29,477
{\an1}[determined yell]

34
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,527
You haven't seen
the village in ages.

35
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,394
Don't you want
to say hello?

36
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,463
{\an1}I'm not interested
right now.

37
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:05,677
{\an1}All right, all right! Here
comes the assorted offal

38
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:08,313
{\an1}plate! Oh, and waitress?

39
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,348
Yes?

40
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,048
Another plate of
skirt steak and loin!

41
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:12,249
{\an1}Skirt steak and loin! Okay!

42
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:13,819
{\an1}Oh, one more thing...
can you please

43
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,186
{\an1}take these plates?

44
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,354
Sure thing!

45
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,922
{\an1}You know, you guys.

46
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,124
{\an1}Even if this is supposed to
be Asuma's treat, I don't

47
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:21,826
{\an1}think that it's nice
to start before our

48
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:23,361
{\an1}host even gets here!

49
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,894
I'm just saying
that it's wrong.

50
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,364
Eh, don't worry!

51
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:29,600
{\an1}Who are we kidding? He
probably just stopped by

52
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:32,335
{\an1}Kurenai Sensei's place
and forgot all about us.

53
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:35,338
{\an1}You know, Kakashi Sensei
supposedly hasn't left

54
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:38,441
{\an1}Naruto's side at all for
even a minute!

55
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:41,711
{\an1}Seriously, Naruto really
has been trying hard.

56
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:45,447
{\an1}[chuckle] Yeah I guess
that's true, but...

57
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,349
For Naruto,
it's more like...

58
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:51,854
{\an1}Ninja Art: Beast Mimicry!
Man Beast Clone!

59
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,491
Fang Over Fang!

60
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:03,197
{\an1}I am not going to lose to
him! Fang Over Fang!

61
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:10,772
{\an1}I'm ready now. I could leave
at a moment's notice. The

62
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,274
{\an1}reason is because I'm tired
of being left behind.

63
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,380
Even if I can't
stand next to him...

64
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:23,683
{\an1}I still want to get to the
point where I can follow

65
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,585
{\an1}close behind Naruto.

66
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,822
You made Food
Pills today, too?

67
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,724
{\an1}I thought I'd cheer
him on by giving him

68
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,626
{\an1}some nutrition at least.

69
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,828
You can have
one if you want!

70
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,228
No, thank you.

71
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,100
{\an1}You're holding up
pretty well. Why do

72
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,335
{\an1}you go so far for him?

73
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,904
[chuckle]

74
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:55,680
{\an1}[determined yells]

75
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,621
I'm counting on
you, Yamato.

76
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:06,289
{\an1}You have to keep the Nine
Tails' chakra inside of

77
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,957
Naruto in check.

78
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,693
{\an1}So far, at least, it's
remaining stable.

79
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,995
{\an1}[determined yell]

80
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,767
{\an1}Come on! I can't be wasting
all of my time like this!

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,368
{\an1}I've got to keep going...

82
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,772
{\an1}I've got to keep going!

83
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,707
More!

84
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,893
Go to Naruto!

85
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,872
What happened?!

86
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,406
{\an1}Is everybody okay?!

87
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,007
{\an1}[gasp] This is...

88
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,915
{\an1}Hey, who are you?!
[attacking yell]

89
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,053
{\an1}If that is the case, I -

90
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,388
{\an1}This is bad news!

91
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,759
Naruto!

92
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,465
{\an1}Hurry! You've gotta
come quickly! Please!

93
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,174
{\an1}Whoa, even Neji's
having trouble!

94
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,777
{\an1}Who the hell are you?

95
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,651
How dare you
attack my village?!

96
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,051
For that, you're
going down!

97
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,854
{\an1}You must be careful!
He's really strong!

98
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:55,424
{\an1}He is! Even I was no
match for him at all!

99
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:57,292
{\an1}Gotcha. But still...

100
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,528
{\an1}I'm in the middle of
training, and I'm busy, so I

101
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:01,329
{\an1}won't waste any time on him!

102
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,899
{\an1}I'm gonna take care
of him with one blow!

103
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,201
{\an1}Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

104
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,911
Get ready!

[attacking yell]

106
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,287
He is strong!

107
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,223
Why you!

108
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,298
[gasps]

109
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:02,820
Naruto?

110
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:06,290
{\an1}He certainly looks like
Naruto! Our friend is a

111
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,092
Mecha-Naruto!

112
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,325
He's no friend!

113
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:10,293
Naruto!

114
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,262
Stop! This is a
one-on-one match!

115
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,733
{\an1}All right... Hey!
Mecha-me!

116
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,167
{\an1}Tell me who made you!

117
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,105
{\an1}There's no way that I'm
gonna lose to a fake- Huh?!

118
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,107
What?!
Hold on...

119
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,508
{\an1}I'm losing all my
Nine Tails' Chakra!

120
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,178
{\an1}Hey! Quit it! Just what do
you think you're doing?!

121
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:39,087
{\an1}Look, Kakashi! That guy is
extracting the Nine Tails'

122
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,223
{\an1}chakra pulling it
right out of Naruto!

123
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:45,027
{\an1}If this continues, against
the enormous power

124
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,129
{\an1}of the Nine Tails'
Chakra, Naruto will--

125
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,397
{\an1}This is not good.

126
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,434
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

127
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:58,805
{\an1}What?! It's so tiny!

128
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:01,174
{\an1}Damn it! Mini Rasengan!

129
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,310
{\an1}My strength is gone.

130
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,813
Lightning Blade!

131
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,419
{\an1}The flow of Nine Tails'
chakra has stopped.

132
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,020
Yes, of course!

133
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,922
{\an1}To extract the Nine
Tails' chakra, he needs

134
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,891
{\an1}to be within range.

135
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:21,927
{\an1}All right, then! We'll draw
Naruto away from him!

136
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,591
What's going on?

137
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,461
{\an1}Don't worry, it's okay. The
ANBU are the only ones who

138
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:01,097
{\an1}know about this secret
underground passageway.

139
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,867
{\an1}Damn that guy! I'm not
kidding!

140
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,668
{\an1}I'm gonna pulverize him!

141
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,138
He found us?!

142
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,740
{\an1}He's probably just
attacking blindly.

143
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:15,009
{\an1}Just let me go after him,
Kakashi Sensei! Otherwise,

144
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,444
{\an1}the entire village
could be torn to pieces!

145
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,893
[scared screams]

146
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,899
{\an1}You're right, Kakashi.
He's simply attacking

147
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,168
{\an1}anything in sight.

148
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,937
{\an1}Naruto, you won't be
able to beat him.

149
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:46,906
For now, it's
best to retreat.

150
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:00,919
No!

151
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,486
{\an1}Look at that destruction!

152
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,194
I'm telling you,
I'll win for sure!

153
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,395
{\an1}Just listen. He isn't
only taking Nine Tails'

154
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:12,830
Chakra from you!

155
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:15,598
{\an1}Neji used his Byakugan to
look inside that guy's body

156
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,534
{\an1}and saw what appears
to be the Eight

157
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,469
{\an1}Signed Sealing Formula.

158
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:22,639
{\an1}Which means that thing's
also a vessel to seal and

159
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,574
{\an1}hold the Nine Tails.

160
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,577
{\an1}We think he intends to
siphon off your chakra,

161
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,246
{\an1}weaken you, and then
capture Nine Tails.

162
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,748
{\an1}In other words, if
Nine Tails is taken

163
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:34,716
{\an1}from you, you will die.

164
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,154
{\an1}It's a replacement
vessel for Naruto.

165
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,590
{\an1}But to make it so it
looks just like Naruto,

166
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:43,792
{\an1}that's just morbid.

167
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,160
Damn it!

168
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,462
{\an1}After he lost sight of you,
Naruto, he disappeared.

169
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:52,733
{\an1}His whereabouts are unknown,
but he's sure to appear when

170
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,402
{\an1}you show up again.

171
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,206
{\an1}And then the village will
become a battlefield!

172
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,576
{\an1}What are you tryin' to say?

173
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,045
{\an1}Naruto, leave the village!

174
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:06,980
{\an1}You wanna get rid of me?

175
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:08,215
Be quiet!

176
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:09,316
[gasp]

177
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:10,717
Let me finish!

178
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,287
{\an1}We'll use Naruto to lure
that guy out of the village

179
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,589
{\an1}and then bring him down.

180
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:21,694
{\an1}However, we can't let Naruto
get close. Can you do it?

181
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:23,963
{\an1}That's a tough question...

182
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,198
{\an1}We don't have a choice!

183
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,433
{\an1}Naturally, we need
Yamato to control

184
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,102
{\an1}the Nine Tails' chakra.

185
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,471
{\an1}So besides me, we'll need
Sensory type ninja and

186
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,907
specialists in
long-range combat.

187
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:38,343
[eager bark]

188
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,718
{\an1}Man, what a snazzy cart! I
didn't know you rode on

189
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,420
{\an1}something so fancy,
Granny Tsunade!

190
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:53,389
{\an1}The Feudal Lord gave it to
me for diplomatic purposes.

191
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:56,559
{\an1}But it isn't my style, so
I've never used it.

192
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:00,463
{\an1}Yamato, ride in the
palanquin with Naruto,

193
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:02,098
{\an1}suppress the Nine
Tails' chakra, and

194
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,900
{\an1}don't let it leak out.

195
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,101
Got it.

196
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:07,637
{\an1}But still, if he's in close
enough proximity, the

197
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,373
{\an1}chakra's gonna leak out
no matter what I do.

198
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:13,209
Then I won't let
it get near him.

199
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,810
That's why
we're here!

200
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,113
Huh?!

201
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:22,918
Shikamaru!

202
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,252
Hey!

203
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,054
Neji! Choji!

204
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:29,456
{\an1}All of us from way back
then are together again!

205
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,158
Kiba!

206
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,260
{\an1}So, tell me, are you
surprised, or what?!

207
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:36,730
{\an1}Well, I knew you were gonna
be here, but sure, whatever.

208
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,631
Uh...

209
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,402
{\an1}You do want to get back to
training, right, Naruto?

210
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,502
Huh?!

211
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,072
{\an1}It'll be a real drag, but
we're gonna help you out.

212
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,579
{\an1}How come I'm stuck in this
cramped space with you,

213
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,982
Yamato Sensei?

214
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,716
{\an1}I was about to say
the same thing.

215
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:00,286
What?! We're
cart-bearers?!

216
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,723
{\an1}This Mecha -nized-
"Mecha-Naruto..."

217
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:09,061
{\an1}Until you destroy it, don't
even think about returning!

218
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,628
Now, go!

219
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,367
{\an1}Yeah! You ready for
this, Mecha-Naruto?!

220
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,309
{\an1}I just knew that I was going
to be left behind again...

221
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,244
{\an1}And the reason is because
my beetles told me so.

222
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,616
{\an1}[determined yell]

223
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,253
It's coming!

224
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:39,755
He can fly?!

225
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:48,764
[screaming]

226
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,676
He just fired
off a big one!

227
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,811
This is bad!
As in, not good!

228
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:05,380
Leave it to me!

229
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:06,646
Shino?!

230
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,116
{\an1}The reason is because
I've had it with

231
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:09,750
{\an1}being the only one...

232
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:11,818
Shino!

233
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,354
...left behind!

234
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:21,927
[chuckle]

235
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,181
Aw, come on,
keep it together!

236
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:44,783
{\an1}I can't take that
face of yours!

237
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,751
{\an1}I'm okay. I'm not sick.
I'm really not sick!

238
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:49,054
Really?!

239
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:54,958
{\an1}He's one hundred fifty
meters above us,

240
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,427
{\an1}dropping Mecha Bombs!

241
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:59,997
The forest! Run
into the forest!

242
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,307
Kakashi Sensei,
switch with me!

243
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,775
What is it?

244
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,377
We'll bring him
down with shadows!

245
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,029
{\an1}Well, he certainly
isn't holding back!

246
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,067
{\an1}That's it, come on.
Just keep firing!

247
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:42,336
{\an1}Come on, bring it!

248
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:51,611
{\an1}Shadow Possession Jutsu!

249
00:19:59,252 --> 00:19:59,985
It worked!

250
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:01,620
And now...

251
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:02,621
Ninja Art!

252
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,756

253
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,268
Huh?

254
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,374
[screaming]

255
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:29,147
{\an1}The shadow broke!

256
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:48,831
{\an1}I'm gonna need more
shadows and a nap.

257
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:53,602
[cough]

258
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,475
Shikamaru!

259
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,777
Mecha Naruto!
He's coming!

260
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,246
{\an1}Inside the cart's more
dangerous than outside!

261
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,954
Shizune, request
assistance from the Sand.

262
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:17,024
{\an1}Tell them Naruto's
in trouble!

263
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,593
We will not let
Mecha-Naruto get him!
