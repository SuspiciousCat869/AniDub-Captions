00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:35,769
{\an1}No, this is just a silly novel
that Jiraiya gave to me.

00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,705
Oh...you mean another in
the "Make Out" series?

{\an1}Actually, no. This one's
a little different.

00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,778
{\an1}It's about Naruto, Sasuke, and
the rest of the young generation
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

10
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,747
{\an1}It's actually a good read...

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,016
To be honest, I
can't put it down!

Oh, is that so?

13
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,486
Well, in any event, what
would you like to do
about your dinner?

14
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,023
{\an1}I'm at a really good
part right now...

15
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,392
{\an1}Would you like me to have your
dinner brought out here to you?

00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,593
{\an1}Sure! I'd appreciate that.

Alright. It'll
be just a moment.

{\an1}Now, then... where
did I leave off...?

How do you know
about my father?

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,384
And why would you want
us to change the laws
of the Hidden Leaf?

21
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,986
{\an1}Dissatisfaction is common
throughout the Shinobi World.

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,224
{\an1}If we first change the Five
Great Nations and their most
influential village, the Leaf

23
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:40,794
{\an1}...then the entire
Shinobi World will change.

24
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:45,765
{\an4}Are you telling me that you can
really change the laws of a
village as great as the Hidden
Leaf?

25
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:50,302
{\an1}Yes.  But to do so I need
collaborators to help.

occurred while we were fighting
a few of the Leaf Genin.

this before, remember?

86

inside your mother, and sealed
the other half in you.

that was because...

00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,282
{\an1}Yes... But that isn't the

{\an3}Huh!?

92
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,423
{\an4}I sealed the other half of Nine
Tails inside you because I had
faith that you'd be able to
master the use of its power.

{\an3}[gasp]

in this clearing.

Asuma and Team Kurenai have
probably joined up.

00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,662

us, shouldn't we head back
to the Leaf Village?

111
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:28,765
{\an1}Look, we weren't assigned this
mission because of our fighting
abilities.

112
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,838
{\an7}Lord Fourth chose us because
the younger we are, the harder
it is for the enemy to use their
jutsu on us.

113
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:40,309
{\an7}That's why he ordered us to
return to the village
immediately without engaging

or their numbers...

117
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,352

our fighting power.

the others who went to
rescue their teammates?

{\an1}I wonder if Tenten's with him.

144
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,217
{\an1}Yeah, she is, she's following
right behind him now.

145
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,722
{\an1}They're on the same team, but
she's gotta be going out of her
mind trying to keep up with Lee.

146
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:49,157
Oh yeah, I'll bet!

147
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:51,293
{\an1}What's Neji doing?

148
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:55,196
{\an1}If Neji's around, then Lee
won't be able to do
whatever he wants to do.

149
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:56,564
{\an1}The reason is, because--

150
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:59,967
{\an1}The thing is, I'm not picking
up Neji's scent now...

151
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:18,651
No.  Wait...
Neji is there...

152
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,620
{\an1}I can see him near
Sasuke and Sakura.

153
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,055
{\an1}Is he alone?

154
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,522
{\an1}What about Naruto?

155
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,258
{\an1}No, I'm not seeing Naruto
anywhere now...

156
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,293
{\an1}But it's weird... How
can I explain this?

157
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:32,764
{\an1}It's like Neji's inside
something hazy...

158
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,532
{\an1}And there's someone who's
standing right there next
to him.

159
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,267
{\an1}Is there anyone else?

160
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:47,543
{\an1}There's someone near Sakura and
Sasuke! And they're lurking
around!

{\an1}[gasp]

162
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:30,115
{\an1}That's Sasuke and Sakura.
They're two of my comrades from
the Hidden Leaf Village.

163
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:33,684
{\an1}Then see for yourself what
they're really like.

164
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,489
{\an1}What's up, Sasuke?

165
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,092
Just be quiet.

What does that mean?

180
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:15,909
{\an1}Well, I'm not entirely certain,
but it probably means that the
enemy is still detaining Neji.

181

{\an1}There's no mistake...

all making their way to where
