one more time!

{\an1}Attacking the me

00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,044
{\an7}<i>I can't use</i>
<i>Particle Style</i>
<i>now!</i>

291
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,646
{\an7}<i>Then I have</i>
<i>no choice.</i>

292
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,582
{\an7}<i>I'll just have to</i>
<i>smash it to pieces!</i>

293
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:45,820
{\an7}<i>Earth Style!</i>
<i>Stone Fist</i>
<i>Jutsu!</i>

294
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,789
{\an1}Just one problem.

295
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,128
{\an1}[pained groan]

296
00:19:55,162 --> 00:20:00,132
{\an4}A weak punch like that
isn't going to be enough,
little Ohnoki. Put some
power into it!

297
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,136
{\an4}You're not using
Particle Style,
you must be out
of juice.

298
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,542
{\an4}You forget that I'm
not that Lil' Ohnoki
from long ago that
you made fun of.

299
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:11,509
{\an1}Huh?

300
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,079
{\an1}Earth Style..

301
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,314
{\an1}Super Weighted
Boulder Jutsu!

302
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,150
{\an1}Not bad, Ohnoki!
Not bad at all!

303
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:27,925
{\an1}Oh, no!
I've done
it now!

304
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,961
{\an1}The genjutsu's
undone.

305
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:38,001
{\an1}[struggling]
My back!

306
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:43,438
{\an1}In my heart, I always
knew you'd become
Tsuchikage one day.

307
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:47,643
{\an1}[struggling groan]

308
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:52,480
{\an4}But just look at you now!
You're nothing more than
a stubborn old fool with
a bad back!

309
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:58,919
{\an4}I'll admit that punch
had some real power to it,
but you overdid it and put
yourself out of commission!

310
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:01,187
{\an1}Hey! Hurry up and
escape, would ya?!

311
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:04,058
{\an1}This is the Hozuki
Clan's Water Gun
Jutsu!

312
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,825
{\an1}[pained groan]

313
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,128
{\an1}Go on! I can't
stop myself!

314
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,330
{\an4}(Temari)
No matter how many
times we attack,
there's no effect!

315
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:03,699
{\an1}We haven't inflicted
any damage!

316
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:06,267
{\an4}(Dodai)
We need a
more powerful
Wind Style User.

317
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,370
{\an4}(Temari)
Well, I'm not a half bad
Wind Style user myself,
you know.

318
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:12,673
{\an1}Honestly, in the Allied
Forces, there isn't a
stronger one.

319
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:15,375
{\an1}(Naruto)
Yeah, there is!
Me!

320
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:18,946
{\an1}Next time on
Naruto Shippuden:
"Paradox"

321
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,116
{\an1}(Temari)
Is it a new Rasengan?
It just might work!
