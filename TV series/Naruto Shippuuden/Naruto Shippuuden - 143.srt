1
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,840
{\an1}- Let's do this and shut up
this witless pain in the ear.

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
{\an1}-That is the plan.

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,674
-Check it.

4
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:57,408
{\an1}I'm not witless, yo.

5
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,642
{\an1}I got super rhymes and
charming flow, fool.

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,877
{\an1}-Oh, what a joke.

7
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:04,545
{\an1}Not to mention, he's got
absolutely zero rapping talent.

8
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:05,145
-Hold up, fool.

9
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,378
{\an1}No need to be cruel.

10
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:06,445
-Be quiet!

11
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,063
[mumbling]

12
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:16,108
{\an1}-I'm feelin' hella fine.

13
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,643
{\an1}I just wrote the fattest rhyme.

14
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:20,844
Thank you.

15
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,111
{\an1}Now, I'll play with you tools,
you teensy weensy baby fools.

16
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,414
{\an1}-Watch out, Sasuke.

17
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:31,247
{\an1}This guy is clearly
used to handling blades.

18
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:31,981
{\an1}He's no ordinary ninja.

19
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,653
-Ha ha ha.

20
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:46,555
{\an1}Quickly take a look 'cuz now
I give you a taste of my hook.

21
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,689
[theme music]

22
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,334
-What...

23
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,735
{\an1}-The hell... What's that stance?

24
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,194
{\an1}-Sasuke, are you all right?

25
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,929
{\an1}- What is up with
those moves of his?

26
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,463
{\an1}I can predict his
line of attack.

27
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:43,596
-Hm.

28
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,566
{\an1}SUIGETSU: The Chidori blade.

29
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,200
{\an1}He's going to use
something that's

30
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,567
{\an1}impossible to defend against.

31
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,239
-No way.

32
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:11,475
He blocked it.

33
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,242
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): He can
stream his chakra too.

34
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,445
{\an1}- First, I'm gonna float
and fly like a butterfly.

35
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:26,382
{\an1}Then I'll sting you
like a killer bee.

36
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,253
-Sasuke!

37
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,088
{\an1}- And end my flow
with a killer blow.

38
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,462
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
He also uses

39
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,262
{\an1}lightning style, my weakness.

40
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:13,569
-Hold on.

41
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:13,669
-Yah.

42
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,143
-Sasuke.

43
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,780
{\an1}This is not good.

44
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,881
Here, quickly.

45
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,214
{\an1}Hurry up and bite me.

46
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,549
Do it.

47
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:46,449
Ahhh!

48
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,626
{\an1}KILLER B (VOICEOVER): He
funneled the lightning style up

49
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:12,393
{\an1}through his body and
deflected my attack.

50
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:15,227
{\an1}That's how he avoided
mortal injury.

51
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,329
And that woman
possesses the ability

52
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,529
{\an1}to heal others letting
them suck her chakra.

53
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,132
{\an1}-Thanks for that, Karin.

54
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,300
-Yeah, sure.

55
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,535
{\an1}- Sasuke, the three of
us will take care of him.

56
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:36,037
{\an1}The fact is this guy's
incredibly strong,

57
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,438
{\an1}so we better go at them as
if we are trying to kill him.

58
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:40,739
{\an1}That might be our best
chance of taking him

59
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:40,872
{\an1}while he's still alive.

60
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:48,875
{\an1}-This battle's not over.

61
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,043
{\an1}Gotta stop these foes.

62
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:50,776
{\an1}Check it out, yo!

63
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:08,918
-Gotcha.

64
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,018
Sasuke, now.

65
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,885
{\an1}Just hit both of us.

66
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,786
-Chidori.

67
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:13,886
-Ahhh!

68
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:34,929
-He's gone.

69
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:35,729
Where is he?

70
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,698
- They're puny,
but so bothersome.

71
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:42,665
I'm done.

72
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,532
Goin' home.

73
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:44,532
{\an1}Gonna get my drink on, son.

74
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:44,432
Yeah.

75
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:47,767
-Karin.

76
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:48,267
-I know.

77
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,903
He's over there.

78
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:55,871
{\an1}KILLER B (VOICEOVER): So she's
also a sensory type, huh?

79
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,874
-Got no choice.

80
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:05,208
{\an1}Here comes the Eight.

81
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:05,341
Woo!

82
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,817
{\an1}SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Here it comes.

83
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:28,685
{\an1}It's just like that day.

84
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,958
{\an1}- Oh, he's the first to
dodge my Eight Tailed

85
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:44,190
{\an1}form since my brother.

86
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:49,794
-Damn it.

87
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,193
He's after them.

88
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,628
{\an1}-Yo, I'll squash y'all flat.

89
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:53,194
Split splat.

90
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,771
-You all right?

91
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,537
{\an1}-I think, more or less.

92
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,641
{\an1}- It definitely has
speed and power,

93
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,076
{\an1}but he only moves
in a linear fashion.

94
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,810
{\an1}So with my eyes, I should
be able to see him coming.

95
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,611
Karin,
I need you to read his chakra

96
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:33,112
{\an1}and anticipate his
moves for me now.

97
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:35,047
{\an1}Stay on him and keep
relaying his location to us

98
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,180
{\an1}at all times, you understand?

99
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,682
{\an1}- If you really think
you can keep up.

100
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,415
-No, look out!

101
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,484
{\an1}KILLER B (VOICEOVER):
Those eyes.

102
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:50,887
{\an1}The Sharingan genjutsu, huh?

103
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:51,520
Can't move.

104
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:08,260
-Lariat!

105
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:20,298
-Sasuke!

106
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,803
What?

107
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:32,104
What is this?

108
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,105
{\an1}- His neck and chest have
been seriously injured as well

109
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:34,337
{\an1}as the organs beneath.

110
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:45,643
{\an1}He's beyond our help.

111
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:46,711
{\an1}- In a way, Sasuke is
like my reincarnation.

112
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:52,279
-Hang in there.

113
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,979
{\an1}-Karin, don't worry.

114
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:55,147
I'll do it.

115
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,381
{\an1}You don't have enough
chakra to deal with this.

116
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:58,716
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): What
are you going to do?

117
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,716
{\an1}-I'm going to merge with him.

118
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,818
{\an1}I'll share my body and chakra.

119
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:05,985
{\an1}Since his body is compatible
with my curse mark,

120
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,885
it should work.

121
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,689
{\an1}- In order to break the hold
of the genjutsu, what you need

122
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:16,989
{\an1}is a partner that can agitate
their chakra and wake you up

123
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:19,091
from it.

124
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,559
{\an1}My partner is the Eight
Tails that's inside of me.

125
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,259
{\an1}Genjutsu doesn't work
on Jinjuriki hosts who

126
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,828
have control of
their tailed beast.

127
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,929
You're losing.

128
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,830
{\an1}Then I obliterate, and then
y'all, I shall annihilate.

129
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,396
{\an1}My true mode as the
Eight Tails abode

130
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,898
{\an1}is now going to unfold, yo.

131
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,165
It's a monster.

132
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,399
See, I told ya.

133
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,834
{\an1}Whole transformation, yo.

134
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:40,967
Oh ya.

135
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:08,444
{\an1}Eight Tails will make you pee
your pants, you little ants.

136
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,882
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): Such chakra.

137
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:19,249
{\an1}Is this even possible?

138
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:21,383
{\an1}-That's Eight Tails?

139
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,784
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
A monster ox.

140
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:27,319
{\an1}So this is his true form, huh?

141
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:28,553
{\an1}-Just me and my bones.

142
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,021
{\an1}I was born a glorious longhorn.

143
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:30,321
Wee!

144
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,190
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): His
chakra's off the charts.

145
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,491
{\an1}We'll die if we stay here.

146
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:38,357
{\an1}-Jugo, are you done yet?

147
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:48,461
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER):
Thank goodness.

148
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,130
He's alive.

149
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,097
{\an1}-Good, you're conscious.

150
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,498
{\an1}Come on, you've got to get up.

151
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,564
{\an1}Jugo, we need to...

152
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:56,332
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): He
turned into a child?

153
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:57,766
Why?

154
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,134
-Jugo.

155
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,235
{\an1}-I won't let you die.

156
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,102
{\an1}You're a memento of Kimimoro.

157
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,302
-Come on, hurry.

158
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:08,071
We gotta run.

159
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:08,370
-Weee!

160
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,940
{\an1}You're a water style shinobi.

161
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,274
I knew it.

162
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,609
{\an1}You think you have
the advantage?

163
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,010
{\an1}-I'll take over, you guys.

164
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,376
{\an1}Just run while you can.

165
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:28,246
{\an1}-Thanks Suigetsu.

166
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:29,312
{\an1}-Let's go Sasuke.

167
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,681
{\an1}SUIGETSU (VOICEOVER):
Who would have

168
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:36,949
{\an1}thought I'd end up
sacrificing myself again just

169
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:37,449
{\an1}to save their hides?

170
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:44,052
- Yo,
I'm not lettin' you get away

171
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,187
{\an1}with that this late in the
game, fools.

172
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:45,453
You fools.

173
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,422
{\an1}-That really doesn't look good.

174
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,435
{\an1}- That looks like...
is that Lord Killer B's?

175
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:25,904
{\an1}-Wh... what is it, Sensei?

176
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:26,336
-Let's go.

177
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:26,503
-Yes sir.

178
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:32,773
But that's...

179
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:42,911
{\an1}- Killer B. Why'd he
transform into Eight Tails?

180
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,078
I thought Lord
Raikage had forbidden

181
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:44,912
{\an1}him to take that form.

182
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:45,878
-Wait.

183
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,312
Look over there.

184
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,080
{\an1}He's been fighting with someone.

185
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,782
{\an1}-Those robes, Akatsuki.

186
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,415
{\an1}The same ones who
kidnapped Yugito.

187
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,652
{\an1}- I can't believe
Suigetsu's all messed up.

188
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,418
{\an1}We can't escape now.

189
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:02,820
{\an1}What are we gonna do?

190
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:23,795
{\an1}Hurry up and bite me.

191
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:24,528
Do it.

192
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,564
{\an1}-I won't let you die.

193
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:33,732
{\an1}You're a memento of Kimimoro.

194
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,166
{\an1}-I'll take over, you guys.

195
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,834
{\an1}Just run while you can.

196
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,502
-Haaa!

197
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:42,803
{\an1}KARIN: He's coming.

198
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:49,438
Amaterasu.

199
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,477
{\an1}JUGO (VOICEOVER): So those
are the inextinguishable black

200
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:04,478
{\an1}flames Sasuke spoke of.

201
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:10,447
{\an1}KARIN (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

202
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:46,463
{\an1}SASUKE: Karin, run!

203
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,235
{\an1}Damn, the black flames.

204
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,935
{\an1}-It's too late for her now.

205
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,468
We need to get
away from here fast

206
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,136
{\an1}before we get caught in it too.

207
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:01,970
-Wait, Jugo.

208
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,070
-We can't.

209
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:08,472
SASUKE: Karin.

210
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:28,781
-What?

211
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,949
But how?

212
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:32,950
{\an1}-Jugo, grab Karin.

213
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,050
Hurry!

214
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,587
{\an1}- The black flames
have been extinguished.

215
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:44,554
{\an1}How is that possible?

216
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:50,924
{\an1}SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I
was able to extinguish

217
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,725
{\an1}the black flames of Amaterasu.

218
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,560
{\an1}Is this another power of
the Mangekyo Sharingan?

219
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:06,597
{\an1}In which case... Ahhh.

220
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:17,769
{\an1}In which case... Ahhh.

221
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:20,603
- Eight Tails,
seems he's barely alive.

222
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,437
{\an1}SASUKE: Then we did
manage to take him down

223
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,604
{\an1}without killing him.

224
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:24,038
{\an1}Let's grab him and go.

225
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:30,440
{\an1}- No, don't tell me they
actually defeated Lord Killer B?

226
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,242
{\an1}-It must be some mistake.

227
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:34,210
{\an1}We've got to go help him.

228
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,643
{\an1}- Those guys down there are
members of the Akatsuki,

229
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,044
don't be hasty.

230
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:38,111
Wait, is that...

231
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,379
-What is it?

232
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,946
A Uchiha crest.

233
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,680
-Uchiha?

234
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,180
{\an1}- It would be useless
for us to engage them,

235
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,547
{\an1}so we should report
this to Lord Raikage

236
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,749
{\an1}and let him deal with it.

237
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,483
{\an1}- When he here's what happened
to his younger brother,

238
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,918
{\an1}knowing how he is,
he'll be furious.

239
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,523
- You must be
exhausted after that.

240
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:09,858
You've lost
Orochimaru's curse mark

241
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,226
{\an1}and you haven't yet healed
yet from battling Itachi.

242
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:14,860
-I know.

243
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
{\an1}I really didn't expect that we'd
have such a fight on our hands

244
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,662
today.

245
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:19,162
{\an1}But it's done now.

246
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:34,534

247
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:54,543
[theme music]

248
00:21:54,543 --> 00:22:14,551

00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:34,560
[theme music]

250
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:56,370
[theme music]

251
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,670
{\an1}LADY KATSUYU: I've been
waiting for you all to arrive.

252
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,771
{\an1}KAKASHI: Lady Katsuyu,
what are you doing here?

253
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,671
{\an1}LADY KATSUYU: It's an emergency.

254
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,039
{\an1}Mount Katsuragi's
barrier has been broken.

255
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,873
KAKASHI: What?

256
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:06,874
{\an1}What of the Tsuchigumo clan?

257
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,774
{\an1}LADY KATSUYU: Time
is of the essence.

258
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:11,476
{\an1}Under the secret treaty
made by the third Hogake,

259
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,677
{\an1}Team 7 will immediately head
out to the location with Yamato

260
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:16,778
as team captain.

261
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,746
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on Naruto
Shippuden, "Wanderer."

262
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,680
{\an1}It's an all new mission.
