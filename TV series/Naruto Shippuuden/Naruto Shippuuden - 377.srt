Nine Tails'
Chakra is leaking!

25
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,137
{\an1}I was trying not to hurl, so
I used Nine Tails' Chakra...

26
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,276
{\an1}And what were you
doing all this time?!

Sorry...

{\an1}He's coming, Neji!

my ability to search out the

{\an1}Just Let me fight,
too, Kakashi Sensei!

45
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,879
{\an1}If the two of us just
team up, I know that

46
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,717
{\an1}we can take this guy down!

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,851
No!

48
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:58,322
{\an1}It's not just your problem
if Nine Tails is captured.

{\an1}The village's very

My existence is
at stake, too!

52
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,069
Hey! [grunting]

53
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,109
Kakashi Sensei!

54
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:14,145
{\an1}Just sit still for a while.

55
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:19,253
{\an1}I'll show you the true
essence of the Copy Ninja.

56
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,764
{\an1}I can't copy that!

57
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:27,399
{\an1}It seems kinda...

58
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,667
impossible!

59
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,739
Idiot! Idiot!
Are you an idiot?

60
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,211
Damn it!

00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,531
{\an1}Who the hell are you?!

63
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:50,367
{\an1}No, what are you?!

64
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,070
Nine Tails...

65
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,740
You can talk?!

66
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:58,446
Give me the Nine
Tails right now.

67
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,216
{\an1}Huh?! No! No way!

68
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,555
Nine Tails...

69
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,156
I want it!

70
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,258
Give it to me!

71
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,628

I won't lose!

can't afford to die here!

You?!

77

{\an1}I'm Gaara of the Sand

Gaara!

79
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,579
{\an1}The Hokage should have
relied on me from the start.

80
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,985
{\an1}Long-range battles are
my ultimate defense.

81
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:48,319
{\an1}This is my kind of mission!

82
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:52,058
{\an1}Plus, machines are
vulnerable to sand.

{\an1}Don't want the One Tail...

Nine Tails!

85
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,639
{\an1}One Tail is no longer inside
me, but I can't let you have

86
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:02,675
{\an1}Naruto's Nine Tails!

87
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,581

00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,058
{\an1}Well, if it isn't Mr. Gaara!

92
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,929
{\an1}So you're here to pick
up the pieces after

93
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,497
{\an1}Nine Tails is captured?

Hmph! What?!

95
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,605
{\an1}Nine Tails' Chakra
hasn't been extracted yet?

96
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:25,442
{\an1}And here I thought that this
thing was supposed to be the

97
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,612
{\an1}Akatsuki's brightest hope!

98
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:28,581
What?!

00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,182
{\an1}That thing's an Akatsuki?!

100
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:31,484
Nine Tails...

101
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:32,853
{\an1}The Nine Tails...

{\an1}Did you hear that, Gaara?!

105
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,299
Even the Mecha
doesn't want you!

106
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,837
{\an1}Oh, how sad, so sad.

107
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,038
[laughter]

108
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,874
{\an1}Is it any wonder you lost
to me and got your Tailed

109
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,178
{\an1}Beast taken away?!

110
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,450
{\an1}Face it, you're as weak as a
baby, and you look like you

111
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,185
{\an1}could use some cheering up!

112
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:58,492
{\an1}Gaara, Gaara, cheer up
and grin, 'cause you

113
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,729
{\an1}won't have one once I win!

114
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,898
[laughter]

115
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,068
You're dead!

{\an1}All you had to do was just
give a little squeeze.

119
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:17,420
Just one little
squeeze, that's all.

120
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,289
One squeeze!

121
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:30,740
That's it!
I'm outta here!

The Akatsuki
have some nerve!

00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:47,231
{\an1}I'm the one who created this
child, but then they stole

127
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,101
{\an1}him away from me!

128

Where's Sasuke?!

133
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,416
Sorry.

134
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,819
He's not here.

135
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:04,091
{\an1}I thought I'd settle
this debt all by myself.

136
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:06,928
He was with me
earlier, but he ditched me!

137
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,163
How annoying!

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,411
{\an1}But, at least I have
custody of this child again.

139
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:20,982
Now he'll move
under my command.

140
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,588
{\an1}Go take the Nine Tails!

141
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,325
{\an1}If I possess Sasuke and
The Nine Tails, I'll have

142
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,963
{\an1}nothing to fear in
this whole world!

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,467
Aren't you
forgetting something?

{\an1}One of the feared
Legendary Sannin!

Pervy Sage!

147
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:42,114
{\an1}This whole thing's a rip-off
of my Toad Mouth Trap!

148
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,950
{\an1}Right, Orochimaru?

149
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,185
Yes...

150
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:48,123
{\an1}And thanks to it,
Naruto can't escape!

151
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,994
{\an1}My child, go feast to
your heart's content

152
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,697
{\an1}on The Nine Tails' honey!

A.k.a. Jiraiya,
the noted novelist!

158
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,960
{\an1}Now, let's take this
outside, Orochimaru!

00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:14,896

00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:48,981
Huh?!

166
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:49,848
Pervy Sage!

167
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:51,451
What happened
to Pervy Sage?!

168
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,259
He'll come out
looking like that, too.

169
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,866
{\an1}Now then, Naruto.

170
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:05,339
{\an1}Why don't you hand The
Nine Tails over to me?

171
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:06,741
My child...

172
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,914
Oh, man, what
am I gonna do?!

173
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,816
{\an1}What are you gonna do?

174
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,186
I could come
out, you know...

175
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,759
[chuckle]

176
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,929
{\an1}Just sit tight a
little longer, okay?

177
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:23,265
[attacking yell]

178
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:40,625
But why?

179
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:41,726
How can it be?

180
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,130
[attacking yell]

181
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,882
My child has
siphoned off most of

182
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,852
{\an1}The Nine Tails' Chakra.

183
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,923
You're facing a
massive amount of it.

184
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,094
{\an1}So why aren't you giving up?

185
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:08,532
{\an1}Like I said, no matter what,
I can't afford to die here.

186
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,983
[power yell]

187
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:29,999
Go, it's over.

188
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,669
{\an1}I can't do anything anymore.

189
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,538
You sure?

190
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,275
[chuckle]

191
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:39,179
You're weak, so
It can't be helped.

192
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,954
It's not because
it can't be helped.

193
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:47,024
I'm weak.

194
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,093
That's why.

195
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,433
{\an1}I came back to the village
to train and get strong, so...

196
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,969
{\an1}This time, for sure.

197
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,553
So this time...

198
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,823
I'll get
definitely Sasuke back!

199
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,599
{\an1}For Sasuke's sake!

200
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,272
{\an1}For Sasuke's sake...

201
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:49,718
{\an1}Nine Tails' Chakra.

202
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:53,957
Even if that
power is exhausted.

203
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,228
{\an1}For Sasuke's sake.

204
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,666
{\an1}If you think of Sasuke as a
friend, no matter what...

205
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,442
{\an1}Naruto, just as you consider
Sasuke to be a friend,

206
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,144
he shall be
your friend, too.

207
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,050
{\an1}I'm sorry for testing you.

208
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,053
{\an1}But if Nine Tails should
go on a rampage,

209
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,223
{\an1}this guy will take
the fall for you.

210
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,628
Be there for
Sasuke, both of you.

211
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,270
So wait, this
guy's my friend?!

212
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,011
{\an1}Nine Tails' tails!

213
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,282
{\an1}But I'm still conscious...

214
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,051
{\an1}What's going on?!

215
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:37,122
I'm your parent,
yet you turn on me?!

216
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,925
We are friends.

217
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:42,864
{\an1}We bonded with our
fists and know the

218
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,267
{\an1}pain of true friendship!

219

220

No!

[screaming]

222
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,166
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf will
just get destroyed, then!

223
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,245
[angry roaring]

224
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,032
{\an1}Mechanized Nine Tails?

225
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,936
{\an1}Mecha Nine Tails?!

226
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,647
What the-?!

227
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,416
[chuckle]

228
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,720
The Second
destruction of the Leaf!

229
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:52,903
Mecha Me?!

230
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:53,705
I'll go.

231
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:54,605
Huh?

232
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,275
I'll go to the
Hidden Leaf Village.

233
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,346
{\an1}All right, then...

234
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,049
Let's do this,
Mecha Me!

235
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,130
{\an1}When you lose to me, and I
get the Tailed Beast, our

236
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,066
{\an1}rankings will be decided!

237
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,403
{\an1}You could never beat me!

238
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:20,778
I'm going to
reverse them right now!

239
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,181
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

Naruto...

242
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,604
{\an1}At a time like this, why
aren't you here with us?!

243
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:41,475
Hurry, Naruto!

244
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,245
Oh, please!

245
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,549
{\an1}Get here, Naruto!

246
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:56,130
It's okay!

247
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:57,634
It's me, Sakura!

248
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,868
Huh?!

249
00:17:58,903 --> 00:17:59,536
Face open!

00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,307
[chuckle]

00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:03,810
Naruto?!

252
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,218
You protect that
flower, Sakura!

253
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:14,157
{\an1}And I'll protect the Sakura
who protects that flower!

254
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,835
Did you eat
something that went bad?

255
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:35,958
Did we do it?!

256
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,760
{\an1}It is impossible.

257
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:40,364
{\an1}Mecha Nine Tails is made
of the same materials I am.

258
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,870
{\an1}No matter how hard we hit,
we cannot damage each other.

259
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:46,540
{\an1}There is only one
way to it bring down.

260
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,008
What do we do?

261
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,444
{\an1}Take all the Nine
Tails' chakra in me

262
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,213
{\an1}and throw it at him!

00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,821
Mecha Me!

264
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:59,192
{\an1}A Jinchuriki will die if its
Tailed Beast is extracted!

265
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,928
{\an1}And you're basically
like a Jinchuriki

266
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:02,531
{\an1}now, isn't that right?!

267
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,800
{\an1}If you use up the
Tailed Beast Chakra.

268
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,371
{\an1}Mecha Me, you're gonna--!

00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:09,808
Ya know...

00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,044

Mecha Me!

275
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:08,396
{\an1}I'm so sorry it had to
end this way, Mecha Me.

276
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,801
{\an1}But thank you so much.

277
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,378
Sakura...

278
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:20,948
I did just what
you asked of me.

279
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,052
{\an1}I protected this flower.

280
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:27,091
{\an1}And you protected me and
the whole village, as well!

281
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:28,893
No...

282
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,996
{\an1}The one who saved
the village-

283
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,536
I'm not entirely
sure what happened

284
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,442
{\an1}here but whatever it was,
it's clear he fought for

285
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,578
{\an1}and protected all of us.

286
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:42,981
{\an1}The whole village.

287
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,583
I'm grateful.

288
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,657
Now you can go
back to training.

289
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,260
Yeah!

290
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,899
{\an1}And I'm counting on
you to rebuild, Granny!

00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,393
Huh?

00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,137
Oh, sorry.

296
00:22:57,984 --> 00:22:59,920
{\an1}Hinata, did you see it?

297
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:00,787
Yeah...

298
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,624
Can you explain
what exactly happened?

299
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:06,029
{\an1}The Ten Tails has
been completely

300
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:08,032
{\an1}absorbed into that man.

301
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,433
{\an1}Based on its chakra...

302
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:13,072
That guy is Ten
Tails' Jinchuriki?

303
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:18,547
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Ten
Tails' Jinchuriki."

304
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,219
He looks even
creepier than he did before!
