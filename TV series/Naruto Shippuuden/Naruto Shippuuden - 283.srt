1
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:21,209
Now's my chance!

2
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:33,568
Damn it, that guy is
fast! No doubt about it!

3
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,003
Huh!

4
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,478
But...

5
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,049
I'll try again!

6
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:46,326
They're so fast, I can't
track them!

7
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,400
Huh?

8
00:00:55,444 --> 00:00:59,051
Do you really think you
can defeat me with your
Lariat?!

9
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,426
[coughing]

10
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,497
Oh, no! Octopops!

11
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,738
If you have time to
worry, worry about
yourself!

12
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:16,787
Bee?! Why are you doing
this?!

13
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,329
Don't you get it yet,
Bro? Ya hear me? Fool, ya
fool!

14
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:24,168
Octopops! Thanks, I owe
you one!

15
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,406
Now I can get past the
Raikage.

16
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,579
[growling]

17
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:31,550
[grunting]

18
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,519
Huh?!

19
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:33,420
[grunting]

20
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,674
Hokage! Get in here
and help me!

21
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,515
Lady Tsunade?

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,169
I won't give up!

23
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:05,050
Naruto, you don't have to
protect me! Stop,
already!

24
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,656
Dreams don't come true
when you're dead!

25
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:10,460
Heh, don't worry
about me!

26
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,668
Get out of the way,
Naruto! don't do it!

27
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:24,623
Until the day that I
become Hokage... Whatever
happens...

28
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,564
There's no way I'm gonna
die!

29
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:35,578
Huh!

30
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:37,414
[gasping]

31
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,216
Uh!

32
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:43,126
Granny!

33
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,704
Hokage! You'd better have
a real good excuse for
this course of action!

34
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:36,486
"Two Suns"

35
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,164
Hokage! You'd better have
a real good excuse for
taking this course of
action!

36
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:47,609
Look, even if you were to
kill Naruto. And you buy
us some time until Nine
Tails comes back to life,

37
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:53,153
I doubt the next
Jinchuriki will be able
to control Nine Tail's
power to this degree!

38
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:57,662
Since we don't have any
idea which way this war
will go, let's use all
the weapons we've

39
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,000
got... including the
Jinchuriki!

40
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,705
That's why I'll let
Naruto pass!

41
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,245
Nice excuse! I mean, nice
explanation! Now you're
talking!

42
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,289
Now, that's the Granny Hokage
that I remember. The one who
won't let anyone stop her!

43
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:18,938
Hokage. Who's the one
that's just making
arbitrary decisions now?!

44
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,708
You're all fools.

45
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:24,481
Where is there any
evidence that Naruto will
succeed?

46
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:32,030
I already told you your
Lariat won't work against
me!

47
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:48,296
Listen, Bro... you may be
Raikage, but since the
beginning, you've
underestimated my power,

48
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,699
fool, ya fool!

49
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:05,063
No one ever expected the
Third Raikage to die.

50
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,745
Hey, where's my Bro? Over
there? Over there?

51
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,287
All of a sudden, he just
started punching his way
out through the wall.

52
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:25,203
There's gonna be a bunch
of holes in walls now...
Follow them, and you should
be able to find him.

53
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:29,378
Thanks, will do. I'll
look for Bro beyond the
walls I go through.

54
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:19,946
It'll be okay, just hang
in there, Bro. From today
on, you're the Raikage,
yo.

55
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,154
I know that!

56
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:26,560
We're right in the middle
of a war!

57
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:33,540
I will protect this
village and nation to the
very end! As my old man
wanted!

58
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,051
Bee...

59
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,727
You will go to Unraikyo,
the Storm Cloud Ravine,
and work on your Tailed
Beast Bomb.

60
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,365
You will not be engaging
the enemy.

61
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,635
What?

62
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,140
Yo, but my Lariat, that's
where it's at-

63
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:52,110
I don't need your
Lariat anymore!

64
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:57,254
Even if the enemy
invades, you'll stay in
the village and use your
long-range Tailed Beast

65
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,724
Bomb to get them.

66
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:02,965
All right?! You are never
to leave the village
again! Got it?!

67
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:14,889
Bee, both you and Naruto
are precious Jinchuriki!
The two of you are very
special to your villages

68
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:16,092
and your nations.

69
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,564
And that's the reason why
I can't let either of you
pass!

70
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:26,078
No matter how powerful
you two are,... don't
forget that the Akatsuki,
our enemy, has already

71
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:30,020
taken down and sealed
away all the other
Jinchuriki!

72
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:33,393
Just trust me, we ain't
gonna lose, Naruto and
me.

73
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:37,702
And about that I'll
happily give you my
personal guarantee.

74
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:40,975
So be it, then! Let's put
it to the test!

75
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:44,883
Your Lariat against mine!
We'll see who's stronger!

76
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:52,899
Bee, we still have a long
way to go before the
Double Lariat is where it
needs to be.

77
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:58,544
I'm still toning down my
strength to match yours.
You're going to have to
get stronger!

78
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:04,254
I'm gonna surpass you
someday, you'll see! And
on that day, I will be
carefree!

79
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:08,797
That sounds ideal to me.
And I'll do it, too,
you'll see! Easy as
one-two-three! 'Cause

80
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,001
taking you down is my
fantasy!

81
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,539
No way!

82
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,849
[grunting]

83
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:42,932
The thing is, being
Jinchuriki isn't our only
power source...

84
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,773
We possess something
that's even stronger
fundamentally.

85
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:52,518
I'll tell you all the
details. You know your
words to me, and me
alone, back before I

86
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,188
received the Eight
Tails

87
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:58,797
They'll keep me strong,
no matter what happens,
even when all else fails.

88
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,099
Hmm...

89
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,337
It can be anything.

90
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,345
You'll know it when you
find it. Because it will
keep you strong.

91
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,320
So make sure that Bee
finds it.

92
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,925
All right...

93
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,800
You know, Bee, you really
are very special to me!

94
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,606
You and I are the
ultimate tag team, after
all!

95
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,916
You're talking about...
those words I said to you
in front of the Waterfall
of Truth?

96
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,557
You're finally getting
it, huh? So you're not a
fool, ya fool?

97
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:34,936
Preaching truth at you
from above is my fantasy.
The fantasy is now a
reality, oh-yay!

98
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:59,184
White Zetsu uses a
Transformation Jutsu that
can even mimic chakra.

99
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:15,551
Is there a way to see
through such a jutsu?

100
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,953
[groaning]

101
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:19,458
Nothing helpful in these
papers either...

102
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:24,769
Don't you think that we
should relay this intel
to Lord Raikage and Lady
Hokage?

103
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:29,879
Not yet. The two of them
decided to leave me in
charge here, so I'll handle
this situation.

104
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:34,622
Besides, we don't want to
bother them. They need to
concentrate on stopping
Naruto and Lord Bee.

105
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:38,897
But that's the thing...
You see, Lady Tsunade has
already-

106
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,734
I'm looking at new data
right now!

107
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:46,011
It's imperative that I
come up with a solution
right away! So please,
let me focus.

108
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:58,336
It's true that you are
very special to me, Bee.

109
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:03,847
And I do believe we're
the ultimate tag team. I
said that to you, you're
correct.

110
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,285
But just those simple
words are really going to

111
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:10,393
be enough to keep you
strong all through the
battle that you'd face?

112
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:15,838
I don't live and fight
just for the village and
nation. I live and fight
for you, too, Bro!

113
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:21,115
You're still way too
overprotective. You gotta
let me go.

114
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:24,889
Don't lose faith in me.
You gotta trust in my
power, you know?

115
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:29,264
The world is dark and
full of pain... when
you're a Jinchuriki.

116
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:32,437
But I learned you can't
give up, you gotta fight

117
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,713
free. You gotta find a
light that can let
yourself see.

118
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:40,019
Tailed Beasts are not the
only source of our power.

119
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:43,527
What we were before the
Tailed Beasts helps in
our weakest hour.

120
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,334
Our true selves shine like
the sun, they're second
to none.

121
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:52,477
Our true strength means
we will never have to
run.

122
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:57,253
Only I could control the
Eight Tails, only I could
win that fight.

123
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,661
Naruto's got the same
light inside as me, all
right?

124
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:05,103
But instead of only one,
that boy's rocking two
suns' light!

125
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,238
Huh?

126
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:12,685
Yeah, you got that right.
It really is like the
sun, and I'm rocking two
of them!

127
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,589
<i>Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

128
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:18,429
What are these two suns
that you and Bee have
spoken of?

129
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,441
I'm talking about my mom
and my dad!

130
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,211
Your mother and father?

131
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:29,652
You mean the Fourth
Hokage and Kushina
Uzumaki?

132
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:35,531
You're talking about
people who died right
after you were born! You
were merely an infant!

133
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,541
Something must have
happened during his
training to control the
Nine Tails' chakra.

134
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:46,619
Back when Naruto battled
Pain, he started
transforming into Nine
Tails. Minato had put his

135
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:52,430
essence into the seal's
jutsu formula. He
appeared and saved
Naruto.

136
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,370
I knew he wouldn't go
down without a fight!

137
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:07,795
When I was trying to
control Nine Tails'
power...

138
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:11,736
My Dad made sure that I
finally got to meet my
mom.

139
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:17,280
Dad said he'd woven Mom's
chakra into the seal. She
was able to hang out with
me while I undid the

140
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,051
Nine Tails' seal.

141
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,188
He did it all for me!

142
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:27,067
<i>The Fourth Hokage had</i>
<i>studied the unique</i>
<i>Sealing Jutsu developed</i>
<i>by the Uzumaki Clan...</i>

143
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,212
<i>And Kushina's chakra and</i>
<i>life force were powerful,</i>
<i>without question. It is</i>
<i>possible.</i>

144
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:35,718
As I thought!

145
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:41,128
When mom helped me get
this power, she told me
absolutely everything.

146
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:45,136
One time, long ago, dad
fought this guy in a
mask.

147
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,244
And during that battle...
he learned two things.

148
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:54,756
The first thing he
discovered... was that
this masked guy was gonna
try to destroy the future.

149
00:14:54,789 --> 00:15:00,133
And the other thing he
learned... was that the
only one who could stop
the masked man was me.

150
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,874
But only if I had the
Nine Tails' power under
control.

151
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:08,917
Masked man... meaning
Madara?

152
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:14,796
So Madara did cause that
Nine Tails' incident was
Madara's doing after all?

153
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,974
Then this is why Minato
sealed Nine Tails inside
Naruto but left a key to
unlock it.

154
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:26,452
I knew he had to have a
reason. Minato never did
anything that was
unnecessary.

155
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:33,098
He must have concluded
that this masked man,
Madara, posed an enormous
threat to us... all of us.

156
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:38,510
And that only someone
with Nine Tails' power
under his control could
defeat this enemy.

157
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,914
So he chose Naruto.

158
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,893
Minato told you? And he
entrusted everything to
you, is that it?

159
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:50,099
He knew he wasn't the one
fated to be the savior?

160
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,147
I don't know if Dad ever
considered himself to be
a savior or not.

161
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,088
But then... I remember
that my master had always
told me...

162
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,858
My Dad was a Child of
Prophecy.

163
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:08,469
Do you remember what I
said to you earlier? That
so-called Savior is now
dead.

164
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:12,043
What else could you call
that outcome except a
failure?

165
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:20,694
Yeah, you're right. My
dad died. Mom, too.

166
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:24,334
<i>He and my mom died</i>
<i>protecting the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf from the enemy and</i>

167
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:28,142
<i>the Nine-Tailed Fox! They</i>
<i>died protecting me!</i>

168
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,052
It only lasted a moment.
But they gave me
something.

169
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:39,397
Both of them gave me the
knowledge that what I'm
capable of is whatever I
believe I can do!

170
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,370
They entrusted me to be
the savior of the world!

171
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:44,909
<i>Raikage!</i>

172
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:49,017
If you take down Naruto
to delay our enemy's
plans, Madara will

173
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,023
definitely take the Nine
Tails next time.

174
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,094
And the world will come
to an end!

175
00:16:54,127 --> 00:17:00,206
Only Naruto can control
the Nine Tails' power.
Just as Minato thought he
would!

176
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:04,414
We need to let Naruto go.
That way, he can protect
the shinobi.

177
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:08,557
I'm going to bet on
Naruto! So what about
you?

178
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,161
Yo, I gotta second her,
fool, ya fool!

179
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:14,702
Like you always said...
I'm a big fool, too!

180
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:21,248
You see, my good friend
Naruto here is just as
foolish as me. You agree?

181
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:24,989
Right now, you need some
big fools for us to
succeed.

182
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:30,166
Fools who don't care at
all, how strong or tall
the wall. Yeah!

183
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:34,107
[grunting]

184
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:50,172
Bro's at top speed, no
one's faster! I think
he's gonna kill Naruto!
What a disaster!

185
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,285
Just like always,
you're so stubborn.

186
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:59,157
But you're gonna have
to go through me, first!

187
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,564
I can't let Granny get
involved! This is my
fight!

188
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,050
Naruto, this
ends now!

189
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:16,458
Way too many people have
put their faith in me for
me to let them down!

190
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,114
No! I cannot fail!

191
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:52,665
Anyway, I've got my
own responsibilities.

192
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,242
I cannot fail now.

193
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,526
He dodged it?! No way,
fool, ya fool! He really
is!

194
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,364
Just like the Yellow
Flash of the Leaf!

195
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:13,072
Like you just said,
Raikage...

196
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:15,811
If I fail,... then I'm
not a savior.

197
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,317
I cannot fail now.

198
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:22,223
I'm my father's son!

199
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:31,074
He taught me to be the
savior, so that's what
I'll be!

200
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:38,422
My attack was simply a
test. I wanted to gauge
your abilities and
conviction.

201
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:42,564
You're only the second
to have ever outrun my
fastest punch.

202
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:47,273
So it appears... that we
have a savior after all.

203
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,216
Now go forth!

204
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,686
Yes, sir!

205
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,911
This really is the only
way.

206
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:11,956
According to this data,
Naruto can sense
hostility when in Nine
Tails Chakra Mode.

207
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:16,064
He'll be able to see
through White Zetsu's
transformation jutsu.

208
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:20,139
In addition, we can have
Naruto create Shadow
Clones To counter White

209
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,343
Zetsu on every
battlefield at once.

210
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:28,222
But if we delay any
longer, then I'm afraid
there will be no chance
of turning back.

211
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,426
But there's one big
problem...

212
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:34,234
This is a war in large
part to protect Naruto,
a Jinchuriki.

213
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:39,377
So if we throw him into
battle like that... we'd
be getting our priorities
backward.

214
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:44,354
I really don't think that
Lord Raikage would ever
allow us to use such a
strategy.

215
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:46,692
Yes... That's true.

216
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,028
Well...

217
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:52,303
That's the thing. That
doesn't seem to be the
case anymore.

218
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:58,583
The long night is finally
coming to an end.

219
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,960
They should be able to
use their eyes now.

220
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:10,339
Six new Pains. All
Jinchuriki.

221
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:14,648
I've just added a
little something.

222
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:04,467
Attacking the Blunt Blade
Helmet Splitter,
Kabutowari, has no
effect!

223
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,945
<i>Trying to block me is</i>
<i>meaningless, too! This</i>
<i>next attack will end you!</i>

224
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:13,118
Not yet! I hope you
don't think this will
be over so soon.

225
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,926
<i>There's no way to block</i>
<i>the Blunt Blade Helmet</i>
<i>Splitter!</i>

226
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:22,169
Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "The Helmet
Splitter: Jinin Akebino!"

227
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:24,875
Who said anything about
blocking?!
