1
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,235
-Fang Over Fang!

2
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,216
{\an1}-Ma, He's a bomb!

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,218
[bark]

4
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,089
{\an1}-Yeah, I know that.

5
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:50,028
{\an1}-He must have used the
other one as a shield.

6
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,065
{\an1}-I figured as much.

7
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:54,635
{\an1}Just as intel said,
physical attacks

8
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:56,571
{\an1}seem to be his weak points.

9
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:57,572
-Heh.

10
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:58,574
Well, then.

11
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,077
{\an1}We of the Inuzuka
clan couldn't have

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,113
{\an1}asked for a better opponent.

13
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,551
{\an1}Ma, let's take him
down with one strike.

14
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,019
-Hold it, Kiba.

15
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:08,222
{\an1}After all, this guy
is one of the six

16
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,158
{\an1}who brought down Lord Jiraiya.

17
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:13,330
{\an1}We're going to be
cautious and bold.

18
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,467
{\an1}And while Han is out
protecting the puppies,

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,304
{\an1}I expect you to fill in.

20
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:19,138
-Of course.

21
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,097
-Shiho.

22
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,134
{\an1}We'll attack at full power.

23
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,704
-Yes

24
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,475
{\an1}-Boy, I am so hungry.

25
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,843
{\an1}Let's take a little break.

26
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:48,048
{\an1}All of us are really
tired from the mission.

27
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,951
-Hmm.

28
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,954
{\an1}Is something wrong, Sensei?

29
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,189
What is it?

30
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:56,261
{\an1}-Have you noticed
large numbers of birds

31
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:59,332
{\an1}have been flying in the
direction of the village?

32
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,800
{\an1}It's like they're fleeing.

33
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:01,636
-Yes.

34
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,905
{\an1}Makes me uneasy, too.

35
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:06,442
{\an1}We ought to just head
straight for the village.

36
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,977
-Awww!

37
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,316
{\an1}-Let's go, everyone.

38
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:12,285
-Aww, man.

39
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,236
-Behind you!

40
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:39,959
{\an1}-Six nose piercings and
seven studs in each ear.

41
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,662
That's him.

42
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,264
-You are?

43
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,535
{\an1}-It's been a long
time, Lady Tsunade,

44
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:49,574
{\an1}the last remaining member
of the legendary Sanimoon.

45
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:54,681
{\an1}You and I, we have
something to discuss.

46
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,620
{\an1}[theme music - japanese]

47
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,106
-Kiba.

48
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,542
Use that move.

49
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:43,042
-Yeah.

50
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:44,378
Good idea.

51
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:45,580
{\an1}Let's go, Akamaru.

52
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,784
[bark]

53
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,051
{\an1}-Dynamic Marking!

54
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,964
{\an1}-Oh, no you don't.

55
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,737
{\an1}-I've got this under control.

56
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,538
Don't worry.

57
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:02,572
{\an1}I'll take care of them.

58
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:03,406
-Great.

59
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,811
Thanks.

60
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,580
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) Now that
Akamaru's marked you,

61
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,850
{\an1}there's no way for
you to escape me.

62
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:17,762
{\an1}-This isn't Pain.

63
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,665
It's because
characteristics differ

64
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,568
{\an1}from the information
gathered on him.

65
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,943
-Stay alert.

66
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,109
-Of course.

67
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,079
{\an1}I don't let my guard
down for anyone.

68
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,067
-Paper clones.

69
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:49,542
{\an1}-No matter how many
clones there are,

70
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,045
our beetles will
devour them all.

71
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,524
-That smell!

72
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,692
Get back, Shino!

73
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,162
-Hm?

74
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,264
Hm!

75
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,601
{\an1}The paper clones are
armed with paper bombs.

76
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:24,127
{\an1}The real one was already
saturated with water.

77
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,232
{\an1}-She used her weakness
to gain an advantage.

78
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,067
This one's good.

79
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,870
Very good.

80
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:37,714
-Wait.

81
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,016
{\an1}You're that child, aren't you?

82
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:48,296
{\an1}That boy from long ago.

83
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,968
{\an1}-So you do remember me, then?

84
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,004
-You know him?

85
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,707
-Yes, I do.

86
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,843
{\an1}-Who or what is he?

87
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,548
{\an1}-A god who restores order.

88
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,620
{\an1}-It seems like he's
not in his right mind.

89
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:05,689
-Naruto Uzamaki.

90
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,726
Where is he?

91
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,495
-No one knows.

92
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,366
{\an1}-We now have almost
all the junchuriki,

93
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,504
{\an1}so the balance of power
between the ninja villages

94
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:20,244
{\an1}is no longer maintained,
the tailed beasts.

95
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:24,685
{\an1}It's meaningless to continue
harboring a Nine-Tails now.

96
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:28,791
{\an1}-So your target truly
is Naruto, after all.

97
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,962
{\an1}-The rise of conflicts
are imminent.

98
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:36,268
{\an1}The kindling coals of war
are smoldering everywhere.

99
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:39,473
{\an1}And we shall control those wars.

100
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,777
If you cooperate
with us, we would not

101
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,280
{\an1}be averse to helping you.

102
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,450
{\an1}From the state of
this village, you

103
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:50,991
{\an1}ought to have a sense
of our strength by now.

104
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,629
{\an1}-Don't underestimate
the Five Kage.

105
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:57,366
{\an1}You are only terrorists
seeking to destroy the peace

106
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,704
{\an1}that our predecessors
strived so desperately

107
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,040
{\an1}to achieve and to maintain.

108
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:05,244
{\an1}We will not heed you.

109
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:05,879
-Such arrogance.

110
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,419
-So much chakra.

111
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,856
{\an1}-This is the power
of the Rinnegan.

112
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,594
I've never seen
anything like it.

113
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,398
-I have a bad
feeling about this.

114
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,936
{\an1}-What you like to
call peace has only

115
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,238
brought violence
down upon us all.

116
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:27,078
{\an1}-I cannot say that everything
the Leaf did in the past was

117
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:29,115
just or correct.

118
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:32,686
{\an1}But your actions here
are unforgivable.

119
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,256
{\an1}-Be careful of what you say.

120
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,461
{\an1}This is your final
warning from a god.

121
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:39,596
Where is Naruto?

122
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:45,973
Speak.

123
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:48,009
{\an1}-We will pour every
ounce of power

124
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,181
{\an1}that we possess into
bringing you down.

125
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:53,283
{\an1}I have nothing more to say.

126
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,121
{\an1}Except that you're
wrong about one thing.

127
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,458
{\an1}You've made a huge error.

128
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:03,966
{\an1}What you desire most,
you shall never have.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,603
{\an1}-If you think that the
Shinobi of the Hidden Leaf can

130
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,807
{\an1}successfully protect
Naruto from me--

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,307
-No.

132
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:19,656
{\an1}Naruto is stronger
than you know.

133
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,571
-There are six
Pains, and each one

134
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,908
{\an1}can only use one jutsu type.

135
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,314
{\an1}That woman used Summoning jutsu.

136
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:39,118
{\an1}And that means the Pain
that Lord Jiraiya defeated

137
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,822
{\an1}was brought back in
a different body.

138
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,792
{\an1}-There's no mistake.

139
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,728
{\an1}When she was brought
to that tower,

140
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,701
that woman was
undeniably a corpse.

141
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:53,440
{\an1}-When you saw her, did she have
one of these embedded in her?

142
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:54,474
-No.

143
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,279
{\an1}I'm positive that she didn't.

144
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,816
{\an1}-So Lord Fukasaku was right.

145
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,785
Incredibly, Pain
somehow has the power

146
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,757
{\an1}to bring the dead back to life.

147
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,263
{\an1}Plus, he can substitute himself
in other bodies at will,

148
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:11,000
{\an1}and he makes them move by
implanting these black chakra

149
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,135
receivers.

150
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:14,604
{\an1}-So then, are all six of
those Pains actually--

151
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:15,706
-Yes.

152
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,910
{\an1}It's possible that all
of them are dead bodies.

153
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,879
{\an1}And if these rods
are receivers, there

154
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,916
{\an1}must also be a transmitter.

155
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,186
{\an1}-Someone's in the
shadows, broadcasting

156
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,489
{\an1}all of these chakra
signals, and using

157
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,592
{\an1}them to manipulate those bodies.

158
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,561
-Yes.

159
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,466
{\an1}The coded message that
Lord Jiraiya left behind.

160
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,503
{\an1}"The real one's not among them."

161
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,875
{\an1}Perhaps it means that none of
the Six Pains is the real Pain.

162
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,076
-Hold on.

163
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,813
{\an1}Are you saying there are
others still out there?

164
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:45,551
-Exactly.

165
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,854
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) I had
anticipated that possibility,

166
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,392
but only as the
worst-case scenario.

167
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,761
{\an1}I didn't want it to be true.

168
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:56,368
{\an1}-Whatever's out there
possesses considerable chakra.

169
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,573
{\an1}To control so many so easily?

170
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,979
{\an1}-It's similar to our Yamanaka
clan's Mind Transfer Jutsu.

171
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:07,384
{\an1}But we can only manipulate
one person at a time.

172
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,322
So if there are
six of these Pains,

173
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:13,093
{\an1}does that mean there are
six others in the shadows?

174
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,996
-There's no way
to know that yet.

175
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,598
{\an1}-If this is a mind
transfer jutsu,

176
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,969
{\an1}they'd have to be as close as
they could to the receivers

177
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,905
{\an1}to transmit their chakra.

178
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,478
{\an1}Or they couldn't possibly
do such a complex jutsu.

179
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,449
{\an1}-They must be hiding somewhere
near the Leaf village, then.

180
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,683
All right.

181
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,321
{\an1}We'll tell Lady Tsunade
and organize a search party

182
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,490
immediately.

183
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:34,425
-Ah!

184
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,893
-What?

185
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,528
{\an1}How did we not notice him?

186
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:45,274
-Ah!

187
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,046
-Do not move.

188
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:52,885
Or she dies.

189
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,857
-Damn it.

190
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,767
[whimpering]

191
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:04,736
-Mount Myoboku.

192
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,944
{\an1}-That's my father's jutsu.

193
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:15,252
{\an1}But he just searched her mind
in seconds without any device.

194
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:19,292
{\an1}-Well, it would appear
Naruto's not here.

195
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,594
Mount Myoboku.

196
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,097
-What?

197
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,068
[growling]

198
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:44,596
-What?

199
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:45,296
{\an1}They're retreating.

200
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,841
{\an1}-What's going on here?

201
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,211
-Mount Myoboku.

202
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,015
{\an1}The toads' hidden village, yes?

203
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:01,020
{\an1}Then I will linger
here no longer.

204
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,525
{\an1}-How did you know?

205
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,760
-You.

206
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:06,728
-Lady Tsunade.

207
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,963
{\an1}Perhaps we should
let them withdraw

208
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:11,869
{\an1}so we can fortify our
defenses while they're gone.

209
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,172
-Ugh.

210
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:16,143
{\an1}-Just one last thing.

211
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:19,814
{\an1}The chakra you're emitting
through your feet.

212
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,752
{\an1}Is it to counteract my jutsu?

213
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:26,625
{\an1}So my ability has become
known to you, has it?

214
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:31,299
{\an1}However, all is meaningless
before overwhelming power.

215
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:35,371
{\an1}You Great Nations proved
that over the years.

216
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:40,413
{\an1}You all think of yourselves as
the main forces of this world,

217
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,817
{\an1}and push death out
of your thoughts.

218
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,523
Lulled by peace,
you become shallow.

219
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:51,630
If you kill, you
shall be killed.

220
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:56,202
{\an1}Hatred is what connects
this cause and effect.

221
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,506
{\an1}-Quit babbling such nonsense.

222
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,780
{\an1}-In battle, both sides suffer
death, injury, and pain.

223
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:07,086
{\an1}-We Great Nations have
suffered our share of pain.

224
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,488
Enough excuses.

225
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,223
{\an1}You can't justify your actions.

226
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:17,000
-How absurd.

227
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,111
-Lady Shizune!

228
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:26,615
-Feel pain.

229
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,017
{\an1}Contemplate pain.

230
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:37,331
Accept pain.

231
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:38,232
Know pain.

232
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:44,742
-Wait, Pain.

233
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,045
Come back!

234
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:53,655
{\an1}-Feel pain, accept
pain, and know pain.

235
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:57,361
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) He's still
planning something?

236
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,634
{\an1}-Those who do not know pain will
never understand true peace.

237
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,214
-Lord Fukasaku!

238
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,718
Bad news!

239
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,153
-Huh?

240
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:16,724
-What's wrong?

241
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:20,895
{\an1}-Big brother Kosuke, our
messenger, has been killed.

242
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,264
-What happened?

243
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:27,238
{\an1}-I don't know, but his name
disappeared from the register.

244
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:29,274
{\an1}-This doesn't bode well.

245
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,978
{\an1}Has something happened
to the Leaf village?

246
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,314
-What?

247
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:37,186
{\an1}-Naruto-boy, I have
a really bad feeling.

248
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,922
{\an1}-Wait, Geezer Sage.

249
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:41,827
{\an1}Is it the Akatsuki?

250
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:45,298
{\an1}-It's just lucky for us Ma
went to gather provisions

251
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,034
{\an1}and is near the Hidden Leaf.

252
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:49,639
{\an1}And Ma can summon up quite
a bunch of strong-arms

253
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:52,443
{\an1}to defend the village,
including the two of us.

254
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,146
So go get ready.

255
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:54,946
-Yes, sir!

256
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,824
{\an1}[background chatter]

257
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:02,925
{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) Damn it.

258
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,897
{\an1}At this rate, I'll never
get to all of them.

259
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,342
-Lady Shizune!

260

-Hm?

{\an1}-What's going on?

263
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,173
{\an1}-I'm going to use that jutsu.

264
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:36,843
-What?

265
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:39,313

-Yeah.

267
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,650
But why?

268
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:42,551
{\an1}It doesn't make sense.

{\an1}They're obviously
not here anymore.

-Well, then.

{\an1}I guess my power must
have scared them off, huh?

{\an1}-(VOICEOVER) Hmm.

Leave it to Ma.

It's just like
that time with Pop.

{\an1}-What does this mean?

279
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,167
{\an1}-It's hard to believe
they would just retreat.

-Pain.

00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:45,147
{\an1}How could-- Naruto!

320
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,647
Hurry!

321
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,088
{\an1}[sobbing] Please!

322
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:50,588
Naruto!

323
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:28,111

324
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,913
{\an1}-There's no need for the
Hokage to bother herself

325
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,083
{\an1}with the likes of them.

326
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:04,388
{\an1}You just sit back and
sip some tea, Granny.

327
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:07,192
{\an1}I'll take over from here.

328
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:10,097
{\an1}Keep the rest of the
village out of this.

329
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,467
{\an1}I can't be worrying
about everyone else.

330
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,671
{\an1}Not during this fight.

331
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:18,309
{\an1}Next time, on Naruto Shippuden.

332
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:21,347
{\an1}Explosion-- Sage Mode.

333
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:25,119
{\an1}Let's settle this.
