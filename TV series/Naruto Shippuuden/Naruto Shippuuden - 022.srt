00:00:05,811 --> 00:00:11,822
-Well, then, shall we get to it?

00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:13,258
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Here he comes.

00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:21,606
-Die!

00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,017
-He's fast!

CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Did
Hiruko's tail just fall apart?

00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,777
SASORI (VOICEOVER):
Slick move, old lady.

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,981
But how are you going
to block this one?

8
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,460
-No!

9
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:51,462
-Here goes!

10
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,937
SASORI (VOICEOVER): With the
old lady controlling the action,

11
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,439
I'm not getting anywhere.

12
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,915
-Well, in that case--

13
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:29,766
-What?

14
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,537
Quick, hold your breath, Sakura!

15
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,908
-Poison?

-Sakura!

DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
Might as well get started.

18
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,120
NARUTO: Where do you
think you're going?

19
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:05,231
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
I really am lucky,

20
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,302
getting to take down two
different Jinchuriki.

-Dammit.

23

We're not done yet.

Kakashi-sensei!

25
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:07,313
-Well, he is the copy ninja.

26
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,684
A single piece of detonating
clay isn't going to cut it,

27
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:10,751
I guess.

28
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:11,253
Hm.

29
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,032
I don't have a lot
of clay left, either.

30
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,273
All I was trying to do was
lure out the Jinchuriki.

31
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,810
Now I've gotta deal with this.

32
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,846
Hm.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,886
-All right, that does it!

34
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,519
-Narut, wait!

35
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:40,006
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): We've
strayed too far from Sakura.

36
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,279
Any further, and we'll be out
of transmission range, too.

37
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:46,752
I won't be able to
contact Guy's team.

38

Hi-yah!

No good.

-How the hell do
you beat yourself?

49
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,804
I'm running out of ideas here.

50

-Leaf Hurricane!

51
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,800
No good.

What have you--

00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,629
-Ropes with kunai on the end.

62
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:01,198
You should deflect them.

63
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,172
Dodging only gets
you tangled up.

Can't hold my breath.

led the child go, are you?

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,944
-It's useless, granny.

69
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:46,348
If one breathes even
a hint of this poison,

70

then you're a goner.

-It's all over.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto-- Sorry, Naruto.

74
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,465
It means you may have to
wait for me a little bit.

75
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:21,046
But next time, I promise
I won't be dead weight.

76
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,953
I promised Naruto I
wouldn't be a burden.

77
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,926
I promised that things
would be different.

78
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,565
I swore to myself
that this time,

79
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,502
I would protect them both.

80

I can't let it end here.

Hang in there, Sakura.

00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,212
-I have more than one
store of poison, you know?

85
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:57,714
-What?

86
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,289
Sakura!

Hold on!

not going to-- die here!

Sakura, hold on, child.

92
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,452
Just stay with me.

00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,763
-Well, well.

00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,366
Not bad, I've got to admit.

95
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,321
-Oh, this is bad.

00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,475
Talk to me.

100
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:08,411
-I'm OK.

CHIYO (VOICEOVER): This
girl-- she used the blast wave

102
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:25,542
from a paper bomb to
dissipate the gas.

103
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:30,217
Endangering herself
to escape a trap.

104
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,219
How reckless.

105
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,271
-You listen to me.

106
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,408
I will get you, do you hear me?

107
00:12:54,963 --> 00:13:01,007
You can blow my limbs
off, you can poison me

108
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:06,318
till I can't move anymore, but
I'm still going to get you!

109
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:10,792
No matter what you pull, no
matter what you throw at me,

110
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:14,599
I'm going to make sure you tell
me everything about Orochimaru!

111
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,600
Is that clear?

112
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,683
-All I want is the Jinchuriki.

113
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:46,525
The copy ninja's a
headache I don't need.

114
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,530
I have to find a way
to separate them.

115
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,032
Hm.

116
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:15,745
-Kakashi-sensei!

117
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:21,522
Still the best.

118

KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He
sure is trying his damndest

119
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,840
to split the two of us up.

120
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,543
So that's his game.

121
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:37,285
He wants to face
Naruto one on one.

122
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,790
-So much for strategy.

123
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,795
I guess my only option is taking
the two of them down together.

124

I don't have much
detonating clay left.

A shame, really.

If I knew I was going to
end up in this predicament,

127
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,287
I probably would have
brought along a little extra.

128

Heh.

00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,558

you any manners?

00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,300
A man should be attentive
when a lady speaks to him.

134
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,600
-So, you brought them.

135

-You remember these, don't you?

136
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,984
-Yeah.

137
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,889
I suppose I do.

-That's right.

139
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,431
These are the very first
puppets that you ever crafted.

The Father and the Mother.

141

-The Father and Mother?

142
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:24,884
You mean-- Sasori's?

143
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,691
-What could you possibly
hope to accomplish with them?

144
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,295
Those puppets were
made by my hand.

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,266
I know all their tricks.

146

This is just silly.

of that, are you?

Incredible.

Guess I better
play my next hand.

This jutsu is the

is held as the most powerful
ninja the Sand has ever known.

00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:07,181
there was an adorable young
boy with hair as red as flame.

168
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,519
NARUTO: Who set off with some
dumplings to slay an ogre!

169
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,723
SAKURA: No, he's carrying
an axe in this one.

170
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,224
NARUTO: Oh.

171
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:12,858
Right.

172
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,194
CHIYO: Uh, no, no.

173
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:16,098
The child lived happily
with his parents.

174
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:17,367
NARUTO: Did he rescue a turtle?

175
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,736
SAKURA: Not even close!

176
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:19,972
CHIYO: Oh, I quit.

177
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,276
I don't even know what story
I was telling, anymore.

178
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,983
NARUTO AND SAKURA:
But what happens next?

179
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:29,422
NARUTO: Next time,
Father and Mother.

180
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:32,829
[theme music]

181
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,648
-Hi, all.

182
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:45,519
Today we'll be discussing
various lineages

183
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:47,456
of master and student.

184
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,228
First came our founder,
the first Hokage.

185
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:52,265
Then his younger
brother, the Second.

186
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:54,168
The Will of Fire
was then passed on

187
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:56,372
to the Third Hokage,
who also oversaw

188
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,979
the training of the legendary
Sannin, Master Jiraiya, Lady

189
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,316
Tsunade, and Orochimaru.

190
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,725
Tsunade was mentor to Shizune,
Orochimaru to Anko Mitarashi,

191
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,430
and Jiraiya to the Fourth
Hokage, all of whom

192
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:11,300
had pupils of their own.

193
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,474
The Fourth, for example, was
teacher to me, Kaktashi Hatake.

194
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:18,814
And right down here are
my own adorable students,

195
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,518
Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura.

196
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:24,624
Although Sakura's a
student of Tsunade's now,

197
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,184
Naruto picked quite a
bit up from Jiraiya,

198
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:30,721
and we haven't heard a word
from Sasuke since he left.

199
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,624
It's kind of lonely, actually.

200
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:34,692
What about you?

201
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,694
You're not looking
for a sensei, are you?

202
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:39,096
I'll cut you a good deal.
