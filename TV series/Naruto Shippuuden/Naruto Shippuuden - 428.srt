1
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:02,033
[humming]

2
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,264
{\an1}Hey Mom... I'm going out.

3
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,830
{\an1}You're what? No way, mister!

4
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,763
{\an1}You gotta eat first.
It's all ready!

5
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:17,630
{\an1}By the way, did you look
through your dad's papers

6
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,263
{\an1}without permission again?

7
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,762
{\an1}I know how interested you
are in that stuff, but

8
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:23,296
{\an1}you're not even a jonin yet!

9
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:28,595
Seriously?!

10
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:40,593
{\an1}I guess they aren't
coming to get me today.

11
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:46,358
{\an1}That cannot be true!

12
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:48,225
{\an1}You are not really like this!

13
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,158
{\an1}What was that about, anyway?

14
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:54,291
{\an1}It's like they were making
me out to be the bad guy.

15
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,989
{\an1}No, no, no! I can't let
myself get swayed

16
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,023
{\an1}by a bunch of fakes!

17
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,623
{\an1}Damn it. Maybe this
is proof that this

18
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,689
{\an1}world is affecting me!

19
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,755
{\an1}I have to find a way to get
back home somehow.

20
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,321
{\an1}I hate having to ask
someone, but there's

21
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,754
{\an1}just no other choice.

22
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:15,687
{\an1}If anyone here knows about
genjutsu, then it has to be...

23
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,086
{\an1}So what brings you here?

24
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,587
{\an1}I have something that I
really need to ask you.

25
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,119
{\an1}You know a lot about genjutsu,
don't you, Sensei?

26
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,119
{\an1}[gasp] Genjutsu?!

27
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,419
Sensei, what?

28
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,817
{\an1}Why, yes, I do! I'm so glad
that you asked me! I mean, I

29
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,783
{\an1}can't actually use genjutsu,
but I just adore them!

30
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,384
{\an1}Huh?! You can't use them?!

31
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,083
{\an1}Of course I can't! That's
why I'm obsessed and collect

32
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:41,583
{\an1}all kinds of data on them.

33
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:43,682
{\an1}Anyway... Come in, come in!

34
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,549
This is amazing!

35
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:54,080
{\an1}So what do you want to know?
Where should we begin?

36
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:57,780
{\an1}How about the most beautiful
jutsu? Or the most majestic

37
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:01,280
{\an1}jutsu? Or maybe the most
terrifying jutsu?

38
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,979
{\an1}I'm not looking for anything
that crazy! All I want is to

39
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,978
{\an1}know some methods
to undo them!

40
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,646
{\an1}Oh, well that's too bad.

41
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:11,112
{\an1}For example, what do you do
when the usual release jutsu

42
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,710
doesn't work and
you can't rely

43
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,278
{\an1}on help from your friends?

44
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,645
{\an1}[sigh] Wow, that's a very
difficult question.

45
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,676
{\an1}Um, maybe it's possible if
you're more powerful than

46
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,410
{\an1}the jutsu user, but...

47
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:23,477
I thought so.

48
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:29,342
{\an1}Hey, wait! What if you were
to somehow injure yourself?

49
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,375
{\an1}Would that jolt you out
of the genjutsu?

50
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,706
{\an1}No, I can't really recommend
that either. There are some

51
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,607
{\an1}genjutsu that inflict pain
over and over again.

52
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,206
{\an1}Rather than releasing the
genjutsu, you might injure

53
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,339
{\an1}yourself so much that
you'd become an

54
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,306
{\an1}invalid in the real world.

55
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,038
{\an1}[sigh] Yeah, I understand...

56
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:57,538
{\an1}Could I get a large plate of
sesame dumplings, please?

57
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:59,437
{\an1}Sorry, but we only have
plain dumplings.

58
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,802
{\an1}Okay, I'll have a large
order of those, then...

59
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,769
{\an1}Oh, man, what am I ever
gonna do to get myself out

60
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,868
{\an1}of this situation?! I
have no idea what

61
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:10,068
else I can try!

62
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,701
{\an1}What's wrong? Seems
like you're in a

63
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,667
{\an1}bad mood, as usual.

64
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,833
{\an1}I saw that big commotion in
the park yesterday. You were

65
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,567
{\an1}the one fighting against
those others, weren't you?

66
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,733
{\an1}Oh, yeah, that...

67
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,065
What happened?

68
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,633
{\an1}It's kind of a long story,
but basically I'm trying to

69
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,731
{\an1}find a way to undo a
genjutsu cast by a

70
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,598
{\an1}higher-level shinobi.

71
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:37,398
{\an1}That's if there even
is a way...

72
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:41,197
{\an1}You know, I did hear
something a while back.

73
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,531
{\an1}Oh really, you did?!

74
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:45,029
{\an1}Well, when you travel around
doing business as much as I

75
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,062
{\an1}do, you hear a lot of things!

76
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,429
{\an1}I seem to remeber there's a
shinobi who's skilled at

77
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,395
{\an1}that kind of thing in
the Hidden Rain.

78
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:54,661
{\an1}Here. This is a map of the
Hidden Rain Village.

79
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:56,927
{\an1}Huh? I can have it?!

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,994
{\an1}Maybe it's fate that both
our paths have crossed.

81
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:04,160
{\an1}Here, take it. A shinobi can
get there in a few days.

82
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,925
{\an1}He says that like it'll be
easy, but there's no

83
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,092
{\an1}alliance between the
Rain and the Leaf.

84
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,024
{\an1}If I go there without
authorization, I'll be

85
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,657
{\an1}branded as a rogue ninja.

86
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:22,789
{\an1}But I have no choice!
I've got to get back

87
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,257
{\an1}to help everyone!

88
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,217
And where do you
think you're going?

89
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,584
{\an1}They were waiting
for me? Why?!

90
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,450
Binding Syrup!

91
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,082
{\an1}There's no use resisting.
Give it up.

92
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:15,582
I can't believe
you'd betray us.

93
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,681
Huh?!

94
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,414
{\an1}Search through her
belongings.

95
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:20,881
You got it.

96
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:23,413
What're you guys
talking about?!

97
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh! What's this?

98
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,013
{\an1}Give that back to me! What's
going on? I don't have a

99
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,912
clue what you
guys're looking for!

100
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,778
Look, you don't
have to pretend.

101
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:34,745
{\an1}We received intel long ago
that the Hidden Rain Village

102
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,512
was planning an
attack on the Leaf Village.

103
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,311
And that the one
helping them was lying

104
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,777
low in the Leaf.

105
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,910
{\an1}And there's more. When we
were tightening security...

106
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:46,010
{\an1}...we were also tipped off
that you had been acting

107
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:48,042
{\an1}very strangely lately
and might even be

108
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,276
{\an1}planning to desert the
Hidden Leaf Village.

109
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,243
{\an1}Just wait a minute! I
know nothing about that!

110
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:55,841
{\an1}You're gonna deny it even
though you had this?

111
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,740
{\an1}A secret missive addressed
to the Hidden Rain.

112
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:09,306
{\an1}We'll learn more when we
interrogate her. Take her away!

113
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,140
Right!

114
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,206
{\an1}Wait! I don't know
anything about this!

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,405
Nothing at all!

116
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:31,668
{\an1}I heard that she was going
to betray our village!

117
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:34,002
{\an1}Disgusting. Just how
low can you get?!

118
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,701
{\an1}<i>I'm not some traitor like</i>
<i>they say! Even that map...</i>

119
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,435
<i>It was him!</i>

120
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,501
{\an1}<i>He gave me that map</i>
<i>in order to frame me!</i>

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,999
{\an1}Which means that he must be
planning something horrible

122
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:53,266
{\an1}<i>right now! I have to let</i>
<i>someone know!</i>

123
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,432
{\an1}Everyone! Listen-!

124
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:03,097
{\an1}I misjudged you, idiot!

125
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,930
{\an1}Tell the truth! Is this what
you meant by not caring

126
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,364
{\an1}about the village?!

127
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,896
{\an1}Just stop! That's
enough, Hinata!

128
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,659
{\an1}Come on, keep moving!

129
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,858
{\an1}<i>I guess I shouldn't expect</i>
<i>them to react any other way.</i>

130
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,791
{\an1}<i>Damn it! What am I worried</i>
<i>about?! These guys aren't my</i>

131
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:44,624
{\an1}<i>friends or anything! Who</i>
<i>cares what happens to</i>

132
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,990
{\an1}<i>this fake village and</i>
<i>all the phonies in it!</i>

133
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:53,356
{\an1}<i>Anyways, they took my</i>
<i>scroll. I wonder what's</i>

134
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,989
{\an1}<i>going to happen to me now.</i>

135
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,055
{\an1}Tenten, down here!

136
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,753
That's Lee!

137
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,687
{\an1}Are you okay, Tenten?

138
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,153
{\an1}From the look of it you seem
to be in a real dilemma.

139
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,419
{\an1}Come on, I wasn't
trying to peek!

140
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,852
{\an1}Neji, calm down! If we are
discovered, there will be

141
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,185
hell to pay!

142
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,818
{\an1}Right, I'm sorry...

143
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:24,917
{\an1}Anyway, listen, guys.
Why're you here?

144
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,084
We wanted to say
sorry about earlier.

145
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:29,484
{\an1}But if we had defended you
in front of everyone else,

146
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,883
{\an1}then it would have
made it much more

147
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,950
{\an1}difficult to come
and see you.

148
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,949
{\an1}Thanks, but why did you
come here now, then?

149
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:41,014
{\an1}That is simple! We could not
allow ourselves to ignore a

150
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:42,714
{\an1}comrade in trouble!

151
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:45,014
{\an1}We still believe in you,
Tenten. And we wanted to

152
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,548
tell you that.

153
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,780
{\an1}But I said that you guys
weren't my friends.

154
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:51,746
{\an1}Do not be worried
about that at all!

155
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,313
{\an1}As if we would believe you!

156
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,912
How long have we
all been together?

157
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,612
{\an1}Yes, Lee's right. Ever since
we graduated the

158
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:01,378
{\an1}Academy, it's been
every single day!

159
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,710
{\an1}You wanted to become a
shinobi like Lady Tsunade,

160
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,677
{\an1}one of the Legendary Sannin.

161
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,910
Neji wanted to
change his destiny.

162
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,709
{\an1}And I wanted to prove that I
am a supercool grown-up

163
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:17,641
{\an1}shinobi even if I am not able to
perform ninjutsu even a bit.

164
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:23,774
{\an1}Every day, even if there was
wind, rain, storm, or snow.

165
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,108
{\an1}On our birthdays, at New
Year's, during summer,

166
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,640
{\an1}and even on Christmas.

167
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,474
{\an1}We three kept at it
honestly under Guy Sensei's

168
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:32,006
{\an1}over-the-top guidance.

169
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,906
{\an1}We never gave up then, and
we will not give up now!

170
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,005
[chuckle]

171
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:40,772
Tenten?

172
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:44,572
{\an1}It's nothing. It's true,
though. To Guy Sensei,

173
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,538
everything is a
training exercise.

174
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:51,237
{\an1}[chuckle] Yes, he
really is annoying.

175
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,471
{\an1}Neji! Guy Sensei is
a nice grown-up!

176
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,369
He is cool!

177
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,336
You sure?

178
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:57,836
Yes, he is cool!

179
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,470
{\an1}What a strange feeling,
having this conversation

180
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,335
{\an1}here in this world.

181
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,601
{\an1}Maybe even in a fake
world, our feelings

182
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,633
{\an1}can be authentic.

183
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,633
Lee, the guards
will be back soon.

184
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,599
{\an1}Do not worry, Tenten!
We will go and

185
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,933
{\an1}find the real culprit!

186
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,899
{\an1}Hold on! The guy who set me
up disguised himself as a

187
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,598
{\an1}traveling merchant.

188
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,631
{\an1}Be really careful, okay, you
guys? I'm sure that he's

189
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:25,764
{\an1}going to use this
opportunity to stir up

190
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,298
{\an1}some kind of trouble.

191
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,964
I understand. We
will warn everyone!

192
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,029
Good luck, guys.
And thank you...

193
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,591
An attack! We're
under attack!

194
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:10,424
{\an1}Damn it! Where did all
of them come from?

195
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:13,524
Bastards!

196
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:23,422
{\an1}Lady Hinata, are you all right,

197
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,988
{\an1}Why did the Rain attack so
suddenly? I thought that all

198
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,021
they were doing
was spying on us!

199
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,987
{\an1}Hinata, over here!

200
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,287
{\an1}A Summoning Formula?

201
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:40,585
{\an1}So then, they've been set
up around the Village

202
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,553
{\an1}to summon the enemy, huh?

203
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,351
Damn it!

204
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:54,983
{\an1}Oh no! Lee and the others!

205
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:08,915
It's him!

206
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,613
Why are you--?

207
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:13,548
{\an1}I found out all about this
guy and this situation

208
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,514
{\an1}thanks to reading the intel
that my dad had received.

209
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,280
{\an1}And ever since you first
started acting strangely,

210
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,180
{\an1}Tenten, I've been
secretly tailing you and

211
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,778
{\an1}watching over you.

212
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,910
{\an1}I didn't notice you
following me at all.

213
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,608
{\an1}But the whole time I
was watching you,

214
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:45,309
{\an1}the only thing you did was
research genjutsu.

215
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,141
{\an1}And when you were captured,
I realized that this guy was

216
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:51,041
{\an1}the real conspirator
against the Leaf.

217
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,507
{\an1}I'd hoped to stop things
before this...

218
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,507
{\an1}But then they activated
the summoning formula.

219
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,372
This is--!

220
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:09,305
{\an1}It's important to
you, isn't it?

221
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,471
{\an1}Before I came up here, I
spoke to the higher-ups

222
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,337
{\an1}about the conspirator
I caught.

223
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,037
{\an1}And they agreed to
release you, so you're

224
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,438
free to go now.

225
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,969
{\an1}Why'd you do this? I
mean, I could desert

226
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,303
{\an1}the village again!

227
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:26,035
{\an1}To be honest, I can't quite
figure you out. I don't

228
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,135
{\an1}really know how to put it.

229
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:32,801
{\an1}I feel like you're Tenten,
but not the Tenten I know.

230
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,301
{\an1}And you keep talking
about going home.

231
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:40,699
{\an1}So I believe that your
actual home is somewhere far

232
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,966
from this world.

233
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:48,799
What's that?

234
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,231
{\an1}Menma, can you hear me?

235
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,265
That's Lee!

236
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,596
{\an1}Please hurry! All of
you get out of here!

237
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,728
{\an1}A giant Summoning Beast
is on a rampage

238
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,928
{\an1}close to the Academy.

239
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,960
{\an1}Everyone is trying to fight
it off, but at this rate.

240
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:16,194
We need your
help right away!

241
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,727
All right.

242
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,326
{\an1}I have to go. You should get
back to where you belong.

243
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,958
It's true. I'm
not from here.

244
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,992
{\an1}There's a lot of people
I want to save.

245
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,557
{\an1}I need to get home soon.

246
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,557
{\an1}I believed that I didn't
care about this world.

247
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,091
But still...

248
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:42,490
{\an1}Please, let me go with you!

249
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,722
{\an1}Look, I'm sure that I
can help you guys.

250
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,621
{\an1}Super Expansion Jutsu!

251
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:01,454
{\an1}You're mine! [attacking yell]

252
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,851
-[screaming]
-Choji!

253
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:14,385
Tenten!

254
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,251
What happened?!

255
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:18,917
{\an1}Why're you here?!

256
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:21,949
I was cleared
of all charges.

257
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,517
{\an1}I'm going to help
fight, too!

258
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,150
{\an1}Now that is more like it!

259
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:30,648
{\an1}Yeah, all right! So let's
all go and stop that thing!

260
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,648
{\an1}Your fighting spirit's
commendable, but this is

261
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:33,882
where I come in.

262
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,515
Oh, Menma!

263
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,847
{\an1}I just knew that you'd
come to save us!

264
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,647
{\an1}Everyone, get back.

265
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,380
Right!

266
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,446
[angry roar]

267
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:58,743
{\an1}The Leaf's Tailed Beast?!

268
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,344
[defiant roar]

269
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:06,742
Amazing!

270
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,510
{\an1}Yep, that's Menma for you!

271
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,509
{\an1}Go, Menma! Downbeat 'im up!
Show it who's boss!

272
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,741
[defiant roar]

273
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:19,774
{\an1}It ends here. The Hidden
Leaf will be destroyed!

274
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,306
[growl]

275
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,305
{\an1}What is going on here?!

276
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,137
{\an1}No way. We can't stop
another one of those things!

277
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,569
{\an1}You're right. And if it
gets any closer, then...

278
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,236
{\an1}I'll take it from here.

279
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,668
{\an1}What are you talking about?!

280
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:54,468
{\an1}What are you doing?! You
can't handle that thing?!

281
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,533
{\an1}We have to retreat or
those flames will get us!

282
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,867
{\an1}Please, Tenten, you
have to run away!

283
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,333
{\an1}Run away? Never. I've
already made up my mind.

284
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:15,365
I'll stop it!

285
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,065
{\an1}I am going to save everyone!

286
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,292
{\an1}What you did was nothing
short of amazing!

287
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,657
{\an1}I can't believe you took on
a powerful enemy like that

288
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,125
{\an1}and stopped them cold!

289
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,724
{\an1}I'd say you're the top
weapons handler of our era!

290
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:03,290
{\an1}When it comes to Ninja
Tools, no one else is

291
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:05,090
{\an1}anywhere close to you.

292
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:07,090
{\an1}I thought that we were
goners for sure!

293
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,156
{\an1}Thank you so much
for protecting us!

294
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:11,289
{\an1}Don't mention it. I only
wanted to do what

295
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,056
{\an1}I could to help out!

296
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,921
{\an1}<i>That's right. It's just like</i>
<i>I'd always hoped. I was able</i>

focusing on, there, Bee?!

445
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:30,610
{\an1}Let's settle all of this
nonsense with these!

446
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:34,409
{\an1}Lady Tsunade! You can't be
serious?!

447
01:09:34,442 --> 01:09:38,041
{\an1}We're dealing with three
Jinchuriki, here, remember?
We can't have them

448
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:40,041
{\an1}rampaging through the
village!

449
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:42,842
{\an1}All right, then! Odds or
evens, a single round!

450
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:47,474
{\an1}If I lose, you're free to
go wherever you like.

451
01:09:47,507 --> 01:09:50,606
{\an1}Lady Tsunade! If this is the
plan, then please, let me do
it!

452
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,139
{\an1}You just stay out of this,
Shizune! Don't you spoil
my fun, you hear?!

453
01:09:55,172 --> 01:09:57,272
{\an1}Uh, I mean, this is the
Hokage's job!

454
01:09:57,305 --> 01:10:00,739
{\an1}Yes, but your gambling
skills aren't really what
you'd call "the best..."

455
01:10:00,772 --> 01:10:02,037
<i>I'd like to... </i>

456
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,271
Huh?

457
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:05,838
{\an1}... examine the dice first,
please.

458
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:07,404
Fine. Here.

459
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:13,603
Shukaku.

460
01:10:13,637 --> 01:10:15,235
{\an1}Right. You got it.

461
01:10:19,168 --> 01:10:20,635
{\an1}Okay. They're good.

462
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:22,401
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, did
you just see-?!

463
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:24,701
{\an1}Oh, put a damn sock in it,
Shizune!

464
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:27,001
[gasping]
Okay...

465
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:30,333
{\an1}Well, then...
let's begin.

466
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:31,700
All right!

467
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:39,632
[yelling]

468
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:44,532
{\an1}Uh, oh... She's shaking it
too much!

469
01:10:44,565 --> 01:10:48,531
[yelling]

470
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:51,763
{\an1}Place your bet! What is it?
Odd or even?!

471
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:53,530
{\an1}Even!

472
01:10:53,563 --> 01:10:55,263
{\an1}Even, okay?

473
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:58,996
{\an1}Right. And I'm odd! The
bets have now been placed!

474
01:10:59,028 --> 01:11:02,962
{\an1}The winner is...!

475
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:06,160
{\an1}Oh, boy... I rolled snake
eyes.

476
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:10,159
{\an1}I don't feel so good...

477
01:11:10,193 --> 01:11:12,326
[groaning]

478
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,927
{\an1}What's up with this
raccoon dog?

479
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,994
{\an1}It's called cheating!

480
01:11:15,026 --> 01:11:16,859
[growling]

481
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:20,792
How about this?

482
01:11:21,692 --> 01:11:23,157
[screaming]

483
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:23,825
Quick! Run!

484
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:24,958
{\an1}Move it, Octopops!

485
01:11:24,992 --> 01:11:26,291
{\an1}No bra...

486
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,591
{\an1}Get yourself together!

487
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:28,690
This way!

488
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:30,357
Hey, stop!

489
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:37,489
[grunting]

490
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,356
Whoa...

491
01:11:39,623 --> 01:11:40,688
{\an1}That went pretty well!

492
01:11:40,722 --> 01:11:42,188
{\an1}Went well how?!

493
01:11:42,221 --> 01:11:45,822
{\an1}We got the Nine Tails
Jinchuriki without a
scratch! We worked together,

494
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:47,654
{\an1}now we're pals, a
friendship match!

495
01:11:47,687 --> 01:11:48,821
Ramen...

496
01:11:48,854 --> 01:11:52,521
{\an1}I need ramen from
Ichiraku.

497
01:11:53,853 --> 01:11:55,953
{\an1}Yo, stand up! Gimme a fist
bump!

498
01:11:55,987 --> 01:11:57,653
Huh?

499
01:11:57,686 --> 01:11:59,585
{\an1}No, gimme ramen, you chump!

500
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:01,886
{\an1}Hey, you've got some real
potential!

501
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:02,752
{\an1}Hmm?

502
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,385
{\an1}C'mon, gimme a fist bump!

503
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:05,985
{\an1}Gimme ramen, ya chump!

504
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:07,384
{\an1}We're friends, me and you!

505
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:09,050
{\an1}Eatin' menma and char siu!

506
01:12:09,084 --> 01:12:10,384
{\an1}Let's help each other!

507
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,984
{\an1}Add an extra egg to my
order.

508
01:12:12,016 --> 01:12:13,149
Huh?!

509
01:12:14,617 --> 01:12:17,983
{\an1}We Jinchuriki should be
pals. That's right, each and
every one of us!

510
01:12:18,015 --> 01:12:22,883
{\an1}But now, we're far apart,
both guys and gals, and
we're feeling suspicious!

511
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,381
{\an1}You mean that you're
planning on finding the rest
of us?

512
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:27,882
{\an1}That's our plan, at least
for now.

513
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:29,715
Let's go!

514
01:12:43,011 --> 01:12:47,478
{\an1}I wanted to settle this
amicably, but the time for
talk has long passed.

515
01:12:47,778 --> 01:12:51,711
{\an1}You may use force if it's
necessary. Just make sure
you bring Naruto back before

516
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:53,110
{\an1}he crosses the border.

517
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:54,610
Right!

518
01:12:54,643 --> 01:12:58,476
{\an1}And what should we do about
the Jinchuriki from the
Cloud and Sand?

519
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,842
{\an1}I won't ask you to try to
capture them.

520
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:05,308
{\an1}We are talking about
Jinchuriki here. Seizing
three is near impossible.

521
01:13:05,342 --> 01:13:07,407
{\an1}Your priority's getting
Naruto.

522
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:10,808
{\an1}At this moment, the
Jinchuriki are traveling to
the northwest.

523
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:14,306
{\an1}Our best guess is that they're
headed for the Hidden
Waterfall Village.

524
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:14,907
Go!

525
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,306
Right!

526
01:13:20,205 --> 01:13:24,005
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts' power is
at less than one hundred
percent right now. And do

527
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:26,171
{\an1}you have any idea why that
might be?

528
01:13:26,204 --> 01:13:29,571
{\an1}I believe it's because most
of that power was stolen.

529
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,304
{\an1}Yep! Got it in one!

530
01:13:31,338 --> 01:13:35,537
{\an4}That's why their chakra
gets used up in no time at
all if they use their full
power.

531
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:38,469
{\an1}Their power was stolen?! But
who could do that?

532
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:39,669
The Akatsuki.

533
01:13:39,703 --> 01:13:41,436
{\an1}The Akatsuki...?

534
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:45,902
{\an1}Their plan is to use the
power of the Tailed Beasts
to change the world.

535
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:50,167
{\an7}We know of a princess who's
taking a stand to oppose the
Akatsuki.

536
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,901
{\an7}So our plan to counter them
is to protect her and take
back the Tailed Beasts' power.

537
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:57,666
{\an1}Huuuh. Where is this
princess?

538
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,733
{\an1}In a certain castle. But
first, we have to gather our
comrades together.

539
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:04,632
{\an7}We're going to contact all
nine Jinchuriki.

540
01:14:04,665 --> 01:14:08,831
{\an7}The Akatsuki are sure to
make their move during the
next full moon. We gotta be

541
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:10,664
{\an1}ready by then...

542
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:13,865
{\an1}We should avoid all major
routes.

543
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:14,996
My man.

544
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:20,430
{\an1}Hold on just a minute! Look!

545
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:25,462
{\an1}A tea stand? What's
the big deal?

546
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:29,294
{\an1}The big deal is that it's
not a tea stand, it's a
ramen stand!

547
01:14:29,328 --> 01:14:33,760
{\an1}<i>It's the Ichiraku branch on</i>
<i>this mountain pass! It's</i>
<i>world famous! </i>

548
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,726
{\an1}Please, control yourself for
now.

549
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,960
{\an1}But even when we get to the
Hidden Waterfall, it doesn't

550
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:44,860
{\an1}have any famous
shops like this one.

551
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:47,558
{\an1}Get a move on! Before they
catch up, we gotta be gone!

552
01:14:47,592 --> 01:14:50,158
{\an1}Aw, come on, guys...!

553
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,924
{\an1}Looks like they're already
here. Instead of scrambling,
why not hunker down and

554
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,356
{\an1}why not hunker down
and prepare for them?!

555
01:14:59,389 --> 01:14:59,989
Hm.

01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:15,634
[grunting]

596
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:19,701
Uh--

597
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:24,767
[roaring]

598
01:17:26,632 --> 01:17:29,065
{\an1}<i>Hey... where did they go?! </i>

599
01:17:29,965 --> 01:17:34,364
{\an1}They got away. Rather,
they made a tactical
retreat.

600
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:37,698
{\an1}Yeah, but I seriously doubt
that they've given up for
good.

601
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:41,430
{\an1}Hey, Eight-O! Is one time
the limit for a Tailed Beast
Lariat?

602
01:17:41,464 --> 01:17:43,996
{\an1}It seems so. Sorry, Bee.

603
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:48,262
{\an1}Don't worry about it, my
friend! All right, c'mon,
let's go.

604
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:50,862
Hm?

605
01:17:55,961 --> 01:17:58,694
{\an1}I guess that this isn't
the time to be eating, after
all...

606
01:17:58,727 --> 01:18:00,194
{\an1}No, of course not.

607
01:18:00,227 --> 01:18:01,561
[sighing]

608
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:08,159
{\an1}One Jinchuriki is hard
enough, but with three of
them working together,

609
01:18:08,193 --> 01:18:10,759
{\an1}ordinary methods just
won't work.

610
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:12,859
{\an1}Yes, but now it's become
apparent...

611
01:18:12,892 --> 01:18:15,925
{\an1}...that at least for the
moment, the Tailed Beasts
aren't able to release their

612
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,124
{\an1}full, original power.

613
01:18:18,157 --> 01:18:20,624
{\an1}It seems their chakra runs
out almost right away.

614
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:24,924
{\an1}I put a tracker on them.
We'll wait for
reinforcements for now.

615
01:18:24,956 --> 01:18:26,924
{\an1}We're okay, Captain
Yamato.

616
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,756
{\an1}Let's go after them!

617
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:33,489
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts may be low
on chakra, but this is still
Gaara and Killer Bee.

618
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:36,755
{\an1}We can't make any
mistakes. And besides...

619
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:45,420
{\an1}The Hidden Waterfall's just
as I expected. The scenery's
amazing.

620
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,985
But, Octopops...

621
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:49,486
{\an1}What are we gonna do now?

622
01:18:49,519 --> 01:18:53,251
{\an1}I mean, we don't even know
what the Seven Tails
Jinchuriki looks like.

623
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:57,351
{\an1}Chill, it's sure to work
out quick! Jinchuriki
are fans of arithmetic.

624
01:18:57,385 --> 01:19:01,684
{\an1}I hate arithmetic. Everyone
hates arithmetic. Stop
talking nonsense!

625
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:04,751
{\an1}Bee... Watch out. I sense
something ominous.

626
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:05,483
<i>Naruto! </i>

627
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,450
<i>Gaara! </i>

628
01:19:11,115 --> 01:19:13,916
{\an1}<i>Wait, that's... Itachi.</i>

629
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,347
{\an1}The Akatsuki.

630
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:22,915
{\an1}That's them, huh?

631
01:19:22,947 --> 01:19:27,180
{\an1}Every member of the Akatsuki
possesses a unique and
fearsome ninjutsu.

632
01:19:27,213 --> 01:19:32,579
{\an1}And Itachi also wields the
Sharingan and can put Tailed
Beasts under genjutsu.

633
01:19:32,612 --> 01:19:35,412
{\an1}So don't look directly into
his eyes...

634
01:19:36,845 --> 01:19:40,578
{\an1}We've become aware that a
group of Jinchuriki have
joined together and are

635
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:42,677
{\an1}behaving suspiciously.

636
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:46,510
{\an1}We, the Akatsuki, cannot
overlook that, so we'll stop
you.

637
01:19:46,544 --> 01:19:50,309
{\an1}Yo, listen to this, fool, ya
fool! You just straight-up
stole our line!

638
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:53,075
{\an1}So what's the situation
Akatsuki, what's your
design?

639
01:19:53,109 --> 01:19:54,408
[chuckling]

640
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:56,909
{\an1}Do you guys really want to
tangle with us?

641
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:00,041
{\an1}Leave that one to me. I'll
handle him.

642
01:20:00,074 --> 01:20:02,707
{\an1}An even three on three.

643
01:20:02,741 --> 01:20:04,407
{\an1}Yeah! That sounds
perfect to me!

644
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:08,339
{\an1}Now, just hold your horses,
you guys! We Jinchuriki get
into formation, fight with

645
01:20:08,373 --> 01:20:12,139
{\an1}coordination, dance in joint
collaboration, and-

646
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:14,605
[yelling]

647
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:17,205
{\an1}Wait, Naruto! I'll take
care of that one!

648
01:20:19,937 --> 01:20:23,805
{\an1}Well... looks like I get to
take you on.

649
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:24,738
Hmm...

650
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:31,836
{\an1}For some reason, I really
want to take you down.

651
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,235
{\an1}I'll beat you at your own
game! Humph!

652
01:20:34,436 --> 01:20:36,235
{\an1}Wrong! Not if I can help it!

653
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:41,768
{\an1}Hey, Itachi! Sasuke left
the Leaf Village to go after
you! So what are you gonna do?!

654
01:20:57,698 --> 01:21:00,799
Wake up, Naruto!
It's a genjutsu!

655
01:21:03,264 --> 01:21:06,097
{\an1}We don't want a brawl! We
just want safety for us all!

656
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:06,930
Heh.

657
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:08,996
Hah!

658
01:21:09,496 --> 01:21:10,962
{\an1}All right! Acrobat!

659
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:14,429
{\an1}For Jinchuriki! Lifelong
security!

660
01:22:50,913 --> 01:22:52,881
{\an1}Gimme a fist bump!

661
01:22:52,913 --> 01:22:58,379
{\an1}For us, simply existing
fills people with fear. And
with resentment and hatred.

662
01:22:58,413 --> 01:23:00,545
{\an1}That's our fate as
Jinchuriki!

663
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:04,712
{\an1}Fool ya fool! Your destiny
is something that you just
gotta see through, no matter

664
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:07,878
{\an1}what! We're all Jinchuriki,
just like you!

665
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:13,376
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Killer Bee
Rappuden: Part 2"

666
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,643
{\an1}We don't resent you, fear
you, or hate you.
