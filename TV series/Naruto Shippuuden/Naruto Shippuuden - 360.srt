1
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,015
{\an1}Oh! Hey, there, Kakashi!

2
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,585
Come and join us
for some dumplings!

3
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,621
Huh?

4
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:10,594
{\an1}<i>Me, a jonin leader</i>
<i>in charge of genin?</i>

5
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:15,665
<i>Minato Sensei...</i>

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,801
{\an1}You're late, Obito!

7
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,705
{\an1}You finally got here!
So, you're Obito, huh?

8
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:22,874
{\an1}We've been waiting!

9
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:25,175
Made it...

10
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,844
Sure, but you're
super late!

11
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,112
{\an1}Well, we're all done with
our self-introductions.

12
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,248
Other than
yours, that is.

13
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,518
{\an1}I'm the future Hokage!

14
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,386
Obito Uchiha!

15
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:39,089
I'm gonna get my
trademark goggles as well

16
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:41,124
as my Sharingan
carved into my

17
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:43,627
Great Stone Face
for all to see!

18
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,163
That way I'll be
able to glare down at

19
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,098
{\an1}all the other villages!

20
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,399
[sigh]

21
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,201
{\an1}I'll scare the hell out
of all of them with my

22
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:54,137
{\an1}Sharingan stare! And
no one will dare attack

23
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,705
our village!

24
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,909
{\an1}Put in that request after
you become Hokage and

25
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,076
{\an1}activate your Sharingan!

26
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,179
{\an1}Besides, they can't carve
the Sharingan if you're

27
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:03,213
wearing goggles!

28
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,482
{\an1}They can carve 'em on
top of my goggles!

29
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,284
{\an1}But then it'll look
like your eyeballs

30
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,585
are popping out!

31
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:10,287

32

[sad sigh]

33
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:12,857
Anyway...

34
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,558
{\an1}I'm glad someone on
the team shares my

35
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,426
{\an1}dream of being Hokage!

36
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,662
I'm Minato. I'll
be your superior.

37
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:19,697
{\an1}It's nice to meet you!

38
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,164
Yeah it is!

39
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:23,901
{\an1}[chuckling] All right, let's
have our first practice

40
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,635
{\an1}session together, you guys.

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,537
Oh! Okay!

42
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,707
{\an1}In this exercise, I
want to see how good

43
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,241
{\an1}you are with teamwork.

44
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,545
Teamwork, huh?

45
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,448
{\an1}All that you have to do is
take these bells from me,

46
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,150
{\an1}and practice will be over.

47
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,518
{\an1}Simple enough, right?

48
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,020
{\an1}But if there are only
two bells, then...

49
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:44,956
Huh?

50
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,256
{\an1}That's exactly right!

51
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,190
[gasp]

52
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,092
Huh? But what
does that mean?!

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,533
{\an1}One of us won't get a bell
and will be off the team.

54
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,969
Wait, what?!

55
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,771
{\an1}Excellent observation!
Okay...

56
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,305
Let's begin.

57
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:06,711
{\an1}All right, I'm going to be
your jonin leader, and my

58
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:07,745
name's Kakash-

59
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:09,547
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei, right?

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,616
Look, never mind
the formalities!

61
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,951
Let's just get
started already!

62
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:16,486
{\an1}The chance that you'll
fail at this task is over

63
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,188
{\an1}sixty-six percent.

64
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:21,324
{\an1}<i>Back during that training</i>
<i>session, I honestly wasn't</i>

65
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,828
{\an1}<i>really thinking of teamwork.</i>

66
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,698
{\an1}<i>And Minato Sensei...</i>
<i>didn't even notice it!</i>

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,102
{\an1}Great! All of you passed!

68
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,476
But we can still
improve our teamwork,

69
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:39,911
{\an1}so let's work on it!

70
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:40,410
Right!

71
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,479
Yeah!

72
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,821
{\an1}In other words, one of you
three will not get a bell

73
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,056
and will be sent
back to the Academy.

74
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,460
{\an1}<i>It's no wonder Minato</i>
<i>Sensei didn't notice.</i>

75
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,696

<i>with the team, but really I</i>

76

{\an1}<i>just used the other two.</i>

77
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:10,206
{\an1}<i>I know he's taking</i>
<i>it easy on us...</i>

78
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,544
{\an1}<i>But Minato Sensei's</i>
<i>way too skilled.</i>

79
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,245
{\an1}<i>I can't do this alone.</i>

80

81
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,048

[attacking yell]

83
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:22,887
{\an1}Whoa! At this rate, you're
never going to get them!

84
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:26,657
{\an1}<i>I knew it. Minato Sensei is</i>
<i>making allowances for our</i>

85
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,392
{\an1}<i>individual skill levels!</i>

86
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,064
{\an1}<i>Compared to how he is</i>
<i>against Obito and Rin...</i>

87
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,637
{\an1}<i>When he's up against me...</i>
<i>he doesn't ease up as much.</i>

88
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,207
{\an1}<i>He's right: at this</i>
<i>rate, I'm definitely</i>

89

{\an1}In order to complete
this mission...

91

Obito! Rin!

92
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,182

learned at the academy!

94

Huh?!

95
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,357
{\an1}I don't know, Kakashi. I
doubt a simple formation

96
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,526
{\an1}like that one would work
against Minato Sensei.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,794
Just do it!

98
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,898
{\an1}Well, I suppose it's
worth a try, am I right?

99
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,267
{\an1}I guess that it's better
than doing nothing.

100
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,970
Okay, I'm in!
Now let's do this!

00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,074
I know.

157
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,677
{\an1}There's no way I'll allow
people who can't work

158
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,246
{\an1}together as a team
to become shinobi!

159
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,284
No matter what
anybody else says!

160
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,561
{\an1}Now then I wonder how
this year will turn out?

{\an1}[yell] I am in the spring
of youth at full power!

{\an1}No wonder he's a jonin.

166
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,986
{\an1}He can dodge my taijutsu
with such ease!

167
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,955
{\an1}I know! I thought that
graduating from the Academy

168
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,690
{\an1}made us full genin.

169
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,260
{\an1}Failing now is just
way too embarrassing!

{\an1}Because my dream is to
become a splendid shinobi

{\an1}only through taijutsu!

{\an1}I will not abandon
my dream!

177
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:53,852
Ridiculous...

178
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,987
However...

179
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:57,956
I'm not going
to quit, either!

I'll never throw
in the towel!

That's right!

182

I've nearly
become the kunoichi

183

{\an1}I've always admired!

184

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,873
{\an1}This is exactly how
youth should be!

Even if all of
your energy...

...is almost
completely gone.

{\an1}You push through!

{\an1}I wasn't about to let myself

{\an1}You know it's good we
didn't get that sensei

206
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,631
{\an1}everyone talks about.

207
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:14,766
Huh?

208
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,303
{\an1}Tenten, are you talking
about that jonin who sent

209
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,938
{\an1}the three candidates before
us back to the Academy?

Mm-hm!

00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,143
{\an1}Luck doesn't matter if
you have real strength.

212
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,278
{\an1}Those guys simply
weren't good enough,

213
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,879
and that's that.

214
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,015
{\an1}I don't know; that's
not what I heard.

215
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,051
{\an1}I guess that jonin was
talking about something

216
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,452
that's even more
important than a

217
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,553
{\an1}shinobi's strength.

218
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,522
What did he
mean by that?

219
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,958
{\an1}Like... some kind of
super-lethal, one-hit

sure about this?

00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,512
{\an1}Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
eat the bento lunches...

{\an1}Look, you guys, give it
a rest! Just trust me!

00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,749
Have I ever been
wrong before?

227
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,985
Uhh...

228
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,430
{\an1}Yeah, but Kakashi
Sensei's gone.

229
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,300
{\an1}Quit nitpicking, all right?!
Look, just listen to me!

230
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,835
{\an1}You're supposed to
follow the rules!

231
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,774
{\an1}You're right, in the Ninja
World, those who break the

232
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,378
{\an1}rules and laws are
regarded as scum.

233
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,030
But still...

234
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,400
{\an1}Those who would abandon
even one of their friends

235
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,368
{\an1}are far worse than scum.

236
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,772
Obito... I...

237
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,676
Kakashi Sensei!

238
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,744
Huh?

239
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,881
{\an1}I'm sorry, sensei. I failed,
but my kid brothers...

240
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,450
{\an1}They both followed
the rules!

241
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,985
{\an1}The three of you...

242
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,455
Each of you did
obey my orders.

243
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,724
You stuck to the
rules, that's true.

244
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,994
{\an1}But you didn't follow the
unwritten rule, the thing

245
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,629
{\an1}that's most important
to a shinobi...

246
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,165
{\an1}And what's that?!

247
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,466
Why you old-!

249
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,073
{\an1}You'll find out when you all
go back to the Academy.

250
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,881
Huh?

251
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,750
Taking a pass on
the Chunin Exams?

252
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,820
{\an1}Wow, really, Guy? That's
unusually cautious of you!

253
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,221
I know...

254
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,860
Huh? The
Chunin Exams?

255
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,597
{\an1}That's right. The way it
works is if you complete

256
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,298
{\an1}over eight missions
you qualify to

257
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,734
participate in
the Chunin Exams.

258
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,703
{\an1}There haven't been any
rookies in the Chunin

259
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,438
{\an1}Exams for a while now.

260
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,643
What do you say?
You wanna go for it?

261
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,943
[gasp]

262
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,548
Huh? What's the
matter, Lee?

263
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,515
Well...

264
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,285
{\an1}Yes, I would like very
much to test myself

265
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,220
{\an1}and test my strength...

266
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,889
{\an1}I would definitely
like that.

267
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,457
And yet...

268
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,726
And yet... what?

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,329
{\an1}I do not deserve to! At
least not at my present

270
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,432
{\an1}level. I know my own
capabilities best!

271
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,034
[sigh]

272
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,536
And you, Neji?

273
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,039
{\an1}[chuckle] I think
I'll pass as well.

274
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,307
What?!

275
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,678
{\an1}But Neji, you'd make it
to chunin in no time!

276
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,614
{\an1}And that's why there's
no point in rushing it.

277
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,916
{\an1}Yes, I see! Tenten,
what about you?

278
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,586
{\an1}Then I'll pass too!

279
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,920
{\an1}I say that we train hard,
and then next time we'll

280
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,256
{\an1}all take the exams together!

281
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,324
You guys!

00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,764
{\an1}Having students like
them makes me so happy!

284
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,568
I never knew I
could be this lucky!

285
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,406
Dumplings! More
dumplings, please!

286
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,541
Coming right up!

287
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,809
{\an1}Okay, I really don't
get it but this

288
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,545
is so like you.

289
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,779
{\an1}By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you,

290
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,649
{\an1}what's it like being in
charge of fresh Academy

291
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,149
{\an1}graduates, anyway?

292
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,319
{\an1}Oh, that's right! This
is your first time doing

293
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,753
{\an1}that kind of thing!

294
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:29,788
Huh?

295
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,659
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi! Why don't you
come over here and join us!

296
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,694
We've got some
delicious dumplings!

297
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,034
{\an1}What's with him, anyway?

298
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,671
His eyes are as
cold as ever, like he

299
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,573
{\an1}never left the ANBU.

300
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,775
{\an1}He failed every one of them
again, just like last time.

301
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,379
{\an1}That's not what really
concerns me, though.

302
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,080
{\an1}That's right. That's not
such a big deal, but the

303
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,385
{\an1}darkness inside Kakashi's
heart is a real problem.

304
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,986
{\an1}Yeah... He's still
carrying it around.

305
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,156
{\an1}I mean, they were my
classmates, as well.

306
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,625
{\an1}And I grieved them...

307
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,562
{\an1}But still at some point,
you've got to move on.

308
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,664
Yeah, I know...

309
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,402
{\an1}I always knew that the bleak
atmosphere of the ANBU would

310
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,103
{\an1}make him become more
sullen and withdrawn.

311
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,640
{\an1}Lord Third! The ANBU
simply isn't for

312
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,509
{\an1}someone like Kakashi!

313
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,077
{\an1}I realize that it might not
be my place to say this,

314
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,112
{\an1}Lord Third. But...

315
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,350
{\an1}It must be said! We have
lost too many of our

316
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,917
friends already!

317
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,288
{\an1}Watching Kakashi.
It's as though he's in

318
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,157
a hurry to die!

319
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,459
{\an1}And that's the reason
why we came up with this

320
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,994
{\an1}idea of putting him in
charge of the genin.

321
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,863
{\an1}If he has subordinates
to look after we're

322
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,533
{\an1}sure he'll change.

323
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,438
{\an1}Huh, so you think the
same thing as well?

324
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:52,905
You mean?!

325
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,810
{\an1}I don't know. Maybe we three
never should've interfered

326
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,445
{\an1}in the first place.

327
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,880
{\an1}We all thought that if he
were away from the ANBU and

328
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,217
{\an1}instead were in charge
of young would-be

329
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,786
{\an1}shinobi things would
hold more promise

330
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,088
for him, but...

331
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,122
[gasp]

332
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,056
Lord Third!

333
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,391
{\an1}What, Lord Third?

334
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,360
{\an1}Oh, uh, Lord Third!

335
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,162
Please, sit
down, all of you.

336
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,031
Relax and finish
your tea.

337
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,433
{\an1}In fact, I'll have
a cup, as well.

338
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,942
{\an1}Ah, I think I see.
[chuckling]

339
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,911
{\an1}And just what's so funny?!

340
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,481
{\an1}You know, I've noticed
that you always treat

341
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,715
{\an1}us like we're little kids!

342
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:36,616
Asuma!

343
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,252
Oh... Forgive me
for laughing.

344
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,088
And I must admit
you're right, I do treat

345
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,356
{\an1}you like children.

346
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,526
[chuckle]

347
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,537
{\an1}Minato Sensei, is my way
of doing things wrong?

348
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,242
Kakashi Sensei!

349
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,277
Uh... Yes?

350
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,311
Good Morning!

351
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,218
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei! We
wanted to let you know that

352
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,889
{\an1}we're in charge of discipline
at the Academy now!

353
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,857
We know that
everything starts with

354
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,558
{\an1}a proper greeting!

355
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,360
And I'd say that
greeting was spot on,

356
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,761
{\an1}wouldn't you guys?

357
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:24,364
{\an1}Excellent job, all
of you! Keep it up!

358
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,833
Yeah!

359
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,400
{\an1}Now, please excuse us!

360
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,535
{\an1}Please, excuse us!

361
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,571
{\an1}Yes, please excuse
us! Have a good day!

362
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,641
Look, never mind
the formalities!

363
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,409
Let's just get
started already!

364
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,179
Those guys, huh?

365
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,681
{\an1}Hey! It's Kakashi Sensei!

366
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,217
Huh? You three!

367
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,424
{\an1}Thank you very much!

368
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,259
Uh... What?!

369
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,862
{\an1}We jus' wanted to say...

370
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,296
{\an1}Thank you for failing
us back during

371
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,064
{\an1}that training session.

372
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,767
Because of that,
we learned a lot!

373
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:01,735
Huh?!

374
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,970
{\an1}Before that day, we
always depended on our

375
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,572
{\an1}Big Brother too much
and never learned to

376
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,340
{\an1}stand up for ourselves.

377
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,176
{\an1}In fact, back during that
training, we really wanted

378
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,278
{\an1}to share both our
lunches with him!

379
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,014
{\an1}Afterward, we all realized
something: we should've

380
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,750
spoken up right
then and said what we

381
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,885
were feeling.

382
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:18,384
Right?

383
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,620
Yeah!

384
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,622
{\an1}I thought that I was
helping them out...

385
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,757
{\an1}But, actually, what I
was really doing was

386
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,225
{\an1}holding them back.

387
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,393
{\an1}I learned a lesson
that day, too.

388
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,063
So, anyway!

389
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:33,132
{\an1}We're really grateful
Kakashi Sensei!

390
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,137
Grateful? To me?

391
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,542
{\an1}A teacher trains his
students, of course,

392
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,445
{\an1}but at the same time,
learns from them.

393
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:49,215
{\an1}It is only through mutual
respect and growth that

394
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,086
{\an1}you can foster a true
teacher-pupil relationship.

395
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,456
{\an1}It's my sincere hope that
each of you will nurture

396
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,058
{\an1}such relationships
with your pupils.

397
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,963
{\an1}And of course I wish
that for Kakashi as well.

398
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:07,735
{\an1}Huh? Wait, Lord Third! Is
that what I think it is?

399
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,805
{\an1}Oh, my! This was supposed
to remain secret for now!

400
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,941
{\an1}But this is the list
of Academy graduates

401
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,744
{\an1}who will soon be under
Kakashi's tutelage.

402
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,179
{\an1}Seems like a group of
highly individual kids!

403
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,882
{\an1}<i>I'm certain that this new</i>
<i>batch of genin will be able</i>

404
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,751
{\an1}<i>to hold your interest.</i>

405
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:04,952
<i>Where are we?</i>

406
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,821
{\an1}<i>Naruto Uzumaki's house.</i>

407
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,457
<i>The orphan Lord</i>
<i>Forth left behind...</i>

408
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:14,095
{\an1}<i>Are you our Sensei? I'm</i>
<i>Naruto Uzumaki! And one day,</i>

409
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,630
{\an1}<i>I'm gonna be Hokage!</i>

410
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:20,734
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Squad 7."</i>

411
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:23,570
{\an1}<i>So, that kid's made genin...</i>
