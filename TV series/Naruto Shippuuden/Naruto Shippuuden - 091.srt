00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,020
-I take it the
preparations are complete.

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,060
-Yes, Lord Orochimaru.

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,050
-Good.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,200
Then at last I
will get a new body

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,030
and the world will
get what it deserves.

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,130
[laughter]

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,100
-Go, Kabuto.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,050
I can't tell you how much I'm
looking forward to your return.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,230
-Everything's ready, Yukimaru.

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,010
Time to go.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,000
-I wonder.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,020
Is there a place
I can go back to?

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,160
This place we're going to.

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,160
Have I been there before?

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,230
-Lord Orochimaru tells
me he's very much

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,020
looking forward to your return.

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,050
-But return to where?

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,100
Is this the place I'm
supposed to go back to?

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,050
-Lord Orochimaru has
such high hopes for you.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,020
You must do all you
can to live up to them.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,120

-That's enough slaughter.

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,140
If the rest of you want
to save yourselves,

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,170
you'll come work for me.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,000
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,427
All right.

31
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:53,010
Then.

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,468
Follow me.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,090
[laughter]

-(VOICEOVER) In order to
pull of Orochimaru's plan,

35
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,200
I need to draw out
Yukimaru's power.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,020
I must get results
from these tests

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,150
before handing
him over to Gurin.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
I must, no matter what it takes.

39
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,210
-You never know how many times
around it's going to take.

40
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,050
I guess it all depends on
where exactly you put it,

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,230
and how tightly you wrap it.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,180
You'd think that by now I
should know how many times it's

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,140
going to wrap around, but you
never know 'til you finish.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,220
-Hmm.

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,170
Let's go.

46
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,100
-It's almost time.

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,100
[theme music - in Japanese]

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,478
-Hehe.

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,090
-I just have to say, the
dumplings you serve here

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,210
are absolutely delicious.

51
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,030
Of course, with a lovely
thing like you serving them,

52
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
they couldn't be anything else.

53
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,120
-Oh, well, really, you
shouldn't say that.

54
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,160
-In fact, as good as
these dumplings are,

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,150
I bet you're even
tastier, aren't you?

[giggling]

57
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,100
-Finally made it.

58
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's get to work and
start training, Pervy Sage!

59
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,040
-Hang on.

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's wash off the dust
from our journey first.

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,230
-Yeah?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,120
-Remember, healing your arm is
part of the training process.

63
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,160
These hot springs are
great for broken bones.

64
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,190
-Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
-Besides, hot springs
are a lot of fun.

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,070
[giggling]

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,130
-Research.

68
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,040
Time for more research, hahaha!

69
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,140
-You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

70
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,230
I knew it.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,040
You've forgotten what happened
when Grandma Tsunade caught

72

you sneaking peeks
at the ladies--

73
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,130
-No!

74
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,070
I could have sworn this was
a co-ed bath last time I

75
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,010
was here!

76
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh, what the hell happened?

77
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,030
-Well, maybe they
changed their policy

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,180
because of guys like you.

79
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,020
-Oh, be quiet.

80
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,220
In all the time I've
been teaching you,

81
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,080
haven't you learned anything?

82
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,040
Why do you think I keep
doing this, anyway?

83
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,020
-Because you're a pervert.

84
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,050
-You idiot.

85
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,160
My research for
the Makeout Series

86
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,160
is a cover for Shinobi training.

87
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,020
I've trained myself
to go unseen by guards

88
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,210
who happen to be women.

89
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,010
-Keep telling yourself that.

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,140
-Uh, anyway, like I
said, this hot spring's

91
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,100
really for your broken arm.

92
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,130
Healing that is the first
step in the process.

93
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,110
-Oh, man.

94
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,080
This is such a waste of time.

95
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,060
Can't we just get on with it?

96
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,140
-You know, you really can
be annoying sometimes.

97
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,020
-Hmm?

98
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,458
-Hmm?

99
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,030
Just you never mind about this.

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,030
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,200
-I've been training
so hard lately

102
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,220
so I don't have to rely
on the Nine-Tails power.

103
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,120
Because what's the point of
having powers like mine if you

104
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,190
just end up hurting everybody
instead of helping them?

105
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,110
Nothing I've tried so
far has been enough.

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,110
Isn't there some kind
of long-range jutsu

107
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,090
you could teach me?

108
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,060
-Huh.

109
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,030
Well, listen to you, talking
like a veteran Shinobi.

-(VOICEOVER) I swore to myself I
wouldn't let anything like that

115
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,120
happen to Akamaru ever again.

116

117
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,110
-That's right, boy.

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,100
-Kiba.

119
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,220
What are you thinking about?

120
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,180
-I was just remembering how
our mission to rescue Sasuke

121
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,120
turned out, and if it's
really Orochimaru's hideout

122
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,180
we're headed for.

123
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,150
Well, I'm wondering if
this mission might not just

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,080
turn out the same way.

125
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,010
-What?

126
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,150
You getting nervous, Kiba?

127
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,190
-Not on your life,
Kakashi-sensei.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,220
Besides, with everybody talking
about how Shikamaru and even

129
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,200
Naruto were able to
beat the Akatsuki,

130
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,050
I want a chance
to show that I've

131
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,000
been training just
as hard as they have.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,090
-It's essential
that I demonstrate

133
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,000
the results of my
training as well.

134
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,040
-Huh?

135
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,190
-Unlike the rest
of you, I've rarely

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
been allowed the opportunity
of going on missions

137
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,200
with the group and
showing what I can do.

138
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,010
-Oh, come on.

139
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,170
Don't tell me you're still
upset just because you

140
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,090
didn't get to go on one mission.

141
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,070
-That, and the fact that
Naruto didn't recognize me

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,030
after all we've been through.

143
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,130
-Of course Naruto
didn't recognize you.

144
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,210
No one can even see your face
with that stupid thing over it.

145
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,060
-That shouldn't matter
to an old comrade.

146
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,090
-Come on.

147
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,050
The important thing is
that we're together now.

148
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,170
(VOICEOVER) They're
right, though.

149
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,120
I want to show what I
can do, too, if only

150
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,140
to make Naruto acknowledge me.

151
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,000
-(VOICEOVER) They've all become
so much stronger and more

152
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,100
dependable.

153
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,090
Hmm.

154
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,538
Even him.

155
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,210
-Pervy Sage.

156
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,110
I've gotten a little
stronger, don't you think?

157
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
-Huh.

158
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,120
Honestly?

159
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,060
You don't seem that much
different from the rookie

160
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,140
of three years ago.

161
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,120
-Huh, you think so?

162
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,050
-Well, maybe you're right.

163
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,220
If being smarter means
what you say it does,

164
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,110
I'll remain a fool
my entire life.

165
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,130
I'm going after him, and I'll
do it alone if I have to.

166
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,090
I'll create my own
incredible jutsu!

167
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,180
-So, Naruto.

168
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,080
Do you still feel the same way
as you did three years ago?

169
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,080
-I never go back on my word.

170
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,220
Because that's my ninja way.

171
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,060
-Hmm.

172
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,030
That answers that question.

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,100
(VOICEOVER) I felt that
way about a friend once.

174
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,030
All it brought me was a sense
of helplessness and regret.

175
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,000
Naruto's felt that, too.

176
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,140
For three years.

177
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,000
But he's never given
up on his friend.

178
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,190
He's never forgotten him.

179
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,200
He's continued to train.

180
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,030
He still nurses the same
desire to bring Sasuke back

181
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,000
to the Leaf, even at the
cost of his own body.

182
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,080
Heh.

183
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,070
Maybe the idiot has matured
in his own idiot way.

184
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,070
Just a teensy,
weensy little bit.

185
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
-You think so?

186
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,150
Yeah, but if I'm going
to bring him back,

187
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,110
I've still got to
get much stronger.

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,010
-Hmm.

189
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,000
(VOICEOVER) Maybe he can do it.

190
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,200
They say, wherever someone
is still thinking of you,

191
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,120
that place is your home.

192
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,110
-Hmm?

193
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,210
Ha.

194
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,090
Yeah.

195
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,000
-This must be one of the ANBU
Black Ops who sent the message.

196
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,090
What is it?

197
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,160
You sense something?

198
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,070
-We don't need to sense
anything, do we, Akamaru?

199
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,170
[bark]

200
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,010
-You can smell it.

201
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,140
There are going to be a
lot more bodies up ahead.

202
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,220
-Well.

203
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,100
I thought my nose was pretty
keen, too, but-- which way?

204
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,010
-This way.

205
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
-Keep on your toes.

206
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,468
-Huh?

207
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,230
What is--

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,090
-Oh-- somebody help me, please.

209
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,080
-A curse mark.

210
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,100
Orochimaru's curse mark.

211
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,110
Like on the ones before.

212
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,180
-(VOICEOVER) There's no
doubt we've discovered

213
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,060
Orochimaru's hideout, but
what the hell happened here?

214
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,030
-Faint traces of chakra.

215
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,040
There are two.

216
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,040
No, more.

217
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,090
There's a lot of them!

218
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,030
-Let's go, Kakashi-sensei!

219
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,517
-Yes.

220
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,030
There's no time to waste.

221
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,110
-All right, move.

222
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,140
But watch out for traps.

223
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,070
[gasps]

224
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,140
-How horrible!

225
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,060
-What the hell happened?

226
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,110
-It would seem they've
been fighting each other.

227
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,070
-They had a falling out?

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,080
-Let's find out from
them what happened.

229
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,060
[bark]

230
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,190
-What is it, boy?

231
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,190
-Oh, no.

232
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,110
-We'd have been
flattened if Akamaru

233
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,040
hadn't sniffed out
that escape route.

234
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,010
[bark]

235
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,457
-Haha.

236
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:46,160
Good boy, Akamaru.

237
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,160
-So they did lay
a trap, after all.

238
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,110
-Not for us.

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
-Huh?

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,120
-I doubt the enemy has any idea
we're even in the vicinity.

241
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,200
I think that trap was set
off to destroy the evidence.

242
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,100
To destroy the hideout itself.

243
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,150
-But all those
people still inside!

244
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,110
-Yeah.

245
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,080
Pretty ruthless, all right.

246
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,070
-Orochimaru.

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,050
He's going to pay for that.

248
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,030
[bark]

249
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,476
-Stop wasting time.

250
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:15,100
Move it!

251
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,010
-Well, in as much as we've
located Orochimaru's hideout,

252
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,120
we've achieved our mission.

253
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,030
-But we can't really say
it's been a success, can we?

254
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,090
-Hmm?

255
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,130
-We can't return to the
Leaf without having gathered

256
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,200
any information about his
current whereabouts and plans.

257
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,210
-He's right, Kakashi-sensei.

258
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,210
-There is one bit of
information that we've learned.

259
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,140
Well, that was a
timed explosion.

260
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,070
Whoever set the timer had
to have been here recently.

261
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,110
-What?

262
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,100
-You're right.

263
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,190
And if they're still
in the vicinity,

264
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,150
we should find out
what we can from them.

265
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,070
-Good.

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,040
Then it's decided.

267
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,090
Let's get after them.

268
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,110
-Leave everything to me.

269
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,130
My parasitic insects are masters
of picking up an enemy's trail.

270
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,020
-Hey, if anybody's a master
of tracking the enemy,

271
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,060
it's Akamaru here.

272
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,517
[bark]

273
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:07,140
-Yes!

274
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,190
And don't forget me.

275
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,080
-Where are we all
headed, anyway?

276
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,200
Where is she taking us?

277
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,190
-Huh.

278
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,180
Probably right
back to Orochimaru.

279
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,140
-If so, you know what
that means, don't you?

280
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,130
[laughter]

281
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,000
-No, don't do it.

282
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,220
Please, I'm begging you.

283
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,100
No!

284
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,210
[evil laughter]

285
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,230
Augh!

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,160
-I don't think we'll
survive another round

287
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,090
of his experiments.

288
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,200
-You can say that again.

289
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,110
-Yeah.

290
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,220
But he scares me.

291
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,020
That guy-- we're
going up against him?

292
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,170
-Right now, it's just the woman.

293
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,140
-Yeah.

294
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,230
Yeah, you're right.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,070
All we have to do is take the
woman out and we're home free.

296
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,110
-I'm for it.

297
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,030
-I say we kill her.

298
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,476
-Hey.

299
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,110
Who said you could take a break?

300
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,140
[gasp]

301
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,100
-That'd be me.

302
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,190
-One, two, three--

303
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,030
-We're through listening to you.

304
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
---four.

305
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,110
-We've taken a vote
amongst ourselves,

306
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,010
and we've decided
you're dead, lady.

307
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,220
-12, 13, 14, 15.

308
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,040
I count 16 of you.

309
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,010
Is that right?

310
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,030
-What, are you scared?

311
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,467
Hehehe.

312
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,070
Hey!

313
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,130
She's scared.

314
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,100
-Scared of you?

315
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,120
-You really think you
can defeat all 16 of us?

316
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,070
Foolish woman.

317
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,150
-I'll tell you what's foolish.

318
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,060
Going into battle
without carefully

319
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,180
assessing your
opponent's strength.

320
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,090
Crystal-Style.

321
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,140
Crystal Prison.

322
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,100
-My insects have
detected the enemy.

323
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,200
-Oh, man.

324
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,220
Those guys had no idea what they
were getting themselves into.

325
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,140
They weren't only
hopelessly outclassed,

326
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,170
they were hopelessly stupid.

327
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,110
[laughter]

328
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,010
-Are you trying to
say you're smarter?

329
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,210
So, are you coming, then?

330
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,060
-Well, I, uh--

331
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,100
-Yeah, of course we're coming.

332
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,050
It's not like we
were running away.

333
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,130
We were just avoiding
an unnecessary fight.

334
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,010
-(VOICEOVER) Hmm.

335
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,120
Well, I can't face Orochimaru
without any followers.

336
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,170
-I pledge my loyalty.

337
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,170
-There is no need.

338
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,200
Betray me, and you will die.

339
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,060
-A jutsu that imprisons
the victims in crystals!

340
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,180
-Earth-Style?

341
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,070
-I've never seen
anything like it.

342
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,140
-My insects suffered
the same fate.

343
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,100
-(VOICEOVER) No.

344
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,020
It can't be.

345
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,150
-All right, then.

346
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,000
Ready to begin your training?

347
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,040
-Yes, sir.

348
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,507
I'm good to go.

349
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:13,200
-OK.

350
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,080
To start things
off, I think we'll

351
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,020
try a simple jutsu
using your wind chakra.

352
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,060
-A simple jutsu?

353
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,110
-Mm-hmm.

354
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,200
Do you remember that
ninjutsu we were working on

355
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,220
during our last training period?

356
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,080
-Hmm.

357
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,230
Well, I remember we did
lots of different stuff.

358
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,180
-I mean the one in which
toads were involved.

359
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,110
-Oh, yeah!

360
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,040
-Yoo-hoo!

361
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,130
-Ahhh!

362
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,150
Yeah, that one got a little
weird for me, actually.

363
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,120
-Ah, you remember.

364
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,150
Good.

365
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I thought it might have
been too soon back then,

366
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,100
but I think you
can handle it now.

367
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,190
-Uh, really?

368
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,160
-It's a collaboration ninjutsu
in which two jutsu are combined

369
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,110
in order to make a
single, stronger jutsu.

370
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,040
-Ah!

371
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah, I know about that.

372
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,080
When we took on
that Akatsuki guy,

373
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,180
Captain Yamato combined
his Water-Style

374
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,000
with my Wind-Style to make
that Hurricane Vortex jutsu.

375
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,020
-Good.

376
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,120
If you know it, that
makes things easier.

377
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,140
Summoning jutsu!

378
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,070
-Oh!

379
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Jira, it's been too long.

380
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,160
-Ahhh!

381
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,120
-I apologize for having to
make you come so far, Gamariki.

382
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,180
-Oh, don't be silly.

383
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,200
Don't mention it.

384
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,060
Such old, dear friends
as you and I are.

385
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,200
-Ahh!

386
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,200
What's Gamariki doing here?

387
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,060
-Oh, Naruto, you're
here too, huh?

388
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,050
Hmm.

389
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,050
-Ugh.

390
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,070
-The two jutsu have
to be in perfect sync

391
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,100
for the collaboration
ninjutsu to work.

392
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,110
Yamato matched
your timing exactly

393
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,090
to produce his
Hurricane Vortex jutsu--

394
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,180
-Um, you can forget it.

395
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,170
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

396
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,000
No way he and I can
ever be in sync.

397
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,200
I mean, look at
him, he's hopeless.

398
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,110
-Hold on, hold on.

399
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm not the problem here,
I can tell you that.

400
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,040
And anyway, of all
the giant toads

401
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,140
you could have picked, why'd
you have to pick this one?

402
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,180
-Do you want to master
this new jutsu or not?

403
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,170
-Yes.

404
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,140
-So starting from
this moment, you

405
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,010
will be training with Gamariki.

406
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,050
And you'll keep on
training until your timing

407
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,100
and his are in
perfect synchronicity.

408
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,020
Understood?

409
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,100
[sigh]

410
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,130
-Well, if you insist, Jiraiya,
I guess we have no choice.

411
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,030
-Yeah, but, uh, wouldn't
this combination thing

412
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,120
be even more
powerful if you and I

413
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,130
combined our jutsu, Pervy Sage?

414
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,050
-The obvious problem
with that is,

415
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,000
I won't be around
all the time, but you

416
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,230
can summon toads
whenever you want.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,548
-Good point.

418
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,220
Yeah.

419
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
But, uh-- come on.

420
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,000
Is his jutsu really that strong?

421
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,090
-Huh?

422
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,090
Oh.

423
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,579
Gamariki.

424
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,050
Watch carefully.

425
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,210
-You'll be gentle, right?

426
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,090
-Hiya!

427
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,060
-Woah, man!

428
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,140
Guess you're a lot stronger
than I thought, Mr. Gamariki.

429
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,020
-Mm-hmm.

430
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,230
-Once our timing
was in perfect sync,

431
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,220
I let my chakra flow into
his Water Pistol jutsu.

432
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,040
[gulp]

433
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,110
-Your wind chakra should
work especially well

434
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,200
with his water chakra.

435
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,150
With practice, the two of you
will do even better than that.

436
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,050
-Better than that?

437
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,070
Well, all right then.

438
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,010
I'm ready.

439
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,518
Bring it on.

440
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,210
Let's do it.

441
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,070
-First we'll work on
your sense of rhythm.

442
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,180
-Hey-- what sense of rhythm?

443
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,190
-One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two.

444
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,190
One, two, one, two.

445
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,070
One, two, one--

446
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,090
-Ow!

447
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,030
-Ow!

448
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,150
-(VOICEOVER) This toad and me.

449
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,150
-(VOICEOVER) Me and this kid?

450
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,080
-I don't think this
is going to work.

451
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,030
-Oh, boy.

452
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,120
Is this going to be rough.

453
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,020
-You summoned me?

454
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,040
-Yes.

455
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,010
I thought perhaps it
was time to test you.

456
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,040
To see the level of
power you've achieved.

457
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,130
-I see.

458
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,060
[laughter]

459
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,080
-Not even a flicker of fear.

460
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,200
You're very confident
taking me on, aren't you?

461
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,230
-I'm ready.

462
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Any time.

463
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,230
Just say the word.

464
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,180
[theme music - in Japanese]

465
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,170
-That does it.

466
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,130
I quit.

467
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,170
I've had enough of this guy.

468
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,200
This training is a
total waste of time.

469
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,050
-Oh, get a grip.

470
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,000
Learning to combine
your Wind-Style

471
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,040
his Water-Style is
the key to achieving

472
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,200
the collaboration ninjutsu.

473
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,050
-Hey, if it can't be
done, it can't be done.

474
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,200
I need to find someone
more compatible with me.

475
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,030
-Idiot!

476
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,000
You can't summon anything
with your arm the way it is.

477
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,050
-That's what you think.

478
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,130
You're forgetting how fast
I can heal, Pervy Sage.

479
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,200
Next time.

480
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,090
Encounter.
