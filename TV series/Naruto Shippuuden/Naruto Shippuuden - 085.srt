1
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:18,053
-Fire style, Searing Migraine!

2
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:22,083
-Fire style?

3
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,094
-Choji!

4
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:36,005
Ino!

5
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,035
You OK?

6
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:39,025
-Mm-hm.

7
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:39,886
-Yep!

8
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:06,058
-Boy, you really are good.

9
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,100
[theme music]

10
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,243
Kakashi-sensei!

11
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,053
-Are you OK?

12
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,094
-Yeah.

13
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,203
Though I've performed
the Lightning

14
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:06,254
Blade four times, all
while using the Sharingan.

15
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,174
Can't let this drag on.

16
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,225
-They're good.

17
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,225
They work seamlessly together.

18
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:17,115
-Yeah, but Kakashi-sensei got
him, with he Lightning Blade.

19
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,086
Why isn't he dead?

20
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,096
-You're right.

21
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,136
I ran him straight
through the heart.

22
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,136
He should be dead already.

23
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,186
But instead, I took
down one of the monsters

24
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:29,137
that sprang from his body.

25
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,177
I suspect it died in his place.

26
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,047
-Probably.

27
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:39,098
Just look at the way he dodged
my Shadow Possession Shuriken.

28
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,218
He detached his arm, with what
looked like a beating heart.

29
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:45,239
And it was moving
all on its own.

30
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:48,249
-OK, so, what does that mean?

31
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,029
-Best guess?

32
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,150
Those dark figures with
him, not to mention

33
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,201
the masked guy himself,
all have separate hearts.

34
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:00,091
And yet all five
of them were his.

35
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,071
-What?

36
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,231
-That's impossible!

37
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:06,121
-One less, though,
thanks to Kakashi-sensei.

38
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,232
-You mean to take
him down permanently,

39
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:12,182
we need to destroy the
other four hearts he's got?

40
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,242
-Afraid so.

41
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:16,043
-Good eye, once again.

42
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:19,083
Each of these hearts
belongs to a shinobi

43
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:23,043
that I faced in battle
and got the better of.

44
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:29,254
They can easily be replenished--
with your hearts, for example.

45
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:31,234
-Now it makes sense.

46
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:34,075
He's tapping into the chakra
networks of the hearts

47
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:38,216
he's stolen, enabling him
to incorporate their chakra natures.

48
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:44,257
-Oh, by the way, you Leaf ninja.

49
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,037
You bury your dead, or what?

50
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,077
Because it'll be a
real hassle if you do.

51
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,117
Knowing Kakazu,
he'll totally want

52
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:56,217
us to go digging for
that cash cow of his.

53
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:58,258
It was already a downer, though.

54
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,198
Seriously, that
guy with the beard

55
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,218
went down like it was
nothing, you know?

56
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:05,039
Where the hell was
the fun in that, huh?

57
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:08,259
-Big talk, coming from the man
who got his head chopped off.

58
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,240
-Kakazu!

59
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,270
Shut the hell up!

60
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,260
So anyway, I know you're
looking for revenge,

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,071
but I think you're out
of your league here.

62
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,171
You three are just pups.

63
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:25,061
You must've been his
students, then, huh?

64
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,122
Well, with a loser like
that guy teaching you,

65
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:30,192
you're pretty much screwed.

66
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:32,163
-Don't insult Asuma-sensei!

67
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:33,222
-Choji!

68
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,123
-Aw, the loving bond
between teacher and student.

69
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,153
Heh. What a load.

70
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,184
-You piece of--

71
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,233
-Choji!

72
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:44,224
You're not all bent out
of shape over that chump?

73
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:45,214
Hm, fatso?

74
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,376
-Choji!

75
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,207
-Heh, heh!

76
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,029
Yeah!

77
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,099
-You moron.

78
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:31,220
Don't let him egg you on
like that anymore, OK?

79
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,131
-Sorry.

80
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,073
Huh?

81
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:39,662
Huh?

82
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,152
No--

83
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:53,894
-Choji!

84
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,254
[laughter]

85
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,211
-At this rate--

86
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:12,073
-Time to die.

87
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:20,064
Little brat.

88
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:20,755
Huh?

89
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,236
-Shikamaru!

90
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:49,278
-Pathetic little worms.

91
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,200
Just die.

92
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,146
-Heh, heh, heh.

93
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:54,226
So long.

94
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,226
Nice knowin' ya!

95
00:09:58,217 --> 00:09:59,087
Huh?

96
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,021
-Hm?

97
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:40,302
-Oh, boy.

98
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,133
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

99
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,254
-You OK?

100
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,224
-Uh-huh.

101
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,185
-Yeah, more or less.

102
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:02,175
[groaning]

103
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,246
-That was pitiful.

104
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,166
What happened there, buddy?

105
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,276
-You should talk.

106
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:14,217
I wasn't the one who
fell for a shadow clone.

107
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:15,196
-Oh, yeah, right.

108
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,096
You saw that?

109
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:20,167
-Shikamaru, what now?

110
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,207
-First thing we do is
get them on their own.

111
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,318
We have got to tackle
them individually.

112
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,158
-Agreed.

113
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:29,318
SHIKAMARU: Once their combo
attacks are off the table,

114
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:33,319
we can focus on destroying the
big guy's last four hearts.

115
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:35,169
KAKASHI: OK, then.

116
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,319
But for that to happen, one of
us will have to stall Hidan.

117
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:41,220
-I'll take care of it.

118
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,310
Listen, out of the four of us,
I've got the most chakra left.

119
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,200
And besides, I'm not any good
in a straight up fight, anyway.

120
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,251
With Mind Transfer Jutsu--

121
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,131
-Forget it.

122
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:52,231
It's too dangerous.

123
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:54,251
Your mind transfer
should always follow

124
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,231
after my shadow possession.

125
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:59,292
If you miss, you can't get back
to your body for a few minutes.

126
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,192
No.

127
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,103
It's too risky.

128
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,193
I'm going to do it.

129
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,253
-What?

130
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:11,324
-I'll get him with possession,
and head off with him.

131
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,093
-You sure?

132
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,314
How do you plan on trapping him?

133
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:17,254
We still need some
kind of diversion.

134
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:19,254
-Well, I could take
care of that part.

135
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,124
-No way, Choji.

136
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:24,155
If he so much as scratches
you and captures blood,

137
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,255
it's all over.

138
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,315
It'll be just like last time.

139
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:30,126
I head on attack is the
wrong way to go here.

140
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,226
Choji.

141
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,227
-Huh?

142
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:37,107
-You have to preserve
all your chakra.

143
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,307
Kakashi-sensei will need some
help with the other enemy.

144
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,298
I'll get a hold of him.

145
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:48,109
You guys can stay out of it.

146
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,179
And the diversion?

147
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,148
That'll be me.

148
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:53,149
I've got this.

149
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,100
I'll get a hold of him.

150
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,301
You guys can stay out of it.

151
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,211
And the diversion?

152
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,141
That'll be me.

153
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:12,121
I've got this.

154
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:21,113
-All right.

155
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:22,172
He's all yours, then.

156
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,253
Here.

157
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,134
-Thanks.

158
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,288
-Heh.

159
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:10,209
Not that again.

160
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:13,129
Are you scared of my
scythe and abilities?

161
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,911
Huh?

162
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,310
-You're dealing
with me right now.

163
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,132
-Uh-uh-uh.

164
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,345
A covert attack from a distance?

165
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,106
How pathetic!

166
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:28,189
-Ha.

167
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,270
Slowpoke.

168
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,671
Huh?

169
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,340
HIDAN (VOICEOVER): He threw
the blade with his shadow?

170
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:48,271
-No dodging it midair!

171
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,252
-All right!

172
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:57,243
-Heh.

173
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,332
You wish, kiddo.

174
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:03,254
As long as you watch the
shadows, this jutsu's worth--

175
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,233
what the--

176
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:09,324
-Now who's pathetic?

177
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,215
I don't hide in the shadows.

178
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:12,174
I become them!

179
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,355
Shadow Possession
Jutsu, complete.

180
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:26,226
-You stupid little--

181
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,177
-Shikamaru! Get going!

182
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,246
-Leave the rest to us.

183
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,337
We're counting on you

184
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:31,216
-Right.

185
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,298
Come on, pal.

186
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,188
We're going for a little stroll.

187
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,191
-Where are we going, kid?

188
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,232
Huh?

189
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:13,152
Splittin' up me and Kakazu
isn't gonna save you!

190
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,223
Damn you!

191
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:31,285
-Wasn't wise for
the kid to go alone.

192
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:34,295
He's underestimated Hidan.

193
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,205
He did show a lot
of promise, though.

194
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:41,315
He'd have commanded quite
a bounty down the line.

195
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:47,206
But today, that boy dies.

196
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:52,257
However, you were
correct about one thing.

197
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:55,247
I am strong.

198
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:03,348
The gap between our respective
battle experience is vast.

199
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:07,199
Those headbands you are
all wearing remind me

200
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:11,369
of the very Leaf shinobi
I ever faced off against.

201
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,310
The First Hokage.

202
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,300
-What?

203
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,160
-Huh?

204
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,301
-Just how old is this guy?

205
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:21,231
-So you are immortal?

206
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,221
-Naw.

207
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:26,291
There's no such
thing in this world.

208
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:31,252
I've just managed to prolong my
life by stealing and stocking

209
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:36,173
up on others' hearts before
mine can stop from old age.

210
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,306
-You think I'm gonna run?

211
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:00,186
Heh.

212
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:06,167
Your, uh, shadow jutsu.

213
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:10,207
It lasts about five
minutes, as I recall.

214
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:14,158
And it's just the two of us now.

215
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:16,198
You made this one
easy for me, boy!

216
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,148
Yah!

217
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:02,154
-Fire and wind style masks.

218
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:12,155
[laughter]

219
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,386
[yelp]

220
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:37,318
-If you're counting
the original,

221
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:41,209
my body holds up to five hearts.

222
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:45,389
Thanks to you, though, I'm
now in need of a replacement.

223
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,270
That's why I'll be taking yours.

224
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,362
-The preparations are complete.

225
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:11,213
Oh, how I've been
waiting for this.

226
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,203
Die!

227
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:22,314
[squish]

228
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:31,316
[theme music]

229
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,237
KAKASHI: You seem pretty
confident your partner will

230
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,276
come out on top.

231
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:06,234
But you two have really
underestimated Shikamaru.

232
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:09,283
He set out to win this fight.

233
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:14,142
There's no way he'd let Asuma's
sacrifice be for nothing.

234
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,291
This has all been one
big game of Shogi,

235
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:21,229
and you two were played like
pawns from the very beginning.

236
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,307
Next time, Shikamaru's Genius.
