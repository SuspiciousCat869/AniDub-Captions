1
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:20,338
-You came.

2
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:20,972
-Yeah.

3
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,607
{\an1}Are you all right?

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,441
-Yes.

5
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:24,174
-Hold on.

6
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:25,375
{\an1}Why are you here?

7
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,076
{\an1}You worried about Hotaru, too?

8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,844
-Hardly.

9
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,012
{\an1}It was just coincidence.

10
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,416
{\an1}Besides, these guys
didn't come for Hotaru.

11
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,183
{\an1}-What do you mean?

12
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,918
{\an1}Those guys, who are they?

13
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,427
{\an1}YAMATO (VOICEOVER): That mask.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,529
I see.

15
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:52,463
{\an1}Their real target is--

16
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:52,897
-Master!

17
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,702
{\an1}-Why are the Hidden Leaf here?

18
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,374
{\an1}-I'm going to need you
to let that girl go.

19
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:06,874
-No.

20
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,677
-OK, then.

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,879
{\an1}If that's how you
want it, then we'll

22
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:15,548
{\an1}just take her back by force!

23
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:16,348
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

24
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:24,354
{\an1}-Ninja Art, Super Beast Scroll.

25
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,466
-I'll take the
guy in the middle.

26
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,567
{\an1}You take the guys on
either side of him,

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,068
{\an1}and we'll attack together.

28
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:46,971
{\an1}-Got it, but these ANBU--

29
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,474
{\an1}-We'll let it play out.

30
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,107
{\an1}YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
We need to find out

31
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,108
{\an1}what they're doing here.

32
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:58,949
-Master--

33
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,985
{\an1}-Hidden Jutsu, Kirisame.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,362
{\an1}-What the heck's with this rain?

35
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:20,431
{\an1}-It's a jutsu that dissolves
any chakra it touches.

36
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:22,500
{\an1}It's called Kirisame.

37
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,835
-Why, you--

38
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:25,335
-Go.

39
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,238
-Stop it!

40
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:29,906
Back off!

41
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,306
-Let's go.

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,807
-Water whip!

43
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,048
{\an1}-Wood Style Jutsu!

44
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:55,626
-Master!

45
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:06,534
No!

46
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,974
{\an1}-That'll keep you
quiet for a while.

47
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:20,444
{\an1}-What the hell are you doing?

48
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,547
-Naruto!

49
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,381
Wait.

50
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,115
{\an1}Our team's on assignment.

51
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,784
{\an1}We've been charged with
keeping that girl safe.

52
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:32,487
{\an1}Please return her to us.

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,354
-That's right!

54
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,055
Hand her over!

55
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:39,326
{\an1}-You ninja, you're ANBU Black
Ops from the Hidden Mist.

56
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,459
{\an1}And you're after this man.

57
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:42,595
{\an1}Isn't that right?

58
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,797
{\an1}-They're ANBU Black Ops?

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,630
Wait a second.

60
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,770
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I get it now.

61
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,805
{\an1}Then that Utakata is--

62
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:58,073
{\an1}-Then Utakata must be
listed in the bingo book

63
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:02,911
{\an1}as a rogue ninja, and these men
have come here to capture him.

64
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:05,146
{\an1}-So let me get this straight.

65
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,815
{\an1}Those ANBU Black Ops guys
aren't here for Hotaru.

66
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,583
They want him.

67
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,887
{\an1}-She has nothing to do with you.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,454
{\an1}Please release her.

69
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,890
{\an1}-How about a deal?

70
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,357
{\an1}We'll trade her for him.

71
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,162
-No.

72
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,129
{\an1}We can't make that deal.

73
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,264
-What?

74
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:32,167
{\an1}-She seems to be very
attached to this man.

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,435
If we simply let
you take him away,

76
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,637
there's no doubt
she'll follow you.

77
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,305
{\an1}She'll be in danger,
and we'll be in trouble.

78
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,808
So we can't turn
him over to you.

79
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,344
{\an1}-Then we won't give give her up.

80
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:47,411
{\an1}-If we're forced to
resort to battle,

81
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,347
{\an1}our actions could
have far reaching

82
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,181
{\an1}effects, even full scale war.

83
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,783
{\an1}Are you willing to risk that?

84
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:04,092
{\an1}-The Hidden Mist?

85
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,764
-Captain Yamato?

86
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,306
{\an1}MALE VOICE: Men of
the Hidden Leaf.

87
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:22,806
-Huh?

88
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,545
{\an1}-I'm the commander of this unit.

89
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,180
Talk to me.

90
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:37,718
{\an1}I'm Tsurugi, head of the
Hidden Mist ANBU Black Ops.

91
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,420
{\an1}It's certainly not our desire
to escalate this impasse

92
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:42,922
{\an1}into a war between our nations.

93
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:46,357
{\an1}Perhaps it is still
possible to negotiate?

94
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,158
-It is.

95
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:47,792
I'm listening.

96
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,602
-I know you.

97
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,236
{\an1}-Let us meet alone.

98
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,805
{\an1}Just the leaders of
our two teams, I mean.

99
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,542
{\an1}And Utakata, as well.

100
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,010
{\an1}-I'll agree to that.

101
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,681
{\an1}You two, stay right here.

102
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:33,761
[theme music]

103
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,145
{\an1}-Then we're in agreement.

104
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:23,147
{\an1}Until you complete your
mission with the girl,

105
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,182
we will postpone
apprehending Utakata.

106
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:31,153
{\an1}-As soon as her safety is
guaranteed, I'll notify you.

107
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,787
{\an1}-Keep in mind that
should you fail

108
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,723
{\an1}to honor the agreement
that we've made here today,

109
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:39,425
{\an1}war between our nations
may be inevitable.

110
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:39,993
-I understand.

111
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,966
{\an1}-You guys are too much.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,868
I'll be doing
exactly as I please.

113
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:53,469
{\an1}-I don't think so.

114
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,838
{\an1}Until our mission ends,
you will remain with us

115
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,107
{\an1}under our supervision.

116
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,210
{\an1}After that, what you do is
between you and the Hidden

117
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,278
Mist.

118
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,978
-Very well.

119
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,580
{\an1}-Tell me, just what
did you do, Utakata?

120
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,253
{\an1}-That information is
none of your business.

121
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,387
-My apologies.

122
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,889
-I wish to speak
with him alone now.

123
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:19,590
-All right.

124
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:20,724
{\an1}I'll wait over there.

125
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,610
-What happened?

126
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,079
-How'd it go?

127
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,746
{\an1}-Oh, well enough.

128
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,483
-Where are they?

129
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:57,253
{\an1}-They're having a
private discussion.

130
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,753
-Is it true?

131
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:01,857
{\an1}I mean, is Utakata
really a rogue ninja?

132
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,356
-Yeah.

133
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:11,496
{\an1}-Look, don't cause us trouble.

134
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,235
Just surrender,
and come back home.

135
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,969
{\an1}-Why would I do that?

136
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,704
{\an1}Why would I go back
just to get killed?

137
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,839
{\an1}-The village has changed.

138
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,041
Our old nickname
no longer applies.

139
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,509
{\an1}We're not the Blood
Mist Village now.

140
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,477
{\an1}Things even seem peaceful.

141
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,046
{\an1}But the balance of power
between the five great nations

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,082
{\an1}remains extremely
tenuous and delicate.

143
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:39,253
{\an1}The importance of what you
possess increases, and research

144
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:42,221
{\an1}into its use has also increased.

145
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,156
{\an1}The village needs that
power, so you definitely

146
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,292
{\an1}won't be killed if you return.

147
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,726
Trust me.

148
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,660
{\an1}-I don't think I can
trust anyone anymore.

149
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,471
Master, no!

150
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,739
Please stop.

151
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:06,240
Please!

152
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,347
[scream]

153
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,655
-You know why.

154
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:29,257
{\an1}My master tried to kill me.

155
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,425
And that thing
that's inside me--

156
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,197
{\an1}-Boar, boar, monkey,
rat, snake, snake--

157
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,134
[scream]

158
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:51,107
{\an1}-Without question, I sacrificed
myself for the village.

159
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:56,178
{\an1}I trusted my master, and
did all that he said.

160
00:11:56,211 --> 00:12:01,481
{\an1}And in return, he betrayed
me and tried to kill me.

[scream]

162
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:05,819
-What?

163
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,592
This power!

164
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,094
Wait!

165
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:17,062
No!

166
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:18,529
No, stop!

167
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,931
Stop!

[roar]

169
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:29,537
-No, Utakata.

170
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,072
You're wrong.

171
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,140
Harusame did not
try to kill you.

172
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:34,808
{\an1}You must believe me.

173
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,310
{\an1}It wasn't like that at all.

174
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:41,547
{\an1}He performed that terrible
ritual not to bring you harm,

175
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,249
but to separate
that thing from you.

176
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:47,251
{\an1}He was trying to save you.

177
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:50,387
{\an1}-You actually think
I'm going to buy that?

178
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,689
{\an1}You're either lying,
or you've grown senile.

179
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,024
-It's true.

180
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:59,294
{\an1}-My master-- no, that man
used me and tried to kill me,

181
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,029
{\an1}and that's all there is to it.

182
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:05,966
{\an1}And then, as a result,
he ended up dying.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,401
{\an1}If you ask the villagers,
they'll all say that I killed

184
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,303
{\an1}him, even if I didn't.

185
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:13,305
{\an1}-Please, Utakata,
just come home.

186
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,007
Then you can see
everything for yourself,

187
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,141
{\an1}and you'll know that
I'm not lying to you.

188
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,342
-No thanks.

189
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,411
{\an1}-Then we'll have no
choice but to kill you.

190
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:22,112
You know that.

191
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:23,912
{\an1}-Do as you please.

192
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,015
{\an1}And I shall do as I please, too.

193
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:40,159
{\an1}-You're all right!

194
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:45,596
-Let her go.

195
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:46,097
-Yes, sir.

196
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,703
-Oh, master.

197
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:54,370
-That's enough!

198
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,408
{\an1}I told you already,
never call me that again.

199
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:08,881
{\an1}Do you understand?

200
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,684
{\an1}-Men of the Hidden
Leaf, as agreed,

201
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:16,154
{\an1}we will retreat for now.

202
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:20,323
{\an1}Let us hope that both our
missions will be successful.

203
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,658
However, we will
continue to watch

204
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,227
{\an1}you to make sure that
you honor our pact.

205
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:26,495
-Understood.

206
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,364
-Farewell.

207
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:28,863
Scatter!

208
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,002
-That was fun.

209
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,078
{\an1}Now, then, where do you
think we should go from here?

210
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:51,347
{\an1}-I believe that it would be best
if we avoid Tsuchigumo Village.

211
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,016
{\an1}-Yes, Sai, you're right.

212
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,918
{\an1}It's quite clear now the
place is no longer secure.

213
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:58,619
{\an1}Hotaru couldn't be
kept safe there.

214
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,254
{\an1}Perhaps we should return to Mt.

215
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:01,588
Katsuragi.

216
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:04,658
{\an1}There we'll be able to plan
what our next move will be.

217
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,692
{\an1}-I'd like to go back, too.

218
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:09,795
{\an1}I want to make sure
that Tonbee's OK.

219
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,531
{\an1}-But the ones who came
after the forbidden jutsu

220
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:14,099
{\an1}may also return there.

221
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:16,401
{\an1}It could be unsafe, as well.

222
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,702
{\an1}Let's meet up with
Tonbee and Sakura,

223
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:22,539
{\an1}then decide a course of action.

224
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,174
{\an1}And Utakata, you're
coming with us, too.

225
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:48,658
-Hey, you OK?

226
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,163
{\an1}-I wonder why he doesn't
want me to call him master?

227
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,136
{\an1}-A monstrous crime.

228
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,638
{\an1}He killed his own master, and
then fled from the village.

229
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,473
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER):
What could have happened

230
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:11,410
{\an1}between Sir Utakata
and his own master?

231
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,145
{\an1}NARUTO: There's no
way we can know what's

232
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:16,313
{\an1}going on with Utakata
and the Hidden Mist.

233
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,882
{\an1}But still, I don't
think that's important.

234
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:20,451
{\an1}I mean, if you've
already decided

235
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,885
{\an1}you want to be his
student, it doesn't matter.

236
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,119
-It does.

237
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:27,623
{\an1}I have to become strong,
and restore my clan's honor.

238
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,858
{\an1}So I have to learn from him.

239
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,226
{\an1}-I know what you mean.

240
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,595
{\an1}You just want him to teach
you everything he knows.

241
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,030
{\an1}-Well, it's not quite like that.

242
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,898
-Yeah.

243
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,332
I felt something
similar, myself.

244
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,836
{\an1}I don't remember my parents.

245
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,337
Not one bit.

246
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,506
-Oh?

247
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,076
{\an1}-Maybe that's why when I
traveled with the Pervy Sage,

248
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,511
{\an1}I wondered if that's
what it really

249
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:58,446
{\an1}felt like to have a father.

250
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,081
{\an1}And I'll admit it, I
acted like a spoiled brat

251
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:02,815
{\an1}with him sometimes.

252
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:06,085
{\an1}But the thing is,
training isn't easy.

253
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,853
{\an1}Not by a long shot.

254
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,222
{\an1}You have to think things
through for yourself,

255
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:13,659
{\an1}and you have to learn the
techniques by yourself.

256
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:16,893
{\an1}Otherwise, you'll
never get any better.

257
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:20,397
{\an1}If Pervy Sage hadn't
been my teacher,

258
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,399
{\an1}I wouldn't have even
figured out the basic stuff.

259
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,401
{\an1}You're not alone.

260
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,469
{\an1}The thought that someone's
near, that they're

261
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:32,172
{\an1}watching over you, that
can make you stronger.

262
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:33,773
-I understand.

263
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:37,510
{\an1}I really envy you, Naruto.

264
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:40,045
{\an1}So just like you say,
I'm going to think

265
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:44,683
{\an1}of Sir Utakata as my master.

266
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:45,617
-Huh?

267
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,750
{\an1}Hey, you look pale.

268
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:50,787
{\an1}-No, I'm-- I'm OK.

269
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,621
-Huh?

270
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,888
Hey.

271
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,692
{\an1}Hotaru-- you're burning up.

272
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,893
{\an1}And you're hurt, too.

273
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,194
{\an1}Is that from the fight?

274
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:05,699
Captain Yamato!

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,702
-Let me.

276
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,207
{\an1}I need some medicinal herbs.

277
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,509
Let me see.

278
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,545
{\an1}The dokudami plant should
be abundant nearby,

279
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,979
{\an1}around where it's damp.

280
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:27,382
{\an1}A purple plant, with
leaves shaped like a heart.

281
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:30,284
{\an1}-The purple is underneath
the leaves, right?

282
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,719
{\an1}-Yes, that's right.

283
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:32,686
-Got it.

284
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,592
{\an1}-So, what's wrong?

285
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,493
-Hotaru's ill.

286
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,428
{\an1}Please, leave it to me.

287
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:44,929
-All right.

288
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,037
{\an1}-If that plant grows
best in damp areas,

289
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,440
{\an1}I guess the river bank would
be the first place to look.

290
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:00,941
Huh?

291
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:01,975
There.

292
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,477
{\an1}That must be what
he's talking about.

293
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,348
Huh?

294
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,181
What?

295
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,883

What is that?

forbidden jutsu.

It was-- it was
engraved onto her.

{\an1}-How could they do that?

305
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:54,049
{\an1}-To hell with forbidden jutsu.

{\an1}To hell with our clans.

{\an1}To hell with our masters.

{\an1}They think of those beneath
them as mere vessels.

312
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:12,397
{\an1}As vessels with no choice.

00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:02,716
{\an1}-En no Gyoja left behind a way
to extract the forbidden jutsu.

317
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:05,685
{\an1}-It's clear to me that our
clan no longer has the strength

318
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,654
to keep the
forbidden jutsu safe.

319
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:12,390
{\an1}To prevent its misuse, we have
no choice but to destroy it.

320
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:13,491
{\an1}NARUTO: Destroy it?

321
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,860
{\an1}But what'll happen to
Hotaru if you do that?

322
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:21,297
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden, Heir to Darkness.

323
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,297
Dammit.

324
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,699
{\an1}There has to be another way.
