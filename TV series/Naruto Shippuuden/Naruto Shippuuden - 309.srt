{\an1}All right, which one of these

recklessly jump in front of him

that guy before?

{\an7}[Groan] They got separated from
the main company because of
those fakes. We're waiting on

{\an3}Yeah!

{\an1}You've changed so much I
didn't even recognize you!

23

Anyway, who is he?

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,007
{\an1}Oh, he's a reanimated samurai.
<i>And he's super strong.</i>

{\an1}Get back, shinobi!

29

{\an1}I bear no grudge against you

30

{\an1}But my body's being controlled.

31

{\an1}So at the moment, I have no say
in my own actions.

32

actually a true samurai. I
abandoned the Land of Iron ages
ago...

{\an1}I'm a displaced samurai, a
ronin. No, not quite. I...

Old Man Tatewaki?!

Hmm?

{\an1}You really know this guy,
Naruto?

{\an1}That's right! It's me, Naruto!

40
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:12,280
{\an1}So you're still alive, are you?

41

all right? Did they survive?

say that.

46

{\an1}Are we gonna have time to eat
before we go?

47
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:38,336
{\an1}Is food really the only thing
you ever talk about?!

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,673
{\an1}What if it is? What the heck are
you even doing here with us
anyway?

49

{\an1}For this mission, Naruto will be
joining Shikamaru's team.

50
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,111
{\an3}Huh?

51
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,448
{\an4}He is? All right, I guess. But
what exactly is this mission
that we're supposed to be going
on with him?

52
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,785
{\an1}Well, to put it bluntly, it's a
kidnapping.

53
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,153
[All] What?!

54
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:01,357
{\an1}<i>A young lord is being held</i>
<i>hostage in a castle in this</i>
<i>small nation.</i>

55
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:06,729
{\an4}<i>Your mission will be to kidnap</i>
<i>the young lord back from his</i>
<i>abductors without being</i>
<i>discovered.</i>

56
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:12,668
{\an1}So we sneak the guy out of
there, and then what? Are we
gonna demand a big ransom?

57
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,537
{\an1}Get real, would you? This is a
political situation.

58
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:19,208
{\an1}His homeland has a treaty with
the nation that kidnapped him.

59
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,145
{\an1}But his land wants to break the
treaty and ally with the Land of
Fire.

60
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:27,481
{\an1}And so, the mission is to
retrieve the young lord and take
him home...

61
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:30,517
{\an1}...so his abductors don't have
leverage over his homeland.

62
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:33,920
{\an1}All right, Granny, what rank is
this mission gonna be?

63
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,089
{\an1}Normally, a B-rank mission.

64
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:39,425
{\an1}But depending on how fortified
the castle is, it may become
A-rank.

65
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:44,363
{\an1}Yeah, all right! Now you're
talking! That makes this whole
thing worthwhile!

66
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:47,166
{\an1}Come on! We don't concern
ourselves with that stuff!

67
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,704
{\an1}Well, I warned them.

68
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,975
{\an1}They know that there's been
suspicious activity surrounding
that nation lately.

69
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:01,645
{\an1}And it has something to do with
the fact that his nation wants
to cancel the treaty, correct?

70
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:07,150
{\an1}If this mission goes awry, it'll
become an A or S-rank quickly.

71
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:12,256
{\an4}As an ANBU, you are to stay in
the shadows and watch their
backs to make sure that doesn't
happen.

72
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,957
Under what circumstances
should I reveal myself?

73
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,528
{\an1}I want you to gather intel on
any other suspicious activity,
as well.

74
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:21,664
{\an1}I'll leave it up to your
judgement.

75
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:23,798
Understood.

{\an1}You know, Sasori my man...

78
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,001
{\an1}The missions we've been
getting lately have been so
excruciatingly trivial.

79
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:21,439
{\an1}That's because we've been
accepting every little request
that comes our way.

{\an1}Pedestrian, mercenary jobs
only for money!

of art to them at all! Hmph!

82
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:34,217
{\an4}I agree completely, but
unfortunately we have no choice
but to listen to the
organization.

<i>Well look who's late!</i>

One of them is for profit, and
the other is war.

88
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,966
{\an1}Simply making money
doesn't interest me.

89
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,467
Me either.

90
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,504
{\an8}Then we'll take
the job for profit.

91
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:58,205
{\an1}Hey! You don't get to decide
all on your own!

92
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,807
{\an1}Ahh, I'm not interested in money
either you know.

93
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:08,848
{\an4}Well someone has to do it! And
Sasori and Deidara both prefer
war. Let's not bicker
unnecessarily about this.

94
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,785
{\an1}Yeah fine! But you guys
all owe me one!

95
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,355
{\an1}So, who are we fighting
in this war?

96
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:20,526
{\an8}It's one nation, and a
small one at that.

97
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,927
{\an1}And what's so special
about this nation?

98
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,365
{\an7}The political standing of a
small nation changes often.

99
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:31,802
{\an1}In any event, this request comes
from a large nation that wants
its territory.

100
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,871
How interesting.

101
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,544
{\an1}So that's the castle we
need to get into?

102
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,280
Yeah, and kidnap
the young lord.

103
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,483
{\an1}The real problem is keeping
anyone from knowing that we did
it.

104
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:51,921
{\an4}Wait, let me guess what the plan
is! We'll use Shikamaru's Shadow
Possession or Ino's Mind
Transfer Jutsu, right?

105
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:56,325
{\an1}All wrong. You and Choji are
gonna be the key players in this
mission.

We are?
What?

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,029
{\an1}Yeah. Choji, you'll enter a
contest that the lord will
attend.

108
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:04,499
{\an1}Normally, only authorized

to be me?

lose right away!

115
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,986
{\an1}Nope. Because the contest that
he's entering is actually a food
fight.

116
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,754
{\an1}It is? It's really a food fight?

117
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,825
{\an1}This should make you happy.
Simply put, Choji, it's a
competitive eating contest.

118
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,461
{\an1}Seriously?! You mean it?!

119
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:41,999
{\an1}Wow, Shikamaru! Entering an
eating contest as a mission is
like a dream come true!

120
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,935
{\an1}So what am I supposed to be
doing on this mission then?

121
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:49,639
{\an1}Well, while Choji's creating a
diversion in the contest, you'll
sneak into the castle.

122
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,374
{\an1}And you'll use Transformation

supposed to be some kind of
royalty.

128

{\an1}So if he does something like
ordering ramen for lunch, his
