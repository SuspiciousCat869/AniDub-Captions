1
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:58,670
{\an1}[scoff] This is a joke.
Any idiot can solve questions
like these.

2
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,472
[groaning]

3
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,674
{\an1}So what question are you going
to solve, anyway?

4
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,476
{\an1}Yeah right, like I would tell
you that?

5
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:13,312
{\an4}Everyone's stuck in a dilemma
because they don't know which
one of the questions they should
solve.

6
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:17,348
{\an1}They don't know which ones their
teammates are going to choose.

7
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,315
{\an1}Neji's planning something,
I can tell.

8
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:26,286
{\an1}Yeah, maybe. But why would he
tell a rival what he plans to
do? What's the point in that?

9
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,122
{\an1}<i>The method he plans to use</i>
<i>probably requires it.</i>

10
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,156
{\an1}You know which one you're doing?

11
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,858
{\an1}No, and I don't know about
my teammates either.

12
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,326
{\an1}What's that supposed to mean?

13
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:44,329
{\an4}But if there's a way to let them
know just how many points I'll
get, then I'll be able to solve
the question.

14
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,130
{\an1}[chuckle] That's a pretty big
if!

15
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,965
{\an1}I'll communicate the number with
vibartions.

16
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,302
{\an1}I'll send the four vibrations
through the wall.

17
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,337
{\an1}And relay the information
without leaving or destroying
the room.

18
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:03,873
{\an4}<i>But are you sure that just</i>
<i>hitting the wall will actually</i>
<i>get your message across to your</i>
<i>teammates?</i>

19
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,209
{\an1}How would you interpret four
knocks on the wall?

20
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,378
{\an1}Well, let me think. If I were to
hear four signals like that,
then...

21
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,146
[thudding]

22
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,315
{\an1}<i>I'd think our other teammate and</i>
<i>I should score forty points.</i>

23
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,484
{\an1}<i>If we both get forty, that's</i>
<i>eighty points.</i>

24
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,285
{\an1}<i>Then the one who signaled could</i>
<i>get...</i>

25
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:29,288
{\an1}<i>Fifty, forty, thirty, or zero</i>
<i>points...</i>

26
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,490
{\an1}<i>But none of those combinations</i>
<i>add up to one hundred.</i>

27
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,394
{\an4}So instead, I'd interpret the
signals to mean that the one who
sent them will complete the
forty-point question.

28
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:43,296
{\an1}<i>And the other two can do the</i>
<i>thirty-pointers.</i>

29
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,132
{\an1}<i>Oh, I get it. That makes</i>
<i>sense...</i>

30
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:51,334
{\an1}I wonder if Gennai and Inaho
will think the same way..

31
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,201
{\an1}Hope Minoki and Tanzo will
too...

32
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:59,705
{\an1}Each village picked three genin
for the teams that compete
here in the Chunin Exams.

33
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:03,307
{\an1}<i>Everyone just has to trust in</i>
<i>their teammates. </i>

34
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,510
{\an1}But why would you show all of
us how to do this?

35
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,779
{\an1}If I suddenly pounded on the
wall four times, what would you
think?

36
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:13,479
Oh. Well...

37
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,113
{\an1}I'd be suspicious.

38
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:21,116
{\an4}<i>Of course you would. And I</i>
<i>simply didn't want any of you to</i>
<i>do something to interfere with</i>
<i>me.</i>

39
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:26,353
{\an4}I figured that the best course
of action would just be for me
to come clean and let everyone
in on this.

40
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,322
{\an1}That way, we can all pass this
ridiculous paper test.

41
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:30,756
All of us?!

42
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,222
[gasps]

43
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:32,657
{\an1}So that's his plan.

44
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:36,359
{\an1}Everybody passes, huh? I guess
he really got you there,
Mr. Proctor.

45
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:40,894
{\an1}Well,...even so, I got a good
look at his leadership skills.

46
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,897
<i>All of us...?</i>

47
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:51,100
{\an1}I get it. And you're probably
right.

48
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:55,202
{\an1}But how about letting me be the
one to pass on the info to the
other classrooms?

49
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,504
Okay. But why?

50
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:03,140
{\an4}<i>I can't let the Hidden Lead do</i>
<i>all the work. I'll even take the</i>
<i>blame if the classroom is</i>
<i>damaged.</i>

51
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,508
{\an1}<i>So I just need to send</i>
<i>vibrations, right? </i>

52
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:06,476
Yes.

53
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,778

{\an1}Hey! That was five!

{\an1}<i>What're you doing?</i>

62

{\an1}<i>Everyone passes? Yeah, right.</i>
<i>You've gotta be kidding me!</i>

63
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,295
{\an1}What's the point of a test
unless someone's eliminated?!

64
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,396
{\an1}[growl] How dare you...?!

{\an1}Hey, what does that guy think
he's doing?!

67
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:47,566
{\an1}And it's too late to fix it!

68
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,267
{\an1}Send four more vibrations, and
you'll just cause confusion!

69
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,569
{\an1}It doesn't matter if you sent
five signals.

70
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:54,703
<i>What...?!</i>

71
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:59,271
{\an1}<i>Three times would've been fine</i>
<i>too. As long as the message gets</i>
<i>out, any one works.</i>

72
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:04,041
{\an1}Any one...?! Are you trying to
tell me that three, four, or
five would all be the same?

73
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,510
{\an1}Yes, that's correct. Well,
it'll be slightly different.

74
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,379
{\an1}<i>It simply means the question I</i>
<i>pick will change. </i>

75
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,346
What's that...?!

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,714
[gasps]

77
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:18,516
I get it...

78
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,052
{\an1}That was some kind of signal...

79
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,489
{\an4}And it's definitely more
efficient than just yelling
something out along with
everybody else.

80
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,123
{\an1}But why knock five times?

81
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,725
{\an1}I bet five signals is referring
to the fifty-point question.

82
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,359
{\an1}So what are we supposed to do?

83
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:36,827
I see...!

84
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:37,527
Huh?

85
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:44,798
{\an4}<i>To get one hundred points using</i>
<i>a fifty-point question, two</i>
<i>members need to solve the</i>
<i>fifty-pointer and the third</i>

86
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:45,965
{\an1}<i>member needs a zero. </i>

87
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,700
{\an1}<i>Whoever signaled can't solve the</i>
<i>fifty-pointer.</i>

88
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,702
{\an1}<i>That's what the message is</i>
<i>telling us.</i>

89
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:54,202
{\an1}What do you mean?

90
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,306
{\an4}<i>The remaining two have to select</i>
<i>the fifty-point or the</i>
<i>zero-point question but have no</i>
<i>way of knowing which to choose. </i>

91
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,308
{\an1}<i>He's signaling both teammates to</i>
<i>solve the fifty-point question.</i>

92
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,210
{\an1}Whoever signaled us is supposed
to get zero points, then?

93
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:14,214
{\an4}Yes, exsctly. We'll have to hope
that our other teammate will
think about the alternatives and
figure it out, too.

94
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:17,215
{\an1}Who do you think was the one
that sent the message, anyway?

95
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:23,085
{\an4}Honestly, I have no idea. But
whoever sent it to us got
everyone in that classroom to
agree.

96
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,587
{\an1}Otherwise, it would've been
impossible to do.

97
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:30,323
{\an1}That means everyone in the
classroom that signaled us will
earn zero points.

98
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:36,527
{\an4}<i>The reason is because the</i>
<i>message is telling the remaining</i>
<i>two members to choose the</i>
<i>fifty-point question. </i>

99
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,729
{\an1}Ah, ha! That is what it means!

100
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:43,063
{\an1}Still, opting to get zero points
is pretty gutsy.

101
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,733
{\an1}Even with three signals, my
intent would've been
communicated.

102
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,368
{\an1}In that case, I simply would've
answered the forty-point
question.

103
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:51,903
[growl]

104
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,470
{\an1}How do you figure?

105
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:58,672
{\an1}Because if the grouping is
thirty, thirty, and forty, to
get one hundred points total...

106
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,574
{\an1}...whoever sent the signal
wouldn't take thirty points.

107
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:07,343
{\an4}That would leave the remaining
two to choose between thirty and
forty points, and that won't
work.

108
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:13,414
{\an4}<i>Whoever sends the signals takes</i>
<i>the forty-point question,</i>
<i>leaving the thirty-point</i>
<i>questions to his two teammates. </i>

109
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:17,516
{\an1}[sigh] Damn you. Why didn't you
just explain that to us
earlier?!

110
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:21,518
{\an1}I was quite clear. I didn't want
anyone to interfere.

111
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,387
{\an1}I thought jutsu users who can
communicate silently with their
teammates...

112
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:29,390
{\an1}...would be able to foil my
plan to have everyone pass this
round.

113
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,323
[sigh]

114
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:31,990

right?

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,468
<i>those sounds. </i>

140
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,002
{\an1}So every team will score a
hundred points?

141
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,538
{\an1}<i>No, that's not necessarily true.</i>

142
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:16,350
{\an1}If they just think about it
calmly, then they'll all come to
agree with Neji...

143
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,184
{\an1}<i>But how calm can they remain?</i>

144
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,721
{\an1}<i>How much faith they have in</i>
<i>their teammates is another</i>
<i>problem altogether. </i>

145
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,923
{\an1}<i>What's the answer that you</i>
<i>prepared?</i>

146
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,357
{\an1}Huh? What's that?

147
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,491
{\an1}If you were taking this test,
what would you do?

148
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:35,494
{\an1}I'd just use my Shadow
Possession Jutsu, of course. But
then,...

149
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:39,530
{\an1}...this entire question wouldn't
even exist if I weren't the
proctor.

150
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:43,498
{\an1}That's why there's no point
whatsoever in me answering the
question.

151
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,566
{\an1}What's that excuse all about?!

152
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,869
{\an1}Look...it all boils down to
thinking carefully about your
teammates and the situation.

153
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:57,172
{\an1}<i>Still, there's bound to be a lot</i>

<i>Second Round a pain. </i>

154

{\an4}<i>I don't wanna make trouble for</i>
<i>the Hidden Sand. You see,</i>

<i>exam. </i>

155

{\an1}<i>Time's up. Everyone, flip over</i>
<i>your papers. </i>

156
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,584
{\an1}For the test's second part.

157
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:19,218
{\an1}[gasps] What now? Another part!

164
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,934
{\an4}<i>And the member who's named as</i>

written his own name down!

{\an1}Look, Sakura, Sasuke! I'll be
the decoy, so you two can make a
run for it.

179

{\an1}NARUTO,...NARUTO,...

a lot, you guys, for naming me
as the decoy!

you'd just write me!

{\an1}You're so mean, the both of you!

188

201
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,348
{\an1}We wanted to inform you of
something we discovered.

00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:17,351
[gasp]

203
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:24,956
{\an1}You don't need any proctors from
the Hidden Lead for the Second
Round?

204
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,959
No, ma'am.
The Hidden Sand would like to
handle everything ourselves.

205
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:30,358
Why's that?

206
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,094
{\an1}The site of the Second Round is
the Demon Desert.

207
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,361
{\an1}It's extremely dangerous even fo
r those familiar with it.

208
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:38,964
{\an1}For the sake of security, we ask
for your understanding.

209
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,100
{\an1}For whose security, exactly,
may I ask?

210
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,100
[gasp]

211
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,335
{\an1}Naturally, for the participants.

212
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:52,338
{\an1}The jonin in charge of the
entrants will accompany them to
the Hidden Sand Village.

213
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,372
{\an1}<i>That's not up for discussion.</i>

214
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,174
{\an1}<i>Yes,...That'll be fine.</i>

215
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:04,545
Your thoughts?

216
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,179
It's suspicious.

217
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:09,014
{\an1}Yes. The Sand's hiding
something.

218
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,949
{\an1}However, they are not the only
ones.

219
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,085
{\an1}What was the response from the
Hidden Rain?

220
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,953
{\an1}Danzo requested a meeting with
both of us earlier.

221
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,387
[gasp]

222
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,356
{\an1}Even though he's confined under
house arrest right now, he still
has connections.

223
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:35,629
{\an4}I trust that the both of you
are aware that I helped Hanzo of
the Salamander, the leader of
the Hidden Rain Village?

224
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,396
[grunt]

225
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:40,265
{\an1}That was back when you were
still in charge of the
Foundation.

226
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:46,268
{\an1}But I continued to communicate
with him secretly even after
I'd been ousted, as well.

227
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,236
{\an1}Danzo, do you mean to say that
you...?

228
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:52,739
{\an1}But Hanzo abruptly stopped
contacting me.

229
00:15:53,605 --> 00:16:00,010
{\an4}If he had stopped trusting me,
then I'm sure he would've lured
me out and killed me since I
know so many secrets.

230
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,243
But he did not.

231
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,179
{\an1}Something has happened to Hanzo.

232
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,080
{\an1}What do you suspect?

233
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,347
[slurp]

234
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,186
{\an1}I think there's been some kind
of clandestine incident in the
Hidden Rain Village.

235
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:21,055
{\an1}The worst case is that he's no
longer of this world...

236
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,354
Can't be!

237
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,724
{\an1}To the outside world, Hanzo's
still the leader of the Hidden
Rain.

238
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:30,526
{\an1}Please warn Princess Tsunade
that she must be extremely
wary.

239
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:34,562
{\an1}And to keep a close watch on
the entrants sent by the
Hidden Rain Village.

240
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,898
{\an1}That's what we are relaying.

241
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,766
{\an1}<i>For Danzo to ask this of you...</i>

242
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:51,872
{\an4}He may called a hardliner and
the darkness personified within
shinobi, but there's no doubt
that everything he does is for

243
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:54,207
{\an1}the for the sake of the Leaf.

244
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:58,542
{\an1}The Hidden Rain, huh...? We'll
have to increase our
surveillance.

245
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,543
{\an1}And think of the Sand...

246
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:06,346
{\an1}I'll inform the jonin in charge
of the entrants about all of
this.

{\an1}Those of you here have passed
the First Round.
Congratulations.

253
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:35,130
{\an1}Neji, you were the one who sent
us that signal, right?

254
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,964
{\an1}It's thanks to you that we
passed!

255
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,432
{\an1}Truth be told, that guy from
the Sand actully did it.

256
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:44,502
{\an1}How come all three of you got
through to the next round?!

257
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,369
{\an1}That's right. Wasn't the decoy
supposed to get disqualified?

258
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:53,540
{\an4}The rule just said that all
three had to have the same
answer. So our team didn't
choose anyone.

259
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,273
What?!

260
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,641
{\an1}We turned in blank sheets.

261
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,143
{\an1}Blank? All three of you?!

262
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:02,111
{\an1}Yeah! There's no way that we'd
ever sacrifice a comrade.

[groans]

264

passed with all three
members.

{\an1}Sorry, guys. I just couldn't
figure out that question!

268
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:17,720
It's okay!

269
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,555
{\an1}We coordinated things with that
in mind.

270
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,891
{\an1}Cool! I trusted you two and
didn't write anything.

271
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:25,424

{\an1}You can communicate mentally,
but that backfired on you,
didn't it?

277
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,967
{\an4}You see...Even considering
allowing one of your own
teammates to die was the wrong
answer right from the start.

Damn you...

00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:50,438
{\an1}I'm Temari of the Sand.
I'm in charge of Round Two.

280
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:55,607
{\an1}Too many teams passed the first
round, so we're going to have to
narrow things down even more.

281
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,110
{\an1}Just what do you mean by that?!

282
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:03,379
{\an1}<i>First, Round Two is also a team</i>
<i>battle. Any team without its</i>
<i>third member is disqualified! </i>

283
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:04,914
What?! No way!

284
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:08,982
{\an1}Furthermore, the upcoming round
of these Chunin Exams...

285
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,951
{\an1}...is to be held in the Hidden
Sand Village.

286
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,021
{\an4}<i>Although there's a clear route</i>
<i>between the Hidden Leaf and</i>
<i>Hidden Sand Villages, it will</i>
<i>take a shinobi three days,</i>

287
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,789
{\an1}<i>no matter how fast they are. </i>

288
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:28,294
{\an1}We've just dispatched a
messenger hawk to the Hidden
Sand.

289
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:32,862
{\an1}It's message reads, "After the
first thirty, all who follow are
disqualified."

290
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,997
[grumbling]

291
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,399
{\an1}<i>Finally, as in Round One,</i>
<i>fighting is prohibited en route.</i>

292
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:42,367
{\an1}<i>You can fight to your heart's</i>
<i>content in Round Two.</i>

293
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:44,203
That's all!

294
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:45,236
Lee! Tenten!...

295
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:46,369
[gasp]

296
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,406
{\an1}As always, he's quick to assess
the situation.

297
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,741
{\an1}What's wrong?! I just said
that's all.

298
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,442
[gasps]

299
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:57,475
Ino, Choji!

300
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,445
{\an1}Um, uh, what is-?!

301
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,080
I get it!

302
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,949
{\an1}This means that the
elimination's already begun!

303
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:07,648
[shouting]

304
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,817
{\an1}Couldn't you at least have said,
ready, set, go?

305
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:14,953
{\an1}This is the Chunin Exams.
Not the Academy.

306
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,553
Uh, what?

307
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,588
Hey, Yukata!

308
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:18,588
Hurry up!

309
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,490
{\an1}Next time, we'll just use an
ordinary scholastic
test...

310
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,095
{\an1}We should try to get there
first!

311
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,597
{\an1}But there's no advantage in
being the first to arrive, Lee!

312
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:39,766
[gasp]

313
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:41,567
Byakugan!

314
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,204
{\an1}There's another team up there
ahead of us.

315
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:47,905
What?! [gasp]

316
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,417
{\an1}Lord Kazekage...Round One of the
Chunin Exams is over.

317
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:16,387
{\an1}The participants are now
heading towards the Hidden Sand
Village.

318
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,421
Yes, I see.

319
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,324
{\an1}Prepare for Round Two.

320
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,879
{\an1}<i>The people targeting you are</i>
<i>stepping up their efforts. </i>

321
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,113
{\an1}<i>You'll just be playing into</i>
<i>their hands if you continue</i>
<i>this!</i>

322
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:10,217
{\an4}<i>I already know. But if I quit</i>
<i>because of that, it would be</i>
<i>like declaring that I will cave</i>
<i>under pressure. </i>

323
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:14,421
{\an1}<i>The Chunin Exams is where</i>
<i>everything began for me. </i>

324
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:19,290
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"The Night Before the Second</i>
<i>Exam." </i>

325
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:24,426
{\an1}<i>So I'm going to make sure these</i>
<i>Chunin Exams are a success.</i>
