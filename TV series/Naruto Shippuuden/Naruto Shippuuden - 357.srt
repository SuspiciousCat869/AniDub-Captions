1
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:58,030
Damn it!

2
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,939
As usual, your
Lightning Blade is as

3
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:13,742
{\an1}brilliant as ever, sir.

4
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:17,144
{\an1}Brilliant? There's no
such thing as brilliant or

5
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,479
{\an1}inferior in assassination.

6
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:22,682
Killing is
killing, that's all.

7
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:28,352
{\an1}By the way, what ever
happened with the

8
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,286
replacement?

9
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,055
{\an1}Our team is still
short a member.

10
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:34,324
{\an1}There isn't really a rush.

11
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:36,358
We're not in the
middle of a war now.

12
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,994
Someone'll show
up soon enough.

13
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,567
Hey, Kakashi!

14
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,102
What's going on?
You look so tired.

15
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:52,470
{\an1}Just finish a mission?

16
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,339
{\an1}Don't be an idiot, Guy! You
know that the ANBU aren't

17
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,673
{\an1}allowed to discuss
their missions!

18
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,608
{\an1}That's how it goes.

19
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:02,677
{\an1}Well, anyway, we're going
out for sweet dumplings.

20
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,645
{\an1}You want to join us?

21
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,913
Sorry, I don't
really like sweets...

22
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,817
He's become so
antisocial lately.

23
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:12,751
Huh.

24
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:16,020
{\an1}Maybe 'cause of the
secrecy in the ANBU.

25
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,789
{\an1}No! No way this'll stand!

26
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,690
Kakashi is my
lifelong rival.

27
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,991
{\an1}He has a heart that's
completely filled with

28
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,325
burning passion.

29
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,227
{\an1}I guess it's up to me!

30
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,329
{\an1}What's up to you?

31
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,164
Please let me
join the ANBU!

32
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,700
{\an1}It's the best thing
to help Kakashi!

33
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:37,968
{\an1}Guy, please, calm down.
I completely understand

34
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,337
your concern for
your friend Kakashi.

35
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,906
{\an1}But the saying "the right
person for the right job"

36
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,408
{\an1}applies here, I think.

37
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,610
{\an1}Your skills won't be well
used in the ANBU.

38
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,846
{\an1}It's not about what's
good for me, Lord Third!

39
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,380
{\an1}If I were Kakashi's
partner, I could--

40
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:56,616
{\an1}Silence! You simply aren't
suited for the ANBU!

41
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,485
{\an1}Huh?! [screaming]

42
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:06,523
{\an1}I can't believe he said
that I'm not suited...

43
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:09,725
Huh?!

44
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,562
Lord Danzo!
This is perfect!

45
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:15,562
What is it?

46
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:16,929
Please, you just
have to accept me as

47
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,632
{\an1}one of your ANBU!

48
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,266
{\an1}I'm afraid that you lack it.

49
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,335
Heh?! Lack what?

50
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:25,970
{\an1}You lack darkness.

51
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,075
Darkness?

52
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,120
{\an1}Very soon, a new member
will be joining your team.

53
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,021
Is it the one we
talked about?

54
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:54,056
{\an1}Yes, he's an extremely
capable shinobi.

55
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:57,092
{\an1}Perhaps. But very young.

56
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,060
{\an1}That's why Danzo's
recommended that he

57
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,629
{\an1}gain more experience.

58
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:05,833
{\an1}Here's your equipment.

59
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,968
Yes, thank you.

60
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,973
{\an1}I'm starting my new
ANBU assignment today.

61
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,408
Itachi Uchiha.

62
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,743
{\an1}I'm glad to be here.

63
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,712
{\an1}So, you're the one.
You can take the locker

64
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:25,814
{\an1}that's in the back.

65
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,314
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:31,851
That him?

67
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:33,920
They say he's
only eleven.

68
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:36,153
{\an1}That makes him the
youngest ANBU ever!

69
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,858
{\an1}You'll be on Team Ro.
Meet at the Third Training

70
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,792
{\an1}Ground in five minutes.

71
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:43,526
Right.

72
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,615
{\an1}What are you doing?!

73
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,151
{\an1}Explain yourselves!

74
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:19,819
{\an1}We wanted to make
sure he had the skills

75
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,854
to be one of us.

76
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,387
{\an1}Since he's so young.

77
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:26,591
{\an1}You have a problem with
your superiors' decision?

78
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,925
{\an1}No, sir. It's not like that...

79
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:31,327
{\an1}Haven't you already been
able to tell that he's not

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,828
{\an1}an ordinary shinobi?

81
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:39,066
{\an1}I'm Kakashi, captain of Team
Ro. You're new, but I want

82
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,935
{\an1}you to learn the ANBU rules
and formations quickly.

83
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,336
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,619
He's good.

85
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,387
{\an1}He is talented, but making
an exception for someone so

86
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,122
young is rather
unusual for the ANBU.

87
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,725
Well, Lord Danzo
recommended him...

88
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:18,761
{\an1}Really? Huh. He doesn't
seem to fit the mold, though.

89
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:19,862
How so?

90
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,931
{\an1}Lord Danzo has his own
set of criteria for ANBU

91
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,933
{\an1}and Foundation agents.

92
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,165
And?

93
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,467
{\an1}I just can't see it...

94
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,577
{\an1}I started my duties today.

95
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,280
Is that so?
That's my boy.

96
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,515
{\an1}Itachi, I'm proud
you've joined the ANBU.

97
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,718
{\an1}But there's one thing
you must never forget...

98
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:55,521
{\an1}...that even more than being
a Leaf ANBU, you're first

99
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,622
{\an1}and foremost an Uchiha.

100
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,123
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:00,992
{\an1}The Uchiha Clan's
been entrusted with

102
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,126
{\an1}the security of Village.

103
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,094
So our clan has
to live outside the

104
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,496
{\an1}village boundaries.

105
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,163
{\an1}It's essential that
our clan have one of its

106
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:11,198
{\an1}own inside the ANBU.

107
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,266
I am counting
on you, Itachi.

108
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:18,004
{\an1}Fugaku Uchiha stood out
as one of the shrewdest

109
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,138
{\an1}security captains
in generations.

110
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:23,708
{\an1}It comes as no surprise
that he is your father.

111
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,978
{\an1}I mean no judgment.

112
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:31,279
{\an1}The Leaf ordered the Uchiha
Clan outside the village.

113
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,050
{\an1}But the Leaf also granted
them the ability to govern

114
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,752
{\an1}themselves. So we cannot
intervene in their matters.

115
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,755
{\an1}Therefore, we need our own
set of eyes and ears there.

116
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,424
{\an1}I'm counting on you, Itachi.

117
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,161
Have you settled
into the job?

118
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,429
Not quite.

119
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,164
{\an1}That's unlike you.

120
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,332
{\an1}I haven't gone out
on a mission yet.

121
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:00,300
Protecting Lord
Hokage is a mission.

122
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,002
{\an1}Isn't the ANBU an
assassination and

123
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,804
{\an1}special tactics unit?

124
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,171
Well, we're not
at war now...

125
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,143
Kakashi...

126
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:14,979
Sir?

127
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,513
{\an1}As Hokage, when I
assign a mission,

128
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:19,581
{\an1}it's an official one.

129
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:23,184
{\an1}However, I cannot ignore
Danzo's view that there is

130
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,986
an underside to
this mission.

131
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:27,854
So, a separate,
unofficial team will be

132
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:28,955
dispatched, too.

133
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:33,025
One that the
Hokage didn't order?

134
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,226
{\an1}You will work under Danzo.

135
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,697
{\an1}On the surface, it's a
diplomatic mission.

136
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:44,299
{\an1}We'll be exchanging intel
with the Hannya Black

137
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:47,167
{\an1}Ops of the Land of
Woods at the border.

138
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:48,636
But...

139
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:52,071
{\an1}I believe that this meeting
is, in reality, an enemy

140
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:55,474
trap. Lord Third
agrees with me on that.

141
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:58,576
{\an1}The ANBU will secretly
guard the team that's

142
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,111
{\an1}on the official mission.

143
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:04,413
{\an1}When the enemy turns on that
team and attacks, kill them.

144
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,049
{\an1}Leave no survivors.

145
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,684
{\an1}Total annihilation, sir?

146
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,519
{\an1}We must show them that
the Hidden Leaf does not

147
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:14,087
{\an1}tolerate betrayal!

148
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:17,256
{\an1}I'd like to be in a two-man
squad with Itachi.

149
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,758
As you wish.

150
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,592
{\an1}I shall take my leave.

151
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,694
{\an1}Kakashi, I recognize your
worth as an ANBU.

152
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,897
{\an1}I'm even tempted to pull
you into the Foundation.

153
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,665
{\an1}Surely you jest, sir...

154
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:29,899
No.

155
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:32,100
You possess all
the right qualities.

156
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:34,635
{\an1}Especially the one
called darkness.

157
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,045
[gasp]

158
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,316
{\an1}It's a covert exchange
with the Land of Woods'

159
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,217
{\an1}Hannya Black Ops.

160
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,720
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf will
hand them this scroll.

161
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:03,023
{\an1}And in turn, you'll
accept a scroll from them.

162
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,459
Should we verify
the contents?

163
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,996
{\an1}This is a test of mutual
trust between our two lands.

164
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:15,832
{\an1}So if they hand you a fake
scroll, then it will prove

165
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,100
{\an1}that the Land of Woods
has no interest in

166
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,169
an alliance with
the Hidden Leaf.

167
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:22,904
{\an1}That means if nothing
happens, we just bring

168
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,538
{\an1}back the scroll, correct?

169
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,973
{\an1}Yes. Presently there are no
hostilities between us and

170
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,208
{\an1}the Land of Woods,
but we cannot be

171
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,277
{\an1}certain it will remain
so. Be very careful.

172
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,813
On it! [chuckle]

173
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,651
[grunt]

174
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,492
{\an1}Hey, Itachi. First
ANBU mission, huh?

175
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,493
Yes.

176
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,095
{\an1}I heard it's just Captain
Kakashi and you.

177
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,696
Watch your back.

178
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:00,397
Why's that?

179
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:03,033
{\an1}If it's for a mission, the
Captain won't hesitate to

180
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,734
kill a comrade.

181
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,901
{\an1}He's a shinobi of
the highest degree.

182
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:18,144
Okay, everyone!

183
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,611
{\an1}Time to fire up your
youthful passion!

184
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:22,446
Now! Let's go!

185
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:24,647
Captain! Wait!

186
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,885
{\an1}Sometimes I wonder if I'm
getting too old for this.

187
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,120
[sigh]

188
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,523
So they weren't
actually told the true

189
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,257
{\an1}nature of this mission?

190
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,061
{\an1}That's right. Only the top
ranks of the Leaf know it.

191
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,763
And the two of
us, of course.

192
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:00,007
{\an1}You are a godsend on
long-distance missions

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,741
like this one,
Mr. Kosuke.

194
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,676
Please help
yourselves to seconds.

195
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,079
{\an1}Yes, that's right! Make
sure that you eat up and

196
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,346
{\an1}replenish your energy
and chakra, everyone!

197
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,348
{\an1}But Captain, is it
wise to have a fire

198
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,049
{\an1}out in the open like this?

199
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,950
{\an1}Aren't we announcing
our presence?

200
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:17,253
{\an1}Yeah! What if the enemy
sees and attacks us?

201
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:22,856
{\an1}Well, if they want to
attack us, then so be it.

202
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:24,757
{\an1}My hunch tells me
this mission's really a

203
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,160
provocation to
clear up whether

204
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,693
{\an1}they're friend or foe.

205
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:33,564
Impressive.

206
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,332
{\an1}He's only been told the
superficial facts of the

207
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,202
{\an1}mission, but he's figured
out its true purpose.

208
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,703
{\an1}It's a good time for
us to refuel as well.

209
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:43,738
Right.

210
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:50,576
{\an1}In a way, this symbolizes
the ANBU perfectly.

211
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:51,944
How is that?

212
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:54,512
{\an1}They sit in the sun
and enjoy a hot-pot

213
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:55,814
meal together.

214
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,415
{\an1}While we sit in the
shadows and eat food pills.

215
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:01,218
{\an1}I don't mind at all. I
realize this is merely a

216
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:02,919
{\an1}part of the job we do.

217
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:04,686
I see...

218
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:17,229
Huh?

219
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,267
{\an1}Are you with the Land of
Woods' Hannya Black Ops?

220
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,236
{\an1}Indeed we are. Now
hand over the scroll!

221
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,536
Fine. Together.

222
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,537
You first.

223
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:31,706
{\an1}Very well, then...

224
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,578
{\an1}There's no mistake.

225
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,214
{\an1}And where is your scroll?

226
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,315
Here.

227
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,016
[gasp] [grunt]

228
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,122
{\an1}We're supposed to
exchange scrolls, not fire!

229
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,793
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf has
reneged on our agreement

230
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,194
and attacked us.

231
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,295
{\an1}We shall seek retribution.

232
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,931
{\an1}That's just a bold-faced
lie! You broke our

233
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,432
{\an1}agreement! It was you!

234
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,433
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

235
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,935
{\an1}[confident laughter]

236
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,069
Captain, they!

237
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,205
{\an1}They planned to betray
us from the start!

238
00:15:16,638 --> 00:15:17,772
We'll take over.

239
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:19,406
{\an1}You all get away!

240
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,708
You guys?!

241
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:24,644
Earth Style!
Rock Collapse!

242
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,113
Quick, run!

243
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,816
Earth Style!
Mud Wall!

244
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,889
[chuckle]

245
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,159
You two, get
out of here!

246
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,160
Right!

247
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:52,331
{\an1}Rumor has it you'd
kill a comrade for the

248
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,665
{\an1}sake of a mission.

249
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:56,700
I'd never let my
friends get killed.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,370
{\an1}That's why I was entrusted
with this Sharingan.

251
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,373
You go, too.

252
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:06,141
{\an1}Like I'd ever turn
my back on a mission!

253
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,275
Get on with it!

254
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,378
Earth Style!
Rock Collapse!

255
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,814
{\an1}Eight Inner Gates:
Fifth Gate of Closing!

256
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,016
Open!

257
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,552
All that with
just taijutsu?!

258
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:24,954
{\an1}Admire him later!

259
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,161
[attacking yell]

260
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,768
{\an1}Retreat! Retreat!

261
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:11,487
Your mission is
complete now.

262
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,488
{\an1}Return to the village.

263
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:14,790
[scream]

264
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:18,926
{\an1}Hey, what are you doing?!

265
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,062
{\an1}This is our mission.

266
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,865
{\an1}Even if that's true,
stop this, Kakashi!

267
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:29,667
{\an1}Hey! Only an idiot calls
someone by their real name

268
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,069
{\an1}on an ANBU mission!

269
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:32,936
How can you?

270
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,537
[screams]

271
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,474
{\an1}Rest assured, Captain. The
enemy has been neutralized.

272
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:41,742
[gasp]

273
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:53,118
I'll report back
to Lord Danzo now.

274
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,353
Your part of the
mission is complete.

275
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:57,554
Captain...

276
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,521
{\an1}The Sharingan you
possess wasn't

277
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,290
{\an1}originally yours, was it?

278
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:03,025
No...

279
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,094
{\an1}Do you ever feel doubt about
using a power that wasn't

280
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,961
{\an1}your own to begin with?

281
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,863
You aren't an
Uchiha, Captain.

282
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:14,066
{\an1}And yet you possess
the Sharingan.

283
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,500
{\an1}You wield the power
the Uchiha do.

284
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,570
{\an1}So tell me: whose
side are you on?

285
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,439
{\an1}I've never thought
about it quite that way.

286
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,274
{\an1}This Sharingan was entrusted
to me by a friend...

287
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,210
And he...

288
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,278
{\an1}...made me vow never to
forget what's important.

289
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,812
A friend?

290
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,747
Yeah...

291
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,515
To never let a
comrade get killed.

292
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,024
Yes, I see. That
was nicely done.

293
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:49,657
Lord Third...

294
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,593
{\an1}I get why you told me
that the ANBU isn't

295
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:53,660
suited for me.

296
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,396
I understand...

297
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,231
{\an1}But that's not all! Because
I don't believe that

298
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:01,367
{\an1}Kakashi is suited for
the ANBU, either!

299
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,135
Is that so?

300
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,837
So how did the
new guy do?

301
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:09,039
He did well.

302
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:12,509
{\an1}He'll probably be a better
ANBU than me, in fact.

303
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,076
But...

304
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,577
{\an1}You're an exceptional
ANBU, sir!

305
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:20,647
{\an1}There is a darkness beneath
every ANBU mission.

306
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,582
{\an1}Why are you saying
this all of a sudden?

307
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,351
All of a sudden?

308
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,452
You're right...

309
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,388
{\an1}Deception and killing
are part of the missions.

310
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,189
And always were.

311
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:40,961
[gasp]

312
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,029
Big Brother!

313
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,231
Let's walk home
together, Sasuke!

314
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:46,433
Okay! Done with
your mission, huh?

315
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,968
Guess what,
Big Brother!

316
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:54,505
{\an1}Today, my sensei at the
Academy complimented me!

317
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:07,081
Hey, Kakashi...

318
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:11,317
{\an1}I'm sorry about what
happened on the mission.

319
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,285
No, I'm sorry.

320
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,858
{\an1}As some of you may know...

321
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:25,593
{\an1}My son Itachi has
joined the ANBU.

322
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:29,230
{\an1}Close proximity to the
Hokage and top officials

323
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:31,698
will mean access
to more information.

324
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,235
{\an1}And that will be of benefit
to the entire Uchiha Clan.

325
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:40,004
{\an1}Itachi, do you have
anything to report now?

326
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,439
Yes...

327
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,776
{\an1}I'm still new, so there
isn't too much for me to
report yet.

328
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:50,479
{\an1}But in the Leaf's higher
ranks, I don't believe

329
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,079
{\an1}there's much solidarity.

330
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:56,015
{\an1}It's my belief that the
Uchiha Clan's choices

331
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,219
{\an1}will forge the future of
the entire Hidden Leaf.

332
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:04,889
{\an1}Exactly. By all rights, the
Uchiha Clan must be central

333
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,124
{\an1}to determining the
future of the Leaf.

334
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,759
[cheering]

335
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,434
That's the--!

336
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:00,171
{\an1}<i>You're part of the ANBU now.</i>

337
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,873
{\an1}<i>So this is one mission</i>
<i>that you can't avoid.</i>

338
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,274
{\an1}<i>So tell me, what is it?</i>

339
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:07,344
{\an1}<i>Six years ago, after the</i>
<i>Nine Tails incident, the</i>

340
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:09,212
{\an1}<i>village higher-ups</i>
<i>suspected that the Uchiha</i>

341
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,414
<i>Clan was behind</i>
<i>the entire thing.</i>

342
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,149
{\an1}<i>Since then, the Uchiha</i>
<i>district has been under</i>

343
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:16,317
<i>twenty-four-hour</i>
<i>surveillance.</i>

344
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,986
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Coup d'État."</i>

345
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,088
{\an1}<i>A mission's a mission.</i>
