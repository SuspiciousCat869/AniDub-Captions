[theme music]

2
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,078
-It's no wonder
it was completely

3
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,747
useless to look
for a scroll that

4
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,715
{\an1}contained the forbidden jutsu.

5
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,150
{\an1}He had used his very
own granddaughters

6
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,518
{\an1}as the jutsu's hiding place.

7
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,490
{\an1}That En no Gyoja.

8
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:18,658
{\an1}What a cruel thing to do.

9
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:22,528
{\an1}If the forbidden jutsu is simply
removed from its human vessel,

10
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,196
{\an1}then its power will
become lost forever.

11
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,965
Also, unless the
person who's its vessel

12
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,967
{\an1}is very skilled, and strong
enough to control it,

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,935
{\an1}the forbidden jutsu
can never be activated.

14
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,807
{\an1}Even if someone looking for
the forbidden jutsu found it,

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,410
{\an1}they couldn't lay
a finger on it.

16
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:44,644
{\an1}En no Gyoja's foresight
and selflessness

17
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:47,279
{\an1}has kept it protected
all this time.

18
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:51,582
{\an1}However, if it stays like
this, the treasure's wasted.

19
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:54,684
{\an1}Right now, for my purposes, you
have become nothing more than

20
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:58,220
{\an1}a container to accumulate
natural chakra energy.

21
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,757
{\an1}But you've yet to learn to wield
the activation jutsu necessary

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,492
{\an1}to set off all that
collected energy.

23
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:07,327
{\an1}And that's where I
come into this story.

24
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,695
{\an1}The only survivor of
the Tsuchigumo clan

25
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,532
{\an1}who has mastered that jutsu.

26
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,600
{\an1}What a lucky turn of events.

27
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,835
{\an1}The jutsu that could
restore our class

28
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,569
and help regain
our former glory is

29
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,970
{\an1}on the verge of seeing
the light of day.

30
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,840
{\an1}We'll use it to strike fear
into the hearts of anyone who

31
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,073
{\an1}ever denounced our clan.

32
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,977
{\an1}What's the matter, Hotaru?

33
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,245
{\an1}Doesn't that make you happy?

34
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,881
Aw, come on.

35
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,482
Smile for me.

36
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,183
No?

37
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:38,917
Then here.

38
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:44,353
There.

39
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,321
See?

40
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,923
{\an1}Now you're happy, too.

41
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:49,057
And you should.

42
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,592
{\an1}You should be joyous!

43
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,993
[laughter]

44
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,101
{\an1}-Tsuchigumo Style
forbidden Jutsu Release.

45
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:14,175
{\an1}Big Bang It's here.

46
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:24,182
{\an1}Big Bang It's here.

47
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,800
{\an1}Now, the secret weapon
that will restore our clan.

48
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,034
{\an1}The jutsu awakens after
its decades long slumber.

49
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,572
{\an1}Now gather, chakra.

50
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:59,675
{\an1}Come, fill this vessel
until it overflows.

51
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,577
{\an1}Come and manifest your
terrible and beautiful power!

52
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:20,790
-Utakata.

53
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:23,225
{\an1}What are you doing?

54
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,593
-That chakra.

55
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:25,961
It's flowing.

56
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:26,561
-What chakra?

57
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:30,764
I don't see it.

58
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,231
{\an1}What are you talking about?

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,799
-It is there.

60
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,433
Chakra from the
atmosphere and terrain.

61
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:47,910
{\an1}-What's that for?

62
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:50,044
{\an1}-They'll ride the
chakra current and flow

63
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:53,313
{\an1}right towards where
it's being drawn in.

64
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:55,148
{\an1}And towards Hotaru.

65
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,082
{\an1}-That's where she is?

66
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,585
-Let's go.

67
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:00,084
-Yeah.

68
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:00,586
Right!

69
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,126
{\an1}But why's the chakra gathering?

70
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,193
Hey.

71
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,328
{\an1}Are you sure that
Hotaru's gonna be there?

72
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:17,298
{\an1}-If you have time to talk, then
you aren't moving fast enough.

73
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,640
Hotaru.

74
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,541
There.

75
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:32,375
-Let's go!

76
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:44,717
Hotaru!

77
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,222
-We're too late.

78
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,324
{\an1}-Akaboshi's men are useless.

79
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,993
{\an1}Couldn't they have
at least held you off

80
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:57,393
{\an1}until I was finished here?

81
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,163
Oh, well.

82
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:05,532
{\an1}I suppose that I don't
mind having an audience.

83
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:07,001
-You bastard.

84
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,970
{\an1}Just what are you
going to Hotaru?

85
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:12,103
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER):
So, Utakata--

86
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,671
-It's her dream.

87
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,940
{\an1}All I'm trying to do
is breathe life into it

88
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,674
{\an1}and make it into a reality.

89
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,476
{\an1}The revival of the
Tsuchigumo clan.

90
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,212
{\an1}And the key to that dream is
activating the forbidden jutsu

91
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,581
{\an1}with my abilities.

92
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,383
{\an1}-And what abilities are those?

93
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,085
{\an1}What do you mean?

94
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,720
{\an1}-Hotaru doesn't have the skill
to activate the forbidden

95
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,153
jutsu herself.

96
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,022
{\an1}She's only able to
accumulate chakra

97
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,256
{\an1}from the world around her.

98
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,558
So when she's
absorbed enough, I'm

99
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,561
{\an1}going to activate it for
her, from the outside.

100
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,529
{\an1}All of this is in order
to restore the tarnished

101
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,230
{\an1}honor of the Tsuchigumo clan.

102
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,298
{\an1}-You don't know what honor is.

103
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:53,300
{\an1}You're taking advantage
of Hotaru's feelings

104
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,802
{\an1}for her grandfather, for
Tonbee, for her people.

105
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,204
{\an1}You're dishonoring
everything Hotaru holds dear!

106
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,542
{\an1}-Who wants something as cheap
and pointless as feelings?

107
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:08,012
{\an1}I'm going to steal
the entire world.

108
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,412
-You what?

109
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,147
{\an1}-While I have this, be it the
five Kages or the Daimyo lords,

110
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,317
{\an1}no one can ignore my
demands or me anymore.

111
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,752
New village?

112
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:18,752
No thanks.

113
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:20,386
{\an1}Soon I will attain
land and holdings

114
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,288
{\an1}that are even superior to
the five great nations.

115
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,923
{\an1}-Have you lost your mind?

116
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,257
{\an1}-Oh, I'm quite serious.

117
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,860
{\an1}Now that I've come
this far, I can

118
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,894
{\an1}match the might of
any of those nations.

119
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,429
{\an1}With this forbidden jutsu,
taking over the world

120
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,463
{\an1}is no longer just a daydream.

121
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,098
-I knew it.

122
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,399
I just knew it!

123
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:39,833
{\an1}You don't really give a damn!

124
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,970
{\an1}All the people of the Tsuchigumo
clan mean nothing to you!

125
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:45,370
{\an1}-Well, that goes without saying.

126
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:48,373
-And what about
Hotaru's feelings, huh?

127
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:50,441
{\an1}-Couldn't care less about them.

128
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:54,477
{\an1}She put her faith in you,
carrying that massive seal

129
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:56,278
in her own body.

130
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,881
{\an1}She protected it with
all of her might,

131
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,449
{\an1}for the sake of her entire clan.

132
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,317
{\an1}And she entrusted you with it.

133
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,054
-What?

134
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:11,690
{\an1}[laughter] Look, it's true that
I killed my own father in order

135
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,224
{\an1}to satisfy my own ambitions.

136
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:15,592
{\an1}I'm not denying that.

137
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:18,028
But you're in no
position to talk.

138
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,362
{\an1}I know about you.

139
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,698
All about you.

140
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,432
{\an1}You're listed in the bingo book.

141
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:24,633
{\an1}Isn't that right?

142
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,234
{\an1}A rogue ninja from
the Hidden Mist.

143
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,671
{\an1}You turned your back on your
village and on its laws.

144
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,273
{\an1}I don't need to be lectured
by someone like you.

145
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,307
{\an1}You don't care about
your village, either.

146
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:41,878
Hmph!

147
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:45,414
{\an1}You and I, we're quite
alike, I can tell.

148
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,515
{\an1}MIght not want to admit
it, but we're the same.

149
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,855
{\an1}I hid no such thing.

150
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,290
{\an1}What I said before
was true, although I

151
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:00,025
{\an1}didn't tell you one thing.

152
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,560
{\an1}That the reason my father
died protecting the jutsu

153
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,428
{\an1}is that I killed him.

154
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,762
{\an1}-A monstrous crime.

155
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:09,032
{\an1}He killed his own master, and
then fled from the village.

156
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:09,999
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): No.

157
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,366
{\an1}I won't believe that.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,635
Sir Utakata is
nothing like that man.

159
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:17,138
{\an1}And yet-- and yet I--

160
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:29,113
[screaming]

161
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:39,587
-What?

162
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:48,894
{\an1}This-- This power.

163
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:49,961
Wait, no!

164
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:50,461
No!

165
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,528
Stop!

166
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:51,996
Stop!

167
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,066
[roar]

168
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:02,070
{\an1}-Hit close to home, didn't I?

169
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:06,506
{\an1}[laughter] Well, whatever.

170
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,875
{\an1}But since Hotaru is so
attached to her people,

171
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,709
{\an1}I'll do her a favor.

172
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:14,045
{\an1}The new nation I form will
be named after the Tsuchigumo

173
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,979
clan.

174
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,412
See?

175
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,048
{\an1}I'm not such a bad guy.

176
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:22,751
{\an1}Using the name of the land of my
birth will return it to glory.

177
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,652
{\an1}I'd say I'm a pretty great guy.

178
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,087
-Knock it off!

179
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,387
{\an1}-Maybe you're right.

180
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,322
{\an1}Maybe it's true that I don't
really give a damn at all.

181
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,391
{\an1}At least not about my village.

182
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:33,226
-But Utakata--

183
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,160
-Tell me.

184
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,827
{\an1}What'll happen to her?

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,463
{\an1}-I'll keep her around,
as the ultimate weapon

186
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,698
{\an1}to launch the forbidden jutsu.

187
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,667
And through her
I can control it.

188
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,335
{\an1}The perfect vessel
to build my nation.

189
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,237
-Vessel?

190
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,806
{\an1}Did you just say vessel?

191
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,074
-That's right.

192
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,810
She's my vessel.

193
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:57,342
-Enough!

194
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,024
-Aw.

195
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:18,424
So close.

196
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:22,028
{\an1}But now you can't oppose me
anymore, just Hotaru can't.

197
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,000
Good.

198
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,367
More chakra.

199
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,468
{\an1}Let your body overflow with it.

200
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,377
{\an1}And what about you?

201
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:50,347
{\an1}What shall I make you do, now
that you're under my control?

202
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,116
Perhaps I should
make you two comrades

203
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,383
{\an1}turn on each other in battle.

204
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,622
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can't move.

205
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,658
{\an1}-Or maybe I'll keep you
around as bodyguards.

206
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:07,827
{\an1}You two can be the
protectors of my vessel.

207
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,328
-No.

208
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,828
Never.

209
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,668
{\an1}-You didn't think you could
get near my vessel that

210
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,136
easily, did you?

211
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,338
{\an1}-All right, that's it.

212
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,705
{\an1}I've heard enough!

213
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:26,040
{\an1}Stop calling her that.

214
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,474
{\an1}Hotaru's no one's vessel.

215
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,809
Got it?

216
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,344
-You annoy me.

217
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,011
Be quiet.

218
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:40,084
{\an1}Don't you understand?

219
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,186
{\an1}You have no grounds to object.

220
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,586
{\an1}This was Hotaru's decision.

221
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,821
{\an1}She came to me of
her own choosing.

222
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,455
{\an1}She agreed to become the vessel.

223
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,856
{\an1}It isn't up to you two anymore.

224
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,777
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): To Utakata.

225
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,612
{\an1}I'm going to work
together with Shiranami

226
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,680
{\an1}to restore the Tsuchigumo
clan to greatness.

227
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,248
Thank you for
everything you've done.

228
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,020
Goodbye.

229
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,154
{\an1}Your student, Hotaru.

230
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,594
-Hotaru doesn't
really want to be

231
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:44,263
{\an1}rescued by you, or by anybody.

232
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,198
{\an1}So you get to stay
right there and watch

233
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:49,900
{\an1}as the Tsuchigumo clan's village
disappears in an instant.

234
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:53,370
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): Sir
Utakata, I'm so sorry.

235
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,470
{\an1}All of this is because
I was so foolish.

236
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,978
-Well.

237
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,579
{\an1}So you still have the
will to resist, do you?

238
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:14,319
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): Sir Utakata.

239
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,186
{\an1}-This can't happen.

240
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,022
{\an1}-Just a little more.

241
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,790
{\an1}Just a little more,
and Hotaru will

242
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,525
{\an1}be all filled up with chakra.

243
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,294
{\an1}You will be my witnesses
to the glorious reawakening

244
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,262
{\an1}of the forbidden jutsu.

245
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:47,276
-No chance.

246
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,210
{\an1}We can't fight those
four like this.

247
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,877
{\an1}-Yeah, you're right.

248
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:53,180
{\an1}So first we have to
stop the villagers.

249
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,647
-But how?

250
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,748
{\an1}-We have no choice.

251
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:57,416
{\an1}We'll have to get a
little rough with them.

252
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,352
{\an1}We need to contain
them in one place.

253
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:04,121
[shouting]

254
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:07,522
-I'm so sorry.

255
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:08,924
{\an1}A little rough, huh?

256
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,868
{\an1}Ninja Art, Super Beast Scroll!

257
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:40,914
-Wood Style.

258
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,950
{\an1}Four Pillar House Jutsu!

259
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,885
{\an1}We'll just keep them
there until later.

260
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,788
{\an1}-Gee, way to ruin our fun.

261
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,590
{\an1}-We can't keep letting
them have their way,

262
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,724
{\an1}so we have to shut
them down right now.

263
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:56,625
-Funny.

264
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:58,193
{\an1}I was about to say that to you.

265
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,560
{\an1}-We'll see about that.

266
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,405
{\an1}-It's just not as much
fun without an audience

267
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,406
to watch us.

268
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,773
[laughter]

269
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,776
{\an1}-This is not good.

270
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,144
{\an1}There's no end to any of this.

271
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,048
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

272
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,987
{\an1}-You're doing great, Hotaru.

273
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,688
{\an1}But our two guests must be
getting impatient by now.

274
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,963
{\an1}Now, surrender to me completely.

275
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:52,299
{\an1}Unreleas the chakra that
you've accumulated all at once.

276
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,100
{\an1}Take this place that
has rejected you,

277
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,768
{\an1}and reduce all of it to ashes!

278
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:02,440
-Ninja Art.

279
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,374
-Huh?

280
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:04,341
-Bubble Bomb!

281
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,812
-You snake.

282
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,047
{\an1}When did you set up that attack?

283
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,416
{\an1}You know, if you'd
just behaved, then

284
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,118
{\an1}you could have lived
a little bit longer.

Why did it fail?

{\an1}These guys-- their chakra
levels are extraordinary.

289
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:43,702
{\an1}-Startign to get it now?

290

{\an1}We'd never let you
control us that easily!

-Hotaru.

00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:22,998
{\an1}Are you all right, Hotaru?

300
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,505
-What's wrong?

301
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,275
{\an1}So what should we do about this?

302
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:38,075
[laughter]

303
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:38,576
-Hey!

304
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,476
Back off!

305
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,810
{\an1}Or do you still want to fight?

306
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,311
-Just hold on.

307
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,880
{\an1}Have you forgotten that
thanks to my Word Bind Jutsu,

308
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,481
I still have her
under my control?

309
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,319
{\an1}Now out of my way!

310
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,454
-You won't win.

311
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:57,156
{\an1}-She isn't fully charged
with natural chakra yet.

{\an1}But it'll have to do.

them, and everyone,

00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,364
{\an1}just how strong the
forbidden jutsu is.

315
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:22,908
All right.

316
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:25,176
Let us begin.

317
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:28,111
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): No.

318
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:32,482
{\an1}-We're going to show the
entire world our power.

319
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,416
No, mine.

320
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:35,983
My power!

321
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,717
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER): No.

322
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,186
No!

323
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,321
{\an1}-Everyone will die!

324
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:43,789
Fury Jutsu!

325
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:44,290
-No!

326
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:29,855
[theme music]

327
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,353
HOTARU: I never
wanted to hurt anyone.

328
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:00,321
{\an1}I only wanted to protect
the jutsu entrusted

329
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:03,256
{\an1}to me by my grandfather,
and fulfill his dream.

330
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,494
{\an1}And yet I hurt Naruto, and Sir
Utakata with my very own hands.

331
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:09,994
{\an1}I didn't want this.

332
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:12,430
{\an1}I betrayed Sir Utakata.

333
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,197
{\an1}Someone like me should
disappear, along

334
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:15,999
{\an1}with the forbidden jutsu.

335
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:20,569
{\an1}NARUTO: Next time on Naruto
Shippuden, Master and Student.

336
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:23,004
{\an1}HOTARU: Goodbye, Sir Utakata.
