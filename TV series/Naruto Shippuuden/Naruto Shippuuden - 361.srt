1
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,001
{\an1}Now, regarding the next
group of genin that you'll

2
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,336
{\an1}be in charge of...

3
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,038
I'm going to be
in charge again?

4
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,507
{\an1}Oh, don't give me
that upset look.

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,843
{\an1}Guy has already formed
his squad and gone

6
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,244
{\an1}out on missions with
them, you know!

7
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:11,012
{\an1}Aren't you eager to set out
on missions with apprentices

8
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:12,347
of your own?

9
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,782
Well...

10
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,951
{\an1}In any event. I'm certain
that this new batch of

11
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:19,620
{\an1}genin will be able to
hold your interest.

12
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,525
Where are we?

13
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,893
[grunt] Naruto
Uzumaki's house.

14
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,797
The orphan Lord
Fourth left behind...

15
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:34,365
{\an1}So, that kid's made genin?

16
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,534
[chuckle] Well,
it seems that has

17
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,402
{\an1}captured your interest!

18
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,072
{\an1}So, this is where
Naruto lives.

19
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:44,673
Yes...

20
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,348
{\an1}This milk is way past
its expiration date.

21
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01,053
<i>Minato Sensei</i>
<i>was so meticulous.</i>

22
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:03,321
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>this is his son!</i>

23
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:06,658
{\an1}He's a fool, but it would
be best if you looked after

24
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,927
{\an1}him. You have good
instincts, Kakashi.

25
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:15,465
And also Sasuke
Uchiha's on your team...

26
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:20,202
{\an1}I wish you good luck!

27
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,404
Understood.

28
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,507
{\an1}This looks like it's going
to be troublesome.

29
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,913
{\an1}Next, we have a kunoichi.

30
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:42,954
{\an1}Welcome, Lord Third! And
Kakashi Sensei, as well!

31
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,390
{\an1}Our little Sakura's gonna
be under your supervision!

32
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:46,990
Please! Come in!

33
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,460
{\an1}Yes, yes! Come in
and have some tea!

34
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,830
{\an1}I'll go get it rea-tea!

35
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,963
{\an1}Oh, would you stop that?! My
goodness, you're so silly!

36
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,998
[laugh]

37
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,601
Ahem!

38
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,804
{\an1}I'm afraid that I am
only here unofficially.

39
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:06,240
{\an1}If I accept an invitation to
a student's home, other

40
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:08,141
{\an1}parents might think
that I'm showing

41
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,009
favoritism and
frown on it.

42
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,345
{\an1}Oh, please! You don't
have to be so formal!

43
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,413
{\an1}That's right! Thanks to
you, we live in peace and

44
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,949
have hardly any
worries, Lord Hokage!

45
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,350
{\an1}I really doubt that anyone
would dare to complain!

46
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:23,153
{\an1}And, you come along too,
Kakashi Sensei! After all,

47
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,555
you're going to
be our daughter's

48
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,290
Sensei! C'mon,
c'mon, c'mon!

49
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,759
{\an1}<i>Well this just keeps</i>
<i>getting worse!</i>

50
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,899
The last one is
Sasuke Uchiha's house.

51
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,239
{\an1}At one time, the Uchiha
lived in their own separate

52
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,508
{\an1}and autonomous district.

53
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,510
{\an1}Now only Sasuke's left.

54
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:54,880
Hmm...

55
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:58,616
{\an1}Sasuke's father Fugaku
Uchiha was very strict. It

56
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,886
{\an1}seems the boy's inherited
his sense of discipline.

57
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,591
{\an1}His older brother Itachi
was very meticulous, too.

58
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,828
{\an1}Yes, I remember well. I
assigned him to serve

59
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,762
{\an1}under your command.

60
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,765
{\an1}Now I need you to look
after the younger one.

61
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:20,734
{\an1}I'm asking in place of
their father, Fugaku.

62
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,636
{\an1}I don't know how much
looking after Itachi I

63
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,704
{\an1}really did. I didn't have
to teach him a thing.

64
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:28,206
{\an1}That Sharingan he had
was significantly more

65
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,208
{\an1}effective than mine is.

66
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,646
{\an1}Well, regardless... you're
now the only Leaf Shinobi

67
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,981
{\an1}who has a Sharingan.

68
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:40,918
{\an1}We don't know yet if Sasuke
will be able to activate

69
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:44,720
{\an1}his... But if he does, you
must be there for him.

70
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:45,988
Of course.

71
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,595
{\an1}Obito! How did-?!

72
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:05,671
This time...

73
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,006
{\an1}I will protect my comrade!

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,975
Obito...

75
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,214
Kakashi...

76
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,919
[wet cough]

77
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,396
Rin...

78
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,400
{\an1}The shadow of tragedy
follows this eye.

79
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,171
{\an1}I wonder if it might be
best not to activate the

80
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:49,807
{\an1}Sharingan at all.

81
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:51,808
But...

82
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,179
{\an1}This eye, whether it's for
the better or for the worse...

83
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,782
{\an1}...holds the key to my
feelings toward my comrades.

84
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:03,384
Some say the
downside is that those

85
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,919
{\an1}feelings attract tragedy.

86
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,188
{\an1}To prevent such things, it's
my duty to ensure that my

87
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,423
pupils treasure
their comrades.

88
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:13,459
Uh-huh.

89
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,395
{\an1}It appears your judging
criteria will stay

90
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,963
{\an1}the same this year.

91
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,770
{\an1}<i>Still... This room is quite a</i>
<i>contrast from Naruto's.</i>

92
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,806
[chatter]

93
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,607
Why?

94
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,475
{\an1}What do you mean?

95
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,677
{\an1}Why them? I mean,
why'd you put me in

96
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,277
{\an1}charge of those three?

97
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:41,949
Because...

98
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,518
{\an1}There's a hopeless fool as
well as a skilled protégé.

99
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,587
{\an1}Plus a clever kunoichi...

100
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:51,124
{\an1}I'd say it's much like
Minato's old team.

101
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,659
So... you chose
me on purpose?!

102
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:57,028
{\an1}Listen, Kakashi. I'm
the Leaf's Hokage,

103
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,996
I would never
make my personnel

104
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,463
{\an1}decisions personal!

105
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,466
{\an1}I pick the right man for
the right job, carefully

106
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,467
considering each
assignment.

107
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:09,437
{\an1}And I do so regardless of
what the teachers at the

108
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,773
Academy believe.

109
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:14,174
{\an1}Sasuke and Naruto are going
to be on the same squad?

110
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,743
{\an1}Brilliant! Sasuke graduated
top of his class out of

111
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,512
{\an1}twenty-seven students

112
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,914
while Naruto
was at the bottom.

113
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,282
{\an1}That's a great way to
keep the squad balanced!

114
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,350
[harrumph]

115
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,288
{\an1}There are times when a
squad's composition greatly

116
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,891
{\an1}affects its shinobi,
their actions, and

117
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,359
{\an1}their success rate.

118
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:39,163
{\an1}Therefore, it is the duty of
those who govern to maintain

119
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,898
{\an1}special teams with
a variety of skills.

120
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,435
{\an1}For example, Guy's team
that was formed last year.

121
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:51,338
{\an1}It lacks the balance Academy
instructors recommended.

122
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,742
{\an1}It's a squad that specializes
largely in taijutsu.

123
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,910
{\an1}Yes, you're right.

124
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,045
{\an1}And yet, this year,
they have really

125
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,679
{\an1}come into their own.

126
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:04,816
{\an1}I plan to form special
military squads that use

127
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,118
{\an1}Secret Ninjutsu, too.

128
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:13,056
{\an1}So as you see it, Naruto's
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki...

129
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,357
{\an1}And Sasuke carries inside
of him the potential to

130
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,727
{\an1}activate the Sharingan.

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,762
{\an1}As I said before, you are
the only one who can give

132
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,099
{\an1}Sasuke advice regarding
his Sharingan.

133
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,535
{\an1}<i>Looking to the future,</i>
<i>it's imperative that</i>

134
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,270
{\an1}<i>Sasuke awaken his</i>
<i>Sharingan so that he can</i>

135
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,306
{\an1}<i>control the Nine Tails.</i>

136
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,843
{\an1}<i>That night's tragedy must</i>
<i>never happen again.</i>

137
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,078
{\an1}I understand that
those two are special.

138
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,880
{\an1}But then, what about
the kunoichi, Sakura?

139
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,050
{\an1}Hm? I think she has
the potential to be a

140
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,751
{\an1}brilliant kunoichi.

141
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,620
{\an1}But right now she
is just average.

142
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:51,988
However...

143
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,767
Shuriken Shadow
Clone Jutsu!

144
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:09,969
<i>Oh!</i>

145
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,805
{\an1}<i>He's already picked up</i>
<i>how to do one of my jutsu!</i>

146
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:17,609
{\an1}Nice one, Orochimaru!

147
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,743
[growl]

148
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,148
I can do that!

149
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,749
{\an1}What? You too, Jiraiya?

150
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,451
What?!

151
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,956
{\an1}Shu... Shuriken...

152
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,992
Whatever Jutsu!

153
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,359
[groaning]

154
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,798
{\an1}Talent draws people to it...

155
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,633
{\an1}Men begin to notice women.

156
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,636
{\an1}And in time, rivalry
matures both.

157
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:53,838
C'mon! Get 'im!

158
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,072
You can do it!

159
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:55,973
Huh?

160
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,812
{\an1}Then you mean you've
even considered how

161
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,546
{\an1}the squad will develop?

162
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,313
{\an1}Yes, of course I have!

163
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,819
{\an1}<i>There's no doubt... Obito</i>
<i>was desperate for Rin to</i>

164
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,352
<i>acknowledge him.</i>

165
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,322
<i>But...</i>

166
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,026
{\an1}I get your logic behind
this, Lord Third.

167
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:23,229
{\an1}However, I've already
failed twice, and with squads

168
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,964
{\an1}that you organized,
just like this one.

169
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:28,834
{\an1}Maybe we both need to face
that I'm simply not cut out

170
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,935
{\an1}to be a Jonin Leader.

171
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:34,271
{\an1}Did you fail them because
of your personal feelings?

172
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,839
Well, no...

173
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,541
{\an1}I see... It's unfortunate
for those students.

174
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,644
{\an1}But in our harsh shinobi
world, it is better that

175
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:45,580
{\an1}they learn such things
when they're still young.

176
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,416
{\an1}Ultimately, I think this
situation will prove to be a

177
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,184
{\an1}valuable lesson for them.

178
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,586
{\an1}Maybe, but it wasn't
something I planned.

179
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:54,087
It just happened
to work out.

180
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,056
{\an1}Yes, perhaps that's true.

181
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,625
{\an1}Still... I, at least, had
faith that it would work!

182
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,459
{\an1}I trust in you, Kakashi.

183
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,828
Lord Hiruzen!

184
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,197
It was the same
with Minato.

185
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,432
{\an1}What?! Minato Sensei?!

186
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:15,771
{\an1}Hm, judging solely from the
practice reports, it would

187
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,473
{\an1}seem that Kakashi acted
largely on his own.

188
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,042
{\an1}Kakashi is leagues ahead
of the other graduates

189
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,078
{\an1}in terms of his skill
and intelligence.

190
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:26,247
{\an1}Honestly, it's exciting
just thinking about his

191
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,348
development.

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,351
{\an1}But perhaps, due to the
incident with his father

193
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,352
Sakumo, he's
very headstrong.

194
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,255
{\an1}Nonetheless, I maintain
faith that he'll realize the

195
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,022
{\an1}importance of teamwork.

196
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,824
{\an1}You have faith in him, huh?

197
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,959
Yes, I agree.

198
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,996
{\an1}And since I believe
you're right, I shall

199
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,930
{\an1}have faith in your faith.

200
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:47,864
[chuckle]

201
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:52,101
{\an1}<i>Minato Sensei knew all</i>

202
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:54,402
{\an1}<i>and shallow strategy.</i>

203

205
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,411
{\an1}Believing in your
students and watching

206
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:08,581
{\an1}over them is also part
of being a teacher.

[gasp]

211
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:35,670
{\an1}You're right, in the Ninja
World, those who break the

212
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:38,105
{\an1}rules and laws are
regarded as scum.

213
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,040
But...

214
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,044
{\an1}Those who would abandon
even one of their friends

215
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:46,045
{\an1}are worse than scum.

All right! Are
you our Sensei?

223

229
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:44,726
See ya!

230
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,727
So long!

231
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,661
{\an1}I'll see you later, Sasuke!

232
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,497
{\an1}Oh, just get lost, Ino Pig!

233
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,267
{\an1}Aw, man... I can't
believe they already

234
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:56,168
{\an1}got their sensei.

235
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,938
{\an1}Well, so what?! I bet the
next one will be ours!

236
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:02,474
{\an1}No way! It's gonna be our
Sensei next, for sure!

237
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:03,640
Right, Akamaru?

{\an1}Please to meet you.

[growling sigh]

245
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,025
{\an1}[chuckle] Well, it looks
like the loser squad

246
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,993
gets a loser
sensei, too!

247
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,998
He's late!

248
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,905
Are you waiting
for me, Tenzo?

249
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,078
{\an1}I wish that you'd stop
calling me "Tenzo," Captain.

250
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:52,148
{\an1}Yeah, well, I wish you'd
drop the "Captain" part.

251
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,216
{\an1}Sorry, but you'll always be
"captain" to me. That'll

252
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,520
{\an1}never change, even if you're
no longer with the ANBU.

253
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,255
{\an1}So what did you want? I've
heard rumors that it's been

254
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,689
difficult trying
find my replacement.

255
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:06,826
{\an1}Or did you come all this way
just to laugh at me, the

256
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,262
{\an1}great genin babysitter?

257
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,729
Not at all!

258
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,764
{\an1}That was all such a long
time ago! But you haven't

259
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,534
{\an1}changed a bit, Captain.

260
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:19,336
{\an1}Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm
really busy today. I can't

261
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,704
{\an1}just stand around and chat.

262
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,239
[chuckling]

263
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:25,941
{\an1}Yeah, though it's way past
the time when you were

264
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:27,676
supposed to go
meet your genin.

265

[grunt]

266
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,380
Well, see ya.

267
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,584
{\an1}"See ya?" Well, well...

268
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:39,786
Maybe he did
change a little.

269
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,889
{\an1}He used to be so fixated on
the past and the present,

270
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,391
and now he's
saying, "see ya..."

just wouldn't!

{\an1}take these bells from me.

noon, you go without lunch.

to try to split the team.

{\an1}I hope they figure it out.

287
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:49,009
{\an1}That way at least ONE
of you will end up tied

288
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,910
{\an1}to a post and ultimately
disqualified for

289

the mission.

00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,116
BUT... Naruto
doesn't get any.

304
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,250
Huh?

305
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,218
{\an1}It's your punishment for
breaking the rules and

306
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,920
{\an1}trying to eat by yourself.

307
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,589
{\an1}And if anyone tries to
feed him, that person

308
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:47,323
{\an1}will immediately fail.

309
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,595
{\an1}I make the rules, you
follow them. Got it!?

310
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,063
[gasps]

311
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:05,871
{\an1}<i>Minato Sensei had</i>
<i>faith in me...</i>

312
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>So should I have</i>
<i>faith in them, too?</i>

313
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,478
<i>But what if I'm</i>
<i>wrong to begin with?</i>

314
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,713
{\an1}Don't you even have
a shred of kindness in

315
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:18,416
{\an1}that heart of yours?!

316
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,451
{\an1}All you ever talk about
are rules and regulations!

317
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,420
<i>That's true...</i>

318
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,522
{\an1}<i>I'm still just trying</i>
<i>to stick to my rules.</i>

319
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:31,259
Let's get going
then... Captain!

320
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,830
<i>Obito...</i>

321
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:40,032
{\an1}<i>For the sake of the team,</i>
<i>you stepped up and</i>

322
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,467
{\an1}<i>compromised that day.</i>

323
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,304
{\an1}<i>If only I'd accepted the</i>
<i>offer of friendship that you</i>

324
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,738
<i>extended to me.</i>

325
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:51,442
{\an1}<i>If I'd embraced that little</i>
<i>sign you gave me.</i>

326
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:53,843
Here.

327
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,078
-Huh?!
-What is-?!

328
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,312
[gasp]

329
00:19:56,346 --> 00:19:58,615
[groan]

330
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:12,392
{\an1}<i>Obito, did you see that?</i>

331
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,862
{\an1}<i>I'll never, ever forget</i>
<i>about you or Rin.</i>

332
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,000
Kakashi!

333
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,334
Kakashi!

334
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,670
Kakashi!

335
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:37,280
Aaaah.

336
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:39,014
[gasps]

337
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,682
You!!

338
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,218
[screaming]

339
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,419
You pass.

340
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:48,188
{\an1}<i>But I think that for now,</i>
<i>I'm going to move forward</i>

341
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:50,556
{\an1}<i>with some new comrades.</i>

342
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:53,526
{\an1}<i>Naruto. Sasuke. Sakura...</i>

343
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,495
{\an1}<i>I'm going to believe in you.</i>

344
00:20:56,194 --> 00:21:00,666
{\an1}<i>And Obito, Rin, I'll</i>
<i>make you both a promise.</i>

345
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:04,435
{\an1}<i>I'll believe in my comrades</i>
<i>and never let them die!</i>

346
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:06,336
{\an1}<i>The exercise is over.</i>

347
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:09,572
{\an1}<i>Everyone passes! Squad</i>
<i>seven starts its first</i>

348
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,273
{\an1}<i>mission tomorrow!</i>

349
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:19,580
{\an1}<i>[growling] You guys</i>
<i>forgot to untie me!</i>

350
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,996
{\an1}<i>I'm scum because I couldn't</i>
<i>keep my promise to you...</i>

351
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,366
{\an1}<i>But you're a hero of the</i>
<i>Leaf. You don't have to</i>

352
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,535
{\an1}<i>become scum, too!</i>

353
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:11,671
{\an1}<i>Obito, your once-strong</i>
<i>will is still alive today,</i>

354
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:13,105
{\an1}<i>right next to me!</i>

355
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,642
{\an1}<i>The only thing the</i>
<i>current me can do is...</i>

356
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,880
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Kakashi's</i>
<i>Resolve."</i>

357
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,148
<i>...protect the</i>
<i>current Naruto!</i>
