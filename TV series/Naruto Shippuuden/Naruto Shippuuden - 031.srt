1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,974
[theme music]

2
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,646
-Oh, Lady Chiyo, you--

3
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,513
-I don't get it.

4
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,249
What she's trying to do?

5
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,617
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Medical Ninjutsu?

6
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,218
No.

7
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,495
-We have to get
back and neutralize

8
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,330
that poison, and quickly.

9
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,499
Our job here is finished.

10
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,466
We beat him.

11
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,373
-But more than that,
there's something I must do.

12
00:02:56,043 --> 00:03:00,647
My job isn't done yet.

13
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,517
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): So this
is what she was talking about.

14
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,160
-Is that?

15
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,361
KAKASHI: Yeah.

16
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,529
-Leave him alone, will you?

17
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,064
What do you think you're doing?

18
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,373
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Lady Chiyo is

19
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,275
exchanging her own life for his.

20
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,546
-Sakura, what?

21
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,486
-It's gonna be all right.

22
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,554
She's bring him back.

23
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,569
-She's bringing him back?

24
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,041
What are you talking about?

25
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,509
I mean, how is
that even possible?

26
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:11,084
-This jutsu, only
Lady Chiyo knows it.

27
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,652
It's a special jutsu.

28
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,286
-Wait.

29
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,554
Are you serious?

30
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,323
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Such
a convenient jutsu

31
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,424
should not be possible.

32
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,263
That chakra flow.

33
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,132
There's no question.

34
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,368
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): It
comes at a considerable risk.

35
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,971
[groan]

36
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,329
-Not enough chakra.

37
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,406
[panting]

38
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,250
Come on.

39
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,139
-You can use my chakra.

40
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,374
Take as much as you need to.

41
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,643
That'll work, won't it, Granny?

42
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,611
Please?

43
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,381
[panting]

44
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,618
KAKASHI: Naruto and Gaara
are both jinchuriki.

45
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,088
Naruto knows how Gaara feels
better than anyone in the Sand

46
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,256
ever could.

47
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,091
After all, those
who are jinchuriki

48
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,594
have been treated the
same way in every village.

49
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:09,236
That's why he feels this
desperate need to save Gaara.

50
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,503
It doesn't matter
whether Gaara's

51
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,974
from the Sand or the
Leaf or anywhere else.

52
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,547
CHIYO: Place your hands
on top of mine, son.

53
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,973
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

54
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,452
KAKASHI: Naruto's dream
is to become Hokage.

55
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,122
So the news that Gaara
had been made Kazekage

56
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,357
hit him pretty hard.

57
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:08,461
He was frustrated, but at the
same time, deep in his heart,

58
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,764
he was profoundly
happy for Gaara.

59
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,435
You see, Naruto has
another remarkable gift.

60
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,606
He doesn't need much time or
many words to make friends

61
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,608
with almost everyone he meets.

62
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:33,353
CHIYO: In this world of shinobi
created by frivolous old people

63
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,523
it's a great comfort to
know that new souls like

64
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,124
yourself have come along.

65
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:51,004
Up till now, everything I've
done in my life has been wrong.

66
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,975
But at least, here
in my final hour,

67
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:59,746
I can finally do something
right for a change.

68
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:11,658
The Sand and the Leaf, may
the future that awaits them

69
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,328
be different from the way
things were in our time.

70
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,504
This special power of yours
that Kakashi spoke about of,

71
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:29,409
that power will change
the future dramatically.

72
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:36,116
Become a Hokage the likes of
which has never been seen.

73
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,752
And as for you, Sakura.

74
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,186
-Yes.

75
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,491
CHIYO: In the future, help
those closest to your heart,

76
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,295
not some old grandmother
with one foot in the grave.

77
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,600
You're a lot like me, child.

78
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:58,104
So few women possess
such strong spirit.

79
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:02,042
You'll surpass your
master as a kunoichi.

80
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,243
I've little doubt.

81
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:15,588
Naruto, do an old woman
a favor, will you?

82
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,526
You are the only
person in the world

83
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,531
who knows the extent
of Gaara's pain.

84
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,368
He also knows your pain.

85
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,338
Please, look after Gaara.

86
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,098
-Gaara.

87
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:04,971
Gaara!

88
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,543
GAARA: Who is that?

89
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:16,349
Who's-- who's calling me?

90
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,217
Who is it?

91
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,987
This hand.

92
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,726
Oh.

93
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,497
It's just my hand again.

94
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,336
My hand-- me.

95
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,108
Who am I?

96
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:48,448
I-- I am--

97
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,247
-Gaara.

98
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,265
-Naruto.

99
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,519
What is this?

100
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,255
-They all came
running to help you.

101
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,591
You've had everyone
worried half to death.

102
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,193
-Lord Gaara!

103
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,128
Sir, are you all right?

104
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,002
Yeah!

105
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,371
[cheering]

106
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,973
Welcome back, sir!

107
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,158
-You sure had us worried there.

108
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,426
-No kidding.

109
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,128
You caused us a whole ton of
grief there, little brother.

110
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,163
-Ugh.

111
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,398
Will you two quit
putting on airs already?

112
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,701
Gaara's the Kazekage, Remember?

113
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,469
Ugh.

114
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,972
Show a little
respect, you nitwits.

115
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,276
-Gaara, talk to me.

116
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,110
How do you feel?

117
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,453
-Easy.

118
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,288
You shouldn't get
up too quickly.

119
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,690
Your body hasn't completely
recovered from the rigor mortis

120
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,291
yet.

121
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:42,695
-Oh.

122
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,997
Thanks be to the heavens!

123
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,665
I thought we'd lost him.

124
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,334
Without the Lord Kazekage I'd--

125
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,103
-Get a hold of yourself.

126
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,438
There's no way we'd
ever lose Lord Gaara.

127
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,974
Lord Gaara is the
hottest thing ever.

128
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,210
He's a quiet, cool,
strong, and elite warrior.

129
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,278
-Yeah.

130
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,647
Lord Gaara is totally
gorgeous, isn't he?

131
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,615
After all, he is Kazekage.

132
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,250
-If anything should
ever happen again,

133
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,386
I'll protect him
with all my heart.

134
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:06,986
-No.

135
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:07,654
I will!

136
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,088
-Get in line.

137
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,920
-Lord Gaara!

138
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,497
-I know I'm still a genin
and all, but come on.

139
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,532
Cut me a break.

140
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,368
KANKURO: Ah, don't sweat it.

141
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,470
Women always go
weak in the knees

142
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,040
for that cool,
elite type of guy.

143
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,107
So what can you do?

144
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,642
Am I right?

145
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,646
-I'm pretty sure Shikamaru said
something like that once too.

146
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,420
GAARA: He's known
the same pain I have,

147
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,623
and he taught me
that I can change

148
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,193
the path my life will follow.

149
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,397
One day, Kankuro, I'd like
to become something precious

150
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,332
to others too.

151
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,574
KANKURO: Naruto, thank you.

152
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,509
-Huh?

153
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,243
Hey.

154
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,411
Don't look at me.

155
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,214
It's granny over there that
you should be thanking.

156
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,384
She saved Gaara with some kind
of incredible Medical Ninjutsu.

157
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,160
She tired herself
out and fell asleep,

158
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,836
but I'm sure she'll be fine when
we get her back to the village.

159
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:25,951
KANKURO: No. She won't.

160
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,645
Granny Chiyo used "that" jutsu.

161
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,514
-What are you talking about?

162
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,148
Why won't she?

163
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,055
-I will.

164
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:49,989
-Huh?

165
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,057
-Huh?

166
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,459
KANKURO: She wasn't
using Medical Ninjutsu.

167
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,561
It was a Reanimation Ninjutsu.

168
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,501
Granny Chiyo is dead.

169
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,572
-Reanimation Jutsu?

170
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:09,976
-What are you saying?

171
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,011
How can she be dead?

172
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,380
-It's a ninjutsu that allows
you to bring someone back

173
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,518
from the dead in exchange
for your own life.

174
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,521
-It can't be.

175
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,222
NEJI (VOICEOVER): As I thought.

176
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,524
-Guy-sensei.

177
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,124
-Mm.

178
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,634
-Years ago, in our
Puppet Master corps,

179
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,336
a jutsu was secretly
developed to breathe life

180
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,106
into actual puppets.

181
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,008
Granny Chiyo led that project.

182
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:49,515
They did come up with a
method for it, however,

183
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,618
midway they concluded there
was too much risk involved.

184
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,754
It was classified
as forbidden jutsu

185
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,057
before human testing could
be done, and sealed away.

186
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,997
CHIYO: In this world
of shinobi created

187
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,701
by frivolous old people,
it's a great comfort

188
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:13,105
to know that new souls like
yourself have come along.

189
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:19,078
Up till now, everything I've
done in my life has been wrong.

190
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,482
But at least here
in my final hour

191
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:26,552
I can finally do something
right for a change.

192
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:31,090
The Sand and the Leaf, may
the future that awaits them

193
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,026
be different from the way
things were in our time.

194
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,667
This special power of yours
that Kakashi spoke of,

195
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,104
that power will change
the future dramatically.

196
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:55,381
Become a Hokage the likes of
which has never been seen.

197
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,165
-Fell for that one, didn't you?

198
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,535
I was just playing possum.

199
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,537
[laughter]

200
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,544
-Look at her.

201
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,446
I half expect her to
burst out laughing.

202
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,282
Her face is so peaceful.

203
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,120
-Yes.

204
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,060
Yes.

205
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,512
TEMARI: Naruto, there really is
something different about you.

206
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,417
It's true.

207
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,485
You do have the power
to change people.

208
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,995
Lady Chiyo always used
to say that she didn't

209
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,398
care about the future of
the Hidden Sand Village.

210
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,200
She wasn't the
kind of person who

211
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,668
would do something
like this for Gaara.

212
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:31,410
KAKASHI: Lady Chiyo entrusted
the future to you and Gaara.

213
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,580
It was a death
befitting a shinobi.

214
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,020
-Yeah.

215
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,657
Just like the Third.

216
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,658
-That's true.

217
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,295
-Hm.

218
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,631
I get it now.

219
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,301
I understand what
Granny wished for.

220
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,269
-Lord Gaara, are you all right?

221
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,270
-I'm fine.

222
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:44,383
Everyone, pray for Lady
Chiyo, and bid her farewell.

223
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,643
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Lady Chiyo.

224
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,543
[theme music]

225
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:02,868
-We've finally gotten word
from the Sand Village.

226
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,804
Lady Chiyo was
the only casualty.

227
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,675
The Kazekage has been returned
to his village safely.

228
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,277
Teams Guy and Kakashi
completed their missions.

229
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,480
They're scheduled to
return in three days.

230
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:15,814
-Hm.

231
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,683
Sounds like it went smoothly.

232
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,985
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): I'm a
little worried though, milady.

233
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:21,653
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
What do you mean?

234
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:25,257
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade, if I may?

235
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,260
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- Return of the Kazekage.

236
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,662
[theme music]

237
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:41,773
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Gallery of memories.

238
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:42,574
TEMARI: Hey, Gaara.

239
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:43,675
-Hm?

240
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:44,543
-Check it out.

241
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:45,744
I found a bunch of old photos.

242
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:46,879
You wanna have a look?

243
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:48,747
-Let's see 'em.

244
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,848
KANKURO: Oh, hey.

245
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,650
These are from the
chunin exams in the Leaf.

246
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,585
TEMARI: Can you believe
it's been three years?

247
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,654
KANKURO: That's when
Gaara flipped out and went

248
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:58,257
on a rampage.

249
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,325
TEMARI: I don't what
was gonna happen.

250
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,760
Although, I never
thought Gaara could

251
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,863
be stopped by such
a knucklehead.

252
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:08,367
GAARA: We are greatly indebted
to Naruto Uzumaki and the Leaf

253
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,668
Village.

254
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,738
TEMARI: Well, we are
allies with them now.

255
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,039
KANKURO: Plus, we
helped them out

256
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,441
with the Hidden Sound Village.

257
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:20,846
GAARA: And I intend to maintain
that bond with the Leaf.

258
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,914
-Hey, by the way.

259
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,382
-Hm?

260
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:26,618
-You've got a million pictures
of Gaara and almost none of me.

261
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,520
What's up with that?

262
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,790
-Well, Gaara's kind
of a fan favorite.

263
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,993
Give the people what
they want, right?

264
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:35,861
-Oh, man.

265
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:37,396
That hurts.

266
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:38,797
-Sorry.
