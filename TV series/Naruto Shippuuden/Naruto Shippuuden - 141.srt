1
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:15,562
{\an1}MADARA: After the attack of the
nine-tailed fox, 16 years ago,

2
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:18,333
{\an1}unjust suspicions
grew that the Uchiha

3
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,003
{\an1}had tried to stage
an insurrection

4
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,908
{\an1}and seize power to take over
leadership of the village.

5
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,845
{\an1}As a result, the Uchiha were
put under strict surveillance

6
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:30,649
{\an1}by the ANBU black
ops, and were forced

7
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,752
{\an1}to relocate to the
outskirts of the village.

8
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:34,121
{\an1}They became completely isolated.

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,964
{\an1}Distrust bred hatred,
and eventually, their suspicions

10
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,435
became reality.

11
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:48,307
The Uchiha clan
started plotting a coup

12
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:52,011
{\an1}de tat to take over the village.

13
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,949
{\an1}And so the Hidden Leaf's
leaders planted a spy

14
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:57,819
{\an1}within the Uchiha
clan to watch us.

15
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:03,592
{\an1}That spy was your older
brother, Itachi Uchiha.

16
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:07,165
{\an1}And that's when Itachi's
suffering began.

17
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,567
{\an1}-An Uchiha coup de tat.

18
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:14,741
And Itachi...
was he really a spy?

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,380
{\an1}- Despite being an Uchiha,
you were told nothing

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,217
{\an1}because you were so young.

21
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:21,584
{\an1}But it's all true.

22
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:28,894
{\an1}Your father, Fugaku,
was the mastermind

23
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:33,734
{\an1}of that planned coup.

24
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:37,106
{\an1}And Itachi was a spy who
entered the ANBU black ops

25
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:37,672
{\an1}on your father's orders.

26
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:45,350
{\an1}- Itachi, you also serve as
the Uchiha clan's pipeline

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,454
{\an1}to the village nerve center.

28
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:52,826
{\an1}You understand that, don't you?

29
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:55,930
- However,
it was actually the opposite.

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,434
{\an1}Itachi was supplying the
village with intelligence

31
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:01,104
on the Uchiha.

32
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:05,109
In other words,
he was a double agent.

33
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,413
{\an1}You can't even imagine what a
heavy burden that was to bear.

34
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,914
-But why?

35
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:12,153
Why would Itachi
betray the Uchiha?

36
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:15,457
- You may never
understand his reasons,

37
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:19,128
{\an1}because you've never lived
through the horrors of war.

38
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:22,566
{\an1}The Third Great Ninja War,
when Itachi was merely

39
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:27,973
four years old,
he saw many people die.

40
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,410
{\an1}He should have never
had to experience war

41
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,146
{\an1}at such a young age.

42
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:35,217
War is hell.

43
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:37,820
{\an1}That trauma turned
him into a pacifist

44
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,958
{\an1}who hated warfare,
one who had the peace

45
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,827
and stability of
the village foremost

46
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:46,499
{\an1}in his mind and actions.

47
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,337
{\an1}Instead of being bound by
obligation to his clan,

48
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,808
{\an1}he was a ninja devoted
to his village,

49
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,879
{\an1}and the village leaders
exploited that trait.

50
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,749
{\an1}They assigned him to a top
secret mission... an eye

51
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,919
for an eye.

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,858
{\an1}For they'd need the
sharingan to face the Uchiha.

53
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,394
That's right.

54
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:14,236
{\an1}The mission was the eradication
of the entire Uchiha clan.

55
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,848
{\an1}What must Itachi have
gone through emotionally

56
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:27,354
when he learned
of his assignment?

57
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:31,159
{\an1}Itachi was faced with a
terrible choice... the decision

58
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,795
{\an1}to raise his hand against
his fellow brethren

59
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:37,967
was probably an
unbelievable struggle.

60
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,938
{\an1}But if ninja the caliber of
the Uchiha were to revolt,

61
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:43,074
{\an1}both the Hidden Leaf
village and the Land of Fire

62
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,078
{\an1}would be shaken tremendously.

63
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:47,848
{\an1}Other nations would take
advantage of the situation

64
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,185
and invade.

65
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:52,120
{\an1}It could easily become the
trigger for the Fourth Great

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,256
Ninja War.

67
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,794
{\an1}The Uchiha clan's self-interest
would embroil innocent people,

68
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,632
{\an1}who had nothing to do
with the Shinobi world,

69
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,301
{\an1}and countless people
die once again.

70
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:08,209
{\an1}If you were Itachi,
what would you have done?

71
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,750
{\an1}So he made up his mind.

72
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,820
He himself would
drop the curtain

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,891
{\an1}on his own clan's history.

74
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:22,061
Of course,
he did not hate the Uchiha.

75
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,665
{\an1}He simply did what he had to.

76
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,502
{\an1}The discrimination by the
village and the object

77
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,006
{\an1}of their antagonism...
he shouldered all the

78
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:34,043
blame himself.

79
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,878
{\an1}No one should ever
question Itachi's decision

80
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,916
{\an1}and the sacrifices he made.

81
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,654
{\an1}To be truthful, back then, I had

82
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:44,725
{\an1}also been quietly plotting war.

83
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:48,363
{\an1}I held grudges against the
Senju-led Leaf, as well as

84
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:52,535
{\an1}the Uchiha, and Itachi
had picked up on that.

85
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:56,240
{\an1}He alone knew of my existence.

86
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,946
{\an1}He sought me out and
made me a proposal.

87
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,016
In exchange for
letting me carry out

88
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,152
{\an1}my vendetta against
the Uchiha, I

89
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:09,190
{\an1}was to leave the village alone.

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,995
He would aid me
against the clan.

91
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:15,899
{\an1}The third Hokage tried
to resolve the situation

92
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,736
{\an1}through other means.

93
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,372
{\an1}He attempted to open
negotiations with the Uchiha

94
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:25,680
{\an1}to reach a compromise,
but time ran out,

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,482
{\an1}and his efforts failed.

96
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:28,383
{\an1}The night drew near.

97
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,294
{\an1}He knew his fate.

98
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,332
{\an1}To become known as a criminal
who murdered his own clan.

99
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,769
{\an1}To bear the burden of disgrace
and become a rogue ninja.

100
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,173
All of that was
part of the mission.

101
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:47,909
{\an1}Itachi completely
fulfilled his duty,

102
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,382
{\an1}except for one single mistake.

103
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:55,152
{\an1}He could not bring himself
to kill his younger brother.

104
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,059
[theme music]

105
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:47,537
{\an1}- Afterwards, Itachi
appealed to the third Hokage,

106
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:50,441
{\an1}beseeching him to protect you
from Danzo and the councillors.

107
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,578
{\an1}He fled the village
after threatening Danzo.

108
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:56,148
If anything were
to happen to you,

109
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:57,651
{\an1}Itachi would leak
all the intelligence

110
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:02,090
{\an1}he had on the Hidden
Leaf to unallied nations.

111
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,094
He worried about
you above all else,

112
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:08,131
{\an1}and yet he could not
tell you the full truth,

113
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,534
{\an1}so he told you as
much as he could.

114
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:14,741
-It's a lie!

115
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:15,976
{\an1}This just isn't like
you, big brother!

116
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,578
It's not!

117
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,246
{\an1}- I have acted like
the older brother

118
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:22,150
{\an1}you desired for one reason...
because I wanted

119
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,154
to discover how
powerful you were.

120
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,157
I needed to find
a worthy opponent

121
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,394
{\an1}to test the limits
of my own abilities.

122
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:32,331
{\an1}You have that unique potential.

123
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,601
{\an1}Now I've made you hate me.

124
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,939
Now you have to
desire to defeat me,

125
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:39,440
{\an1}which is exactly why I'm
going to allow you to live.

126
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:44,814
Don't you see?

127
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:46,750
{\an1}It's all for my own benefit.

128
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,586
{\an1}Foolish little brother.

129
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:52,858
{\an1}If you wish to kill me one
day, in hate and revenge,

130
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:56,663
{\an1}surviving in such an unsightly
manner as this, by all means,

131
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,533
flee.

132
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:02,671
{\an1}Cling to your wretched
life, and then, one day,

133
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,674
{\an1}when you possess the same
eyes, come back and face me.

134
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,650
{\an1}- He gave you a reason to
seek revenge against him,

135
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,788
{\an1}and hoped it would
make you stronger.

136
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,959
{\an1}They wanted you to believe
that the Uchiha was

137
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,298
{\an1}a proud clan from the
Hidden Leaf village.

138
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:24,300
{\an1}He begged the Hokage to
make sure you would never

139
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,671
learn the truth.

140
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,440
{\an1}And from the moment
he left the village,

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,513
{\an1}he resigned himself to battling
you to the death in order

142
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:35,248
{\an1}to bestow upon you new powers.

143
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,287
{\an1}That is Itachi's truth.

144
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,461
-No.

145
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:44,461
You're lying.

146
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,969
{\an1}It's got to be a lie.

147
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:50,436
{\an1}It just has to be.

148
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,612
{\an1}It's all nonsense.

149
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,283
Itachi tried to
kill me many times!

150
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,988
{\an1}- If Itachi really
wanted to kill you,

151
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,658
{\an1}you'd most certainly be dead.

152
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:09,729
{\an1}- He even used the mangekyo
sharingan against me!

153
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:10,763
{\an1}There's no question he
was trying to kill me!

154
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,771
[screaming]

155
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,607
No question.

156
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,143
- Even your
contingency plans were

157
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,479
{\an1}factored into his calculations.

158
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:27,453
{\an1}He had to pressure you
hard during that battle.

159
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:29,856
{\an1}Surely you've figured out why?

160
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:30,824
{\an1}You understand it
now, don't you?

161
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:36,732
{\an1}-And now it finally emerges.

162
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,788
{\an1}- He wanted to free
you of the curse mark

163
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:57,126
{\an1}and the death of the
one closest to you.

164
00:10:57,126 --> 00:11:01,598
{\an1}It was a battle to awaken
your mangekyo sharingan.

165
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:04,636
{\an1}Itachi carefully set up
everything in that battle,

166
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:07,339
diverting your
attention from the truth

167
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,312
{\an1}by pretending to the very end
that he was stealing your eyes.

168
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,347
You're starting
to see the truth.

169
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:18,021
-You're lying.

170
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:21,793
I know it.

171
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:24,595
{\an1}You sent the Nine-tails
to attack the Hidden Leaf!

172
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:27,466
{\an1}Itachi told me that
it was all your doing!

173
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,402
{\an1}ITACHI (VOICEOVER):
16 years ago,

174
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,272
{\an1}when the Nine-tails
attacked the Hidden Leaf

175
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,775
{\an1}Village, it was Madara's doing.

176
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,612
{\an1}But like Madara's bid for
power, the Fourth Hokage

177
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,248
{\an1}stopped that, too.

178
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:39,382
In short,

179
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,662
{\an1}Madara is a bitter,
defeated loser.

180
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:50,497
{\an1}He is not worthy or
capable of achieving

181
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,500
{\an1}Uchiha's true greatness.

182
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,970
I am the one.

183
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,777
{\an1}I shall surpass Madara and
become the ultimate ninja.

184
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:03,316
{\an1}- You laid false charges
against the Uchiha

185
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:06,552
{\an1}and you teamed up with
Itachi to toy with our clan!

186
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,622
{\an1}- Itachi was lying
when he told you that.

187
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,657
{\an1}Just as I've explained.

188
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,560
{\an1}He was gripped with fear
that you would somehow

189
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,496
{\an1}discover the truth.

190
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,233
{\an1}He wanted to make
absolutely certain there

191
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,802
{\an1}was no chance of that.

192
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,874
{\an1}He fed you lies to make
sure you wouldn't trust me.

193
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,978
{\an1}He even implanted
Amaterasu in your eyes.

194
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,513
{\an1}- There's no way that
I'd ever believe you!

195
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,085
{\an1}Itachi was pure evil!

196
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:32,087
{\an1}He was a criminal who
slaughtered our clan

197
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,991
{\an1}and became an Akatsuki!

198
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,494
{\an1}- He took the burden
of all this on himself

199
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:40,231
{\an1}and fled his birth village.

200
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,835
{\an1}Then he joined the
Akatsuki to spy from inside

201
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:44,503
{\an1}on the organization that
threatened his village.

202
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,249
{\an1}He always had the welfare of
the Hidden Leaf in his mind,

203
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,988
{\an1}just as he always thought
of yours, as well, Sasuke.

204
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,592
{\an1}Itachi appeared in the
Hidden Leaf Village

205
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,728
{\an1}after the death of
the Third Hokage, who

206
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:06,166
had promised to
be your protector.

207
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,003
{\an1}He wanted to remind
Danzo and the councillors

208
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:13,276
{\an1}that he was still alive and
still very much a threat.

209
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:13,977
{\an1}He wanted to make sure...

210
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:14,978
-Stop it!

211
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:16,280
More lies!

212
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,949
{\an1}Everything you say is a lie!

213
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,085
{\an1}You're still alive, aren't you?

214
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,734
{\an1}- Each of us lives
dependant and bound

215
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:35,572
{\an1}by our individual knowledge
and our awareness.

216
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:40,746
All that is what
we call reality.

217
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:44,751
{\an1}However, both knowledge and
awareness are equivocal.

218
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:48,123
{\an1}One's reality might
be another's illusion.

219
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:51,194
{\an1}We all live inside
our own fantasies.

220
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:55,399
{\an1}Don't you think that's
true, Sasuke?

221
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,936
How much can you
see when you look

222
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:02,041
{\an1}with those sharingan
eyes of yours?

223
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,911
{\an1}- My eyes are not the
same as they once were.

224
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:05,645
{\an1}My sharingan can see
through genjutsu.

225
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,521
{\an1}- You speak with such
confidence, as you always do.

226
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,593
{\an1}Well, for now, I'm willing
to take your word for it.

227
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,437
{\an1}- Those eyes of yours did
not perceive a single truth

228
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:26,307
about Itachi.

229
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,477
{\an1}You weren't able to pierce
through any of the illusions

230
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:31,281
he created.

231
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:37,655
{\an1}Itachi killed his friends,
his superiors, his lover,

232
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:42,263
his father, his
mother, but he couldn't

233
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:45,166
{\an1}kill his little brother.

234
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,304
{\an1}He killed every shred
of feeling in his heart

235
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,073
in order to
slaughter his own kin

236
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:54,179
{\an1}for the sake of his village.

237
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:59,519
{\an1}But he just couldn't
bring himself to kill you.

238
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,187
{\an1}Do you understand
what that means?

239
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,736
{\an1}To him, your life was even
more precious than the village.

240
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:20,380
{\an1}Until the moment of his death...
no, even after he died,

241
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,619
{\an1}it was all for you,
to confer on you new powers.

242
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:29,024
{\an1}By allowing you to defeat him,
he had avenged the Uchiha clan.

243
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:34,533
{\an1}He made you the hero of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

244
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,670
{\an1}Ravaged by illness, painfully
aware of his impending death,

245
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,211
{\an1}he forcefully prolonged his
life with medication, all

246
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:44,646
{\an1}for the sake of his
beloved little brother.

247
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,824
{\an1}Because he had to fight you
and die in your presence.

248
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,774
{\an1}For the peace of the
Hidden Leaf Village,

249
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:09,613
{\an1}and most of all for
you, Sasuke Uchiha,

250
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:14,119
{\an1}he wanted to die being known
as a criminal, and a traitor.

251
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,923
{\an1}He accepted disgrace
in the place of honor,

252
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:20,295
{\an1}and hatred in the place of love.

253
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:25,234
{\an1}And yet, Itachi still died
with a smile on his face.

254
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,338
He bequeathed to
you the Uchiha name,

255
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,007
{\an1}still fooling you
to the very end.

256
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:39,720
{\an1}ITACHI: I'm home!

257
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:46,896
{\an1}-Welcome home, Itachi!

258
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,367
Hey come on,
let's go outside play together.

259
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,902
{\an1}So what do you think we
should go play first?

260
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:53,339
{\an1}-Stop that, Sasuke.

261
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,976
{\an1}Your brother has academy
homework to do first.

262
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:58,312
{\an1}You could play after
he's finished doing that.

263
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:58,713
SASUKE: But Mom!

264
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:06,089
- It's OK,
I can do my homework later.

265
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,558
{\an1}Besides, it's easy.

266
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,664
-Oh, goodness.

267
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,531
{\an1}SASUKE (THINKING): I wonder
where he could be hiding.

268
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:19,707
-Ha!

269
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:22,578
{\an1}I found you, big brother!

270
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,714
{\an1}-You're pretty sharp, Sasuke.

271
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:26,182
But too bad!

272
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,050
-Aww!

273
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,521
{\an1}That's so not fair!

274
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,922
Hey Dad?

275
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,192
-Huh?

276
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,194
{\an1}- Itachi and I were out
playing hide and seek today,

277
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,565
{\an1}but then he used a clone jutsu
to trick me and run away.

278
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,934
{\an1}And that's cheating, isn't it?

279
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:44,675
{\an1}- Oh, you've mastered
using the clone jutsu?

280
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,711
{\an1}- Hey wait, you could
teach me the clone jutsu

281
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,346
{\an1}after we finish dinner, OK?

282
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:48,446
-Homework, boys.

283
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,621
{\an1}-Sorry about that, Sasuke.

284
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,157
{\an1}But we'll do it some other time.

285
00:17:56,157 --> 00:18:00,663
{\an1}No Sasuke, it's time to go.

286
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,131
{\an1}- What happened to
the new shuriken jutsu

287
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,801
{\an1}you promised to teach me, huh?

288
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,402
{\an1}ITACHI: It'll have to wait.

289
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:06,671
{\an1}I have an important
mission tomorrow.

290
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:09,841
I must prepare.

291
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,376
{\an1}SASUKE: You're such
a big fat liar.

292
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,489
-Sorry, Sasuke.

293
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:21,190
{\an1}Maybe some other time.

294
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,898
{\an1}SASUKE: OK, Just watch this.

295
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,533
-Hey!

296
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,968
Be careful!

297
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,037
[grunt]

298
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:37,645
-Itachi?

299
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:39,448
That was fun.

300
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,350
{\an1}Will you train with
me again sometime?

301
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,153
-Sure.

302
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,456
{\an1}But I'm going to be
assigned missions soon,

303
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:49,261
{\an1}and starting tomorrow, you'll
be attending the Ninja Academy.

304
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,764
{\an1}So, we aren't going to have
as much free time to ourselves

305
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:51,097
anymore.

306
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,937
- That's OK,
as long as you can still

307
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:57,472
spend time with
me once in awhile.

308
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,447
{\an1}-We're flesh and blood.

309
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:06,384
{\an1}I'll always be there for you.

310
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:10,524
{\an1}Even if it's just as an
obstacle for you to overcome.

311
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:10,624
-Big brother?

312
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:15,963
Listen.

313
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:19,602
{\an1}Can you please help me with
my shuriken training today?

314
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:22,138
{\an1}-I can't, I'm too busy.

315
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,375
{\an1}Why don't you ask
father to teach you?

316
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,744
{\an1}- But you're better
than he is when

317
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,312
{\an1}it comes to shuriken jutsu.

318
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,113
{\an1}Even a kid can see that.

319
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,058
Hey!

320
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,929
-Sorry, Sasuke.

321
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,866
{\an1}Some other time, OK?

322
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,033
{\an1}Even if it's just as an
obstacle for you to overcome.

323
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:50,644
Sasuke,
I'll always be there for you.

324
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:53,582
{\an1}Even if you do hate me.

325
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:54,014
That's what big
brothers are for.

326
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,160
{\an1}-Forgive me, Sasuke.

327
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,363
But this is it.

328
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:02,240
{\an1}-We are no longer the Hebi.

329
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,776
{\an1}From this day on,
our team will be the Taka.

330
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:10,251
{\an1}And Taka has but one goal.

331
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:10,718
Our mission

332
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:18,127
{\an1}is to destroy the Hidden Leaf.

333

334

338
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,595
{\an1}KILLER B: Oh my eyes,
light too bright.

339
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,164
{\an1}Is it noon already?

340
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:02,502
{\an1}Dammit, man, no fool, you fool.

341
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,505
{\an1}Training for more and
my belly is starving.

342
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:06,208
Rap loving guy,
I got me a hunch that I just

343
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,843
{\an1}decided on sukiyaki for lunch!

344
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:07,743
Yeah.

345
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:14,919
{\an1}-Sure looks like that's the guy.

346
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,355
Next time,
on Naruto Shippuden...

347
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,358
{\an1}Battle of Unraikyo.

348
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:22,295
Eight-tails,
I'm here to capture you.
