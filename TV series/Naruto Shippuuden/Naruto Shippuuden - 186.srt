Mount Jofuku, huh?

95
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:13,062

flower, and as a result
it's difficult to
obtain... so...

00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:41,169
{\an8}(Sakura)
Naruto, Lady Hokage's
been treating Lee's
injuries, hasn't she?

139
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:42,838
{\an8}(Naruto)
Yeah! Of course!

140
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,574
{\an7}(Sakura)
Even so, doesn't it
seem like Lee's been really
out of sorts lately?

141
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,308
{\an8}(Sakura)
...Like he has
no energy?

142
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,777
{\an8}(Naruto)
What do you expect?
That was a serious
injury!

143
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,113
{\an8}It isn't just that!
His optimism has
started to fade...

144
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:57,280
{\an8}He's actually
skipped a few
rehab sessions,
too.

145
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:01,484
{\an5}That's not the
Lee I know!
Even today he
would have said:

146
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:06,588
{\an4}Sakura! To protect
you, I will recover
faster! And hour, a
minute... No!

147
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:10,157
{\an1}I will not stay
hurt a second more
than I must!

148
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,160
{\an5}If he were his
normal self then
he'd mean every
word he said, too!

149
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:16,428
{\an1}Uhhh, he'd
do it just
for you?

150
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:19,898
{\an1}Yeah, but still,
Sakura has a point.

151
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,465
{\an1}Hm?

152
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,268
{\an7}Remember his injuries
were so serious even the
medical team couldn't
heal him.

153
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,403
{\an7}Maybe he won't ever
fully recover...

154
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,873
{\an7}If Lee thinks that,
it's no surprise
he's feeling down.

155
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:33,675
{\an1}Granny Tsunade is
gonna fix him up!
I know she will!

156
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:38,544
{\an4}I'm just saying sometimes
it's not right to give
someone hope when there
really isn't any!

157
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:39,278
{\an1}But...

158
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,013
{\an7}You may want to
cheer him up--

159
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,348
{\an7}but that can put
pressure on him to put
on a happy face, and that
can make things worse!

160
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:49,385
{\an7}Please, Naruto, don't
say stuff like "it'll be
fine," because we don't
know that it will be!

tougher than you

163
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:58,926

Gaara in the Chunin

an amazing guy.

164

{\an7}I know there's no waythat
I could ever understand
the suffering he's going
through right now...

169
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:22,643
{\an7}...but he's doing
everything he can to
overcome it, and I
believe in him.

170

wilt if you're
not careful!

272
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:46,553
{\an1}Who's that?

273
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:51,757
{\an4}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>Our apologies!</i>
<i>Here's the secret</i>
<i>message!</i>

274
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,858
{\an1}<i>(Furofuki)</i>
<i>Hm.</i>

275
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:57,195
{\an7}So, old lady, you
live in the middle
of this forest all
by yourself, huh?

276
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:00,797
{\an8}I <i>do</i> have a name,
you know! I'm
called Furofuki.

277
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:05,301
{\an4}I'm a Medical Ninja
from the Hidden Leaf,
and I'm here to study
the Jofuku Flowers.

278
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:08,169
{\an1}It's what I love
to do, and that
is that!

279
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:14,340
{\an4}Is that thing we
encountered a guardian
deity of the Jofuku
Flower or something?

280
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:16,875
{\an1}The flower protects
itself when it's
picked!

281
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:22,380
{\an4}It searches the mind of
whoever picked it to find
their archenemy, transforms
into that foe, and attacks.

282
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,849
{\an4}I guess it's just
our bad luck that
we were thinking
of Gaara!

283
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:29,651
{\an5}Too bad we didn't
think of Choji!
Then we coulda won
no problem!

284
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:35,256
{\an4}You know, if you hadn't
trespassed into the Jofuku
Forest in the first place,
this never would've happened.

285
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:36,990
{\an1}We're really sorry!

286
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,191
We sure are!

287
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:43,429
{\an1}Whoa! This thing's
so heavy!

288
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,264
{\an1}And all of this
is just Jofuku
Flowers!?

289
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:50,900
{\an7}It is. And your
mission now is to bring
all of these back to
the Leaf Village.

290
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,302
Ino...

291
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:56,704
{\an4}Hey don't blame
me! Blame the guy
who sent us on
this mission!

292
00:19:57,605 --> 00:20:02,574
{\an4}Rejoice, Lee! Because
I've managed to bring
you the greatest gift
of all today!

293
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:07,012
{\an7}<i>(Guy Sensei)</i>
<i>MY special handmade</i>
<i>herbal food pills</i>
<i>of love!</i>

294
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:11,014
{\an7}These little guys
were made with my
sweat, tears, and
love!

295
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:14,850
{\an7}And of course, they're
filled with the
warm friendship of
your comrades, too!

296
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,852
{\an7}My comrades'
friendship?

297
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:22,856
{\an4}That's right! Cause none
other than Naruto and his
team obtained the medicinal
herb needed to make these!

298
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,224
{\an7}Sakura too!?

299
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:26,959
{\an7}<i>(Guy Sensei)</i>
<i>Yes! Sakura </i>
<i>and Ino, too!</i>

300
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:32,297
{\an7}I see. Then that must
mean that these have also
been filled with love
from Sakura...

301
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,300
{\an7}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Sakura! In order to </i>
<i>repay your kindness, I</i>
<i>will recover faster!</i>

302
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:42,271
{\an7}<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>An hour? A minute? No.</i>
<i>I will not stay hurt a</i>
<i>second more than I must!</i>

303
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:45,440
{\an4}If you eat a
hundred of these,
you won't need to
fear surgery!

304
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:46,773
I will do it!

305
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,575
{\an1}Wait!! Just
hold on!

306
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:53,412
{\an7}Tell me how many
I must eat each
day, and I will!

307
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:57,915
{\an7}I'm glad to see that
you're not taking any
chances this time!
Bravo Lee!

308
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:02,185
{\an7}But it's not one
hundred total...
It's one hundred
each day!!!!

309
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,586
[munching]

310
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,655
{\an1}Don't you worry,
Lee! I won't let
you suffer alone!

311
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:11,058
{\an4}While you're eating
all of those I'll do
one thousand speed
push ups!

312
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:59,403
{\an4}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Why do I have to</i>
<i>train to break free</i>
<i>of Genjutsu now?</i>

313
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,639
{\an7}<i>(Jiraya)</i>
<i>Don't you remember </i>
<i>the reason for this</i>
<i>training?</i>

314
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,740
{\an4}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Huh!? It's so I</i>
<i>can bring back</i>
<i>Sasuke, of course!</i>

315
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:10,244
{\an4}<i>(Jiraya)</i>
<i>Sasuke possesses the </i>
<i>Sharingan. Naturally he'll</i>
<i>learn to master genjutsu.</i>

316
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:14,281
{\an4}<i>(Jiraya)</i>
<i>If you can't defend yourself</i>
<i>against it, how do you expect</i>
<i>to bring him back!?</i>

317
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:19,250

<i>and Student, the Training.</i>

318

{\an5}(Jiraya)
Let's get some real
practice at breaking
genjutsu!
