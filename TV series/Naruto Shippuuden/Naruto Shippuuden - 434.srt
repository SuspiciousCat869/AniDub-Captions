{\an1}At least then I'd be able
to prove who's better.

{\an1}Come on, you guys, stop it!

{\an1}Never say that again!

{\an1}Yes. It was all extremely

has gone missing.

disappeared as well.

155

{\an1}There were signs that showed
he'd been dragged underground
by something...

creature wrapped around Guy
Sensei and dragged him away!

attacked us too!

{\an1}The remaining teams

169
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,000
{\an1}We need to regroup with every
team before anything else.
And set up a base camp.

{\an1}You're right: first, we need to
regroup with the other teams.

172
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,567
{\an1}I want to confirm some
things with them.

173
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,501
{\an1}Chiefly what the status is for
Asuma and Kurenai.

174
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:08,567
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Guy Sensei lost consciousness</i>

<i>The exact same thing happened</i>
<i>with Kakashi Sensei.</i>

176
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:17,033
{\an4}Come to think of it... Kakashi
Sensei was watching a Shinobi
Ageha butterfly before it
happened.

177
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:23,801
{\an4}It's possible the powdery scales
of the Shinobi Ageha and the
chakra flowing underground
interacted with each other.

178
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:28,400
{\an1}Maybe there's a jutsu that
doesn't work on us but has an
effect on the jonin.

179
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:33,234
{\an1}Could be, but the scales
of the Shinobi Ageha
aren't toxic or poisonous.

180
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:39,367
{\an1}I don't know how the jutsu might
work, but like I said...
there's something that I want to

181
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,868
verify with the
others... about this.

182
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,868
{\an1}What!? But, that's--

183
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,200
{\an1}Lord Fourth's kunai?

184
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:46,634
I have no clue what's
going on here!

185
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,200
Isn't that exactly the
same kunai that you found
earlier, Sakura?

186
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:54,334
{\an1}It's not.  This is the one Guy
Sensei dropped when he was
captured.

187
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:59,667
{\an4}Two separate jonin just happened
to drop the kunai that were
entrusted to them by Lord
Fourth...

188
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,801
{\an1}at's something that I find very
hard to believe.

189
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:06,000
{\an1}So if we assume the enemy
dropped them there
intentionally...

190
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:09,567
{\an1}Must be someone with
considerable knowledge
of many jutsu...

191
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:13,567
{\an1}Or somebody who knows the secret
behind Lord Fourth's kunai.

192
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:17,801
{\an1}Then I have a feeling that we'd
better hurry up and join with
the other teams quickly.

193
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:24,300
{\an4}The tracking team of Kiba, Shino
and Hinata should be able to
pinpoint their locations pretty
easily.

194
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,868
Yes, I agree.

195
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,534
{\an1}Then can we rescue the captains?

196
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,334
{\an1}No. Once we know their
situation, we'll send word
back to the village.

197
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:36,133
Right. We don't have
authorization for a rescue.

that village and do a little
search and reconnaissance, huh?
