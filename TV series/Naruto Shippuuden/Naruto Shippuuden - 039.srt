1
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,256
-There's no presence of anyone
around the Tenchi bridge yet.

2
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,293
-Well, I guess that
rules out one thing--

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,196
there's no Akatsuki ambush.

4
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,532
All right.

5
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,869
Then that means we'll proceed
according to the plan.

6
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:59,438
NARUTO: Right.

7
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,714
-Here, Naruto.

8
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:07,084
Could you take this picture
and hold it up in front of me?

9
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:13,729
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,397
That's right.

11
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,966
Just face it toward me.

12
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,140
Wood Style Transformation.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,646
Well, did it turn out OK?

14
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:43,381
-Yeah.

15
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,482
It's amazing.

16
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,822
You look exactly like
Sasori's puppet, Hiroko.

17
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:48,657
-Excellent.

18
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,226
Now I have to match the voice.

19
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:53,131
Let me know when it
sounds close to Sasori.

20
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:55,134
-Yes, sir.

21
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,105
[singing in different pitches]

22
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:09,961
-There.

23
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:10,762
You've got it.

24
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,033
That's Sasori's voice.

25
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,235
-All right.

26
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,906
If you're all ready, shall
we begin the operation?

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,607
-Hold it.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,076
Your tone's too polite.

29
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:22,082
Try to sound more--
oh I don't know.

30
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:24,419
Way more aggressive
or something.

31
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,121
-Oh.

32
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:25,755
Yeah.

33
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:26,923
You're right.

34
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:29,261
I'm supposed to be cranky
and irritable, and more

35
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:33,168
than anything, I hate
to be kept waiting.

36
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:36,173
We're starting
the operation now!

37
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,142
-You nailed it.

38
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:39,178
That's exactly what
he sounds like.

39
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,615
-Listen up.

40
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,451
Our opponents will
be on the alert,

41
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:45,957
so I want us to split up.

42
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:49,763
We'll have to work as a
team, especially you, Naruto.

43
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:52,101
No one makes a move
before I give the signal.

44
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:55,808
Let's go!

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,502
OK.

46
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,504
This is it.

47
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,266
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
The wind's strong here.

48
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:48,767
Good.

49
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,241
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

50
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:33,578
-Yeah.

51
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,914
This spot should be fine.

52
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,705
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
It's almost noon.

53
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,041
-That lousy spy.

54
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,476
Why isn't he showing up?

55
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:19,659
SAI: He's here.

56
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:43,468
[theme music]

57
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:53,996
-That must be the guy.

58
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:14,531
SASORI: Go to the Tenchi
Bridge in the Village

59
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,702
Hidden in the Grass.

60
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:21,276
Ten days from now at noon,
one of Orochimaru's henchmen

61
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,449
is working for me
as a spy, and that's

62
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:27,721
where I'm supposed to
rendezvous with him.

63
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,192
However, I don't think I'll--

64
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,482
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
So, that's him.

65
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,911
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Good
luck, Captain Yamato.

66
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:58,446
-It's been a long
time, Lord Sasori.

67
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:11,703
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): That's--

68
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:16,845
-About five years, right?

69
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:29,167
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
Kabuto Yakushi.

70
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,169
-Were you followed?

71
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,619
-It's just you and me.

72
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,354
-How do you feel?

73
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:46,530
-Well, I still haven't
shaken that strange sensation

74
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:51,906
from when your jutsu broke and
I remembered who I was again.

75
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:55,380
My head still feels
clouded and heavy.

76
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,315
-No way.

77
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,182
He's back?

78
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:58,485
-It's crazy.

79
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,392
So the Akatsuki spy
was actually Kabuto.

80
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:05,498
-I have a few questions for you.

81
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,970
-I don't have much time,
so please keep it brief.

82
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,174
I risked my life
sneaking out to meet you

83
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:15,181
without Orochimaru finding out.

84
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:17,652
-I want information
about Sasuke,

85
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:20,357
as well as the location
of your boss's hideout.

86
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,835
-Orochimaru has
several hideouts.

87
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,738
We keep moving to a
different one every week

88
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,676
to avoid being
discovered by the enemy.

89
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,681
Of course, many are in
the Hidden Sound Village,

90
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,252
but some hideouts are
in other lands too.

91
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:40,692
He has spies everywhere
acting as his eyes and ears.

92
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,831
There are so many ways a
person could get around.

93
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,333
It's not easy to track them.

94
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,838
-The current hideout?

95
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:51,177
-Right now Orochimaru's holed
up on a small Island on a lake

96
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,780
just to the north of here.

97
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,852
We'll be moving
again in three days.

98
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,956
Sasuke Uchiha is there as well.

99
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:07,372
NARUTO: The wind
is so loud I can't

100
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,376
hear a word they're saying.

101
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,077
SAKURA: Ugh.

102
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,379
You're such an idiot.

103
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,886
That's why we were able to
sneak this close in first place.

104
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:18,024
The wind blows away our
scent and hides our sound.

105
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,927
Why do you think he
hasn't noticed us?

106
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:23,600
-Oh.

107
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:37,124
By the way-- it was nothing.

108
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,259
Just a wild rabbit.

109
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,502
As I was saying,
we should discuss

110
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:44,108
the orders you gave
me, Lord Sasori.

111
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,176
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Uh-oh.

112
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,147
I still had a few
more things I wanted

113
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,851
to ask him while
I had the chance.

114
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:55,861
If the conversation goes on
much longer, I'd be discovered.

115
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,266
-Even after
re-animation, Orochimaru

116
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,303
uses a Protection
Jutsu on the specimens

117
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:03,342
from his discarded
vessel, so I was

118
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,282
unable to analyze their cellular
structure as you commanded me.

119
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:07,782
-I see.

120
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:13,793
NARUTO: What's he waiting for?

121
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:17,233
He should just grab the
guy while his guard's down.

122
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,636
-Have you forgotten
that's Kabuto?

123
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,208
Playing it safe is the
right way to handle it.

124
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,312
Besides, if he
manages to escape,

125
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:26,983
this was all for nothing.

126
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,321
SAI: But if he
takes too much time,

127
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,024
then the spy might
get suspicious.

128
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:34,496
And then our whole plan
would be put into jeopardy.

129
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,865
-Maybe.

130
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,138
But we have no choice but to
trust the captain's judgment.

131
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,994
KABUTO: Now, I trust you brought
the item you promised me.

132
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,162
Let's do the hand-off.

133
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,332
I've spent too much
time here as it is.

134
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,746
If I were to be discovered
speaking with you like this,

135
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,918
Orochimaru will
certainly kill me.

136
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:07,821
-I'm aware.

137
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,891
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): I
can't stall any longer.

138
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,527
I have to take him right now.

139
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,941
OROCHIMARU: Your conversation
sounds intriguing.

140
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:22,881
I hope neither of you would
mind if I joined in the fun.

141
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,016
-Huh?

142
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,285
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
He was just followed.

143
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,693
-Orochimaru!

144
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:30,962
SAI (VOICEOVER): So that's him.

145
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,188
-Lord Sasori, if you hadn't
pulled out the kunai,

146
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,092
I wouldn't have gotten
away from him in time.

147
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,032
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Lucky.

148
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,035
Looks like he misunderstood.

149
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:58,242
I guess my cover
hasn't been blown yet.

150
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:03,451
However, now that Orochimaru
has shown up-- now what do I do?

151
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,538
-I remember that garb.

152
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:18,311
It sure brings back
memories, Sasori.

153
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,717
-So you followed
Kabuto, did you?

154
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,719
-Oh.

155
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,490
I just wanted to
thank you in person.

156
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,896
After all, you're the one
who sent this kid to me,

157
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,900
and he's come in very handy.

158
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:37,578
The development of any new
jutsu usually eats up well

159
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:40,617
over a hundred
human test subjects,

160
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,290
but thanks to your spy's
Medical Ninjutsu skills,

161
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:50,066
I've been able to reuse my
test subjects again and again.

162
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:54,240
For some reason it's always
so hard to find volunteers.

163
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,910
-Sakura, what are we gonna do?

164
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,847
-Until we see him
give the signal,

165
00:16:57,913 --> 00:16:59,583
we'll just have to stand by.

166
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,325
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Taking
on Orochimaru by myself

167
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,462
would be virtually impossible.

168
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:10,436
And even if I work alongside
Kabuto to beat him back,

169
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:12,005
Kabuto would tell
by my fighting style

170
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,110
that I'm not really Sasori.

171
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,682
I could summon my
three teammates,

172
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,952
but my identity
would be revealed,

173
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:23,859
and Kabuto would flee
before we captured him.

174
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,165
Either I call in the others and
try to defeat both these guys,

175
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:31,472
or maintain my cover
and retreat right now.

176
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,307
OK.

177
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,041
Time to decide.

178
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,606
Did he know who I was?

179
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:51,207
No.

180
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:52,442
He couldn't have.

181
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:56,015
Then what's going on here?

182
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,952
-Multiple Striking Shadow Snake!

183
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:17,820
-That was a Wood
Style substitution.

184
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,322
Interesting.

185
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:22,796
You must be--

186
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:26,869
-Lord Orochimaru, is that
form Sasori's real body?

187
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:27,805
-Sasori?

188
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:29,707
Definitely not.

189
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,143
Oh, Kabuto.

190
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,714
You mean all this time
as his faithful servant,

191
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,319
and you've yet to see
the man's real face?

192
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:37,688
-Hm.

193
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:40,226
Well he always hides it behind
those weird puppets of his.

194
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,097
The man is such
as dreary fellow.

195
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,669
-What is the
meaning of all this?

196
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:48,574
Kabuto, you were supposed
to be an Akatsuki spy.

197
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,009
Shouldn't you have
been controlled

198
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:53,349
by Sasori's jutsu
this whole time?

199
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:54,785
-Not any longer.

200
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:57,356
Lord Orochimaru broke
that jutsu long ago.

201
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,197
-So you pretended to
be under Sasori's jutsu

202
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,502
all the while having
turned traitor?

203
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:08,275
Or did Orochimaru use
his powers to turn you?

204
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:08,942
-Oh no.

205
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,379
You've got it wrong.

206
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,682
The fact of the
matter is I empathize

207
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:16,789
with Lord Orochimaru's ideals.

208
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,793
Who are you anyway?

209
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,298
The plan was to come
take care of Sasori,

210
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,869
but your presence
changes things.

211
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,974
OROCHIMARU: Kabuto, I can fill
you in about this child later

212
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,078
on.

213
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:33,686
For now, why don't you signal to
the three baby rats behind you

214
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:34,922
to come on out.

215
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,765
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): So he
must have known all along.

216
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,473
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
There's the signal.

217
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,152
-Well, it's you again.

218
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,892
-Mm.

219
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,962
I know that face all too well.

220
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:01,902
And it looks like the
Nine-Tails tagged along.

221
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,540
Well, we might as well
have a little fun together.

222
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:12,487
OROCHIMARU: Let's find out
who's gotten stronger--

223
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:13,990
you or Sasuke?

224
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,988
[theme music]

225
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:01,645
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): My, my.

226
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,750
You're starting to act like a
jinchuriki, aren't you, Naruto?

227
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:05,885
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Is he--

228
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,689
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What
kind of chakra is that?

229
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,192
SAI (VOICEOVER):
The air, it stings.

230
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:12,096
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): It's got
to be the Nine-Tails' Cloak.

231
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,434
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): The
jinchuriki host's power.

232
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,670
This must be it.

233
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,872
I can tell just by feeling it.

234
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,409
This chakra, it's horrible.

235
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,479
It's not a chakra that
can be controlled.

236
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:24,751
SAI (VOICEOVER): So this is
Naruto's power, the Nine-Tails'

237
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,087
power.

238
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:28,358
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time--
The Nine-Tails Unleashed!

239
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,829
[theme music]

240
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,921
-Lord Orochimaru has been
re-animated three times

241
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:46,022
thus far.

242
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:48,393
Details about the
first time are sketchy.

243
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,497
When the Leaf Village
was destroyed,

244
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,168
it was already his second body.

245
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:55,506
He wanted the body
of Itachi Uchiha who

246
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,580
possesses the Sharingan,
but he could not get it.

247
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:02,518
Instead, he tried to entice
Itachi's younger brother,

248
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:05,356
Sasuke over to his
side with some help

249
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:08,194
from Kimimaro and
the Sound Four.

250
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:10,432
But in a battle with
the Third Hokage,

251
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:12,402
both of Orochimaru's
arms were sealed,

252
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:15,775
and his body reached
its limit too quickly.

253
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:19,481
The situation was dire, so I
had the remaining test subjects

254
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,086
battle each other, and
chose the last one standing

255
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,056
to serve as the next host.

256
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,155
That would be his
current form, Genyumaru.

257
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,457
It's been three
years since then,

258
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,261
and I'm proud to say that his
next vessel is nearly complete.

259
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,964
But I'm just thinking out loud.

260
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,932
Don't pay any attention.

261
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:38,792
