1
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,354
{\an1}It's so ironic...

2
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,222
Oh? What's that?

3
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:30,190
{\an1}Looking at the both of you
now, you'd think that the

4
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,691
two of you were
best friends.

5
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,759
{\an1}What happened to those
brothers who fought so

6
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,727
{\an1}fiercely and hated
each other?

7
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,363
{\an1}No matter how much you
use those eyes of yours...

8
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:42,097
{\an1}I'll use my hatred...

9
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,899
To turn fantasy
into reality!

10
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:54,803
{\an1}All-in-all, it isn't very
hard to guess something

11
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:57,305
{\an1}happened between you when
you took Itachi down...

12
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:00,407
{\an1}But what exactly is it that
you want to ask of a

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,041
once-dead man?

14
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,111
{\an1}I want the truth.

15
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,077
Hmm...

16
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:12,614
{\an1}Oh, really? Interesting.
Could it be?

17
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:15,148
{\an1}Hmph. With the way
that you're talking...

18
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:18,651
{\an1}Do you really not trust
Itachi, after all?

19
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:23,786
{\an1}Sasuke, don't you
think that maybe...

20
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:26,788
{\an1}You already know the
truth about Itachi?

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,058
{\an1}Well, it's no wonder that
you didn't return to the

22
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,960
{\an1}Hidden Leaf Village
after defeating Itachi!

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,895
{\an1}No wonder you joined the
Akatsuki, who sought the

24
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,229
{\an1}Leaf's destruction!

25
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:42,931
I understand...

26
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,166
{\an1}Now that I have all of the
pieces, it makes so much

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,067
{\an1}sense to me... That's
the reason why...

28
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,735
{\an1}...you intend to destroy the
village that caused your

29
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,270
{\an1}brother such pain.

30
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,540
{\an1}Just as I thought: you
aren't denying it.

31
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:02,074
{\an1}So you ran into your brother
and followed him all the way

32
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:05,210
{\an1}down here to find out the
truth once and for all.

33
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,711
{\an1}To ask, is that what
happened back then?

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,213
{\an1}Or, what about that
one other time, too?

35
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,280
{\an1}All the dirty details...

36
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,182
{\an1}But like I already told you...

37
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:17,250
{\an1}Your brother is a liar!

38
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,784
{\an1}Trust me, I know.

39
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:23,353
{\an1}So doesn't it seem
just a bit odd?

40
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,121
{\an1}Itachi was willing to kill
his own family, his whole

41
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,591
{\an1}Clan! To protect the
Hidden Leaf Village.

42
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,391
{\an1}Isn't that in direct
opposition to what you're

43
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:32,925
{\an1}trying to do now?

44
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,061
{\an1}However... I'm the one who
wants exactly the same thing

45
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:39,728
{\an1}that you yearn for,
right, Sasuke?

46
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,164
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru couldn't
complete his Operation to

47
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,132
{\an1}destroy the Leaf, and I've
inherited that task.

48
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,735
{\an1}I think you should ponder
that very carefully...

49
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:54,804
{\an1}Join me now and stab your
treacherous brother Itachi

50
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,738
{\an1}in the back in the process!

51
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:00,207
{\an1}What? You don't even
have to feel guilty!

52
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:03,543
{\an1}He's not even him!
He's already dead!

53
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,810
{\an1}He's just an imitation.

54
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,144
{\an1}It was a mission...

55
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,846
{\an1}To become known as a
criminal who murdered his

56
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,514
{\an1}own clan, to bear the
burden of disgrace,

57
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,282
{\an1}and become a rogue ninja.

58
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,250
All of that was
part of the mission.

59
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:20,252
{\an1}Itachi completely
fulfilled his duty...

60
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:23,587
Except for one
single mistake...

61
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:29,223
{\an1}He could not bring himself
to kill his younger brother.

62
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,118
{\an1}We've received intel that
Itachi Uchiha of the

63
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,485
{\an1}Akatsuki has died.

64
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,521
{\an1}You should mark his entry in
your Bingo Book, and remove

65
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,588
{\an1}him. Just cross him out.

66
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:29,090
{\an1}So that traitor has
finally died, has he?

67
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,795
{\an1}I'm surprised. Who was
able to kill someone that

68
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,929
{\an1}powerful, do you know?

69
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,464
{\an1}His little brother,
Sasuke, apparently.

70
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,366
{\an1}Poetic that someone who
killed his clan got taken

71
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,434
{\an1}down by his own kin.

72
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,535
{\an1}Yeah, well, it serves
him right after all the

73
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,469
{\an1}atrocious stuff he did!

74
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,770
{\an1}Not only did he join the
Akatsuki, but he also

75
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:54,805
{\an1}attacked the Leaf!

76
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,238
{\an1}He's the most notorious
criminal in the

77
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:58,506
{\an1}Village's history!

78
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,407
{\an1}But damn it all...

79
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,542
{\an1}I wish that we got our
hands on him first!

80
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,910
{\an1}Since Itachi's little
brother took down such a

81
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:08,011
{\an1}special S-Class Criminal...

82
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:10,079
{\an1}...I bet he'll get a ton of
decorations and a large

83
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:12,548
{\an1}bounty from the nation
and the village.

84
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,349
I wonder how
much he'll get.

85
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,916
{\an1}It's not a question of
money. You're out of line.

86
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,917
{\an1}Well, I know, but...

87
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:22,286
{\an1}They don't know the truth...

88
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,688
{\an1}Plus, there are too
many people here.

89
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,089
Then I'll teach
them the truth!

90
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:31,224
{\an1}Don't... Even if they try to
confirm the truth about

91
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,193
{\an1}Itachi with their
superiors, the Leaf's

92
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,527
{\an1}elders will deny it
vehemently.

93
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:40,129
{\an1}The current Hokage doesn't
even know the facts.

94
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:44,098
{\an1}Furthermore, Itachi did in
fact slaughter his own

95
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:47,866
{\an1}Uchiha Clan. And as an
Akatsuki member,

96
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,302
he pretended to
attack the Leaf.

97
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,169
{\an1}No one would believe
the truth...

98
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,672
{\an1}Look how long it took you.

99
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,207
{\an1}For bastards like them...

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,441
{\an1}He sacrificed everything for
those who would brand him a

101
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,643
traitor... for
these bastards!!

102
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:08,612
{\an1}It is exactly what Itachi
wanted. If you do not like

103
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,313
it, what is it
that you want?

104
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,948
{\an1}No, we're not the same.

105
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:22,018
{\an1}My Operation to Destroy the
Leaf is nothing like yours!

106
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:28,956
I can sympathize
with Itachi.

107
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:31,391
{\an1}I understand his choice.

108
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:34,892
{\an1}Because, honestly,
I'm just like him...

109
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:38,395
{\an1}It was fine and good being
taken in by Leaf Shinobi,

110
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,262
{\an1}but because my background
was a mystery,

111
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,464
{\an1}I was immediately
raised to be a spy.

112
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,965
{\an1}Medical Ninjutsu was
drilled into me,

113
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,233
just so enemies
would come to trust me.

114
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,236
{\an1}I went from village
to village spying...

115
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,704
{\an1}I pretended to be someone
else, living a life of

116
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:57,572
{\an1}lies... There was no
place and no space for

117
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,939
the real me.

118
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:02,776
{\an1}With no friends or comrades
who knew who I really was, I

119
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:05,543
{\an1}continued to work on
suppressing myself.

120
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,612
{\an1}And around the time I
stopped knowing who I

121
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,312
{\an1}even was anymore...

122
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,680
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf Village
stopped trusting me, and I

123
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:14,883
{\an1}was relieved of my mission.

124
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,484
{\an1}Both Itachi and I worked for
the good of the Hidden Leaf,

125
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:19,684
but in return...

126
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:22,919
{\an1}...all we got back was
dishonor and disgrace!

127
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,822
{\an1}So you tell me, what in the
world has the Leaf Village

128
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,155
{\an1}ever done for us?!

129
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,791
How Itachi lived
is what led to the

130
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,025
creation of the
current you.

131
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:37,027
{\an1}And though I am still alive,
something similar to you was

132
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,695
{\an1}born from me, as well.

133
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:41,864
{\an1}Face it, Sasuke. There is
no one who understands

134
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,297
{\an1}you better than I do.

135
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,399
{\an1}I'll be your big brother.

136
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,300
{\an1}And I'll stick by your side
through thick and thin.

137
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,468
Come... join me.

138
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:53,503
{\an1}Sasuke, don't listen to him.

139
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:56,906
{\an1}He was an even greater spy
than I was. So he's even

140
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,441
{\an1}more skillful at lying
than me. And...

141
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,141
{\an1}No matter what darkness
or contradictions

142
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,110
{\an1}lie within the Village...

143
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,645
I'm still Itachi
Uchiha of the Leaf!

144
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:14,115
{\an1}Sasuke, it's my fault that
you're like this right now.

145
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,383
{\an1}I know that I have
no right to advise

146
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,751
you in any way.

147
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,853
{\an1}But I sincerely hope that
you'll hear me out...

148
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,688
{\an1}...because I have to
tell you something.

149
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,190
{\an1}After we've settled
things here.

150
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,492
{\an1}So help me stop him.

151
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:39,729
{\an1}I cast the Reanimation
Jutsu. You cannot kill me.

152
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,198
{\an1}And I can instantly recover
from any wound you try to

153
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,933
{\an1}inflict. This is pointless.

154
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,701
I've also shut
off my vision.

155
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,968
{\an1}So the much-touted
genjutsu of your Visual

156
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,903
Prowess won't
work, either...

157
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,872
{\an1}You brothers have no chance!

158
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,406
{\an1}Because I cast it...

159
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,575
{\an1}...the Reanimation
Jutsu is invincible!

160
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:05,543
{\an1}It's really quite annoying
listening to him talk...

161
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:08,212
{\an1}But he's explained
the situation well.

162
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:10,413
{\an1}I know. You don't
need to tell me.

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,581
{\an1}All right, so what now?

164
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,649
{\an1}It seems he doesn't know the
true power of the Uchiha.

165
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,184
{\an1}We have a Visual Jutsu that
can be used on an opponent

166
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,085
{\an1}without eyesight...

167
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:25,621
{\an1}In exchange for losing
the light in one's eyes.

168
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,161
The Izanagi?

169
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,463
How do you know
about that?

170
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:44,098
{\an1}Danzo used it against me
back when I had to fight him.

171
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,032
{\an1}Well, then you're
lucky to be alive.

172
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,366
Hm?

173
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,702
{\an1}Never mind that. How do
we use Izanagi here?

174
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:54,203
{\an1}I don't mean Izanagi. But
another Forbidden Jutsu,

175
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,838
{\an1}considered it's other half.

176
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,506
Another one?!

177
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,073
{\an1}I've already laid the plan.

178
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,541
{\an1}An Ultimate Visual
Jutsu that holds his

179
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,008
{\an1}fate within its grasp.

180
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,010
The Izanami!

181
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,311
Izanami?!

182
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,516
If the Izanagi
changes one's fate...

183
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,116
The Izanami's a
jutsu that decides it!

184
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:21,552
Sasuke... do not
leave my side.

185
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:28,523
A jutsu that
decides one's fate?

186
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,724
There's another
jutsu like Izanagi?!

187
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,527
I confess that I
don't entirely know

188
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,294
{\an1}what you're up to...

189
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,228
{\an1}But whatever it is, nothing
will work against me.

190
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,397
{\an1}Seems you still don't
understand just what

191
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,298
exactly I have
become now!

192
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,734
{\an1}Sage Art! Inorganic
Animation!

193
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,503
Itachi!

194
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,806
{\an1}This jutsu brings inanimate
objects to life and allows

195
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,942
{\an1}me to control them in any
manner that I see fit.

196
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,442
It's different
from a jutsu that

197
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,810
{\an1}just manipulates chakra...

198
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,044
A bit extreme,
don't you think?

199
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:13,080
{\an1}Protecting Sasuke with your
Susano'o slowed you down.

200
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:15,582
Oh, well... But
don't you worry.

201
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,116
{\an1}I would never harm Sasuke.

202
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,785
{\an1}He is my precious test
subject, after all.

203
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:21,819
Now, then...

204
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,788
{\an1}Time to rewrite that brain
of yours with this...

205
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,122
{\an1}You know what will
happen, right?

206
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,390
[chuckle]

207
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,893
Amaterasu!

208
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,435
{\an1}Well, it appears that the
greatest offensive Visual

209
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:53,202
{\an1}Jutsu can also act as
the greatest defense.

210
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:55,872
{\an1}It's so hot the limestone
cave has gone back

211
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,706
{\an1}to being just a cave...

212
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,042
I'm sorry...

213
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:03,842
Sasuke...

214
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:06,878
{\an1}Unfortunately for
you, I'll win.

215
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,980
{\an1}I'm so near the point where
I'll be able to achieve and

216
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,981
{\an1}control everything
that I simply can't

217
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:14,882
{\an1}imagine myself failing at
this stage of the game.

218
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,952
{\an1}All the laws and principles
of Nature, which Lord

219
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:22,285
{\an1}Orochimaru compiled
and studied for so long...

220
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:25,588
{\an1}...are now stored and
being used inside of me.

221
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,123
{\an1}I have evolved from
human to snake to dragon.

222
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:33,025
{\an1}At this moment, I am the
closest thing in the entire

223
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,393
{\an1}world to the Sage
of Six Paths.

224
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,461
{\an1}Compared to me, the
Uchiha are nothing at-

225
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:41,129
{\an1}Just shut up! You
don't know the Uchiha!

226
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:42,464
You see-!

227
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:48,133
{\an1}Kabuto... When I look at
you, it's like looking at

228
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,702
my former self.

229
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,537
{\an1}And that's the reason
you will lose...

230
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,507
{\an1}Look, I'm not on the
sidelines anymore.

231
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,874
{\an1}I'm not just a player.

232
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,142
{\an1}I'm a central figure!
I own this war!

233
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:08,311
{\an1}I had the Akatsuki twisted
around my little finger,

234
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,412
{\an1}manipulated the war
to my advantage,

235
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,413
and cornered the
Uchiha brothers!

236
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:15,916
Make no mistake,
Kabuto: I hate you.

237
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:18,851
However, I also
understand you.

238
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:21,953
{\an1}We both lived as spies, as
liars, presenting a false

239
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,286
{\an1}front to the world.

240
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,222
{\an1}I didn't know who I was
at one point, either.

241
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,591
{\an1}But I finally understand now
that to know oneself is not

242
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,426
{\an1}to achieve everything and
not to become perfect.

243
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:38,462
{\an1}Instead, it is to become
aware of what one is and

244
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:39,896
{\an1}isn't capable of.

245
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,397
{\an1}That sounds like the
philosophy of a loser.

246
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,832
{\an1}You're saying one should
acknowledge and give up

247
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,266
{\an1}what one cannot do?

248
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,201
{\an1}I'm not. It is simply to
forgive oneself for the

249
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:52,803
{\an1}things one cannot do alone.

250
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:56,171
{\an1}<i>It's because you cannot do</i>
<i>everything yourself that you</i>

251
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,906
{\an1}<i>have comrades to help you.</i>

252
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:00,707
{\an1}<i>And also you should never</i>
<i>ignore things one could</i>

253
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:02,341
{\an1}<i>still accomplish.</i>

254
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:07,144
{\an1}If you want to know who
and what you are...

255
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:10,780
{\an1}You must reexamine and
acknowledge your true self.

256
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,315
{\an1}I failed at that...

257
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,550
{\an1}I lied to everyone around
me. I lied to myself.

258
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,151
I was deluded.

259
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,586
{\an1}Those who cannot or
will not acknowledge

260
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,821
themselves are
sure to fail.

261
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:27,489
{\an1}Just like I have failed.

262
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,158
{\an1}What do you two imagine you
know about me, anyway?

263
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:34,693
{\an1}I have been ardently
pursuing what I am in my own

264
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,861
{\an1}way for the longest time.

265
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,195
My whole life...

266
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,498
{\an1}I bet he's from that city...

267
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:47,034
{\an1}Where that recent
battle was just fought.

268
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,069
{\an1}What should we do with him,
Sis? I mean, he's bleeding

269
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,037
{\an1}from the head pretty badly.

270
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,604
{\an1}He's gonna die soon.
Should we take him?

271
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:59,340
{\an1}Urushi... His injuries are
less severe than yours were.

272
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,208
{\an1}Don't worry. Just relax. I
can help. I'm able to do a

273
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,144
{\an1}little Medical Ninjutsu.

274
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,112
{\an1}Where are your parents?

275
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,580
{\an1}What's your name?

276
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,650
{\an1}Seriously? You don't
know anything? Come on!

277
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,418
{\an1}Urushi, help him up.

278
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:21,719
[growling]

279
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,822
{\an1}You sure are lucky, kid!
Here, grab my shoulder!

280
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,324
{\an1}<i>That's my oldest memory...</i>

281
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,094
{\an1}<i>I was nobody and had</i>
<i>nothing right from the very</i>

282
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,561
{\an1}<i>beginning. Nothing at all.</i>

283
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:42,497
{\an1}<i>I didn't know my parents.</i>
<i>Or even my own name.</i>

284
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,565
{\an1}Your wound appears to
be healing quite nicely.

285
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,600
{\an1}Hey, you could at least say,
"thank you," you know!

286
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,501
{\an1}Don't you have any
manners at all?!

287
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,669
{\an1}Listen! We don't want
anything to happen to you

288
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,037
{\an1}again, so put this on!

289
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:58,139
{\an1}Man, you don't know manners,
or who your parents are!

290
00:16:58,173 --> 00:16:59,239
{\an1}Or even your own name!

291
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,942
{\an1}I gotta say, that's
a first for me!

292
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,242
{\an1}You're going to be
living right here with

293
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,911
us from now on.

294
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,978
{\an1}That means, starting
right now, you can just

295
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,746
{\an1}consider me your mother.

296
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,848
{\an1}You can always ask me for
whatever you might need.

297
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,550
{\an1}But you know it's totally
inconvenient that he

298
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,950
{\an1}doesn't have a name.

299
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,217
That's true...

300
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,320
What would be a
good one for him?

301
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,958
{\an1}Wait, how about...
Kabuto, as in helmet?

302
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,425
So simple...

303
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,359
That was fast.

304
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:35,760
{\an1}It's just what he's wearing!

305
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,328
{\an1}It's best not to overthink
things sometimes.

306
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,362
[chuckling]

307
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,867
{\an1}Hey! Check it out! He
just smiled! I guess that

308
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,768
{\an1}means he likes his name!

309
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,602
Oh, good!

310
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:15,082
{\an1}<i>Hey, you could at least say,</i>
<i>"thank you," you know!</i>

311
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:17,183
{\an1}<i>Don't you have any</i>
<i>manners at all?!</i>

312
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:26,222
Well... what are
we going to do?

313
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,757
{\an1}We can't get by on just the
assistance money from the

314
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,959
nation and the
village anymore.

315
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:34,459
{\an1}I guess the only option we
have left is to negotiate

316
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,961
{\an1}with the both of them!

317
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:38,229
{\an1}Neither is going to
give us any more funds.

318
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,429
You know that!

319
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:42,497
{\an1}But as it is now, we're
barely scraping by.

320
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,732
{\an1}And remember, we just
took another one in...

321
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:52,369
{\an1}Yes, I understand... I will
do something about it.

322
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:53,470
So, therefore-

323
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,104
Oww!

324
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,007
{\an1}What are you doing up
at this late hour?!

325
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,908
You should be in
bed, asleep, now!

326
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,910
[concerned gasp]

327
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,377
{\an1}Please! This child
just got here.

328
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,512
{\an1}He doesn't know our
schedule or rules yet.

329
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,914
{\an1}Please, go easy on him.

330
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,917
{\an1}Oh, Mother, you are
far too indulgent

331
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,551
{\an1}with these children!

332
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:22,953
{\an1}Okay! Come here and look
at this clock! It's already

333
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,487
{\an1}twenty minutes past
lights-out time!

334
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:28,489
Which means that
lights-out is at what time?

335
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,291
{\an1}Let's learn this right
now so it's not an issue!

336
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:35,660
{\an1}Well? What time is it?

337
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,661
{\an1}You have to learn
it for yourself!

338
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:46,666
[gasp]

339
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,301
{\an1}This child is simply too
young. It isn't his fault

340
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:53,937
{\an1}that he can't read a clock,
much less do arithmetic.

341
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,238
{\an1}Let's just call it a night.

342
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,404
Nine o'clock.

343
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,240
{\an1}Yes, that's correct!

344
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:04,509
{\an1}[laughter] It appears that
he only has bad vision!

345
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,944
{\an1}He's smart for his age!

346
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,978
{\an1}But he's going to
need some glasses.

347
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,046
Agh!

348
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,313
{\an1}And where are we going to
get the money for that?

349
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:14,215
{\an1}My goodness! Why couldn't he
have just spoken up and told

350
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,349
{\an1}us he couldn't see well?!

351
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,688
{\an1}You can be mindful of the
time from now on, right?

352
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,124
{\an1}I just hope that those
lenses are the correct

353
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,658
{\an1}strength for your eyes.

354
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:31,457
[chuckle]

355
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,770
Thank... you...

356
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,537
Thank you.

357
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,906
{\an1}<i>My name is symbolic.</i>

358
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,607
{\an1}<i>My eyeglasses, a tool...</i>

359
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,008
Thank you...

360
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,844
{\an1}<i>From the very beginning,</i>
<i>I was nobody...</i>

361
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:08,045
Thank you...

362
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:10,813
Thank you!

363
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:12,781
{\an1}That's enough, now.

364
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:16,183
{\an1}From the very beginning...

365
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,684
I had nothing.

366
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:21,053
{\an1}Nothing at all...

367
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,240
{\an1}<i>Mother didn't know me. </i>

368
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,975
<i>Why? Why didn't</i>
<i>she remember me?</i>

369
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,176
{\an1}<i>If she doesn't know</i>
<i>me, then who am I?</i>

370
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,544
{\an1}<i>What were all those things I</i>
<i>received from Mother?</i>

371
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:10,445
{\an1}<i>My name, that I was one of</i>
<i>Mother's children, even</i>

372
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:14,248
<i>these glasses.</i>
<i>Who... are you?</i>

373
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:19,684
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Kabuto Yakushi."</i>

374
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:23,887
{\an1}<i>It appears that you no</i>
<i>longer see yourself clearly...</i>
