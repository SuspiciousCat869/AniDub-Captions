1
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:05,641
{\an1}The longer you live,
the more you'll realize

2
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:08,812
{\an1}that the only things that
truly exist in this reality

3
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,948
are merely pain,
suffering, and futility.

4
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,184
Listen...

5
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,487
{\an1}Everywhere you look in this
world, wherever there is

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,589
light, there are
always shadows to be

7
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,091
found as well.

8
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:22,693
{\an1}These are nexuses,
causal relationships

9
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,329
{\an1}that cannot be separated.

10
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,431
{\an1}Normally, that is.

11
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,143
{\an1}He means tossing the
real world's bad stuff

12
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,978
{\an1}and escaping inside
of a dream that's

13
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:41,248
entirely full of
good things!

14
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:06,843
{\an1}Since it's a dream,
everything is just

15
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,211
{\an1}how you want it!

16
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,682
{\an1}Even those who are dead
can be alive again!

17
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:20,725
{\an1}A world of only victors...
A world of only peace...

18
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,995
{\an1}A world of only love.

19
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,732
{\an1}I will create such a world.

20
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,770
{\an1}Rin... Once again...

21
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:35,476
{\an1}Let's create a world
where you can exist again.

22
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,094
I shall...

23
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:58,434
{\an1}...sever the nexuses
of this world!

24
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,909
{\an1}That's the reason
why I've come back.

25
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:12,483
[chuckle]

26
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,321
{\an1}Well, I certainly hope
that no one observed you.

27
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:19,924
{\an1}I'm pretty sure I'm the
only one who saw him.

28
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,928
{\an1}Obito slaughtered all of the
enemy, so I think we should

29
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,530
{\an1}still be perfectly safe.

30
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,400
{\an1}He didn't seem to want
to kill his former

31
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,703
{\an1}teammate Kakashi,
though.

32
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:33,473
{\an1}But then again, Kakashi
didn't see anything anyway.

33
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,244
{\an1}When reinforcements from the
Hidden Leaf Village arrived,

34
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,513
{\an1}he was screaming, "Who
killed the enemy?!"

35
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,849
{\an1}You still felt loyalty
to your one-time

36
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,985
{\an1}teammate, did you?

37
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,422
{\an1}Not at all. I didn't
care either way.

38
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,626
{\an1}It doesn't really matter to
me anymore whether he's

39
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,695
{\an1}alive or dead, in
this world, at least.

40
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,899
{\an1}Kakashi will exist in
the world we'll create.

41
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,102
Rin, too...

42
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,904
{\an1}I want you teach me
how to create this world

43
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,707
{\an1}of dreams, Madara.

44
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:08,513
{\an1}[chuckle] I don't
need your thanks now.

45
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,315
{\an1}Just come over here.

46
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:14,419
{\an1}Starting today, you
will be the savior.

47
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,522
{\an1}Look into my eye.

48
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:22,128
{\an1}You are inside my
genjutsu right now.

49
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,599
{\an1}It is still a blank canvas,
but I can project my will

50
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,967
{\an1}upon it to create
whatever I want.

51
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,471
I can control
everything in here.

52
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,808
{\an1}Anything that I wish is
possible, since I'm linked

53
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,912
{\an1}to and borrowing the
power of the Gedo Statue.

54
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,815
Just like this.

55
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:46,088
{\an1}We'll use this genjutsu
to create the ideal world.

56
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,891
{\an1}And then we'll cast the
genjutsu on everyone else

57
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,794
{\an1}and bring them here.

58
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:57,000
{\an1}The scale of this jutsu, an
entire world of dreams is

59
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,271
{\an1}achieved by using the
moon instead of our eyes.

60
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:05,577
{\an1}You make it sound so simple,
I still don't quite get it.

61
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,912
Let me explain,
starting with the

62
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:11,383
Sage of the Six
Paths and the Ten Tails.

63
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,753
{\an1}Wait, isn't the Ten
Tails just a legend?

64
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:18,491
{\an1}Legends are always derived
from something real.

65
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,596
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts that roam
the world resulted when the

66
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,833
{\an1}Sage of Six Paths split
up the power of Ten Tails.

67
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:28,335
{\an1}What, seriously?

68
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,504
{\an1}Do you have any proof
that story's true?!

69
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,005
I do.

70
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,811
{\an1}After I'd obtained Hashirama
Senju's cells, I implanted

71
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,347
{\an1}them into the wound
that I had received.

72
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,751
{\an1}At first, nothing
at all happened...

73
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,521
{\an1}It was only when I was
beginning to die of old age

74
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:47,323
{\an1}that my Rinnegan awakened.

75
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,062
{\an1}And it also simultaneously
led to the undoing of a

76
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,430
certain seal.

77
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,835
{\an1}I could then summon and
extract the husk of the Ten

78
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,104
{\an1}Tails from a Seal Stone.

79
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,774
{\an1}The husk of the Ten Tails?

80
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:06,879
{\an1}Yes, I call it the Gedo
Statue and the Seal Stone

81
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,348
is what you now
know as the moon.

82
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:14,286
{\an1}I immediately used the
statue as a catalyst and

83
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,523
{\an1}medium to culture
Hashirama's cells into

84
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:18,625
what you see
before you now.

85
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,496
{\an1}Really, one could say that
these artificial beings are

86
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,532
{\an1}clones of Hashirama.

87
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:27,435
{\an1}Although they're quite
reduced in quality.

88
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,205
{\an1}The Rinnegan cannot be
awakened without possessing

89
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:34,075
both Uchiha and
Senju powers, and

90
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,711
{\an1}the statue cannot
be controlled easily.

91
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:41,183
You have Senju
cells attached to the

92
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:42,552
{\an1}right half of you.

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,955
{\an1}Even if you never awaken
the Rinnegan, you ought to

94
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:49,192
{\an1}eventually be able to
control the statue.

95
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:58,937
{\an1}Hey, can you see them?
That redhead's eyes?

96
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,074
{\an1}So they're Madara's
Rinnegan, huh?

97
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,110
They're Madara's
actual eyes.

98
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:09,048
{\an1}He secretly transplanted
them without anyone knowing

99
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,718
{\an1}back when that boy
was very small.

100
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,456
{\an1}Nagato is of Senju
bloodline and the only

101
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,292
{\an1}other person in addition
to Madara who can

102
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,762
{\an1}summon the Gedo Statue.

103
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:26,835
{\an1}As Madara said, first we win
over and groom Nagato,

104
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:30,973
{\an1}then everything else
will fall into place.

105
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:34,176
{\an1}Huh?! Hey, what are
you going to do?

106
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,378
{\an1}I'm going straight for him.

107
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:39,849
{\an1}But wait, shouldn't you
plan a strategy first?

108
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:41,451
{\an1}I don't need to do that.

109
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:47,625
{\an1}Obito, I shall teach you the
Uchiha Forbidden Jutsu...

110
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,994
{\an1}The Six Paths Jutsu,
and the Shadow

111
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,829
{\an1}and Light Style Jutsu.

112
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:00,605
{\an1}I've implanted my
will into this one.

113
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,241
Think of him as
being half of me.

114
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:06,279
{\an1}Though he will be
degraded, as well.

115
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,447
Use these beings
made with Shadow and

116
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,884
{\an1}Light Style Jutsu
as your soldiers.

117
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,225
{\an1}That Black Rod was
created as a physical

118
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,662
{\an1}manifestation of my will.

119
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:23,464
{\an1}Use it when performing
the Six Paths Jutsu.

120
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,841
[grunting]

121
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:42,319
[grunting]

122
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:54,533
{\an1}Now go on. Until the time
when I will be revived.

123
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,337
You shall be...

124
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:02,107
Who're you?

125
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:05,945
{\an1}I am Madara Uchiha.

126
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,815
Madara?

127
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,723
{\an1}To claim Madara Uchiha's
name as your own means

128
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,424
{\an1}you're either a criminal...

129
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,060
{\an1}Or a total idiot.

130
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,796
{\an1}Now, why have you
approached us?

131
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,666
The Rinnegan...

132
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,002
[gasp]

133
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,872
{\an1}To guide those who
awaken it is the mission

134
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,641
our organization
has been entrusted

135
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,709
{\an1}with since long ago.

136
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:36,847
{\an1}You mean that you
know about my eyes?

137
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:41,485
{\an1}You are the reincarnation of
the Sage of the Six Paths,

138
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:44,522
{\an1}who dreamed of world
peace and stability.

139
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:48,326
{\an1}Only the villages of large
nations are showered in

140
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,796
{\an1}light, leaving your
small country's village

141
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,197
{\an1}in their shadow, dying.

142
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,635
{\an1}That is why your eye
has awakened here.

143
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:01,875
{\an1}Wherever light strikes,
there are always shadows.

144
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,177
{\an1}So long as there is a
concept of victors,

145
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,413
the vanquished
will also exist.

146
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,084
{\an1}The selfish intent of
wanting to preserve peace

147
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:14,321
{\an1}initiates wars. And hatred
is born to protect love.

148
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,192
{\an1}These are all nexuses,
causal relationships that

149
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:20,028
{\an1}cannot be separated.

150
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,930
{\an1}Normally, that is.

151
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:25,802
{\an1}However, a world made
up of only victors,

152
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:31,240
{\an1}peace, and love. Such a
world can be created, too!

153
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,144
{\an1}If you allow all of
us to collaborate,

154
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,979
{\an1}you can learn how.

155
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,018
{\an1}As soon as you attain the
true power of the Rinnegan,

156
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,655
{\an1}your very own world can
be actualized immediately.

157
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:45,890
Now...

158
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:48,928
{\an1}No, we can't do that.

159
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:52,330
{\an1}I think you're just
trying to use us.

160
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,334
{\an1}This offer of yours
sounds way too convenient.

161
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,575
{\an1}One finds the true world
only after knowing another's

162
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:04,912
{\an1}pain and shedding
tears alongside them.

163
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,084
{\an1}Shedding tears alongside
them? You mean in revenge?

164
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,155
No, I don't mean
that at all.

165
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,423
{\an1}In mutual understanding.

166
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,327
Stop talking so
idealistically.

167
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,530
{\an1}No such thing exists
in this world.

168
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:27,036
{\an1}Let's go, Konan, Nagato.
We can't trust these guys!

169
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:31,474
Don't you dare
approach us again.

170
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,785
{\an1}I shall wait here at the
same time each day.

171
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:43,355
{\an1}You will eventually
realize it, too.

172
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:11,253
Who are you?!

173
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,291
{\an1}We are the guardians
of this village.

174
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,361
{\an1}This is a warning.
Leave here now!

175
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,464
{\an1}[growl] To hell with
them! Kill 'em all!

176
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:29,240
{\an1}Water Style: Raging Waves!

177
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,082
{\an1}Wind Style: Gale Palm!

178
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,157
{\an1}Damn! We can't get near 'em!

179
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,292
[attacking yell]

180
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,930
One move, and
I'll skewer you!

181
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,871
{\an1}We won't let you take a
single step into this village!

182
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,639
Just give up!

183
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,107
[grunting]

184
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,378
<i>[gasp] The rain!</i>

185
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:05,647
Now's my chance!

186
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:06,915
[attacking yell]

187
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,456
Sorry! You okay?

188
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:16,959
[screams]

189
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,797
{\an1}Damn! There's no end
to this! I didn't want

190
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,065
{\an1}to use this, but...

191
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,017
{\an1}Why you! Do you three
belong to Hanzo's gang?!

192
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,253
{\an1}We wear his headband, but
we are not his subordinates.

193
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:45,025
{\an1}But just like Hanzo, we hope
that one day we'll be able

194
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,559
{\an1}to bring peace to
the shinobi world.

195
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:51,731
{\an1}Oh, so in other words,
you're only copycats of him.

196
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,167
{\an1}We're not copycats!

197
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,070
{\an1}But we will keep the
peace in this village!

198
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,306
{\an1}Not through violence,
but through dialogue!

199
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,875
{\an1}Through dialogue?!
You're mad!

200
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,444
{\an1}This village is between
two great nations!

201
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:05,647
{\an1}As long as they're at war
with each other, the

202
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,149
{\an1}fighting will never end!

203
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,053
{\an1}The strong just take
everything they want from

204
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,221
the weak! That's
how the world is!

205
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,326
{\an1}We're fighting in
order to change that

206
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,826
{\an1}very way of thinking!

207
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,864
{\an1}Every one of you must
secretly wish to find peace!

208
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,936
{\an1}Listen, a piece of
straw is weak...

209
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,306
{\an1}But when you put three
of them together...

210
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:29,841
It's much--

211
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:31,977
Damn it!

212
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,945
{\an1}I'm just trying to say, that
the more you have, the

213
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,647
{\an1}stronger they become!

214
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,116
Yahiko...

215
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,718
You're so bad
at speeches.

216
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,855
{\an1}Whatever! Look, we're
not going to kill you.

217
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,524
{\an1}Negotiate or leave!

218
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,962
{\an1}I can't guarantee you that
we won't attack again!

219
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:52,900
{\an1}That's just fine. We can
do this dozens of times

220
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:53,968
{\an1}until you give up.

221
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:55,803
A hundred times!

222
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,241
{\an1}However! Just remember,
it'll be more painful for

223
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,575
{\an1}you the next time!

224
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:02,411
Let's go.

225
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:06,215
Earlier...

226
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:07,950
{\an1}When you attacked...

227
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,986
{\an1}You spared those kids.

228
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,622
{\an1}Thanks. We're war
orphans, too.

229
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,298
{\an1}Such strange kids...

230
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,270
{\an1}You appear out of
nowhere and ask to

231
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:26,938
{\an1}protect this village.

232
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,574
We want to
change this land.

233
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,845
{\an1}War will never leave this
land. That won't change.

234
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,082
{\an1}Nothing will change.

235
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:37,950
Yahiko...

236
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,622
{\an1}Seems like little by little
things are changing.

237
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,597
{\an1}All three of us are shinobi
who left our village because

238
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:52,000
{\an1}we don't have too
much faith in

239
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,635
{\an1}Hanzo's ways anymore.

240
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,439
{\an1}But to tell you the truth,
we've all been getting

241
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,773
{\an1}pretty sick of this
lifestyle, as well.

242
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,744
{\an1}And when I looked into
your eyes earlier...

243
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,414
{\an1}I began to feel like
starting over again.

244
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:08,784
{\an1}But I don't feel like going
back to Hanzo is the answer.

245
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,888
{\an1}So please, take us in
as your subordinates!

246
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:13,190
No way!

247
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,025
{\an1}What?! But before you--!

248
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,029
{\an1}Not subordinates,
but as comrades.

249
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,403
{\an1}I'm Yahiko. And this is
Nagato and Konan.

250
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,539
My name is
Kyusuke the Swift.

251
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,710
{\an1}If you need intel gathered,
just leave it to these legs.

252
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:35,148
{\an1}Then go and seek out
other villages that are

253
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,749
{\an1}suffering like this one.

254
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:44,325
Yahiko...

255
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,626
What?

256
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:47,661
You should name
our group.

257
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,601
{\an1}There are more of us.
It'll be necessary soon.

258
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:56,539
A name, huh?

259
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,046
{\an1}How about The Akatsuki?

260
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:08,018
{\an1}This nation weeps because
of the suffering of war.

261
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,687
{\an1}So we will change
this nation--

262
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,823
{\an1}No, the whole world.

263
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,360
{\an1}And we shall usher
in a new dawn!

264
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:16,995
Akatsuki...

265
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:18,997
{\an1}That's a great name.

266
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,434
Akatsuki. Great,
then it's decided!

267
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,435
Yeah!

268
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,221
{\an1}I can't believe how much the
Akatsuki's suddenly grown.

269
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,455
Incredible.

270
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,825
{\an1}They've all come to believe
in your dream. Although

271
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,795
{\an1}perhaps more than anything,
they're tired of war.

272
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,569
{\an1}If everyone unites, we
can achieve peace.

273
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,071
Say, where's
Konan right now?

274
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,541
She went out a
little while ago.

275
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,742
Why's that?

276
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:00,944
{\an1}["I dunno" grunt]

277
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,182
This is...

278
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,051
It's Konan's.

279
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:11,656
{\an1}It says, "My dear Konan..."

280
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,093
{\an1}"From the first moment
I laid eyes on you..."

281
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:16,394
Is this--?!

282
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,330
{\an1}It's a love letter.

283
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:22,168
{\an1}"I've wanted to ask you how
you feel about me. I'll be

284
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,604
{\an1}waiting anxiously on the
back terrace for you."

285
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,540
"Kyusuke."

286
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:30,244
Don't tell me...
Konan's gone there?!

287
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,078
I dunno...

288
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,253
[chuckle]

289
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,822
{\an1}Yahiko, didn't you
have something to do?

290
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,725
Huh?! Oh, yeah,
that's right!

291
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:45,793
{\an1}Almost forgot! I need to go
to the bathroom! [laughter]

292
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,096
{\an1}I'm gonna wet myself!

293
00:19:55,871 --> 00:19:56,805
That guy!

294
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,076
{\an1}Guess running isn't
all he's fast at!

295
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,447
{\an1}Well when we get more
comrades, it seems we get

296
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,549
more competition
in love, too!

297
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,385
{\an1}Yeah, no kidding...

298
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:09,787
Oh, Nagato!

299
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,922
Do you like
Konan, Yahiko?

300
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,662
Dummy! It's
nothing like that!

301
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:19,432
{\an1}Well, you know, I
think Konan likes you.

302
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:20,799
Huh?!

303
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:24,837
{\an1}Oh, he's leaving.

304
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:27,741
{\an1}I know you're there...

305
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,277
Yahiko, Nagato.

306
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:33,947
Konan, what did
you tell that guy?

307
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,851
{\an1}I said I don't have time
for a relationship till

308
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:39,854
{\an1}we make the Akatsuki's
dream come true.

309
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:41,624
{\an1}Isn't that right?

310
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,025
Konan...

311
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:45,695
Yahiko!

312
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,698
{\an1}Can you help me out
with some training?

313
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,168
This jutsu...

314
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,869
{\an1}...doesn't work in the rain!

315
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,384
{\an1}Oiled paper, huh?

316
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:08,487
Great idea.

317
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,422
I experimented.

318
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,492
If you hesitate,
I'll leave you behind!

319
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:15,562
{\an1}Like I'd let you!

320
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:59,211
{\an1}<i>Hanzo is setting an example</i>
<i>for the rest of us shinobi</i>

321
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,047
{\an1}<i>by fighting to try to bring</i>
<i>peace to this world.</i>

322
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,116
{\an1}<i>We will prove that one day</i>
<i>the Akatsuki will surpass</i>

323
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,419
{\an1}<i>him in that quest!</i>

324
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,554
{\an1}<i>I approve of a group that</i>
<i>resolves issues through</i>

325
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,924
{\an1}<i>nonviolent means. It</i>
<i>will help me realize</i>

326
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,827
{\an1}<i>my dream of uniting the</i>
<i>Five Nations without force.</i>

327
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:18,398
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Creeping Shadow."</i>

328
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,736
