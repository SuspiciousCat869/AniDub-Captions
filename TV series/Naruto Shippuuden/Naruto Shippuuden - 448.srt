{\an1}no matter how powerful
you might be.

{\an1}Listen, long ago when Nine
Tails attacked the village.

83
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:47,289
{\an1}Minato sealed half of the
Nine Tails inside me,

84
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:50,527
{\an1}and the other half
inside you, even though
you'd just been born.

85
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,298
{\an1}He believed that in time,
this power would come to
be helpful to you.

86
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,801
{\an1}Yeah, but everyone
hated me so much.

87
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,707
{\an1}and it was all because of this
stupid monster fox inside of me!

88
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:08,451
{\an7}Sorry... Both Minato and I had
faith that in time, you'd
eventually be able to control

89
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:11,020
{\an7}this power... despite its
tremendous strength.

90
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:15,159

properly?!

<i>Like I said, don't get mad.</i>

to what people tell you.

93
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,039
{\an1}And also think about what the
"right way" to use this power
should be.

94
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,577

{\an1}Have a strong will?

96

use my strong will with the Nine
Tails Chakra right now...

98
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,628
{\an1}I'm going to pass on my Nine
Tails Chakra to you, and then,

99
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:46,968
{\an4}when the two chakras, both Yin
and Yang, become one, I'm sure
that we'll be able to get out of
here.

a Jinchuriki too!

102
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:56,547
{\an1}So you know what that means!  If
the Nine Tails leaves your body,
then you're gonna die!

103
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,654
{\an1}I won't!  Because I'm gonna make
my power and my will, live!

that village when you Leaf
Shinobi killed him.

140
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,376
He's...?

141
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:47,854
{\an1}...I see. But still, we weren't
the ones who blew up that
village!

142
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:52,493
{\an1}Back then, the Hidden Leaf
feared that a scandal involving
them would be uncovered,

143
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,798
so they destroyed that
village in order to
hide the truth.

144
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:59,202
You see, that's how the
Great Nations save face.

145
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:03,208
Guess it's the obvious
way to avoid being
ridiculed by other villages.

146
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:08,414
{\an4}You're wrong!  Until now, we
thought that it was you guys who
were behind what happened to
that village.

147
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:12,754
{\an1}Right now, it doesn't matter
even a little bit who may
have thought what.

148
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:18,528
{\an1}It still doesn't alter the fact
that my comrade Yahiko was
killed in that incident.

149
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:21,197
Your comrade?

150
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:27,640
{\an1}Believe me... I know just how
hard it is to lose a comrade...

151
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,943
{\an3}Hm?

152
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:35,751
{\an1}Right now my friend is in danger
of being turned into
Orochimaru's vessel.

153
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:40,091
{\an1}We've been rivals since we were
kids, and we trained together.

154
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:44,630
{\an1}<i>He's a very important</i>
<i>comrade to me.</i>

155
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:49,636
{\an1}Yahiko was a very important
comrade to both of us, too.

156
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,307
{\an1}Sasuke... is going
through a rough time,

157
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,179
{\an1}and he set out for
Orochimaru's on his own.

158
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:01,719
{\an1}I just have this feeling that
he'd understand if we could only
have it out in one more fight.

159
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:04,956
{\an1}As his friend, I want him to
have another chance...

160
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,694
{\an1}What do you mean? What are
you talking about?!

161
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:14,169
{\an1}Yeah, that's right... We're
friends, so we should be able
to reach an understanding.

162
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,842
{\an1}That's why I'll never
give up on my friends!

163
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:25,383
{\an1}I'll never give up!  We keep
being tossed around by the Great
Nations...

164
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:29,055
{\an1}But we'll rescue people like us
who are suffering, and we'll
make them our friends...

165
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:32,593
{\an1}Of course! Yes, that's it!

166
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,229
{\an1}Huh?

167
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:37,032
{\an1}We just have to become
friends with everyone!

168
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:41,538
{\an4}And then we'll be able to come
to an understanding with them
instead of always having to
fight!

169
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,340
{\an1}We won't have to have wars!

170
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:48,547
{\an1}That's the reason why we just
have to keep on making Team
Jiraiya grow bigger and bigger!

171
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,817
[gasp]

172
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,055
Nagato...

173
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:59,662
{\an1}Because if I were to give up
then there's no way that I'll
ever become the Hokage!

174
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:05,036
{\an1}But I <i>will</i> become the Hokage and
become friends with shinobi from
all over!

175
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:08,574
{\an1}No, not just with shinobi, but
with the kids too! Anyway...

176
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:13,915
{\an1}If we're all friends, then
fights like this one
don't have to happen!

177
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:17,452
Is this... some kind
of coincidence?

178
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,290
{\an1}We just have to become
friends with everyone!

179
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:24,930
{\an4}And then we'll be able to come
to an understanding with them
instead of always having to
fight!

180
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,333
{\an1}And that means you guys won't
have to fight anymore either!

181
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,836
[small gasp]

182
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:35,342
{\an1}Anyway, look, I'm not asking you
to be my friend... At least not
yet.

183
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,645
{\an1}Just let me join Team Jiraiya.

184
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,619
{\an1}After all, I was Pervy Sage's
student, too, remember?

185
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,387
[gasp]

186
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,627
{\an1}I'm not asking you to join us...
You can stay with the Leaf.

187
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,132
{\an1}I want our goals to be
united along with yours.

188
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,402
{\an1}Just what are...?! What are you?

189
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,174
Nagato...

190
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,477
{\an1}I'm just asking you to let me
join Team Pervy Sage.

191
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,249
{\an1}But before that I have
to save Sasuke...

192
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:07,518
{\an1}... and also save my
comrades in the Leaf.

193
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,823
{\an1}I promise to take on Pervy
Sage's will.

194
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:14,262
It's Team Jiraiya!

195
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,395
[laugh]

196
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:20,837
{\an1}It's very mysterious. The two of
you... really are alike.

197
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,506
{\an1}You're right. They are.

198
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:31,217
{\an1}[grunting] Release!

199
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,053
What are you
doing, Nagato?

200
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:36,557
I  released the jutsu.

201
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,650
You know, you really
are quite a mystery.

202
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:04,094
{\an1}The things you say, It almost
feels like someone set it all
up.

203
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:17,279
{\an1}In fact, perhaps the truth...
might be that Sensei--!

204
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:26,223
{\an1}Well, in any event, whether or
not you're suitable to become
a member of Team Jiraiya...

205
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:31,397
{\an1}<i>...depends on if you can save</i>
<i>that friend of yours...</i>

206
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,737
{\an1}<i>Yahiko was a man who held his</i>
<i>friends in very high regard.</i>

207
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:46,450
{\an1}If you're as much like him
as you seem... then we can
definitely be friends.

208
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:52,191
{\an1}Yeah... I'm gonna prove it
to you. I <i>will</i> save him!

209
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,234
{\an7}Your command of the Leaf
Police Force was nothing
short of exemplary.

210
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,971
{\an7}Thanks to you, there
were no casualties.

211
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:04,107
{\an7}I'm very grateful.

212
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:11,350
{\an1}Oh, no... It was an emergency,
and I just did what was expected
of a Leaf Shinobi, nothing more.

213
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,055
That aside, your son has
developed into a fine young man.

214
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:18,893
{\an1}Whereas, I have failed as a
parent, I'm sorry to say...

215
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:21,229
{\an1}We're still continuing to
search for the two of them.

216
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:25,601
{\an1}But regretfully, we haven't
gotten any encouraging leads
yet.

217
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:32,411
{\an1}All this for my sons... For your
support and that of the Village,
I'm truly humbled.

218
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:38,286
{\an7}The consequences I'm suffering
are my own fault, because I only
paid attention to Itachi.

219
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,589
{\an8}I'm sure Sasuke felt
suffering of his own,

220
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,427
{\an7}constantly being compared
to his older brother.

221
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:48,766
{\an1}Kugaku...

222
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,903
{\an1}I keep picturing them
together, getting along.

223
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:56,877
{\an1}I wish that I could
see them even just
once more before I die.

224
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,949
{\an1}Yes...

225
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:12,564
{\an1}This Chakra Nature!
This is a Change in Chakra
Form I've never seen...

226
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:16,069

{\an1}I know you... you're
from back then.

232
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:05,267
Itachi's your older
brother, right?

233
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:08,338
We are the Akatsuki.

234
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:12,611
{\an1}We've had our eyes on you
since you went to Orochimaru.

235
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,980
That's why we saved you.

236
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,319
So, a word of gratitude
would be nice.

237
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:23,225
{\an1}Did you kill your brother?

238
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,695
{\an1}Why, you--!

239
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:30,501
{\an1}You kept shouting deliriously.
It was easy to figure out.

240
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,103
{\an1}Get lost.

241
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:35,241
Why did your brother
have to die?

The ones who should
have died, didn't.
