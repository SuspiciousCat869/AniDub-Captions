No, I'm not joking at

do you mean?

16

{\an4}You know, it wasn't so
long ago that you were
always getting involved
in all sorts of nonsense!

it out, come on!

{\an4}Well, we may be going up
in size, but I don't see how
these silly missions are
supposed to improve our skills.

00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:11,312
{\an4}The purpose of these
missions isn't to improve
your skills. You're not
doing this for training.

you may be getting
impatient.

Why don't you improve
your skills by taking
care of this ostrich!

{\an4}Hey, what do you think
you're doing, Naruto?!
That bird is all your
responsibility!

{\an1}<i>It's just a fight...?</i>

63

{\an1}<i>No, it seems to be a</i>
<i>vendetta. </i>

64
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,197
{\an1}<i>A vendetta? </i>

65
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,035
Like when someone fights
to get revenge or to
right a wrong?

66
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,772
{\an1}Revenge, huh...?

67
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,779
{\an5}On a busy street in the
middle of the day? They
allow that, Kakashi
Sensei?

68
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:28,048
{\an1}Hmm...

69
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:30,719
{\an1}<i>A vendetta permit, huh? </i>

70
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,825
{\an4}It varies from village to
village, but sometimes if
someone is murdered,
family members are

71
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,894
{\an1}allowed to seek revenge.

72
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:42,033
{\an5}If he has an authorized
permit from the land
where the crime took
place, other nations will

73
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,836
allow the vendetta.

74
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,576
{\an4}I heard that Tsukado, the
guy with the vendetta,
had a distant relative
who was killed.

75
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,446
{\an1}Yeah, late one night his
opponent went to visit
the victim.

76
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,855
{\an4}<i>Then he ruthlessly hit</i>
<i>Tsukado's relative with a</i>
<i>rock and killed him. It's</i>
<i>an awful story, isn't it?</i>

77
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:02,662
{\an4}<i>Anyway, the killer</i>
<i>escaped, and the family</i>
<i>wanted revenge. They</i>
<i>chose Tsukado to handle it.</i>

78
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,267
{\an1}Then that coward deserves
what he gets!

vendetta, boss.

147
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:11,114
{\an4}Look, you really need to
be more careful! Come
on, hurry up and get on
my back!

148
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:16,888
{\an4}Now, Tell me where you
want to go dammit. The
next town, huh? All right,
I'm glad to help out.

149
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,293
{\an1}Um, that
isn't--

150
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,428
{\an1}Oh, boy...

151
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,532
{\an1}Lesson Two!

152
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:29,005
{\an4}Take all vendettas
seriously, even easy
ones. Get used to
revenge!

153
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,540
{\an3}Uhh...

154
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:31,541
[humming]

155
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,311
{\an1}Uh, excuse me, sir...

156
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:35,747
I shall assist you!

157
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:36,782
{\an1}Wha-?!

158
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,052
[yelling]

159
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:42,056
Ha, take that! Think you
can lightly bump someone
in the shoulder--

160
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:44,091
{\an1}That's not what I meant
either...

161
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:47,697
{\an1}All right, Lesson Three!

162
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,837
{\an4}Completely fill your mind
with pictures of your
enemy, and then put
your anger down on paper.

163
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,439
{\an1}Uh-huh.

164
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:58,544
[chuckling]

165
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,180
What?!

166
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:04,920
{\an4}What's wrong with you?!
You can't make your most
hated enemy look so nice
and cute!

167
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:11,862
{\an5}You know, I gotta say,
mister, I don't really
think you're cut out
for vendettas at all.

168
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:14,799
{\an1}Yeah, and you're not
really cut out to be a
coach.

169
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,972
Do you have to do it?
Carry out the vendetta?

170
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,744
{\an1}I do. I can't go back to
my village until it's
finished.

171
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:26,448
{\an1}I just want all this to
end. So I can go home...

172
00:10:26,482 --> 00:10:29,719
My elderly mother and
father need me.

173
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:34,926
An ostrich is running
wild!

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,561
Ostrich?!

175
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,162
{\an1}[gasping]

[gasping]

178
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,945
{\an1}Whoa... Mister...

179
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:52,282
{\an1}That swordsman... He was
hiding his skills?

180
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,251
{\an1}All right, boys!

181
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,853
Yes, sir!

182
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,157
{\an1}Time for some fun.

183
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,762
{\an1}Sorry. The ostrich bit
through his leash.

184
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:07,170
Just as I suspected,...
you are actually a master
swordsman.

185
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,038
He's what?!

186
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:09,873
{\an3}Uh!

187
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:14,080
{\an5}Hey, what's going on
here? If you're really
that good with your
sword, how come you can't

188
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,815
finish your vendetta?

189
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:18,685
{\an1}I don't know...

190
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:23,558
{\an4}But whenever I look into
his eyes... All of my
strength drains out of
me.

191
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,030
{\an1}It's those eyes.

192
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,967
{\an1}<i>Those piercing eyes... </i>

193
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,536
Mister...

194

[yawning]

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,052
{\an1}I wonder where that
vendetta guy ran off
to...

196
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,790
{\an1}He probably set out early
in pursuit of his enemy.

197
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:50,628
{\an1}Will he do that for the
rest of his life...?!

198
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:54,867
{\an1}What's going on?

199
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,009
{\an1}Well? What do you think,
Mr. Vendetta? Your
tenacity has won me over.

200
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:05,615
{\an4}I want to make sure you
get your revenge, so I
brought your enemy right
to you.

201
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:09,686
I'm guessin' you wanna
give him the payback he
deserves, right?

202
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,391
Focus, Mister.

203
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:19,133
{\an4}Wait! We, the Kanabun
Gang, will oversee this
vendetta and ensure its
fairness.

204
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,136
{\an1}All right, everyone, here
we go!

205
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,172
{\an1}<i>Who do you think's gonna</i>
<i>win?! </i>

206
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,041
{\an1}We're taking all bets!

207
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,676
{\an1}<i>Which one's stronger? </i>

208
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,646
{\an1}<i>I say the one out for</i>
<i>revenge! </i>

209
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,049
{\an7}<i>That guy's hopeless! No</i>
<i>way he'll win! </i>

210
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,186
{\an1}<i>Well, I'm betting five</i>
<i>hundred on the other guy!</i>

211
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,452
{\an1}<i>Me, too!</i>

212
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,495
{\an1}If anyone's short on
cash, the Kanabun Gang
will place a bet for you!

213
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:45,501
{\an5}If that Tsukado guy uses
his real strength, this
fight won't last a
minute!

214
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,139
{\an7}Yeah, and we'll make a
tidy profit!

215
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:53,078
{\an4}That's terrible! Those
guys are just trying to
make a buck off of this
vendetta.

216
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,018
{\an1}It all ends right here.

217
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,456
{\an1}Sorry, but I'm not just
going to lay down and
give up.

218
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,330
On guard.

219
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:16,676
{\an1}What?! He's trying to
fight without looking his
opponent in the eye?!

220
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,857
He might actually win!

221
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,761
{\an1}Wait, did Naruto's
lessons actually help?!

[grunting]

223
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:39,007
{\an1}There's something about
this fight that's bugging
me... Something's off...

224
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,742
{\an1}What it is...?

225
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:45,015
It's him!

226
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,619
{\an1}Just like Mister said.
It's that guy's face.

227
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,122
{\an1}<i>Those eyes!</i>

228

231
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:02,538
{\an7}Those eyes again! How can
you look at me like
that?!

232
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,142
{\an1}<i>Don't you know that I</i>
<i>could kill you?! </i>

233
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:12,084
{\an1}Why hasn't he even tried
to kill Tsukado yet...?

234
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,857
[gasping]

235
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,161
{\an1}All right, then...

236
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:25,035
[yelling]

237
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,273
{\an1}No, this is all wrong!

238
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:33,447
{\an1}I know the reason why you
couldn't kill this guy!

239
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:37,986
{\an7}And I'm betting that
somewhere deep down
inside of you, you know
it, too...

240
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:38,953
[gasping]

241
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,058
Of course...

242
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,561
I understand now...

243
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:45,363
{\an1}Mmm.

244
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:48,433
I see. His blade has
been dulled.

245
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,804
{\an8}He couldn't kill anyone
with it even if he wanted
to.

246
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,039
{\an1}[sighing]

247
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,744
{\an1}Let me explain...

248
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:00,049
{\an1}I have a twin brother who
is named Kageki.

249
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,986
Are you serious? A twin
brother?

250
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,859
{\an1}Yes. Kageki had loaned
money to Shikazo, a
member of your clan.

251
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:15,069
{\an4}But then my brother had a
child and needed money
quickly, so he went to
Shikazo to ask to be repaid.

252
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:19,275
{\an1}<i>Shikazo ignored my</i>
<i>brother and tried to back</i>
<i>out of his debt. </i>

253
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:25,115
{\an4}<i>They argued. A scuffle</i>
<i>broke out between them,</i>
<i>and they both fell to the</i>
<i>dirt floor. </i>

254
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,920
{\an1}But when he fell,...
Shikazo hit his head on a
stone...

255
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,990
{\an1}And then he died.

256
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,860
{\an1}Are you saying it was all
just an accident?

257
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,731
{\an1}Kageki said that he'd
turn himself in.

258
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,568
{\an1}But there were no
witnesses to back him
up...

259
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:44,642
{\an4}<i>Given the circumstances,</i>
<i>he probably would have</i>
<i>been accused of murder.</i>
<i>So I offered to switch</i>

260
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,010
{\an1}<i>places with him. </i>

261
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,578
{\an1}You did what?!

262
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,982
{\an1}I assumed my twin
brother's identity.

263
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:55,123
{\an4}And then I told him, his
wife, and their newborn
child to go into hiding
to keep them all safe.

264
00:15:55,156 --> 00:16:00,696
{\an4}<i>In order to buy them time</i>
<i>to escape, I purposely</i>
<i>attracted the attention</i>
<i>of the pursuers. </i>

265
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:04,335
{\an1}I couldn't let a great
guy like him ruin his own
life.

266
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:09,976
{\an4}Not when I'm such a
scoundrel who's caused
nothing but grief to my
family and to society.

267
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:15,283
{\an7}I guess I figured that
this would be a way to
atone for all that...

268
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:21,525
{\an4}I only have my brother's
word about it. There's no
way for me to prove that's
what happened.

269
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,994
{\an1}But I believe that
what he said is true.

270
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,898
Mister?

271
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:33,807
{\an7}But it's up to you
whether you want to
believe me or not. And if
you don't believe me...

272
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,278
{\an1}Then you can kill me.

273
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:42,953
{\an1}I'm going to choose to
believe that what you say
is the truth.

274
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:43,387
You--

275
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,589
Yeah, Mister!

276
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:48,528
{\an1}Frankly, I'm sick and
tired of this thing
called revenge.

277
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:52,065
{\an1}If you've pretended all
these years to be my
enemy...

278
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:55,571
{\an1}Well, then, I'll just
pretend to be on a
vendetta.

279
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:59,041
{\an1}Thank you...

280
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:03,047
{\an1}What is all this crap?!

281
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,352
{\an1}The two of you are going
to have a fight, no
matter what!

282
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:12,661
{\an1}'Cause otherwise, my men
will hurt you bad!

283
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,665
{\an1}I got your back, guys!

284
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:16,898
{\an1}We'll help, too.

285
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:18,034
That's right.

286
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,736
{\an1}Guess I have no choice.

287
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:26,579
{\an4}I want to get back to the
village soon and resume
my training. So you can
count me in, too.

288
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,780
[grunting]

289
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,719
[squawking]

290
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,256
{\an1}Get them!

291
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,925
[yelling]

292
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,295
[grunting]

293
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:41,365
[groaning]

294
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:46,439
[groaning]

295
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:47,607
[grunting]

296
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:51,512
{\an7}You're gonna regret this
one day! Oh, my aching
head.

297
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:03,194
{\an7}You think everything
turned out okay, Kakashi
sensei?

298
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:06,499
{\an8}Well. That's for those
two to decide.

299
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:10,604
{\an1}I guess revenge... is
really complicated, isn't
it?

300
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,973
Huh. What would you
know about it?

301
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,376
{\an1}Huh?

302
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,080
{\an1}Sometimes, a vendetta
must be carried out, no
matter how hard it is.

303
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:31,799
{\an7}<i>Back then, we-- I mean,</i>
<i>I was such a naive</i>
<i>little kid. </i>

304
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,403
{\an7}<i>Sasuke...</i>

305
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,340
{\an1}Hey! You're
already here!

306
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,077
{\an1}Hi, Kakashi!

307
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,016
{\an7}Good to see you, Kakashi!
We heard that the Hidden
Leaf was in trouble so we
came as soon as we could.

308
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,554
{\an1}I see. We're
glad to have you.

309
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:48,622
{\an3}Hey.

310
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:50,891
{\an1}Huh? What is it?

311
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:55,297
I was just wondering
where Sasuke is; I'd like
to talk to him, as well.

312
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:56,399
{\an1}Uh...

313
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,043
{\an1}Well, Sasuke is---uh...

314
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:05,545
{\an3}Hm?

315
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,946
Sasuke...

316
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,515
{\an1}He just isn't around
right now.

317
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,686
{\an1}We kinda had a fight
and he left the village
for a little while.

318
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,490
{\an1}But don't worry, I'm
going to go bring him
back here soon!

319
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,660
{\an1}You could say hello
to him when we get back.

320
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:19,664
{\an1}I know Sasuke would be
really glad to see you
guys.

321
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,299
{\an1}Right, Sakura?

322
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:22,900
Uh, yeah.

323
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,406
{\an1}What? Were you guys
tangled up in a love
triangle or something?

324
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:31,045
{\an5}What?! - - No, no way,
old man Tazuna, it isn't
like that between us at
all!

325
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:33,081
{\an7}<i>Thank you... Naruto. </i>

326
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,659
{\an7}<i>Sasuke. Where in the</i>
<i>world are you? </i>

327
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:52,608
{\an4}What the heck do you know
about it?! You never had
a family in the first
place!

328
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,311
{\an7}You were on your own
right from the beginning!

329
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,249
{\an7}What makes you think you
know anything about it,
huh?!

330
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,219
{\an7}I'm suffering because I
have those ties!

331
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:05,692
{\an7}How on earth could you
possibly understand
what it feels like to
lose all that?!

332
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,669
{\an1}Now I understand how
Sasuke feels.

333
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,544
{\an1}What vengeance is all
about. And pain as
well...

334
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,652
{\an1}<i>Do you finally comprehend</i>
<i>pain? </i>

335
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:31,493
{\an4}Unless you come to know
the same pain, you
cannot truly comprehend
someone else.

336
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:38,570
{\an4}I thought I knew how
Sasuke felt, what he was
going through. But
really, I didn't

337
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,305
{\an1}understand a thing...

338
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:43,976
{\an4}No matter what I could
have said to him in the
Final Valley, it
wouldn't have reached

339
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,213
{\an1}him. He wasn't going to
listen.

340
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,115
Naruto...

341
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:53,556
{\an4}Without understanding
Sasuke's pain, there's no
way we could ever laugh
together. And no way that

342
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,259
{\an1}we could even argue with
each other again...

343
00:20:57,094 --> 00:21:02,268
{\an4}It'll probably hurt
like hell... but next
time, I want to have a
serious fight with him.

344
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:08,843
{\an4}And then someday, Squad
7, including Sasuke, can
all laugh together like
we used to back then!

345
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,613
[chuckling]

346
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,423
{\an1}<i>This should be our</i>
<i>rendezvous point. </i>

347
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:00,359
{\an1}Looks like we got here
first.

348
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:04,832
{\an4}Man! You can never tell what
those guys from the
Hidden Sand are really
thinking, but if they

349
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:08,202
{\an1}want to be friends with
the Hidden Leaf, they
ought to show up on time.

350
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:10,540
{\an1}I'm sorry if we're late.

351
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:11,708
<i>Gaara!</i>

352
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,209
{\an1}<i>Of all the people.</i>

353
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,246
{\an1}We're doing the joint
mission with him?

354
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,686
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Gaara's</i>
<i>Bond!</i>

355
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:23,123
{\an1}We're allied nations,
so let's try to get
along, okay?
