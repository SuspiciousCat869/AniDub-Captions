1
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:12,824
{\an1}I'm a Jinchuriki, too. The
Akatsuki are hunting all of us.

2
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,461
{\an1}So I'm not just an outsider.

3
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:19,200
{\an1}The Akatsuki always capture
a Jinchuriki alive.

4
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,471
{\an1}And that means your master may
still be alive right now.

5
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:23,507
What??

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,474
{\an1}Are you serious?

7
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:28,414
{\an1}Forget Sasuke. You need to
go rescue your master first.

8
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,885
{\an1}You sure about this?!
Like really, really sure?

9
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:36,224
{\an1}I told you, didn't I?
No way our master would
die as easily as that!

10
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:39,762
{\an1}Tell you what, I'll come
along and do what I can
to help you rescue him.

11
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:42,133
{\an1}And give you all that I've
got on the Akatsuki.

12
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,171
{\an1}Hey, you know what, there,
blondie? You're pretty sharp.

13
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:49,709
Come along with us.
And tell us all
about Sasuke!

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,414
Naruto...

15
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,387
{\an1}Just let me handle
this, Sakura.

16
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,926
{\an1}So, kid... What's your name?

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,028
<i>[Suigetsu]</i>
<i>Naruto?</i>

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,699
{\an1}This Naruto guy
really defeated Pain
all by himself?!

19
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,039
{\an4}[White Zetsu]
That's right.
He's become
extremely strong.

20
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:13,044
In fact, I think
he's stronger than
Sasuke right now.

21
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:14,879
Heh.

22
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:19,052
{\an1}I don't care about that.
What is a problem is this
Five Kage Summit.

23
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,524
{\an1}So what do we do?
The Leaf Village is gone now.

24
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:26,662
{\an1}And if our target, this
guy Danzo, is going to this
meeting of the Five Kage,

25
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:28,732
{\an1}<i>then shouldn't we</i>
<i>head over there, too?</i>

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,068
Hrmf!

27
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,738
{\an1}Huh? What? Do you
think I'm wrong
about that?

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,311
{\an1}We, the Taka, will take the
Hokage's head at the Summit.

29
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,281
{\an1}New destination.

30
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,252
{\an1}Sounds like a plan.

31
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:46,358
{\an1}So, how do we find out where
is this Five Kage Summit's
taking place?

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,929
{\an7}<i>Agh. This situation's</i>
<i>becoming annoying.</i>

33
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:52,433
Zetsu.

34
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:54,970
My clone will
guide you there.

35
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,619
Ugh... Yech!!

36
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,330
Okay, follow me!

37
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:30,087
Do you think we can
really trust these guys?

38
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:32,424
{\an1}We'll keep an eye
on them for now.

39
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:36,762
{\an1}If anything seems suspicious,
then I'll get rid of them
with my Amaterasu.

40
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,101
{\an1}There's something I've been
meaning to test out, anyway.

41
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,642
[Black Zetsu]
Things are going well.

42
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:49,682
{\an4}Well, I never thought
Nagato would use that
Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth
that he developed for me

43
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,519
{\an1}and for such a
thing as that?

44
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,523
I can't believe
he betrayed me.

45
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,880
{\an1}Even if Sasuke
surpasses Nagato,

46
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:14,450
{\an1}it's meaningless if
we can't control him.

47
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:18,890
{\an1}I have no intention of
linking him to the Gedo
statue anytime soon.

48
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,427
{\an1}It's wiser to just
keep an eye on him.

49
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:26,267
{\an5}[Black Zetsu]
I can't believe you
foresaw the possibility
that Nagato would die.

50
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,636
{\an1}As a precaution...

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,107
{\an1}But we've definitely
fallen off my ideal path.

52
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:38,051
{\an1}Thanks to Naruto Uzumaki.
He's caused all our
well-laid plans to shift.

53
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,790
What's next then?
Do we go, too?

54
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,529
{\an1}We're done with moving
ahead cautiously.

55
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:49,200
Put a rush on
Project Tsuki no Me!

56
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:34,585
The Eve of the
Five Kage Summit

57
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:39,792
<i>[Karui]</i>
<i>This'll do.</i>

58
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:46,133
All right, come on,
let's hear all about
this Sasuke guy.

59
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,917
{\an1}Tell us everything you know.
Anything you can about him.

60
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,197
What's the matter?
Spill it!

61
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,449
{\an1}I'm sorry. I can't.

62
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:23,421
{\an1}There's no way I can
sell Sasuke out.

63
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:27,928
{\an1}Quit playing around!
You can't take it back
after all that.

64
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,105
{\an1}All the same, Sasuke is
a Ninja belonging to the
Hidden Leaf Village.

65
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:37,575
He's a comrade!

66
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,014
{\an1}And I'll put my life on
the line to help 'im!
That's the way of our Village.

67
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:47,488
{\an1}Naruto... This is a...
once in a lifetime request.

68
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:53,030
{\an1}Just bring him home.
Please, bring Sasuke
back to me.

69
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,005
Well, come on!
Say something!

70
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,747
{\an1}To be a ninja means that
you must confront hatred.

71
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,987
{\an1}And every one of us must
battle against that hatred.

72
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:15,795
{\an4}And If one comes to call
vengeance justice,
such justice will only
breed further vengeance.

73
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:19,501
And trigger a vicious
cycle of hatred.

74
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:28,080
{\an1}I know that I'm only being
selfish, But I won't sell
out Sasuke like that.

75
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,115
Why you!

76
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,321
{\an1}I get your need for vengeance;
believe me, I do!

77
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:37,093
{\an1}But if you guys hate
enough to kill Sasuke,

78
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:40,531
{\an1}My friends won't just sit back
and accept what happened.

79
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:45,838
{\an1}<i>It'll be an eye for an eye!</i>
<i>And the vicious cycle will</i>
<i>start all over once again!</i>

80
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:49,010
{\an1}<i>The people you love will</i>
<i>keep killing each other.</i>

81
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,950
{\an1}Yeah, whatever! Your Sasuke
is the one who started it all!
So I don't care!

82
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:55,853
{\an1}We are going to kill him!

83
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:01,061
{\an1}Well, just where do
you suggest that we
take our hatred, then?

84
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,464
{\an1}I mean, what could
you do about that?

85
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,600
{\an1}[frustrated grunt]

86
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:12,309
{\an1}You guys can
beat me up instead.

87
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:14,412
I offer myself.

88

{\an1}Look, kid, just get
off your high horse!

89
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:23,659
{\an1}All right, then, let's test
your little theory out.

90
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,796
See if I can really
get my feelings out.

91
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,033

And that!

have go to gather Intel?

95

{\an1}He was the one who asked
for this all on his own.

142
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,242
{\an1}She's right.
Just stay out of this.

143
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:57,418
{\an1}Naruto, There's no need
for you to be beaten,
not on Sasuke's behalf.

144
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,357
{\an1}Shut up. It's my choice.

145
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,567
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>really hated Sasuke's guts.</i>

146
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:13,307
{\an1}<i>But when I look back,</i>
<i>I gotta admit it was always</i>
<i>fun being around the guy.</i>

147
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,112
{\an1}<i>Sasuke... is my best friend. </i>

148
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,618
{\an1}<i>It took a while, but now</i>
<i>we have a special bond.</i>

149
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,823
{\an1}Sasuke keeps causing
you so much pain.

150
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,294
If I were you...

151
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:30,732
{\an1}If you interfere,
I'll pummel you, too!

152
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:32,968
[gasp]

153
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:35,238
That's enough
already, Karui.

154
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:39,311
{\an1}Knocking these guys
around any more, isn't
going to get us anywhere.

155
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,548
I know you
agree with me.

156
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:55,401
{\an1}You know, you could cut him
some slack; he did promise to
help rescue Lord Killer Bee.

157
00:13:55,434 --> 00:14:01,042
{\an1}Oh, yeah? What? And you're not
going to question if he really
means it like you usually do?

158
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,045
You're usually so
obsessive-compulsive!

159
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:05,949
Naruto!

160
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:13,627
{\an1}Even if he's a foe, I like
this guy. He's someone who'd
never sell out his comrades.

161
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,698
{\an1}Real men don't choose
their words lightly.

162
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,137
{\an1}Even if you beat him,
He just won't betray
Sasuke.

163
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,610
{\an1}He's the type who will
never go back on his word.

164
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:25,142
{\an1}Huh?

165
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:27,145
{\an1}Captain Samui!

166
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:28,615
Omoi, Karui.

167
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:31,752
{\an1}How goes the Intel-gathering?

168
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,795
The two of you haven't
been causing any
trouble now, have you?

169
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,763
{\an1}[denying]
Mm-mm! mm-mm!

170
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,671
{\an1}Look, never mind that!
Lord Killer Bee may still be
alive, we have to save him!

171
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:48,677
{\an1}Listen to me, we're going
to have to track down all
the Akatsuki hideouts!

172
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:54,051
{\an1}And? Then what? We can't go
in there alone. These people
captured Lord Killer Bee!

173
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:58,991
{\an1}You're suggesting we check
out the who-knows-how-many
Akatsuki hideouts one by one?

174
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:02,829
We need Intel.
We need analysis first.

175
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:06,201
We mustn't repeat the
errors we made that
time with Yugito.

176
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,441
{\an1}We'll just take the
Hidden Leaf's data
directly to Lord Raikage.

177
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,211
Especially since
there's so much of it.

178
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:17,786
{\an1}[Naruto]
Ngh, Take me...
with you, too... please.

179
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,858
{\an1}I'd... like to help you guys...
rescue your Jinchuriki.

180
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,394
Naruto!

181
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:29,001
{\an1}Besides, there's something
I'd like to talk to the
Raikage about.

182
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:32,072
Talk to Lord Raikage?
Are you kidding me?!

183
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,107
{\an1}Karui...

184
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,644
{\an7}<i>So this child is Naruto.</i>

185
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:40,884
{\an7}<i>Naruto Uzumaki, the one</i>
<i>everyone in this village</i>
<i>is talking about.</i>

186
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:46,560
{\an4}You're an unknown
entity, and right now,
when he's on the road
under minimal guard,

187
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,062
{\an1}I cannot have you
meet Lord Raikage.

188
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,866
...

189
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,704
{\an1}Karui, Omoi, let's go!

190
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:57,908
{\an1}We're approved to
inspect the Intel on
Sasuke and the Akatsuki.

191
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:01,749
It's going to take time
to copy it all, so I
need you two to help me.

192
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:06,221
Sai...

193
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:07,456
{\an1}Yes?

194
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,361
Please take me to
Kakashi Sensei,
and Captain Yamato.

195
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,699
Okay. Here.

196
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:24,647
{\an1}[Sai]
I'll go get the first aid kit.
I'll be right back.

197
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,520
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Hey...</i>

198
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,255
What's with
that glum look?

199
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,524
Kakashi Sensei!

200
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,262
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>I see...</i>

201
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,699
So that's what
happened to Naruto.

202
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,101
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei.

203
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,135
Hmm?

204
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:44,375
{\an1}This link between
Naruto, Sakura, and
Sasuke hurts them.

205
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,411
{\an1}Is that bond really
so important?

206
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:50,284
{\an1}Why do they keep trying when
it causes them so much pain?

207
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:54,122
Sai, You're watching
Naruto for Danzo, right?

208
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,124
{\an1}Well, that's--

209
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:57,294
Relax. It's all right.

210
00:16:57,327 --> 00:17:01,266
{\an1}Jumping in to help Naruto...
isn't something a lookout does.

211
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:05,104
{\an1}<i>I think you've started to</i>
<i>realize it too, Sai.</i>

212
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,753
{\an1}You really ought to have
Sakura treat these wounds.

213
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:16,956
Nah, it's fine.

214
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:21,829
{\an1}Plus if she sees me like this,
it'll only cause more trouble,
trust me.

215
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,467
{\an1}<i>Besides, I heal fast.</i>
<i>I'll be okay in no time.</i>

216
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:28,739
{\an1}Sai...

217
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,374
Hm?

218
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,679
{\an1}What you did before...
Thanks for helping me.

219
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,050
Sure!

220
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,587
{\an1}Boy, they really
worked you over.

221
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,956
Hee.

222
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,124
Ngh! Ow!

223
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:43,193
{\an1}Sorry!

224
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,964
{\an1}Look, you need to take it
easy for a little bit.

225
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,400
No, I'm going to
see the Raikage!

226
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,569
{\an1}Ah!

227
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,040
{\an1}Naruto what are you saying?!
The Five Kage Summit is soon!

228
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,647
{\an4}Every Hidden Village
has agreed to travel
restrictions and no
unnecessary missions!

229
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,081
What do you hope
to achieve?

230
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:03,054
{\an1}I'm going to convince him to
forgive Sasuke! No matter what.

231
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:07,093
{\an1}But you don't have the
Hokage's necklace that
seals the Nine-Tails!

232
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,298
{\an1}As a Jinchuriki you must
not leave the Hidden Leaf!

233
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,137
{\an1}<i>It's bad enough that you</i>
<i>sprouted eight tails</i>
<i>during that last battle!</i>

234
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:20,780
{\an4}We're lucky the Sealing
Formula triggered and
stopped Nine-Tails.
But what about next time?

235
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,886
{\an1}<i>Besides, I'm in charge of</i>
<i>reconstructing the Village.</i>

236
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,056
{\an1}<i>I can't stay close to</i>
<i>you all the time!</i>

237
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,626
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I met the Fourth Hokage.</i>

238
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,094
Huh?

239
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:37,503
{\an1}The one who stopped me from
becoming the Nine-Tails,
was the Fourth Hokage.

240
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:38,672
{\an1}(taken aback reax)

241
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:41,543
{\an1}What does he mean?
The Fourth Hokage's dead!

242
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:46,918
{\an1}The Sealing Jutsu he used,
the Reaper Death Seal,
still holds many mysteries.

243
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:50,188
{\an1}He probably stored some
of his own mental energy
within the seal spell.

244
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:53,760
And that's when the
Fourth Hokage told me,

245
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:59,334
{\an1}The Nine-Tails incident sixteen
years ago, was caused by the
Akatsuki guy with a mask.

246
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:03,340
{\an1}<i>He's so strong even the Fourth</i>
<i>Hokage struggled against him!</i>

247
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:10,084
{\an1}He said the masked one's pulling
the strings. He was probably
just using Pain the whole time.

248
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,821
{\an1}<i>If Sasuke has joined</i>
<i>the Akatsuki,</i>

249
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:16,259
{\an1}<i>that means this masked</i>
<i>guy is using Sasuke, too!</i>

250
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,098
{\an1}It's just as Lord
Jiraiya feared.

251
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:26,540
{\an1}<i>I can't believe that man</i>
<i>was behind the incident</i>
<i>sixteen years ago.</i>

252
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,082
{\an1}He bears the Sharingan.

253
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,519
{\an1}And a grudge against
the Village.

254
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:38,357
{\an1}The only rogue Uchiha capable
of summoning the Nine-Tails,

255
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,127
Is Madara.

256
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:41,595
Eh?

257
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,636
{\an1}Without a doubt,
Anything's possible
if Madara's involved.

258
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,239
{\an1}So he's actually still alive.

259
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:51,643
{\an8}<i>Madara...</i>

260
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:58,453
{\an1}With that vision of yours,
and a chakra more ominous
than my own,

261
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:02,592
You're the spitting
image of Madara Uchiha.

262
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,098
{\an1}Who is this guy, Madara?

263
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,808
{\an4}A former Hidden Leaf shinobi
and Uchiha clan leader who
battled the First Hokage and
lost, and was never seen again.

264
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:18,081
This Intel needs
to be reported to
the Council. Sai?

265
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,015
Yes?

266
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,319
{\an1}You must report this to
the Hokage at once.

267
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,455
Oh. Right.

268
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,695
{\an1}Naruto. What else did the
Fourth Hokage say to you?

269
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,596
Huh?

270
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:40,346
{\an1}Fathers tend to have a lot
they want to tell their sons.

271
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:01,376
{\an1}There was one other
thing he said;
he believed in me!

272
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:03,445
Good!

273
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:06,184
Naruto, you go
to the Raikage!

274
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,185
{\an1}Huh?!

275
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:09,688
Yamato and I will tag
along as your escorts.

276
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:10,924
{\an1}Whaaat?!

277
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,595
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Nononono,</i>
<i>This is a bad idea!</i>

278
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:18,067
{\an4}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>What? Don't you even want to</i>
<i>hear what I have to say before</i>
<i>you make up your mind, Tenzo?</i>

279
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,038
{\an1}<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Hey! You're not supposed to call</i>
<i>me by that name, remember?!</i>

280

<i>Naruto, are you serious about</i>
<i>going to meet the Raikage?</i>

282
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,584
{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Of course. I'm going</i>
<i>to convince him to</i>
<i>forgive Sasuke.</i>

<i>What?! Oh sure, you make</i>
<i>it sound so easy...</i>

{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden,</i>
