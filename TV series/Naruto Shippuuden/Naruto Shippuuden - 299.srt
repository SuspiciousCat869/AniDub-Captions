79

don't aim at all.

80
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,473
{\an1}This tactic exploits the core's
gravity.

{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

145
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,025
Huh?

146
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:27,092
{\an4}Looks like you've overused the
Nine Tails Chakra Mode. No more
clones for you right now,
Naruto.

147
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:27,992
Hmph.

148
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,759
{\an1}Don't try to do everything
by yourself.

149
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:37,160
{\an1}I have the best chance to stop
the Reanimation Jutsu. And I've
got an idea of how to do it.

150
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:42,594
{\an1}Listen, I'm going to put an end
to this war all by myself! It's
my responsibility! Got it?

151
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,126
{\an1}<i>[Heavy Breathing]</i>

152
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,026
{\an1}[Heavy Breathing]

153
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,394
{\an1}<i>I admit, you are stronger than</i>
<i>before. You have much more</i>
<i>power.</i>

154
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:58,461
{\an1}But as a result, you seem to
have lost sight of something
extremely important.

155
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,928
{\an1}<i>Naruto, you must remember.</i>

156
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,361
{\an1}You know why the people of the
Leaf Village stopped hating and
fearing you.

157
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:10,428
{\an1}You know why they accepted you
as one of their own.

158
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:15,195
{\an7}<i>It's because you showed them</i>
<i>that you understood them.</i>

159
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,062
{\an7}<i>And you fought for their</i>
<i>acceptance.</i>

160
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:25,062
{\an1}You just said everyone who cares
about you helped you get where
you are.

161
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:26,362
Hmm.

162
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:32,930
{\an4}If you forget about everyone
else because you now have power,
you'll become arrogant and
egotistical.

163
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:36,630
{\an1}And eventually, you will become
just like Madara.

164
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,263
Hmph.

165
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,231
{\an1}However powerful you are, don't
take it all on yourself.

166
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,331
{\an1}Because if you do, you will
surely fail.

167
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:06,664
{\an4}<i>Your father, Minato, was able to</i>
<i>fulfill his duties as Hokage</i>
<i>because your mother, Kushina and</i>
<i>his comrades were at his side.</i>

168
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:12,732
You share your father's
dream, don't you?

169
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,398
Mhmm.

170
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,799
<i>Then never forget...</i>

171
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:20,031
{\an1}Becoming Hokage isn't about
getting people to acknowledge
you.

172
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,932
{\an1}Only those already acknowledged
will ever become Hokage.

173
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:24,699
Hmm.

174
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,065
{\an1}<i>Never forget your friends!</i>

175
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,136
{\an1}Naruto!

176
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,837
{\an3}Hmm.

177
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:08,337
{\an1}I swore an oath to that Iruka
fella. Simply put, I have to
protect ya.

178
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:14,204
{\an1}You can't do this alone, bro! If
I'm alive, I'm with ya rarin' to
go! You know?

179
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:20,004
{\an1}Don't act like a spoiled brat!
Do you know what you are to
me?!

180
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,238
{\an1}You see, to me you...

181
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:26,404
{\an1}You remain one of my most
important students.

182
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,238
{\an1}Also...

183
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,938
{\an1}I think of you as
my little brother.

184
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,005
{\an1}The enemy leader is targeting
you with everything he's got.

185
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:40,572
{\an1}How can I stand here and let
that happen?! Let you face such
danger?

186
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:45,439
{\an1}And besides, there's no reason
for you to shoulder that burden
alone.

187
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:51,306
{\an1}You're right. I guess I just got
caught up and forgot about that.

188
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,406
{\an1}I thought that I had to do it
all alone.

189
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,740
[Caw]

190
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:04,607
Huh?

191
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,907
Why did?

192
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,039
{\an1}Shisui's eye won't work for
another decade or so.

193
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,574
{\an1}So you wouldn't be able to use
it against Sasuke.

194
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,975
{\an1}However, you possess something
that's even more powerful than
his eye.

195
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,040
What?

196
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:24,174
{\an1}<i>You have the same soul as</i>
<i>Shisui. And that is what he</i>
<i>truly wanted to pass on.</i>

197
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:28,808
<i>You don't need Shisui's</i>
<i>eye anymore.</i>

198
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:32,442
{\an1}<i>The way you are now, you can</i>
<i>stop Sasuke without it.</i>

199
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:36,642
{\an1}But wait! You're here now! You
can just talk to Sasuke! And
this time...

200
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:37,542
{\an3}No.

201
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:39,475
Hmph.

202
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,775
{\an1}I tried to do everything myself,
too. And I failed.

203
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,509
{\an1}So this time, I will leave that
task for a comrade to handle.

204
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,209
{\an1}You'll have to take
care of Sasuke.

205
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:57,510
{\an1}It seems you're not only a
powerful shinobi, but a wise
one, too.

206
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,877
{\an1}Killer Bee...Watch over Naruto.

207
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:04,977
{\an1}Fa'sho!

208
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:06,309
Itachi!

209
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:17,677
All right, Octopops.
Let's do this.

210
00:22:55,749 --> 00:23:00,682
{\an1}<i>Hey! Do not underestimate my</i>
<i>jutsu! You need to stand back!</i>
<i>For real!</i>

211
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,516
{\an1}<i>Now, here are all my</i>
<i>weaknesses! For real!</i>

212
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:09,249
{\an1}<i>I use Shadow Style. In other</i>
<i>words I'm a genjutsu user.</i>

213
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,550
{\an1}<i>And my summoning...</i>

214
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:17,483
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"The Mizukage, the Giant Clam,</i>
<i>and the Mirage."</i>

215
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:21,016
{\an1}<i>My summoning...is a giant clam!</i>
