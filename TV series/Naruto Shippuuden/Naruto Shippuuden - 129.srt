1
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,033
-Well, infiltration
accomplished.

2
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:37,666
Actually, it was easier than
I thought-- perhaps too easy.

3
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:44,000
ANGEL: Pain, what's the matter?

4
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,533
-Someone has
circumvented my rain.

5
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:50,000
From the feel of this
chakra, he's very powerful.

6
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,633
-All right.

7
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,433
Where to start?

8
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,266
Ooh, that's hot.

9
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,166
I'll take one of these pork
buns if you please, granny.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,766
-Why, thank you.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,500
I don't think I've
seen your face before.

12
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,733
Not from around here, are you?

13
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,366
-No, I'm not.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,166
I'm a traveling writer.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
I journey around from place to
place and write about cuisine

16
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,900
from wherever I
happen to be visiting.

17
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,266
-Oh, I see.

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,100
So tell me, how do
you like my pork buns?

19
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,566
-I must say, they're
quite delicious, ma'am.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,433
I had heard they were good,
but now that I've had one,

21
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,300
they're amazing.

22
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,233
-Yes, I know.

23
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,766
Aren't they tasty?

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,033
-You know what?

25
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:56,400
I would love to write
about these in my magazine.

26
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,666
Would that be OK?

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,433
-My pork buns would
be in a magazine?

28
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,033
-Yep, that's right.

29
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,566
Though once I write about them,
you'll have such a crowd here

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,466
you'll never have a
moment to yourself.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,133
-Oh, yes.

32
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,333
I see.

33
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,100
That would be quite a
problem, wouldn't it?

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,633
-Boy, it's certainly nice and
peaceful around here, isn't it?

35
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,566
-Yes.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,266
This village is
no longer plagued

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,166
by war or any other
discord, thanks

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
to the efforts of Lord Pain.

39
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,633
We're all very grateful
for what he's done.

40
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,000
-Lord Pain?

41
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,300
-That's right.

42
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,166
Lord Pain's our leader.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,266
-Your leader?

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,233
What happened to Hanzo
of the Salamander?

45
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,933
-Huh?

46
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,666
-I said, Hanzo of
the Salamander.

47
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,766
Well, uh, thanks for
your time, granny.

48
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,733
SHOPKEEPER: Thank
you for waiting.

49
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:58,000
-Say, do you know what
that thing is over there?

50
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,700
-Huh?

51
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,666
Oh, that's Lady Angel.

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
Didn't you know?

53
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,533
They say if you hang an origami
of Lady Angel at the door,

54
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:11,933
your shop will always
have good fortune.

55
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,166
-An angel.

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,633
Huh.

57
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,666
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
What is going on here?

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,566
This land isn't
divided into two.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
It's already united.

60
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,133
The Hidden Rain
Village used to be

61
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,533
led by Hanzo of the Salamander.

62
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,366
So where is he?

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
Looks like I'm going
to need to check

64
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,400
this place out very thoroughly.

65
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,633
And I think I should
start at [inaudible].

66
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,400
TEZUNA: Oh, sir.

67
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,933
Surely you're just
joking with me.

68
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,000
-No.

69
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,633
I'm not even capable
of telling a lie.

70
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,866
Everything I said
is completely true.

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,300
-Oh, well, I'm flattered, then.

72
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,733
-Oh, yes.

73
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,433
What an intense battle this is.

74
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,133
-Mister, you have
really good taste

75
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,133
for picking me to sit with you.

76
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,933
-Well Tezuna, you remind
me of someone that I know.

77
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,533
You look just like her.

78
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,166
Even your names are similar.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
So I couldn't help but
request your company.

80
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:17,733
This is well worth the long
journey, that's for sure.

81
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,333
-Oh, I see.

82
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,300
So you aren't from around
these parts then, I take it?

83
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,300
-Well I heard
there might be work

84
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,300
for an old mercenary like
me, so I came right away

85
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,000
to see if anyone was hiring.

86
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,733
I think it was Hanzo
of the Salamander

87
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:31,633
who was looking for--

88
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,766
-Shh.

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,166
You mustn't talk about
such things here.

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,766
-Oh?

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,966
And why is that?

92
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:43,100
-If they here that you're one
of Hanzo's old associates,

93
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,566
then you're going to be killed.

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,366
-Oh!

95
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, that's disturbing news.

96
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,700
-The new leader of
the city, Lord Pain,

97
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,400
is a very strict and
unforgiving ruler.

98
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,533
He shows no mercy to
anybody, or at least

99
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,966
that's what my husband tells me.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,033
-What was that?

101
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,433
Are you telling
me you're married?

102
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,100
-Yes, I am.

103
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,900
My husband is just a genin
and doesn't earn much.

104
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,466
So I have to work
this job in order

105
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,666
to make sure that
our bills get paid.

106
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,933
-Wow, that must
be rough for you.

107
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,133
TEZUNA: According to
my hubby, Lord Pain

108
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,566
uses his jutsu to make it
rain all over this village.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,366
And then, the rain
actually tells him

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,833
what everybody in this
entire place is doing.

111
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:22,900
-Really?

112
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,433
That sounds like a
very scary jutsu.

113
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,533
-I know.

114
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,800
So it's better to watch
what we talk about.

115
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,133
-Hey, Tezuna.

116
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,700
-Hmm?

117
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,566
Oh, excuse me a minute.

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
So I'm already

119
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,233
under this Pain's watch, then.

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,566
-"I'm coming home
now with a present."

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,933
Yeah, right.

122
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,733
It's probably something
from that lame gift

123
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,300
shop by Shibuki Bridge.

124
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:06,166
-Huh, what a sad
piece of writing.

125
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:16,533
PAIN: Konan, when
I stop the rain,

126
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,966
ferret out the intruder
with your jutsu.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
KONAN: Leave it to me.

128
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:23,833
PAIN: Are you ready?

129
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,366
-On it.

130
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,100
-Man, it's really coming down.

131
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,466
-I have an idea.

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,700
Want to go get a drink while
we wait for the rain to stop?

133
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,266
-I wish, but there
aren't any bars

134
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,933
we can duck into at ground
level like this one.

135
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,133
We'd have to go up to
one of the higher levels.

136
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,166
-Well, then let's head up there
and get some cover already.

137
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,933
But you sure it's OK?

138
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,266
Didn't you tell your wife you
were heading straight home

139
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
with a little gift?

140
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,100
-It's OK.

141
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,033
This is an emergency mission.

142
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,800
-I never heard of drinking
being an emergency mission.

143
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,966
-Well, look here.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,566
We're in luck.

145
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,133
-Come on in, gentleman.

146
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,933
-Hey, just two.

147
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,266
-We'll have two sakes
and some snacks, OK?

148
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,666
Wait, today isn't Sunday, is it?

149
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,633
-I guess that something must
have come up for Lord Pain.

150
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,566
Maybe he's going to go to
another nation or something.

151
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,833
-Yeah.

152
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,933
I don't recall it ever raining
this hard on other days

153
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:33,866
before, you know?

154
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,266
RYUSUI: Maybe he's
doing something

155
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,533
that requires a lot of power.

156
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:39,000
- But if it keeps on
raining like this.

157
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,033
-Hey, you watch what you say.

158
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,466
Lord Pain gives so much
of himself for all of us

159
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
in this city, and you know it.

160
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,733
So stop your whining.

161
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:48,500
-Yeah, OK.

162
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,966
I guess you're right.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,666
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

164
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,033
RYUSUI: Huh?

165
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,200
Hey.

166
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,333
YUDACHI: Where's our order?

167
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:56,933
You didn't bring out anything.

168
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,366
-No, no.

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,133
You two guys have an
absolute enormous stroke

170
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,233
of luck tonight.

171
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,800
Because this evening,
the both of you

172
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,033
get to enjoy our
grand opening special.

173
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:06,600
-We do?

174
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,733
Seriously?

175
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:08,833
-So what is it?

176
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,766
Tell us.

177
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,100
-It's a little
thing I like to go

178
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,800
the club frog torture special.

179
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,866
-Hey, who the hell are you?

180
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,433
-I'm the one asking
the questions here.

181
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:25,700
And I have quite a
lot of them to ask.

182
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,533
RYUSUI: Now, run!

183
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:34,766
-What?

184
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,933
JIRAIYA: Just give
it up, you two.

185
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,866
[screaming]

186
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,166
[music playing]

187
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,866
[music playing]

188
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,092
-Konan, do it.

189
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:01,592
-Right.

190
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,592
JIRAIYA: Now, then,
judging by the way

191
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,259
you were twirling
your kunai, I'm

192
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,726
guessing that you two are
just underling shinobi.

193
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,759
Am I right?

194
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,592
And does that rogue
ninja symbol signify

195
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,626
that you're loyal to Pain?

196
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,759
-Damn it.

197
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,826
-What the hell is this place?

198
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:41,926
-You're inside the
stomach of a toad.

199
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,492
No matter what you may try,
you'll never be found here.

200
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:47,492
No one will ever
come to your aid.

201
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:50,192
-But who-- who are you?

202
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,259
-I already told you
that I'm the one who's

203
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:55,459
asking the questions
here, remember?

204
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:58,226
-What-- what are you gonna
do with that feather, huh?

205
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,426
JIRAIYA: Tickle you, of course.

206
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,292
If you don't want to
die from laughing,

207
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:05,292
then I suggest you
answer my questions.

208
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:08,226
Now tell me all about
your leader, Pain.

209
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,859
Start talking.

210
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,492
Tell me everything you
know about this man, Pain.

211
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,459
-Don't give in!

212
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,626
-I won't talk.

213
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,092
I won't betray him!

214
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,359
-You're pretty
stubborn, aren't you?

215
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:32,192
Well, I still have
one other trick.

216
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,492
-What-- what are you gonna do?

217
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,659
-If the both of you refuse to
talk, then I'll use my jutsu

218
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,392
and flog you into frogs.

219
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,192
Flog and frog.

220
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,392
Do you get it?

221
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,755
-Just what do you
want from us, anyway?

222
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:08,355
-For you to talk.

223
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,488
-Listen, you.

224
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,655
We may only be underlings,
but we would never

225
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:15,688
betray our comrades, no
matter what you do to us.

226
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,888
You'd better not
take us lightly.

227
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,322
-Well, then I guess
I have no choice.

228
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:25,522
Ninja Art Toad Transformation!

229
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,555
-No, don't!

230
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:33,755
-You bastard!

231
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:34,855
That's not fair!

232
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,222
-All right, then.

233
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:37,488
I guess you're next.

234
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:41,155
Come here, little toad.

235
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,088
-Lord Pain lives in
the tallest tower

236
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,788
on the west end of the village.

237
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:47,155
That's what people say.

238
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,155
-Now, what was that you said?

239
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:51,388
It was something about not
turning on your comrades,

240
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:51,955
right?

241
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:56,788
Well, no matter.

242
00:13:56,822 --> 00:14:00,555
But what did you mean by
"that's what people say"?

243
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:04,255
-Actually, nobody really knows
very much about Lord Pain.

244
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,088
He's a mystery.

245
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:07,988
-What you mean by that?

246
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:11,422
-They say that he's
of Fuma clan lineage.

247
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,022
But no one's ever
seen him up close.

248
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,822
And some people
even go so far as

249
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,988
to claim that he
doesn't really exist.

250
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,488
-I just walked through
town a little while ago,

251
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:23,155
and every single
person that I talked to

252
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,855
just sang his praises.

253
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,188
So don't lie to me.

254
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:30,122
-In this village, Lord
Pain is considered a god.

255
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:32,722
It's not a question
of if he exists.

256
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,755
He's always out there,
watching over every one of us.

257
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,155
He has a representative do
things like ceremonial rites,

258
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,322
speeches, and the
issuing of orders.

259
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:44,022
That's all done
through Lady Angel.

260
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:47,188
JIRAIYA: Her again.

261
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,255
He's your leader, isn't he?

262
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,555
So why must he hide himself
from the people he rules over?

263
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,688
-For times just like this.

264
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,355
-Well, that makes sense.

265
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:59,122
-You're not one of the holdovers
from the old Hidden Rain,

266
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,488
are you?

267
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,288
Just who the hell are you?

268
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:04,422
-Never mind about me, now.

269
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,622
But what's all this
stuff about the holdovers

270
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,888
from the old Hidden
Rain Village?

271
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,755
-You really don't know
anything at all, do you?

272
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,922
Outsider, huh?

273
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,255
Until recently, those
remnants of the old days

274
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:20,622
would try to
infiltrate our land.

275
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,855
But that isn't a
concern anymore.

276
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:26,488
Only very few, very
lucky foreigners

277
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:30,655
like you ever manage to
slip in from the outside.

278
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,555
-It isn't a concern?

279
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,788
What do you mean by that?

280
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:38,155
I had heard this land was
going through a civil war.

281
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,688
-I'm not surprised.

282
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:42,188
This land's closed
to the outside.

283
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,022
But I'll tell you the truth.

284
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:47,355
The civil war here
ended a long time ago,

285
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:50,288
and we were triumphant.

286
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:52,955
That's why Lord Pain
is so legendary.

287
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:55,655
He conquered the Hidden
Rain all by himself.

288
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,922
-I can't believe it.

289
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:06,688
No matter how powerful
this Pain might be,

290
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:09,855
the leader of the Hidden Rain
was Hanzo of the Salamander.

291
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,755
Everyone in the shinobi
world knows about him.

292
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,155
-Yeah, that's right.

293
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:19,555
And not only was Hanzo extremely
powerful, he was also cautious.

294
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:23,688
He made it very hard for
anyone to come near him.

295
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:27,422
He surrounded himself with
bodyguards 24 hours a day

296
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,488
and required full body
searches of everyone

297
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,455
who approached
him, even children.

298
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:35,622
-So how was Pain
able to defeat Hanzo?

299
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,955
Just what ability
does he possess?

300
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:42,155
-I already told you, we don't
really know anything about him.

301
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,222
HANZO: I'm surprised
that you could drive me

302
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,622
into a corner like that.

303
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,922
You are young, but
you are capable.

304
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:00,355
I predict that the Hidden
Leaf will emerge victorious

305
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,088
from this battle.

306
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,755
Therefore, I'll let
the three of you live.

307
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:06,622
-Keep your sympathy!

308
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,922
We can still fight you!

309
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:09,822
-No, Jiraiya, stop!

310
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,122
HANZO: You three
are very strong.

311
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,888
You survived even
this battleground.

312
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:17,155
In return, I will give you time.

313
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,355
Become stronger, and then
return to fight me again.

314
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,488
In exchange for your
lives, tell me your names.

315
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:30,655
-Jiraiya.

316
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,722
-Tsunade.

317
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:34,555
-Orochimaru.

318
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,055
HANZO: Your names have been
etched into my memory--

319
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:41,355
Jiraiya, Tsunade, Orochimaru.

320
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:44,388
And so I, Hanzo,
hereby christen you

321
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,488
three the Hidden Leaf's Sannin.

322
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:52,588
-I just can't believe it.

323
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:57,088
There's no way he could have
defeated Hanzo by himself.

324
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:57,922
-Of course he could.

325
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:58,955
He's a god.

326
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:01,255
He wields formidable jutsu.

327
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:05,288
Even so, that isn't the real
reason to fear Lord Pain.

328
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,688
-Huh?

329
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,488
-What's truly
frightening about him

330
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,955
is his merciless heart
of unbending steel.

331
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,922
He has systematically eliminated
all who question or threaten

332
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,555
his vision.

333
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,888
He didn't stop at
just destroying Hanzo.

334
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:24,388
Hanzo's parents, his wife
and child, his relatives

335
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,322
and friends, even
their infants--

336
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,455
he killed all of them,
then he burned their homes

337
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,855
to the ground.

338
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:35,488
And then he killed emissaries
of villages allied with Hanzo.

339
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:38,522
He erased them all.

340
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:39,322
It was retribution.

341
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,922
Is that not godlike?

342
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:55,588
-A god, huh?

343
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,222
-That's right.

344
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,988
-All right.

345
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,988
Then what exactly is your god
trying to accomplish here?

346
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,988
Even a couple of
lowly underlings

347
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,288
like you must know that much.

348
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,922
-His are the works of a god.

349
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:14,555
We couldn't know what
he has in his mind.

350
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,688
-I see.

351
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,922
Then enough about your god.

352
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,322
At the very least, you
must know some information

353
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:23,222
about the Akatsuki.

354
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:27,355
-Never heard of it.

355
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:29,688
-Your arms and legs
have been bound,

356
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:32,022
so it's impossible
for you to move.

357
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:35,655
But that's not all
that this trap does.

358
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,155
Your pulse is also
being measured.

359
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:41,955
And if you lie,
I'll know instantly.

360
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:42,755
Now, go on.

361
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:44,622
Tell me everything you know.

362
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,455
Otherwise, you're
both going to spend

363
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:49,488
the rest of your miserable
lives eating flies.

364
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,455
-Now, then.

365
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,866
Time to hunt the intruder.

366
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:34,126
[music playing]

367
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,749
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
I taught you ninjutsu

368
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,349
so you could survive
those turbulent times.

369
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:09,082
You were all
undoubtedly my students.

370
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:11,216
The world may indeed
be a cruel place,

371
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:15,149
but to attack me without even
a greeting is just too much.

372
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,620
ANGEL: You know nothing of what
happened to us after you left.

373
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:18,987
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
No, I don't.

374
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,720
But I do know that what the
Akatsuki is doing is wrong.

375
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:25,154
PAIN: This is the choice
I've made, Jiraiya sensei.

376
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:28,354
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- "The Man Who Became God."
