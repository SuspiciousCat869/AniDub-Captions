{\an1}Of course there is! Look
at that.

00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,846
{\an7}That ship's exactly how
Captain Yamato described
it.

54
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:44,654
{\an4}Yes, I agree it's
suspicious-looking.
However, maritime law says
we must examine all lost ships.

{\an1}What thing?

{\an4}You know, the way you
tapped the broom before,
like a drum or something.
That was really awesome.

{\an1}Thanks, it is pretty
cool, huh?

125
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,859
{\an8}The captain taught it
to me. He also gave me
this broom.

128
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:02,510
{\an5}So, listen, Captain
Yamato. I took a look around,
but it's just an ordinary
ship on the inside.

129
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,248
Seems we're in luck.
It isn't a ghost ship
at all.

130
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:09,752

A ghost ship?! That's
just a silly superstition.

131
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,322
Okay, but--

132
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:14,326
{\an1}<i>Isn't that light made by</i>

133
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,027
{\an1}What, the glow on the
mast?

134
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:20,900
{\an4}No way! Now, among
sailors, that light is
considered to be a sign
of good luck...

135
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,603
{\an1}But it's just static
electricity!

136
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:25,239
{\an1}Static- elec-?

137
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,809
{\an1}But what about the crows
up there?

138
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,079
{\an1}<i>You don't normally see</i>

not crows.

140
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:37,755

{\an1}Oh... Seriously?

142
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:43,329
{\an1}Now... No more talk about
this being a ghost ship.

143
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:47,334
{\an1}Aoba and I took the
liberty of checking the
ship's interior...

something.
