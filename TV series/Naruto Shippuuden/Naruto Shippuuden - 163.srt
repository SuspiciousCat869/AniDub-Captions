00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:29,430
{\an1}-It appears you understand
a little about pain.

164
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:33,401
{\an1}However, I have no
need of you right now.

165
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,103
The one I seek--

166
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,804
[blasting]

167
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:37,339
-Is me!

168
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,851
{\an1}-There's no need for
the Leaf's hokage

169
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,986
{\an1}to bother herself with
the likes of them.

170
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,689
{\an1}You just sit back and
sip some tea, Granny.

171
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:54,324
-Naruto--

172
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:56,492
{\an1}-What's going on?

173
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:58,395
{\an1}I can't tell from here.

174
00:13:58,427 --> 00:13:59,461
-Amazing.

175
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,132
{\an1}He took down one of the
Pains with one blow.

176
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:04,334
{\an1}(TO HERSELF): Naruto, you--

177
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,271
{\an1}-Well, grandfather.

178
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,406
{\an1}What do you think?

179
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:11,875
{\an1}Doesn't he remind you a
lot of those other two?

180
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,443
-Indeed he does.

181
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:18,382
{\an1}(TO HIMSELF) Naruto-boy has
surpassed his predecessors.

182
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,651
{\an1}-So you are Naruto Uzumaki.

183
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:22,585
-That's it!

184
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,453
{\an1}Let's settle this.

185
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,597
(TO HIMSELF):
Tendo's powers won't

186
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:37,468
{\an1}be fully recharged for quite
some time, which means--

187
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,006
-Gamakichi!

188
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,241
[thud]

189
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,810
{\an1}-I want you to take Grandma
Tsunade someplace safe.

190
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,844
-Gotcha.

191
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:50,315
{\an1}-Granny, I'll take
over from here.

192
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,684
{\an1}Keep the rest of the
village out of this.

193
00:14:52,718 --> 00:14:55,153
{\an1}I can't be worrying
about everyone else,

194
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,856
{\an1}not during this fight.

195
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:59,758
-All right.

196
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,393
But here.

197
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:02,395
{\an1}Please take Katsuyu.

198
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,029
{\an1}I'm sure she'll come in handy.

199
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,598
She has Intel on
all of the Pains.

200
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:07,966
[squishing]

201
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,338
{\an1}-Go, Katsuyu-girl.

202
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,041
{\an1}Just keep yourself hidden
inside Naruto-boy's clothing.

203
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,750
{\an1}-I-- I probably shouldn't
bring this up right now,

204
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:28,988
{\an1}but now that I've
mastered nature energy,

205
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,623
{\an1}I'm able to sense
everybody's chakra.

206
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,697
{\an1}Is Kakashi-sensei on a
mission away from the village?

207
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,474
I see.

208
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:47,207
Go, Gamakichi!

209
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:51,812
{\an1}-Summoning Jutsu!

Lady Tsunade!

215
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,805
-Sakura.

216
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:20,875
{\an1}It's all right now.
[breathing heavily]

217
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,611
-Yes.

218
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,449
{\an1}Thank you for your
labors, Lady Tsunade.

219
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:32,254
-Hwah!

220
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,294
{\an1}-Summoning Jutsu!

222
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,663
BOTH: Let's go!

00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,598
{\an1}Sage Art, Frog Song!

-Sage Art!

Hiro-boy!

231
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:04,688
-Hey.

232
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,296
{\an1}-Naruto, ninjutsu doesn't
work on the Pain right

233
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,663
in front of you.

234
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:17,135
{\an1}He will merely absorb any and
all ninjutsu-based attacks.

235
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:18,903
{\an1}-OK, Frog Kumate it is.

00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,814
[thwap]

237
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,017
{\an1}KATSUYU: All the Pains
are visually linked.

238
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,153
{\an1}A blind-spot attack is
useless, unless you're out

239
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,154
{\an1}of the other sight line.

00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,361
-Well, then.

242
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,397
{\an1}I'll show them an attack
that they can't see.

00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,001
{\an1}-You insolent mutt!

[thwogg]

{\an1}-And stay down, dog!

00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,675
{\an1}-As you see, I'm ungraceful.

{\an1}-Just lie down, ya mutt!

257
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,474
(TO HIMSELF): I
thought we dodged that.

258
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:32,112
{\an1}-Frog Kumite utilizes the nature
energy all around the wielder.

259
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,248
{\an1}That energy became
part of Naruto

260
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,552
{\an1}and attacked Pain
alongside Naruto's strike.

261
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,955
{\an1}In Sage Mode, both threat
perception and attack capacity

262
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:43,824
{\an1}are enhanced well
beyond the ordinary.

-That's it.

264
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,027
{\an1}I can't waste anymore time.

265
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:48,463
I'll finish this
with my new jutsu.

-I see.

268
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,270
{\an1}So you've become a sage.

269
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:58,708
{\an1}Then you've mastered the
same jutsu as Jiraiya-sensei.

270
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,741
-Jiraiya.

271
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,211
{\an1}You called him sensei?

272
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,179
-That's right.

273
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,448
I also learned
jutsu from Jiraiya.

274
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:08,384
{\an1}He was once my master as well.

275
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,087
{\an1}And that makes us
sibling students.

276
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,922
Sharing the same
sensei, we ought

277
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,491
to be able to
understand each other.

278
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:17,493
{\an1}Our master desired peace.

279
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:22,466
{\an1}-Just shut the hell up, already!

280
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,534
-What a massive
amount of chakra.

281
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,436
{\an1}Did you teach him, that, Pa?

282
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,337
-No.

283
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,673
{\an1}First time I'm seeing it, too.

284
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,609
{\an1}He never did that
during our training.

285
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:35,746
{\an1}I wonder what Naruto-boy's
planning to do now.

286
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,581
{\an1}-What's that jutsu?

287
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:38,949
{\an1}-What's happening?

288
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:41,351
-Naruto's chakra
is forming a-- I

289
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,354
{\an1}think it looks almost
like a shuriken.

290
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:46,491
{\an1}-Wind Style Rasen Shuriken?

291
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:47,791
{\an1}Naruto, what're--

292
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:52,163
{\an1}-Everything you've done
here, all this destruction,

293
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:55,733
what part of all
that is peaceful?

294
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,070
{\an1}-You simply cannot see
the forest for the trees.

295
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,873
{\an1}You're not able to comprehend
the true meaning of peace

296
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:04,375
{\an1}or what I'm trying
to accomplish.

297
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,811
{\an1}Just let yourself be captured.

298
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,814
{\an1}Surrender, and your
death will lead to peace.

shut the hell up!

306
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:01,330
{\an1}It's going to be dangerous,
but merging with him

307
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:02,498
{\an1}is our only chance now.

us from merging.

what're we going to do?

Naruto-boy's

{\an1}come up with his own unique
solution to this problem.

you'd master Wind Style?

00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:33,997
-Ah, I was just
thinking out loud.

321
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,066
{\an1}-Yeah, who woulda
guessed just back then

322
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,569
{\an1}you'd end up being so strong.

323
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:38,503
[gulp]

324
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:39,437
-Huh?

325
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,306
{\an1}-Wind Style, huh?

326
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:44,275
{\an1}-It does have a pretty nice ring
to it, don't you think, Naruto?

327
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,276
-All right!

328
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,046
{\an1}I am absolutely gonna
master this one.

329
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,881
-Yeah, right.

330
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,181
{\an1}You can't even clone yourself.

331
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,717
{\an1}-Just shut your mouth!

332
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,084
You--

333
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:57,456
{\an1}--[laughing] Actually, I can
kinda use Wind Style right now.

334
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,090
{\an1}Check it out, guys.

335
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,661

[vacuuming]

338
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:08,734
-See?

339
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,469
-Ahhh!

340
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:14,073
{\an1}Come on, what kind of
lame Wind Style is that?

341
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,242
Even I could do
something like that.

342
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,076
Here goes.

343
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,645
Wind Style Fart!

344
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:20,145
-You idiot!

345
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:21,348
-Aah!

346
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:22,549
CROW: Idiot.

347
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:23,450
Idiot.

348
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,252
You're an idiot.
