1
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,205
{\an1}There we go.

2
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:18,746
{\an1}Right.

3
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:24,522
{\an1}Storage is now complete!
I'll be returning Naruto-boy
to the Hidden Leaf.

4
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:27,559
{\an1}And then we'll have to
find the octopus.

5
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:37,075
{\an4}<i>The time has come! Just</i>
<i>like Giant Gramps Sage</i>
<i>prophesied. I'm going</i>
<i>to go look for an octopus</i>

6
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:40,045
{\an1}<i>and train to control the</i>
<i>Nine-Tails' power. </i>

7
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:44,018
{\an1}<i>And meet Sasuke once</i>
<i>again.</i>

8
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,326
Naruto, are
you--oof!

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,163
Now, my young
one, time to go!

10
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:39,659
{\an1}"The Young Man and the
Sea"

11
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,331
{\an1}Whoa! Check it out,
it's the ocean!

12
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,270
{\an1}Yeah! Nothin' like
the salt air.

13
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:49,508
{\an1}This is the Land of
Fire's one and only
port.

14
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,481
{\an1}<i>From here, we depart for</i>
<i>the Hidden Cloud Village</i>
<i>in the Land of Lightning.</i>

15
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:57,853
{\an7}So uhh... What's this
top secret mission that
Granny Tsunade was
talking about?

16
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,859
It's called a top secret
mission because it's
secret, Naruto.

17
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:06,200
{\an7}Aw, come on! What's the
big deal-you can tell me!
I won't blab, I promise!

18
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,136
You'll be filled in
later.

19
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,405
{\an1}Boo.

20
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,946
{\an7}<i>Oh, boy. I guess</i>
<i>Yamato hasn't come up</i>
<i>with a good cover story</i>
<i>yet.</i>

21
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:26,230
{\an4}Lady Tsunade? Why did
you assign Naruto an
S-rank mission at such
a critical time?

22
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:30,236
{\an4}And as if that weren't
risky enough, you sent
him to the Land of
Lightning by Sea!

23
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,238
Oink.

24
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,710
{\an1}Yes. But with the
Akatsuki still aiming
for him...

25
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:38,516
{\an7}I decided a long and
arduous voyage at sea,

26
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,522
{\an7}would be just the
thing to throw his
pursuers off the
scent.

27
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,960
{\an4}And then to the Hidden
Cloud Village in the Land
of Lightning. What will
he be doing there?

28
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,932
{\an1}I'll leave that up to
the Raikage to decide.

29
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,813
{\an1}Wow!!!

30
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,684
{\an1}That's a first rate
ship you lined up for us!

31
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,492
{\an5}Actually... The ship
the Hidden Leaf arranged
for us is the next one
over.

32
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,895
{\an1}Yeah, it's the smaller
one over there.

33
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:10,796
{\an1}Huh?

34
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,714
Aww...
that tub?

35
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:27,121
{\an4}Well, we are on a top
secret mission. A big
ship would attract
attention, right?

36
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:30,627
{\an1}This one'll be perfect
for our trip to the
island. More low key.

37
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,132
{\an4}Doesn't look like
there's anyone on
board. When's the
crew showin' up?

38
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,971
About that... They
refused to set sail
into the open sea.

39
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:42,612
{\an4}What?? Why the heck
did they say that? You
didn't try to low ball
them, did ya?!

40
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,015
No, it's not that...

41
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:46,117
Well...

42
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,520
{\an1}Go on, tell me. I
won't get upset.

43
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,993
'Kay... they said
something about a
huge monster?

44
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:55,265
A creature attacking
anything that attempts
to set sail.

45
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,468
A monster?

46
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,816
{\an1}<i>Aw, man. Looks like</i>
<i>I drew the short</i>
<i>straw on this one.</i>

47
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,225
{\an5}Don't know what we'll
run into, but whatever
it is, I'm gonna crush
it into bits.

48
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:16,397
<i>Hahahaha! </i>

49
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,434
I don't think Guy
should be making any
promises,

50
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:22,071
we don't even know
what kind of monster
we're dealing with yet.

51
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,276
{\an1}Ah Guy-Sensei'll be
fine. Look at him!

52
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,047
{\an1}<i>He's already warming up</i>
<i>he's so pumped!</i>

53
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,250
{\an8}[groaning]

54
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:32,253
{\an1}Guy, you sure you're
doing alright?

55
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,890
{\an8}Wh-what are you kidding,
this is nothing.

56
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:37,895
{\an8}I just didn't know the
boat was going to sway
so much.

57
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:41,400
{\an8}My stomach's a little
off, but I assure you
it's only temporary.

58
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,272
{\an1}How are you supposed to
crush a monster in that
condition?

59
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:49,012
{\an8}Please! I may not look
it, but when the time
comes-- [heaving]

60
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,156
Well, we're in the
open sea, now.

61
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,327
{\an7}[gagging]
I--I don't
see anything.

62
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,768
{\an4}Damn monster! It must
have spotted the Leaf's
Burning Hurricane and
turned tail!

63
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:07,841
[gasping]

64
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,183
{\an1}Muh-muh-monster!!

65
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,053
{\an1}Hold on, is that a
sword?!

66
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,323
{\an1}Some type of Summoning
Animal?

67
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:21,528
{\an1}How though? I don't
sense a jutsu user
nearby...

68
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,298
{\an1}<i>Could it be a Wild</i>
<i>Summoning Animal?</i>

69
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,169
It's doubling back!
Get clear!

70
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:28,471
{\an1}Not enough time!

71
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,318
[gasping]

72
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:47,500
You stay back, Aoba!
I'll stop it!

73
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,570
{\an1}Guy! behind you!

74
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:50,405
{\an1}What?!

75
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:54,010
Awwwwoooooooo!

76
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,693
[gasping]

77
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:06,296
{\an1}Huh?

78
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:11,938
{\an1}I'm not gonna make it!

79
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:20,550
{\an1}I gotcha!! You damned
monster!

80
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:23,722
Huh?

81
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,398
Ahhhhh!

82
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,006
{\an1}That was a pretty
reckless move ya pulled
there!

83
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,915
{\an8}My name's Yusuke. Thanks
for the help. Who are you
and how the hell are you
standing on the ocean?!

84
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,752
{\an1}Well, I'm Naruto, a
Ninja from the Hidden
Leaf Village.

85
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,822
{\an1}Now, why don't you
leave the rest to me?

86
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,165
Uh? Huh?

87
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,770
{\an1}Ah! I can't make
signs like this!

88
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:00,745
{\an1}Aaaaaahhhhh!

89
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:03,015
{\an1}Wood Style! Giant
Forest!

90
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,687
[grunting]

91
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:12,529
{\an1}It's gonna pull you
in! Release the jutsu!

92
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:14,933
{\an1}Quickly now Naruto, take
him and go!

93
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,871
{\an1}Scattering Crow Jutsu!

94
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:52,154
{\an1}I don't get it. Why
would there be a summoning
animal in a spot like that?

95
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:56,295
{\an4}Hard to say. It could be
it survived the Third
Great Ninja War, I
guess.

96
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,967
{\an1}Well at least now we know
why everyone working this
port is so scared.

97
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:06,577
{\an1}That thing has been
living around these parts
for about 15 years now.

98
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,246
I see.

99
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,121
{\an4}Normally when its ninja
summoner has fallen, an
animal will return to its
own world.

100
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,891
{\an1}So what's the deal
then, why is this one
acting up?

101
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:21,900
{\an4}Maybe it doesn't know
that its war has ended,
following its orders even
after its summoner is gone.

102
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,869
{\an3}Yeah.

103
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,908
{\an1}Your ninja wars have
never been anything
but a nuisance.

104
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,481
{\an4}Because of that damned
monstrosity, every coward
in town refuses to go to
sea anymore.

105
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:36,556
{\an4}They're not cowards,
they're being smart. What
were you thinking doing
something so dangerous?

106
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,527
A fisherman's job
is to catch fish.

107
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,434
{\an1}I thought I was gonna get
rid of him once and for all.
Only to have you interfere.

108
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,439
{\an1}If I hadn't interfered,
you'd be fish food by now.

109
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,874
{\an1}Hmph.

110
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:55,350
{\an7}Seriously, just leave
that thing to us. It
was reckless of you
to get involved.

111
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:59,124
{\an1}Shut up already. If
anyone beats that thing,
it's gonna be me!

112
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,357
Mm.

113
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,263
{\an1}I'm not asking for all
that much.

114
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:08,571
{\an7}If I only had a sturdier
boat that could withstand
that stupid marlin's body
blows,

115
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,272
{\an7}I might have
a chance.

116
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:15,148
{\an7}And I could probably use
an internal-combustion
engine too, to match that
thing's power.

117
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,755
{\an4}And maybe some sort of
super strong fishing rod
with a good lure that
won't snap on me!

118
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:21,891
Actually, that's
asking a lot.

119
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,160
{\an1}Hmph!

120
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:26,531
Tell me. How come you're
so determined to get that
marlin?

121
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,490
{\an1}Is that your dad?

122
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:49,399
I'm dead serious about
fighting that fish. Anyone
who'd give in so easily...

123
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,137
{\an1}... Is no real
father or son!

124
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,172
[grunting]

125
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,375
[gasping]

126
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,998
{\an1}Captain Yamato, isn't
there anything we can
do?!

127
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,634
Like what?

128
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:16,707
{\an7}I dunno, like lending the
guy a hand? Yusuke should
be able to avenge his dad!

129
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,711
{\an8}Come on! We can't
just stand by and
do nothing!

130
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:22,348
You're in the middle of
an S-rank mission, Naruto--

131
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,389
{\an1}The boy's passion has
moved me to tears,
Yamato!

132
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:32,264
{\an4}Let's give this fellah
a helping hand! Come
on, man, if you will,
so will I!!

133
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:36,670
{\an4}As long as that
monster's out there, we
can't set sail. Kinda
have to deal with it.

134
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:41,678
{\an5}Ya see? Anyway, if that
Marlin's a summoning
animal, then shinobi
like us are to blame

135
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,215
for all that poor
guy's misfortune.

136
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:49,156
{\an4}Mm-hmm. And as far as
we can tell, that creature
isn't here because it wants
to be.

137
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,694
All right. All right,
you guys have convinced
me. [chuckling]

138
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,468
{\an1}All right!

139
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,264
{\an3}Huh?

140
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:26,913
{\an1}<i>Yusuke! </i>

141
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,917
{\an1}We got ya a
fishin' rod, too!

142
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,189
{\an1}Naruto...

143
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,430
{\an4}What do you think? I
designed everything with
that wish list you
rattled off.

144
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:55,522
{\an1}No quarrel with the boat
or the rod, but there's
no motor.

145
00:12:55,556 --> 00:13:00,030
{\an4}Without internal
combustion that can match
the marlin's power, all
this is useless.

146
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:03,501
{\an1}Don't worry! You can leave
that to me! You want power?

147
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:08,009
The Noble Blue Beast
got you covered! I've
got energy to spare!

148
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:09,778
{\an1}So what do you say?!

149
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:16,389
{\an4}Hmph. I can't believe
you people. You couldn't
mind your own business
if you tried,

150
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,860
{\an1}could you? You're taking
all the thrill out of
the fight!

151
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,764
{\an1}Man, that guy
sure is stubborn.

152
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:57,249
{\an1}Heads up, giant marlin
spotted 30 degrees to
starboard!

153
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,454
{\an1}Hey, pull the ship
around in front of him!

154
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:01,155
{\an1}Roger that, on the
double!

155
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,327
Stroke! Stroke!
Stroke!

156
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:12,806
Okay, we're
ahead of it!

157
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,076
{\an1}All right, I'm going to
release the lure.

158
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,550
Hey! What is that?!

159
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:22,454
{\an1}It's a special lure I
built for our oversized
prey.

160
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:25,292
That's not what I meant.
Why's it have to look
like me?!

161
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,430
{\an1}Come on. A showboat
like you will make
for the perfect bait!

162
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,836
{\an1}Nooo! I'm gonna get
eaten!

163
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,129
{\an1}Pick up the pace!

164
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,134
{\an1}We have to make it think
this lure is nice and
fresh!

165
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,370
{\an7}I'm on it!

166
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:57,274
{\an7}Eight Inner Gates! Second
Gate of Rest!

167
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:00,711
[grunting]

168
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,465
{\an1}Faster, Bushier
Brow, Sensei!

169
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,804
{\an7}Fourth Gate, Gate of
Pain, Fifth Gate, Gate
of Closing, Open!

170
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:22,812
{\an1}Open! Open! Open!
Open! Open! Open!
Open! Open! Open!

171
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:28,154
{\an1}Come on... come on...
Come on!

172
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:34,463
{\an1}Huhh?!

173
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,599
Bullseye!

174
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:37,901
{\an1}Well, it looks like my
bait did the trick,
doesn't it?!

175
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:38,704
{\an1}Huh?!

176
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,179
{\an7}<i>That hurts</i>
<i>my heart.</i>

177
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,723
{\an1}Yusuke, come on,
we have to reel
it in!

178
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:55,027
What're you, stupid?
If we do that, the
line'll just snap!

179
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,565
We'll let it play and
wait until it tires out.

180
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,108
{\an1}At this rate, we're
gonna run out of line!

181
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:08,848
{\an5}I know that. I'm gonna
let it pull the boat. You
think you can keep up
with it?!

182
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:15,058
{\an7}Nothing on earth is
impossible for me!
Aaauuhhhh!!!!

183
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:24,138
{\an4}You don't need to row
anymore. Just follow
his lead and steer the
boat now, okay?

184
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,979
{\an1}Gladly. I think I had
just about reached my
limit.

185
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,791
{\an1}Yeah, keep going. Use
up all that strength
of yours.

186
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:46,104
{\an4}It's got amazing
stamina, keeping this
pace up. I can't believe
how fast it is.

187
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:51,212
{\an8}But it will eventually
use up all its energy to
resist. That's when the
real fight begins.

188
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:13,380
This is it! It's
finally showing signs
of exhaustion.

189
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:15,915
[grunting]

190
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,252
{\an1}Yusuke, you okay?

191
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,859
{\an5}Stay outta my way! I
don't need your help!
This fight is between
him and me!

192
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,395
{\an1}Don't worry,
I know that.

193
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:30,037
{\an7}<i>Here we go. This</i>
<i>time. This time</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

194
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:40,052
[grunting]

195
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,791
{\an1}Maybe it's time for
us to step in.

196
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,928
No, don't help him!

197
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:50,168
{\an4}Yusuke's gonna avenge
his father with his own
two hands! We can't take
that away from him!

198
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,937
Oh, dear.

199
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,140
{\an1}Guess we have no
choice. You heard
the man.

200
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,312
[grunting]

201
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,011
{\an1}All right, a
little more...

202
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,949
{\an1}Give it up you damn fish!

203
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:23,051
Ugh!

204
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,054
{\an1}He still has so much
strength!

205
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,927
[struggling]

206
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,098
{\an1}Not good!

207
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:33,032
[gasping]

208
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,134
{\an1}Yusuke!

209
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:38,407
{\an1}Damnnn yooooouuuuu!!!

210
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,108
Heh.

211
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,449
[grunting]

212
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:10,222
[panting]

213
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,357
{\an1}You finally did it,
Yusuke. You avenged
your dad.

214
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,460
{\an1}Yeah.

215
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:39,466
{\an4}I still don't get it,
though. Why hasn't the
animal returned to its
home already?

216
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,888
{\an1}Mmm.

217
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:02,034
{\an1}Easy there. I'll get it
out.

218
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:13,885
{\an1}This is--

219
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,389
{\an1}A Demon Wind Shuriken
from the Leaf.

220
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,258
{\an1}Well, I guess there's
no question, then.

221
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,597
{\an4}Looks like it was
a victim of the Third
Great Ninja War after
all.

222
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,136
{\an1}If it's possible,
we'd like to send
the beast home.

223
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:29,676
{\an5}Yeah sure, whatever you
want. As far as I'm
concerned, our feud was
settled today.

224
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,047
No grudges on my end.

225
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:00,804
{\an8}I can't take it
anymore! Get me
off this ship!

226
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,374
{\an1}<i>Get a hold of</i>
<i>yourself.</i>

227
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,378
{\an1}<i>But these waves are</i>
<i>rather hard to take!</i>

228
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,346
{\an1}<i>Then what do we do? </i>

229
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,850
<i>Get me off!</i>
<i>Please!</i>

230
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:12,088
{\an1}<i>It's a little out off</i>
<i>our way, but there should</i>
<i>be an island up ahead!</i>

231
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:16,762
{\an1}<i>That's it, we'll stop</i>
<i>there! Set a course,</i>
<i>North by Northeast!</i>

232
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,566
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden, The Ninja</i>
<i>of Benisu!</i>

233
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,538
{\an7}<i>Naruto? What are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>
