00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,602
{\an1}<i>(Gengo) The minute that Sasuke</i>
<i>returned to the village...</i>

2
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,037
{\an1}<i>people stopped paying attention</i>
<i>to you.</i>

3
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:19,209
{\an1}That doesn't matter. Do you
believe something like that
would bother me?

4
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:23,012
{\an1}<i>(Gengo) You might consider</i>
<i>yourself a member of Team 7...</i>

5
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:26,450
{\an1}<i>but I wonder if they think the</i>
<i>same of you.</i>

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:31,622
{\an1}I won't fall for your cheap
attempts to convince me. I'm...

7
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:33,658
Uh?

8
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:31,286
{\an1}<i>(Ro) Look there. That must be</i>
<i>the inn where Lord Sai stopped.</i>

9
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:34,790
{\an1}That's right. And now, look
slightly above it.

10
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,996
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) That's the only</i>
<i>checkpoint leading into the</i>
<i>village of Tobari.</i>

11
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,433
{\an1}Unless we're able to find a
way past it, we can't get into
the village.

12
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:46,837
Hmm?

13
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:51,908
{\an1}Yeah, but still, are you sure
this get-up is, like, really
necessary?

14
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,578
{\an1}It looks very becoming on you,
Soku.

15
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,545
[sighs]

16
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,582
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Look, I had to bend</i>
<i>over backwards...</i>

17
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,419
{\an1}<i>to get a coal vendor's traveling</i>
<i>permit for this disguise.</i>

18
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:06,357
{\an1}<i>If you have any better ideas</i>
<i>about how to get past the</i>
<i>checkpoint, let me know!</i>

19
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:11,930
{\an1}Rest assured. We will surely be
able to deceive the enemy's eyes
with this ruse.

20
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:16,201
{\an1}If we just kill the lookouts,
it'll be, like, easy to get past
the checkpoint!

21
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:19,939
{\an1}If we were to do that and the
Leaf's involvement were
discovered...

22
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,240
{\an1}it would mean big trouble.

23
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,679
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Besides, we think</i>
<i>that Sai's entire team was taken</i>
<i>down around here. </i>

24
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,347
{\an1}<i>Don't underestimate the enemy.</i>

25
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,451
{\an1}<i>(Soku) If we stay too long,</i>
<i>we'll just like, increase the</i>
<i>chances of the enemy finding us.</i>

26
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,022
All right, listen
up, both of you.

27
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,090
Hmm?

28
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,024
Huh?

29
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,193
{\an1}[clearing throat]

30
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:46,168
{\an1}I think especially now, on
this mission, it's crucial that
all of us trust each other.

31
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,970
{\an1}And trust really first begins,
I'd say...

32
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:52,207
{\an1}when teammates are
genuinely able to believe in
their comrades.

33
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,877
{\an1}Did you get that out of, like,
some weird book?

34
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:58,748
{\an1}I think Lord Shikamaru is simply
trying to do his utmost...

35
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,316
{\an1}to behave like a good leader
should.

36
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,854
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Quit trying to</i>
<i>analyze me! [groans] Forget it. </i>

37
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:06,222
{\an1}<i>The point is that this mission</i>
<i>requires teamwork.</i>

38
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,125
Uh.

39
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,960
What're you doing?

40
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,495
{\an1}Like, take a good look.

41
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
Silence Shinobi?

42
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:18,335
[grunts]

43
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:19,804
Soku! [grunts]

44
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,142
{\an1}Don't take action by yourself!

45
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,878
{\an1}I'm like, better at this
sort of thing alone! [grunts]

46
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,479
[grunts]]

47
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:39,760
I got him!

48
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,096
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) [sighs] Oh, great.</i>

49
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,800
{\an1}You just ruined our disguise!

50
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,871
{\an1}This situation's taken a
problematic turn.

51
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,242
{\an1}Aw man, guess we're back to
square one for our strategy.

52
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:05,454
[chatting]

53
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,204
What can I get you?

54
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,239
{\an1}Could I just have
some water, please?

55
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:25,743
{\an1}Sure. Help yourself.

56
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:26,442
{\an1}Hmm?

57
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,080
Well, anyway.

58
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,886
{\an1}I heard that the checkpoint
to get into Tobari is right
around here somewhere.

59
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,921
Is that true?

60
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:38,256
{\an1}I've got nothing to
say to outsiders.

61
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:41,059
Hmm?

62
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:45,164
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) The "demon killer,"</i>
<i>huh?</i>

63
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,468
{\an1}<i>(Merchant) Oh! You know the</i>
<i>game, do you?</i>

64
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,605
{\an1}I do. Mind if I play?

65
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,144
{\an1}<i>(Merchant) What good luck,</i>
<i>finding an opponent in these</i>
<i>remote parts! </i>

66
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,279
{\an1}<i>You're a welcome sight</i>
<i>indeed!</i>

67
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,949
{\an1}So does that mean you're
traveling alone?

68
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,954
{\an1}I've come here to Tobari
because I need to hire a
shinobi.

69
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:09,724
But they're busy
checking into my background
and what not.

70
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,593
{\an1}So, I've had to wait here.

71
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,528
{\an1}Village of Tobari, huh?

72
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,664
{\an1}I've actually been hoping that I
could do some business there
myself.

73
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:20,102
{\an1}Well, be warned, going in and
out of there is a real hassle.

74
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,906
{\an1}<i>(Merchant) Unless you have this</i>
<i>pass, it's practically</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

75
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:27,476
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Ah, you got me!</i>

76
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,578
{\an1}Didn't expect that move!
[chuckles]

77
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,915
{\an1}<i>(Merchant) It was my only chance</i>
<i>to play that.</i>

78
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:33,884
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) By the way...</i>

79
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:37,120
{\an1}why did you end up choosing
the Land of Silence?

80
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:40,557
{\an1}There are other lands that would
be able to accept shinobi
requests.

81
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,160
{\an1}Well, first of all, it's the
price.

82
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,596
{\an1}I don't care who does the work
itself...

83
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,400
{\an1}whether it's the Silence or the
Hidden Leaf or anyone for that
matter!

84
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,770
{\an1}<i>(Merchant) After all, shinobi</i>
<i>are dispensable.</i>

85
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,974
{\an1}They're merely tools you use
and then discard.

86
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:59,144
{\an1}[grunts] Please excuse me!

87
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,048
Huh?

88
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,417
{\an1}Are you trying to sabotage our
strategy?

89
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,454
{\an1}It's all because we let guys
like that say whatever they
want that...

90
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:10,623
{\an1}like, shinobi are always
looked down upon!

91
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:13,027
{\an1}Even so, that's no reason to
kill him.

92
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,963
{\an1}I only wanted to shake him up
a little bit, that's all!

93
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:19,366
{\an1}For all your talk, you're,
like, the one who doesn't
trust us!

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,404
{\an1}Then start acting with more
caution and discretion!

95
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:23,470
[grunts]

96
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,107
{\an1}There something you want to say?

97
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:31,713
{\an1}You bet there is! There's no way
I'm gonna mess up a mission by
being, like, overcautious!

98
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,883
{\an1}[groans] That girl.

99
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,354
{\an1}Do you think she's acting
unusually rash?

100
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:41,490
{\an1}It's my conviction, that perhaps
more than anyone else...

101
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:44,694
{\an1}Soku fears the peace that's
being established in the world.

102
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:48,332
{\an1}<i>(Ro) She worries it will spell</i>
<i>the end of shinobi.</i>

103
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:52,936
{\an1}I presume she's determined to
make this mission a success...

104
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,605
{\an1}to prove the value of shinobi
to the world.

105
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,044
{\an1}So much blood was shed to
achieve this peace, which
we've sought for so long.

106
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,081
{\an1}And frankly, it's ridiculous
that some people can't stomach
it.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,983
{\an1}<i>(Ro) Lord Shikamaru...</i>

in combat, don't you?

{\an1}The shinobi we left in the
ravine must've like, been
discovered.

to make a scene now.

125
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,237

supposed to do?

126

{\an1}Komori, we're looking to get
into the Village of Tobari.

142
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:35,848
{\an1}Do you know of any way to get
past the checkpoint?

143
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:41,121
{\an1}That's gonna be a tough one. But
why do you even want to go
there, anyway?

144
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,056
{\an1}We just have some business
there.

145
00:09:43,523 --> 00:09:45,526
{\an1}Shh! Someone's here!

146
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,036
[squeaking]

147
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:59,207
{\an1}Oh, man, it's just a mouse!
Don't scare me like that!

148
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:05,914
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Hey! Hold on!</i>

149
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:09,918
{\an1}What don't you understand about
waiting until we can find a way
to get through the checkpoint?

150
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:14,023
{\an1}Like, if we take too much
time, we could lose our chance
to kill Gengo!

151
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:16,593
{\an1}But it's too dangerous
for you to go alone.

152
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,928
{\an1}You're absolutely not to act
on your own!

153
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,900
{\an1}Look, the only thing that I
wanna do is, like, prove my
abilities!

154
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,971
{\an1}And I refuse to be held back by
some stupid rules!

155
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:31,208
{\an1}Enough, Soku, grow up! This
isn't some kind of game that
we're playing here, you know!

156
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,810
What a drag.

157
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:33,978
What's that?

158
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,216
{\an1}Sometimes I think that I'd
have more freedom if I lived
in the Land of Silence.

159
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,819
{\an1}You mustn't make such reckless
statements.

160
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:46,024
{\an1}Wait a minute. You're not
getting any weird ideas about
deserting the Village, are you?

161
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,428
{\an1}'Cause that's a serious crime.

162
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:52,165
{\an1}Rogue Ninja are hunted to the
ends of the earth...

{\an1}and are always punished to the
furthest extent of shinobi law.

166

right, Soku?

take on a menial job like this
one.

177
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,710
{\an1}But still someday, I'm
gonna have a big inn of my

here.

{\an1}All I want is like, to
make my power be useful.

183
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,336
{\an1}So, you're a shinobi, then?

184
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,071
{\an1}Yeah, but it's a secret.

185
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:01,773
{\an1}Right, sure, I understand.

186
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,413
{\an1}Everyone in my village has
gotten used to peace and because
of that, they're too timid.

187
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,619
{\an1}So, like, at this rate, I
should've just gone to the
Land of Silence.

188
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:15,689
{\an1}But surely you're not really
thinking of deserting your
village, right?

189
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,824
{\an1}I mean, isn't that
a serious crime?

getting back.

193
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:28,970
{\an1}Okay.

195

{\an1}You really don't have to do
this, you know.

196
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:40,349
{\an1}Eh, I'm used to getting yelled
at around here. So, I'm
really good at apologizing!

about deserting the village...

201
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:54,831
{\an1}then we're just going to have to

don't mind if we, like, fight
it out, right here and now.

282
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,662
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) There you are, Soku!</i>

283
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:03,135
{\an1}[grunts] So, Komori, you were
pulling the strings this whole
time, huh?

284
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:08,141
{\an1}I gotta say, you guys are
pretty quick. But still, take a
good look around.

285
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:10,577
{\an1}<i>(Komori) There's no way you can</i>

286
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:16,450
{\an1}Listen, you understand
the gravity of this, right?
Deserting's a serious crime.

287
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:19,520
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Hand her over to us</i>

288
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:22,289
{\an1}You interfere, and
I won't hold back!

289
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:26,695
{\an1}What's it gonna be? Will you
turn her over?

290
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:28,430
[chuckles]

291
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,164
How interesting.

292
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:35,136
{\an1}This is your chance to prove
what you told us. Show us
you're serious!

{\an1}I'll help you, Soku!

298
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,620
{\an1}I don't need your help! This
is my problem to take care of!

[grunts]

300
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,193
{\an1}Lord Shikamaru, I implore
you! Think this over!

301
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:59,998
{\an1}Soku has her reasons for doing
this. Don't be reckless!

302
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,066
{\an1}Are you going to
betray me now, too?

303
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,868
Uh, you misunderstand!

304
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,006
{\an1}[grunts] I'll just have to take
care of you first!

{\an1}The two of you, working
together? [gasps]

308

[grunting]

309
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:27,761
Soku.

310
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:29,562
How could you?

311
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:35,636

{\an1}<i>(Silence Captain) Nicely done!</i>

317
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,196
I don't sense any
chakra. He's dead.

318
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,901
{\an1}You did it, Soku!

319
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:08,038
{\an1}I think that you'll be very
useful to us. Come!

320
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:22,754
{\an1}All right! That's it! You're
pretty much one of us now.

321
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:26,624
{\an1}I mean, you'll have to go
through some rounds of
questioning and stuff...

322
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,460
{\an1}but you'll be released soon.

323
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:32,965
{\an1}In exchange for the intel
you have, you'll be- [grunts]

324
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:38,404
{\an1}Like, I'm gonna need you to
go to sleep for a little while.

325
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:52,887
{\an1}[grunting] Damn it, that was
tougher than I expected it to
be!

326
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,288
{\an1}I thought it went quite well.

327
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:59,460
{\an1}I know that Soku said that she'd
make it appear that we'd died
when she attacked us.

328
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:01,429
{\an1}But still, that hurt a lot.

329
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:04,133
We owe that boy a
debt of thanks, too.

330
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,502
{\an1}Oh man, it's just a mouse!

331
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:11,507
{\an1}<i>(Ro) At that time, I used my</i>
<i>chakra abilities to fake the</i>
<i>presence of a shinobi.</i>

332
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,211
{\an1}Yeah, and his unexpected
reaction was our lucky break.

333
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:18,515
{\an1}An ordinary kid wouldn't have
responded to chakra like that.

334
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,652
{\an1}And then he performed exactly
as we predicted he would.

335
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:26,023
{\an1}<i>(Ro) But what Soku was</i>
<i>bemoaning.</i>

336
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:28,826
{\an1}She truly meant half of what
she said...

337
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:32,030
{\an1}Perhaps you weren't aware of
the extent of the risk.

338
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,232
{\an1}If she'd actually been serious
about fighting us...

339
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,002
{\an1}she could've killed us both
any time she wanted.

340
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,571
{\an1}You know, the thing about
trust is...

341
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:43,909
{\an1}you have to believe in your
comrades first, just like I
told you guys before.

342
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,112
{\an1}<i>(Ro) As I expected of you.</i>

343
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,182
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) [chuckles] Don't</i>

344
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,983
{\an1}I like, heard everything.

[gasps]

346
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,887
{\an1}Your logic's, like, totally
naïve, Shikamaru.

347
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:59,325
{\an1}What are you talking about?
Don't tell me you actually
meant to hurt me back there?

348
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,129
{\an1}If you want, I can,
like, try it again.

349
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:05,833
{\an1}Uh well, maybe some other
time.

350
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,803
{\an1}Anyway, how'd it go?

351
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,941
{\an1}<i>(Soku) I kept the lock open. As</i>

352
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,676
Just perfect.

353
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,110
Hmm.

{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Did you hear</i>
