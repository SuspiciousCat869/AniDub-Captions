1
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:45,508
{\an1}All right,
the coast is clear.

2
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:54,749
{\an7}<i>That ended up being a</i>
<i>good plan for something I</i>
<i>came up with on the fly!</i>

3
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:05,393
[pain]
Huaaggh!!

4
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:17,705
Whoa!

5
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:23,478
[gasp]

6
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:28,649
[panting]

7
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,191
{\an1}[Eight-Tails]
What are you talking about?!

8
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:40,728
That so-called good
plan of yours cost me
several of my limbs!

9
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:43,230
{\an1}Now, now, don't get
mad my boy Eight-o.

10
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,934
{\an1}Ya know they'll regrow,
and ya know that I was
right-o. Yo!

11
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:52,940
{\an1}Will you stop that annoying
rapping when you're around me?
You're horrible!

12
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,077
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

13
00:01:57,278 --> 00:02:00,381
{\an1}Since I'm the one who owns ya
I knows best of all, ha!

14
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:01,515
Feel me? Yeah!

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,554
{\an1}This time I
think I'll try--

16
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,689
You'll try what?
Another half
baked idea?!

17
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:18,599
I'll sing enka!
Yeeaah! Yeah!

18
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,237
{\an1}'Least now I can finally
get out from under my
brother's bossy thumb,

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,507
{\an1}and get out of the
village for a bit.
Freedom, man!

20
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:31,911
{\an1}Since as far as everyone
knows, the Akatsuki still
has me in their grasp.

21
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:36,549
{\an4}I bet the Raikage's
on a rampage.
You sure this is
a good idea?

22
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:42,689
{\an4}I've practically been imprisoned
in this village 'cause as a
Jinchuriki, I'm basically just
a glorified weapon.

23
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:45,458
{\an1}I need a little breather
every once in a while.

24
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,760
{\an1}So? What are you
planning to do?

25
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:52,130
{\an1}For enka, Kin-chan
Sensei's the man!

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,533
<i>Who's that?</i>

27
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,567
Hm?

28
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,539
{\an1}Blaze da name into ya brain,
ya fool. He's the King of
Enka Ninja, and he's so cool!

29
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:04,509
{\an1}How can you be so flippant?
The Akatsuki won't sit
still for long.

30
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,114
{\an5}And besides that,
because you summoned me,
you don't have much
stamina left.

31
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:14,119
{\an1}Did you really have to call
on me when you already had
the upper hand in that fight?

32
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,089
{\an1}<i>Well, to tell you the truth,</i>

33
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,694
{\an4}<i>that Sharingan dude's</i>
<i>probably the toughest</i>
<i>enemy that I've ever had</i>
<i>to face in battle before.</i>

34
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:24,929
I guess that I just
got carried away.

35
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,800
You know, Times may
be a-changing soon.

36
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,704
{\an1}Huh?! You mean through my enka?

37
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,716
{\an1}There's absolutely no
trace left of him.

38
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:48,152
Transportation Jutsu.
It's really quite
troublesome.

39
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,825
Kakashi Sensei.
all that stuff
he told us...

40
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,496
Just be careful.
Take it with a
grain of salt.

41
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,731
But if what he
said is true,
then Sasuke is--

42
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:01,532
Naruto.

43
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:07,471
{\an1}I know how you feel,
but be patient.

44
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:13,577
{\an4}For now, we need to keep
what Madara said in
complete confidence
between the three of us.

45
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,546
{\an1}It must stay secret.

46
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:20,950
{\an4}<i>We're in the middle of</i>
<i>rebuilding the Village</i>
<i>and can't afford any more</i>
<i>chaos and confusion.</i>

47
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:26,022
{\an1}<i>Besides, until we check the</i>
<i>facts, we can't trust Madara.</i>

48
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,358
{\an1}<i>There's too much we don't</i>
<i>know about his claim</i>

49
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:33,229
{\an4}<i>that the upper echelon of</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf Village</i>
<i>used Itachi to slaughter</i>
<i>the Uchiha clan.</i>

50
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,701
{\an1}<i>We need to keep this quiet.</i>
<i>zespecially you, Naruto. </i>

51
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:41,304
Yeah, I got it.

52
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:26,406
Power of the Five Kage

53
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,846
Susano'o...
Unreal.

54
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,849
{\an1}So that's the Uchiha's
Mangekyo Sharingan?

55
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:37,417
Sasuke.

56
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:42,189
{\an1}He always has something
else hidden up his sleeve.
Every time.

57
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,123
Heh.

58
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,327
Darui!
You Sand folk!
Get back!

59
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:50,697
[crack]

60
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:00,841
{\an7}<i>He's aiming for the pillars!</i>

61
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:02,742
The pillars!

62
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,210
{\an1}The ceiling's
gonna collapse!

63
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:10,082
Whoa!
Urgh!
Yaahh!

64
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,887
{\an1}Whoa! What the hell's he doing?!

65
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,743
Huh?!
Ahh!

66
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,056
[gasp]

67
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,895
{\an1}Have you pinpointed
Danzo's location?

68
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,663
Uh, yeah, but--

69
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,634
{\an1}Then take me there.

70
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:07,338
{\an1}But what about
Jugo and Suigetsu?

71
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,407
{\an1}Both of their
chakras are still--

72
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:13,011
Forget them.
Danzo comes first!

73
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,953
Hurry up and
take me to him.

74
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,521
Ah! Yeah,
all right.

75
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,658
{\an7}<i>What's happened to you, Sasuke?!</i>

76
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:50,981
{\an1}They survived, too.

77
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,186
{\an1}I guess I owe you one,
Lord Kazekage.

78
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:02,525
{\an1}Sasuke's gone.
Looks like he bolted
during the chaos.

79
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:07,064
{\an5}If it's this bad here,
who knows what might've
happened to all the
others at the summit.

80
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,741
{\an1}We're going after
Sasuke now!

81
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:21,043
Looks like he's
headed upstairs.

82
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,216
{\an7}<i>Naruto. What would</i>
<i>you have done?</i>

83
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:37,460
{\an7}<i>Thanks to the destruction,</i>
<i>I got free from that hatchet.</i>

84
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,061
{\an8}<i>But now...</i>

85
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,732
{\an7}<i>I wonder how Sasuke,</i>
<i>Karin and Jugo are doing.</i>

86
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,945
{\an1}Ah...
Nh...

87
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,557
{\an1}<i>I can... I can still make it.</i>

88
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:31,846
All right.

89
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:42,623
He's here.

90
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:57,303
Above us!

91
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:26,432
You're good.

92
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,370
Sasuke! Danzo bolted!

93
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:42,048
Lady Mizukage, Chojuro;
stay here! I'm gonna
go after Danzo!

94
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,549
{\an1}The Five Kage Summit
hasn't come to an end yet!

95
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,854
{\an1}Very well. But
don't go overboard!

96
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,057
{\an1}Ma'am, I'll leave the
Akatsuki criminals to you.

97
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:57,029
My back can't take this.
Feel free to rampage as
you please.

98
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,897
Sounds like a plan.

99
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,898
Karin!

100
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,100
{\an1}Come!

101
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:23,221
{\an7}<i>There it is!</i>
<i>Lady Mizukage's Kekkei Genkai!</i>
<i>The Lava Style jutsu!</i>

102
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,894
{\an1}You Akatsuki have trampled
all over the Hidden Mist,

103
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:31,495
{\an1}And manipulated the
Fourth Mizukage.

104
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,937
{\an1}And yet, when I look at you
closely, you Uchiha really
are quite handsome indeed.

105
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,008
Do not interfere.

106
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,944
[sigh]

107
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:49,747
{\an1}Too bad. Such a fine man.
What a waste.

108
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:56,654
{\an1}But at least I get to
give you a kiss that
will melt you away.

109
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,024
Ehhghe!

110
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,357
What?! A kiss?!

111
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,694
Who and what are you,
you witch ?!

112
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,996
And quit making
eyes at him,
you old bag!

113
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:10,000
{\an8}<i>Lady Mizukage</i>
<i>plans to fight!</i>

114
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,970
{\an8}<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I must protect her!</i>

115
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,439
{\an8}<i>But, this man</i>
<i>finished off Zabuza.</i>

116
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:19,409
{\an7}<i>Do I really have a chance at</i>
<i>all against someone like that?</i>

117
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:25,081
{\an7}<i>No, I can do this!</i>
<i>I'm going to try my best!</i>

118
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:28,252
{\an7}<i>Or at least... I hope I can...</i>

119
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,591
{\an4}Lord Tsuchikage,
if you're not going to
participate, then please
just keep your head down.

120
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,125
Hemph.

121
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,298
{\an8}<i>Not that move again!</i>

122
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,840
{\an4}Just keep my head down!?
The nerve of her!

123
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:54,443
Chojuro!

124
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:55,311
Yes, ma'am!

125
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,715
Hiramekarei, release!

126
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,431
[panting]

127
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,235
{\an7}<i>All my cells hurt.</i>

128
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:26,607
{\an7}<i>So this is the Susano'o's</i>
<i>side-effect, if you</i>
<i>use it continuously.</i>

129
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:31,179
{\an7}<i>I haven't even achieved</i>
<i>complete possession form.</i>

130
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:37,019
{\an7}<i>There's so much pain...</i>
<i>How bad was it for Itachi?</i>

131
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:38,287
[gasp]

132
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,225
{\an1}And now it's just
the two of us.

133
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:47,428
Nghh... Egh...

134
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:48,663
[gasp]

135
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,532
{\an8}<i>Is he really dead?</i>

136
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:54,435
{\an7}<i>I thought it was odd his</i>
<i>chakra flow stopped, but...</i>

137
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,971
{\an8}<i>you never can tell with</i>
<i>these Akatsuki guys.</i>

138
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,709
{\an1}That wall next to you,

139
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:06,513
{\an1}I sealed up that doorway
when I launched my first
attack against you earlier.

140
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:21,795
{\an1}This room is now
completely sealed off.

141
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,064
{\an1}There's nowhere to run.

142
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:28,802
{\an1}I can use three chakra natures:
Fire, Water and Earth.

143
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:32,440
{\an1}So I actuality possess
two Kekkei Genkai.

144
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,942
{\an7}<i>Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu. </i>

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,177
[gasp]

146
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,178
{\an8}<i>Where's Sasuke?!</i>

147
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,682
{\an7}<i>He's on the other</i>
<i>side of that wall!</i>

148
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,958
It's melting!

149
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,429
HAAA!

150
00:15:58,564 --> 00:15:59,399
Hurk!

151
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,234
Haugh!

152
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,770
{\an7}<i>Sasuke's chakra is weakening!</i>

153
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,072
{\an8}<i>He always pushes</i>
<i>himself too far!</i>

154
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:12,111
{\an4}<i>[Mizukage]</i>
<i>It seems you got roughed</i>
<i>up pretty badly by </i>
<i>Lord Raikage earlier.</i>

155
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:14,847
{\an1}<i>But I have no intention</i>
<i>of saving you.</i>

156
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:21,387
{\an4}I'll admit to you that it
does leave quite a pain
in my heart to see such a
handsome man melt away.

157
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,588
{\an1}But you must die.

158
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,562
{\an7}<i>Corrosive acid mist...</i>

159
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,267
Uh?

160
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:37,735
What's this?!

161
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:44,109
What?!
Auggh!

162
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:47,446
What is it?!

163
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,316
{\an8}<i>This chakra!</i>

164
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:54,352
{\an1}Wait... This is...

165
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,888
{\an1}the Akatsuki from before!

166
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,525
{\an7}<i>This is... that man's...</i>

167
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,229
{\an7}<i>I can't believe they didn't</i>
<i>notice my Sporulation Jutsu.</i>

168
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:09,067
{\an7}<i>The Five Kage are nothing</i>
<i>but a bunch of idiots.</i>

169
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,667
{\an7}<i>He's...</i>

170
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,372
{\an7}<i>...stealing my chakra.</i>

171
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:16,773
He's absorbing our
chakra to grow?!

172
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,476
{\an1}But when did he--?

173
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:23,281
{\an1}It's a Time-Lapse Jutsu
you set before the Raikage
took you down, isn't it?

174
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,550
Enough!

175
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,700
{\an7}<i>Damn it. What now?!</i>

176
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,872
{\an1}My chakra! It's regenerating!

177
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,541
{\an1}Come... on... get...
ooooffff!!

178
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:05,788
{\an7}<i>Sasuke! Are you all right?!</i>

179
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,558
[panting]

180
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:13,597
{\an1}The mist will spread to
where the others are.
I have to change the pH.

181
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,402
Seems she's having
trouble with him.

182
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:24,306
Akatsuchi, what say we
go join in the fun?

183
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,207
Sure!

184
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,209
Bleaggh!

185
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,023
Hah!

186
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:43,057
{\an7}<i>Earth Style:</i>
<i>Weighted Boulder Jutsu!</i>

187
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:57,573
Aaah!

188
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:00,875
{\an1}<i>Hah heh heh heh!</i>

189
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:05,046
{\an1}So you're the brat that
took down Deidara, huh?

190
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:09,784
{\an4}Well, I've got no
grudge against you,
But many shinobi
want you dead.

191
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,820
So goodbye.

192
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,792
{\an1}Particle Style:
Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

193
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:24,566
Sasuke!

194
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:36,777
{\an1}Sasuke's chakra is gone...
All gone!

195
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,481
No! It can't be! No!

196
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,917
Yes, that's right.

197
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:48,288
It's gone because I've
disassembled his body to
a near-molecular level.

198
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,091
{\an1}And you'll be next, girl.

199
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,333
Nngh! You-!

200
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,267
Huh?

201
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,404
{\an1}Where is Sasuke?!

202
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,673
Where is he?!

203
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,310
Kankuro.

204
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,378
Right.

205
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,553
(effort grunt)

206
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,754
Thanks. I really
appreciate it.

207
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,289
We're all in
your debt.

208
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,125
Tsuchikage!
Where is Sasuke?!

209
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,662
{\an1}I turned that brat into dust.

210
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,366
{\an1}How dare you!
I wanted to take him down!
You had no right--!

211
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,867
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>And you will still get</i>
<i>to have a go at it.</i>

212
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:40,206
{\an1}So quit whining, Raikage.

213
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,387
{\an1}My name is Madara Uchiha.

214
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:00,726
Sasuke!

215
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,563
{\an1}I am here to explain
something to you all.

216
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,668
{\an1}And once you understand it,
I'll ask you a question.

217
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:12,270
What is it?!

218
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,406
{\an1}It's about my plan.

219
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,876
{\an1}Project Tsuki no Me.

220
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:59,274
{\an1}<i>[Tsuchikage]</i>
<i>So that's what Project</i>
<i>Tsuki no Me is, huh?</i>

221
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:03,846
{\an4}<i>[Raikage]</i>
<i>You're insane!</i>
<i>I'm not just handing</i>
<i>the world over to you!</i>

{\an1}<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>Peace is only meaningful</i>

223
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,018
{\an1}<i>[Mizukage]</i>
<i>Otherwise, it's just an escape!</i>

224
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:14,356
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>Very well, then the time</i>
<i>for chatting is over.</i>
