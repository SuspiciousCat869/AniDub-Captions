Where could Sasuke be
going that he'd resort to
hurting you, as well?

33
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,067

really?

stop Sasuke from

46
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:49,478
{\an4}Also... if there are rumors
that he left the village, I want
to prevent them from spreading
further.

47
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:53,149
{\an5}So what I'm
going to do
is issue an
urgent lockdown order.

48
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,818
{\an1}Yes. That's
a good
idea.

49
00:04:56,387 --> 00:05:00,091
{\an4}To keep the
Uchiha's position from
worsening, we'll handle
this internally...

50
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,298
{\an4}...and what's more,
we have to bring

arrive?

now, all of

{\an1}What do you
mean, "all?"

84
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,194
{\an1}What about Sasuke?

85
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,605
{\an4}I'm glad you asked. It's because
of Sasuke that things have
become a bit of a drag. Right,
Sakura?

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,541
Uh... yeah...

87
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,478
Earlier, in the
hospital...

88
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,382
...I heard Kakashi
Sensei and Lord
Hokage and...

89
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:11,522
{\an1}Seems Sasuke... has
left the village.

90
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,225
Huh? He what?

91
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,426
{\an1}Sasuke did what?!

92
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,229
Why would he leave?

93
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,034
{\an1}He went to go search for
Orochimaru.

94
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,940
{\an1}I don't know the reason why, but
it seems he left the
village to get more power.

95
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:29,013
{\an1}Hold on. This Orochimaru, isn't
he one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Leaf?

96
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:35,790
{\an4}Yes. And furthermore, the rumor
is that he killed several
villagers for his unethical
experiments...

97
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,426
{\an1}...and ran away when he was
discovered.

98
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,497
{\an1}Why did Sasuke choose
someone like that?

99
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:47,137
{\an1}From what I hear, that guy is
still dangerous. What kind of
power is Sasuke seeking, anyway?

100
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,142
Oh, Naruto...

101
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:54,916
{\an1}<i>(NARUTO) This headband...</i>

102
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,221
{\an1}<i>(NARUTO) Sasuke was here.</i>

103
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:02,760
{\an1}The headband, which symbolizes
the Hidden Leaf.

104
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:08,568
{\an1}He left it here in the Academy
classroom, which holds so many
memories for all of us.

105
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:13,808
{\an1}So in other words, does that
mean Sasuke has abandoned us,
and the Leaf?

106
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,611
{\an1}No way I don't buy it!

107
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,915
{\an1}Okay sure, so he's been a little
bit irritable lately...

108
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:24,991
{\an4}And I'll admit that he's also
been short with me, and he said
some sarcastic things that
really made me mad!

109
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:25,759
But come on!

110
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:30,631
{\an1}He's still a, a Hidden Leaf!
Sasuke's still our friend!

111
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,200
Naruto...

112
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:37,808
{\an1}Orochimaru is gonna steal
Sasuke's body and use it as his
new vessel.

113
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:38,843
Huh?

114
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,614
{\an1}But Sasuke doesn't know that, of
course.

115
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,453
{\an1}What the hell's Sasuke thinking?
Why would he wanna do this?

116
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:54,165
{\an1}I'm gonna go and bring Sasuke
back! Before he finds
Orochimaru, I'll bring him home!

117
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:59,504
{\an1}Just wait a minute. We also have
to think about the position that
the Uchiha are in right now.

118
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:08,249
{\an4}We can't make a big deal out of
all this. And yet, we also can't
allow Naruto to go and handle
this on his own.

119
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,486
So I'll go with him!

120
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:12,456
Naruto!

121
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:15,060
{\an1}Yeah I know, Sakura, but don't
you worry!

122
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:18,898
{\an1}I'll bring Sasuke back, even if
I have to beat the hell out of
him!

123
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,120
(chuckling)

124
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:37,858
{\an1}You're looking at me and
Akamaru's secret tunnel.

125
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:42,998
{\an1}Sometimes we like to go outside
the village for fancy moonlight
picnics and stuff like that.

126
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:46,336
{\an1}What do you mean, picnics?
You're just taking him out for a
walk!

127
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:49,306
{\an1}Kiba, you know you're gonna
get caught one day.

128
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,011
{\an1}I wouldn't mess up like that!

129
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:57,317
{\an4}And besides, thanks to our
secret tunnel, you can get
outside the village now, so you
should be grateful.

130
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,588
Shikamaru, we'd better
hurry up and go.

131
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:01,724

{\an1}(sighs) Why did I think that you
would be like Itachi?

147
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:27,408
{\an1}It's too soon. You're
not ready yet.

148
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:34,152
{\an1}Itachi was able to master it
when he was about your age.

149
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,221
{\an8}<i>Damn it!</i>

150
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,593
(grunts)

151
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,932
Chidori Stream!

152
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:51,876
{\an1}(heavy breathing)

153
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:55,647
{\an7}<i>Three whole years...</i>

154
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,522
{\an1}(NINE TAILS) Roar!

155
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:05,594
{\an1}This feeling... what the
hell is it?

156
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:10,402
{\an7}<i>I can't let those three years</i>
<i>end, in the blink of an eye!</i>

157
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:17,011
{\an1}That Naruto Uzumaki, he seems to
have gained a lot of strength in
the past three years.

158
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,879
{\an8}<i>That loser!</i>

159
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:23,353
{\an7}<i>I'm going to obtain power, no</i>
<i>matter what it takes!</i>

160
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:40,576
<i>(KUSHINA) Minato!</i>

161
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,212
Kushina!

162
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:48,888
{\an4}Minato, listen! Even though you
issued the lockdown order,
Naruto has snuck out and run off
somewhere!

163
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,757
{\an1}And he hasn't come back yet!

164
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,894
{\an1}Well, uh, you're not actually
supposed to leave the house
either...

165
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:57,600
{\an1}It's not only Naruto, ya know.
Shikamaru's gone missing as
well.

166
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:58,734
What?

167
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:04,209
{\an1}Sakura and Ino were both still
at their houses, but something
didn't seem quite right...

168
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,545
{\an1}It's like they were trying
to hide something.

169
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,148
Hide something?

170
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,418
Hmm, like what if...

171
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,755
{\an1}...they saw Naruto being a
delinquent, going out every
night and being reckless...

172
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:18,662
{\an4}...but because they're so nice
they didn't tell us anything
since they don't want us to
worry about him, you know?

173
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:20,098
{\an1}Are you listening, Minato?

174
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,467
Uh, oh, yeah!

175
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,037
{\an1}Don't worry about Naruto.

176
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:28,976
{\an1}I bet he's probably out getting
in some extra training, that's
all.

177
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,845
Hmm.

178
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,109
Hmm?

179
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,013
This way!

180
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,149
{\an3}Kay!

181
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:20,448
{\an4}If Sasuke of the Uchiha Clan
leaves the village, there will
be a few who will not stand
idly by...

182
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:27,023
{\an4}...Mainly the children that were
raised in this cowardly system
that's been passed on from the
Third Hokage to the Fourth.

183
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:31,563
{\an1}<i>(DANZO) Keep an eye on them, and</i>
<i>if they make a move, follow</i>
<i>them.</i>

184
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:36,002
{\an1}<i>(Danzo) I want to make sure the</i>
<i>gift to Orochimaru reaches him</i>
<i>safely.</i>

185
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:40,275
{\an1}And if they do interfere, get
rid of them, whatever it takes.

186
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:47,251
{\an1}It's possible those fools won't
be the only ones involved.

187
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:51,491
{\an1}That's why I've gathered all of
you, the best the Foundation has
to offer.

188
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:55,496
{\an1}Make sure that you live up to
that name.

189
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:04,475
Huh?

190
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:07,413
Not good!

191
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,948
{\an8}<i>Damn it!</i>

192
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,184
Huh?

193
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:14,623
{\an1}What the?

194
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,291
Bushy Brows?

195
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,397
Neji! Tenten!

196
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:21,665
{\an1}What are you doing here?

197
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,870
{\an1}We saw some shadowy figures
pursuing you when you left.

198
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,077
{\an1}So all of us hurried over here
in order to provide you with
backup.

199
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,150
{\an4}I must say, being of help like
this is much more invigorating
than staying in the village!
Hah!

200
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:40,858
{\an4}Hey, don't get too worked up,
Lee. Nothing good ever happens
when you get all excited like
that.

201
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,962
{\an1}No, get as worked up as you
want! You're a big help.

202
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,164
Look out!

203
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,125
Huh?

204
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:26,689
You guys are...!

205
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,326
{\an1}Wait, those masks! ANBU.

206
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,263
{\an1}Oh, man. Don't tell me Dad
already found out.

207
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,297
{\an8}<i>Byakugan!</i>

208
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:39,573
{\an1}It's only those four that
have followed us here.

209
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:43,010
{\an1}And there are five of us! Which
means this will be easy!

210
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,652
(grunting)

211
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:56,496
{\an1}Sorry, but, there's no way that
we're going back! Not even if my
Dad tells us to!

212
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,031
Hmph!

213
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:04,874
{\an4}I can't believe you're doing
this! You can't just get into a
fight with some guys from the
ANBU!

214
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,946
(grunts)

215
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,898
{\an4}Listen, we definitely have to
bring Sasuke back before he
meets up with Orochimaru, ya
know.

216
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,034
{\an1}So please, don't get in our way!

217
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,207
Ah!

218
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,480
(grunts)

219
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:36,618
(grunts)

220
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:38,654
(gasps)

221
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,242
(grunts)

222
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,022
(grunting)

223
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:05,892
{\an1}Retreat, everyone!

224
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,473
(grunting)

225
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,116
(grunts)

226
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:31,160
{\an7}<i>These guys...aren't ordinary</i>
<i>ANBU.</i>

227
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:36,801
(grunting)

228
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:39,939
{\an1}Naruto! Are you okay? Hmph!

229
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:49,117
{\an7}<i>They're coming at us with intent</i>
<i>to kill!</i>

230
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:54,959
{\an7}<i>This is way too harsh,</i>
<i>considering that all we did was</i>
<i>disobey the lockdown order.</i>

231
00:19:54,993 --> 00:20:00,433
{\an7}<i>And on top of that, there's no</i>
<i>way they would try to kill</i>
<i>Naruto, the Hokage's son.</i>

232
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:05,407
{\an1}I see what's going on. These
ANBU aren't the Hokage's!

233
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:09,713
{\an1}They're from the militant
faction led by someone else!

234
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:12,617
{\an1}Not the pacifist faction led by
Lords Third and Fourth.

235
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,253
{\an1}<i>(SHIKAMARU) It was supposed to</i>
<i>have been dismantled!</i>

236
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:18,225
{\an1}I heard all about it a while
ago...

237
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:23,365
{\an1}That there's a separate ANBU
unit still in existence, and it
serves as a training division.

238
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,403
{\an1}I think it was called the
Foundation.

239
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:28,372
What?

240
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:54,207
{\an7}<i>So they're with the Foundation,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

241
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:06,959
{\an1}(grunts) Damn it! At this rate,
we're never gonna catch up to
Sasuke!

242
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:03,753
{\an4}<i>(SHIKAMARU) These guys aren't</i>
<i>with the Hokage! They're from an</i>
<i>underground organization called</i>
<i>the Foundation!</i>

243
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:06,490
{\an1}<i>(NARUTO) I don't care if they're</i>
<i>underground or aboveground!</i>

244
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:12,266
{\an4}<i>(NARUTO) If they want to kill</i>
<i>me, do it fair and square, with</i>
<i>their faces showing! Now just</i>
<i>try and get me!</i>

245
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,434
{\an1}<i>(ANKO) Such a hot-blooded child!</i>

246
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:18,606
{\an1}<i>(NARUTO) Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Pursuers."</i>

247
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,214
{\an1}<i>(NARUTO) We're all from the</i>
<i>Leaf, but these guys are...!</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>
