1
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:03,857
{\an1}(Yurito) So... I told my
classmates that they were
really lucky.

2
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,691
{\an1}I mean, they have so much free
time!

3
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,660
{\an1}Anyway, it's been a month since
I got here...

4
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:16,330
{\an1}So don't you think that it's
about time I got to supervise a
big assignment on my own?

5
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,030
[knocking]

6
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:18,864
Hm?

7
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,598
{\an1}(Yurito) Oh, Lord Hokage!

8
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:23,367
{\an1}Where did we put that report
from yesterday, again?

9
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,368
{\an1}Third on the right, the second
one from the top.

10
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:27,635
Oh...

11
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:32,271
{\an1}Oh, here it is. Didn't this come
with some attachments, too?

12
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:34,338
{\an1}Second pile, third down.

13
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,739
{\an1}I really don't know what I'd do
without you.

14
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:41,874
{\an1}Oh, right... Lord Hokage...
About next week's inspection...

15
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,875
{\an1}How many times have I told you
to just call me Kakashi?

16
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,744
{\an1}Yeah, you're way too stiff and
formal sometimes... sir!

17
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,311
[grumbling]

18
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:54,214
{\an1}Don't forget to take breaks now
and then. Or efficiency gets
compromised.

19
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,613
Roger!

20
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,184
{\an1}[yawn] It's nice to move around
a bit!

21
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:07,152
{\an1}I didn't think that I'd be
chained to a desk all the time
when I became a shinobi!

22
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:12,554
{\an1}So, uh... How do you not get
totally bored doing this sort of
work day after day.

23
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,155
Uh, sir...?

24
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,957
{\an1}I haven't cloud-gazed in quite a
long time.

25
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,293
{\an1}You know, sir... sometimes you
talk like an old man.

26
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,159
[bird screeches]

27
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,092
Huh?

28
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:26,527
Hmm...

29
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,595
{\an1}(Yurito) What's wrong? Is
something bothering you, sir?

30
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:31,596
Huh?

31
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,264
Nope!

32
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,700
{\an1}(Yurito) All right, I'm done
with everything!

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,467
Man!

34
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,336
{\an1}We really cruised through the
work today! Well, thanks!

35
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,536
{\an1}See you tomorrow!

36
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:51,805
{\an1}Oh, Lord Hokage! See ya!

37
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:53,407
See ya...?

38
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,974
{\an1}Thanks for today...

39
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,575
{\an1}Why'd you pick a kid like that
to work here?

40
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,677
{\an1}The adult world can be
complicated...

41
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:05,611
{\an1}I know. I don't like that kinda
stuff.

42
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:10,480
{\an1}Oh? And here I thought you
became one of us a while back,
Shikamaru...

43
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,248
Give me a break!

44
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:16,016
{\an1}Having more shinobi like
him around the Village...

45
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,750
{\an1}...is just an indication
that we're really at peace.

46
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,651
{\an1}The War's been over for two
years now...

47
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:24,553
{\an1}I know... I'm starting to get a
belly...

48
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:27,621
{\an1}I don't want to hear about all
that.

49
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,156
{\an1}Have you been keeping up with
your training?

50
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,223
{\an1}Eh, a little bit here and there.

51
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,326
{\an1}So you say. But I bet you're as
disciplined as ever.

52
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,360
{\an1}Why can't you just humor me a
bit?

53
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,927
{\an1}Oh, come on! I told him he had
to double-check this!

54
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:46,563
{\an1}By the way, how is that... one
issue going?

55
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,531
On hold for now.

56
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,598
{\an1}There's been no contact, then?

57
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:56,467
{\an1}I just feel bad for putting all
of this on your shoulders.

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,337
{\an1}[sigh] I don't think I was ever
really cut out to be a
shinobi...

59
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,304
{\an1}The reason I continue to be
one...

60
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:05,571
{\an1}...is to make Naruto the Hokage
one day, right?

61
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,074
{\an1}To make that happen, I know that
I can't remain a kid forever.

62
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:12,674
{\an1}Naruto's still a kid even now!

63
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,742
He is who he is.

64
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,711
{\an1}Hey, um... how about we go and
grab a bite after you're done
here?

65
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:23,280
{\an1}After this, it's Lord
Tsuchikage. We have a game set.

66
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:26,247
{\an1}[chuckle] Oh right, I saw him at
the summit yesterday.

67
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,515
{\an1}All he talked about was how bad
he was going to beat you this
time.

68
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,084
{\an1}Anyway, go easy on him.

69
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:35,285
{\an1}Half the reason I do it is
because it's for work.

70
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,753
{\an1}Hey, Shikamaru...

71
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:41,787
{\an1}What does it mean to be an
adult?

72
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:49,258
{\an1}[contemplative sighs]

73
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:52,059
{\an1}No... Wait.. that one?

74
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,627
{\an1}How's that, young'un?

75
00:05:56,661 --> 00:06:00,830
{\an1}Speechless now, eh? [laughing]

76
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,030
Eh?

77
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,630
Excuse me...

78
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:07,166
{\an1}Hey! Don't think I'll just let
you win and run off!

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,069
[grunts]

80
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:16,404
{\an1}[frustrated growl]

81
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,372
{\an1}I have to work twice as hard
tomorrow.

82
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,973
[crowd cheering]

83
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,145
{\an1}(Shop Clerk) Welcome!

84
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,579
Oh! There he is!

85
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:38,980
Hey! Over here!

86
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,681
{\an1}[sigh] Sorry I'm late.

87
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,648
{\an1}(Choji) Hey! I was cooking that!

88
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:45,683
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Who-kay.

89
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:47,717
{\an1}(Ino) This one's done, too.

90
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,418
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Uh-huh!

91
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,885
{\an1}Another kalbi, please!

92
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:54,787
{\an1}(Ino) Anyway, I keep trying to
teach this newbie, but she just
doesn't get it. At all!

93
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:57,422
{\an4}There's one like that on my
team, too.

94
00:06:57,455 --> 00:07:00,990
{\an1}But he reminds me of myself, so
I just can't ignore him.

95
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,657
{\an1}I wonder if Asuma felt this way
about us...

96
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,925
{\an1}You two've really embraced your
roles as instructors.

97
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,827
{\an1}You're one to talk! You're Lord
Hokage's right-hand man!

98
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:15,529
{\an1}Yeah, but... I don't really have
the patience to mentor my
subordinates.

99
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,097
{\an1}Not like you guys...

100
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:20,664
{\an1}You're the type of person that
prefers to just do everything
for themselves.

101
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:25,566
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Being a loner suits
me. you two are really the only
ones who are special to me.

102
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:29,002
{\an1}Y'know, sometimes... I miss the
old days.

103
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:32,103
{\an1}[chuckle] Hey, we're not old
enough to be saying that yet!

104
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:37,106
{\an1}Back then, it was typical for to
be together 24/7 almost all the
time.

105
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,441
{\an1}But now, we have to set up a
time and date

106
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,808
{\an1}just so that we can all get
together for a quick meal!

107
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,842
{\an1}When you think about it, it's
kinda sad, huh?

108
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:49,412
{\an1}Maybe that's the real answer,
then... Maybe that's what it
means to be an adult.

109
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:53,713
{\an1}Yeah, you're right. Your
temperament's really changed,
you know that, Shikamaru?

110
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,547
{\an1}Huh? You gotta be kidding me.

111
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,982
{\an1}Haven't you noticed lately?
You hardly ever say "what a
drag."

112
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,084
{\an1}Oh, yeah? Really?

113
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:03,985
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Thanks for the
food!

114
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:04,885
(Ino) Thank you!

115
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,721
{\an1}(Choji) Hey, guys! They gave me
some gum at the register. Brings
back memories, huh?

116
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,755
{\an1}Oh yeah! I chewed this stuff all
the time when I was a little
kid!

117
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,124
{\an1}(Ino) Oh, it's so sweet! Was it
always this sweet?

118
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,591
{\an1}(Choji) Okay, where to next?

119
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,225
Hm?

120
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,793
{\an1}You still wanna go get more to
eat?!

121
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,061
{\an1}Let's go BBQ hopping! It'll be
fun!

122
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,128
{\an1}Sorry, I have to get going.

123
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,096
huh?!

124
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,630
Shikamaru...

125
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,065
{\an1}is there something on your mind
that's bothering you?

126
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,232
{\an1}... Seems like it's wandering.

127
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,099
Uh...

128
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,133
{\an1}No, it's nothing, really.

129
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,802
{\an1}Just some Allied Shinobi
business. I have to leave the
Village.

130
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:46,603
{\an1}Wait, is it the same thing that
Temari and Kankuro are
attending?

131
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:51,173
{\an1}Hm... So Temari is more
important than we are, is that
it?

132
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:52,772
Ow!

133
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:53,940
[chuckling]

134
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:55,207
{\an1}What're you talking about?

135
00:08:56,574 --> 00:09:00,243
{\an1}(Chojuro) ...And so, we hope
it'll be able to grow even more.

136
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:05,312
{\an1}All right, well, that concludes
my activity report. Does anyone
have any questions right now?

137
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,548
{\an1}As to all the people who went
missing after the Fourth Great
Ninja War...

138
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,215
{\an1}...how is the search coming
along?

139
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,582
{\an1}It's under investigation.

140
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:16,616
{\an4}Well, what about the drop in
shinobi requests?

141
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,918
{\an1}They've been decreasing for
three periods in a row.

142
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,486
{\an1}It's under investigation.

143
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:24,220
{\an1}You realize that if it keeps
dropping the way it has been

144
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,054
{\an1}Village administration'll
be affected.

145
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,155
{\an1}(Shikamaru) We should have a
more detailed report...

146
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,723
{\an1}...no later than the time that
our next meeting is scheduled to
occur.

147
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:35,859
{\an1}I understand the viewpoint that
a decrease in requests for
shinobi

148
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:37,892
{\an1}poses a legitimate concern.

149
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:42,128
{\an1}But remember, this is just a
consequence of being at peace.

150
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:45,629
{\an1}Well, if there are no more
questions...

151
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,264
{\an1}...then everyone... I'll see you
again in a month.

152
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,066
{\an1}Hey! Shikamaru! Wait up!

153
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,967
[sigh]

154
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,634
{\an1}All right... what is it, Temari?

155
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:01,003
{\an1}Come on. What is going on with
you?

156
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:03,871
{\an1}Huh? What makes you say that?

157
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,339
{\an1}See? When you answer a question
with a question,

158
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,173
{\an1}it's practically proof that
something's up.

159
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,607
{\an1}So what is going on in the
Hidden Leaf Village?

160
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:12,042
It's nothing.

161
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,577
{\an1}Is it just something that you
can't talk to me about?

162
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,277
{\an1}I said there's nothing going on!

163
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:21,079
{\an1}Is there anything I can do?
Anything at all?

164
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,214
Nope.

165
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,081
Okay...

166
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,415
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Look, Temari...

167
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,083
{\an1}The thing is, you and I are
both representatives of our
individual villages.

168
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:32,884
{\an1}We shouldn't pry into each
other's--Huh?!

169
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,185
{\an1}[shocked reaction]

170
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,853
[grunt]

171
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,420
{\an1}What do you think you're doing?!

172
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,387
{\an1}I misjudged you! A lot!

173
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:42,721
[stunned sigh]

174
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,091
{\an1}(Kakashi) [laughing]

175
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,092
{\an1}So that's what made
you remember your old man, huh?

176
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:56,161
{\an1}Yeah. Happened all the time.
He'd stay out all night and get
yelled at by my mom.

177
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,529
{\an1}How unfortunate for him.

178
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,532
{\an1}Temari is very intuitive. Sooner
or later, she'll figure out the
Land of the Silence issue...

179
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:06,999
{\an1}So many Rogue Ninja and those
missing from the War

180
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,666
{\an1}seem to be filtering into that
mysterious land.

181
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,604
{\an1}And there's a deep, dark rumor
that it's undertaking shinobi
missions illegally...

182
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:19,105
{\an1}By all rights, the Shinobi
Alliance should be the ones
dealing with this problem...

183
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,073
{\an1}Which means if they discover
we're independently
investigating this,

184
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,907
{\an1}it's gonna be troublesome.

185
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,642
{\an1}But still, taking action against
the Land of Silence in the name
of the Alliance will be thorny.

186
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,744
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Just when we finally
achieved peace...

187
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,946
{\an1}It's already been two weeks
since Sai left word that he was
infiltrating

188
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,615
{\an1}the Land of Silence, right?

189
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,582
{\an1}We can't stand by anymore
without taking action.

190
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:47,017
{\an1}[bird screeching]

191
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,051
Well, finally!

192
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:04,392
{\an1}(Sai) The state of affairs in
the Land of Silence is more
serious than we suspected.

193
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:08,528
{\an1}If it's left as is, the Shinobi
Alliance will be faced with a
predicament.

194
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,762
{\an1}There is a man at work in this
land. His name is...

195
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,396
Gengo?

196
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,230
{\an1}I've never heard of him.

197
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:20,232
{\an1}(Sai) He may change the pitiful
existence of shinobi.

198
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,367
{\an1}Even more than that...

199
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,101
{\an1}he may very well be someone who
changes the framework of this
whole world.

200
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:29,836
{\an1}At this point, I'm not even sure
I know myself anymore...

201
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,504
{\an1}That doesn't sound good...

202
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:32,803
{\an1}No, it doesn't...

203
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,939
{\an1}The team that Sai was leading
held ten masters, the cream of
the crop,

204
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,940
{\an1}even amongst members
of the ANBU.

205
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:42,376
{\an1}This enemy must be fairly adept
to be able to wipe them out...

206
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:43,309
Looks like.

207
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:46,277
{\an1}It seems Sai's instincts were
right.

208
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,479
{\an1}Most of the shinobi who
disappeared after the War

209
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:52,779
{\an1}and the recent rogue shinobi are
in the Land of Silence.

210
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,481
{\an1}I hope that Sai is all right...

211
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:58,650
{\an1}He isn't someone who'll get
killed so easily. Although...

212
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:04,386
{\an1}There are hints in his message
that sound almost like...
admiration for this Gengo.

213
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,719
{\an1}You don't really think that Sai
has--

214
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,987
{\an1}Well he is very innocent...

215
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:13,456
{\an1}If we're to get Sai out and
to nip the Land of Silence in
the bud...

216
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,658
{\an1}...then I'm afraid that we only
have one option...

217
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,458
{\an1}Looks like you have the same
idea I do.

218
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,359
Yes.

219
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,394
{\an1}Except you can't be the one to
go on this mission.

220
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:26,028
Right.

221
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,930
{\an1}To remain inconspicuous, a
three-man team would be the best
choice.

222
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:33,231
{\an1}So could you provide two members
of the ANBU for this mission?

223
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:37,933
{\an1}A three-man squad... You already
have someone in mind for the
third?

224
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:41,602
{\an1}What we're talking about is a
clear breach of faith toward the
Alliance.

225
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:46,370
{\an1}If worse comes to worst, you'll
have to disavow any knowledge of
this team.

226
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,605
And so, I'll go.

227
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:52,407
{\an1}You're already carrying a big
part of the responsibilities

228
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,041
{\an1}within the Alliance.
You can't...

229
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:56,309
{\an1}I'm just adding a job to my
plate.

230
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:59,243
{\an1}It's useless to try and stop
you, isn't it?

231
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:03,612
{\an1}Still... I would've thought
you'd pick Ino and Choji to
accompany you.

232
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,546
{\an1}In order to complete this
mission successfully...

233
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,648
{\an1}...we're going to need someone
who can control chakra

234
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,515
{\an1}and can use that ability
to hide us...

235
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:16,351
{\an1}...as well as someone who has a
jutsu to make a direct hit on
the target. Besides...

236
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:17,750
Besides?

237
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:20,752
{\an1}Ino and Choji have their own
lives to think about now.

238
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,654
{\an1}I think I know just the ANBU for
this...

239
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:29,122
{\an1}They're both easy to work with
and should meet your
expectations.

240
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:31,624
{\an1}I'm sure that you're going to
like them.

241
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,724
What?

242
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,460
{\an1}You're gong on a business trip,
sir?

243
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,760
{\an1}Yeah, take care of things here
for me.

244
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,995
{\an1}Boy, that must be nice! I wish
that I could come along, too!

245
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,496
Damn it.

246
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,698
{\an1}Oh, bring me back a
souvenir, okay?

247
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,765
{\an1}Uh, yeah... I'll be sure to do
that...

248
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,400
{\an1}This is Soku of the ANBU.

249
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,602
{\an1}Easy to work with, huh?

250
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,102
{\an1}All right... and the other one?

251
00:14:58,402 --> 00:14:59,704
I'm right here.

252
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,104
{\an1}When the hell did you--?!

253
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,904
This is Ro.

254
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:07,006
{\an1}He can freely change the amount
and quality of chakra in himself
and in people he targets...

255
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,808
{\an1}...erasing all signs of his
presence or seeming to become
someone else.

256
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:14,042
{\an1}To explain it as simply as I
can,

257
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:17,545
{\an1}it is a modification of the
chakra from the point of view of
what others perceive.

258
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,146
{\an1}To be clear, I don't actually
change the amount of chakra in
whomever I target.

259
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,881
{\an1}A misapprehension is just
created in anyone perceiving
them.

260
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:27,582
{\an1}That's, like, even more
confusing.

261
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,383
{\an1}This one's still just a kid!

262
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,218
{\an1}Irrelevant! In the shinobi
world, ability's, like, all that
matters!

263
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:36,052
{\an1}Right to the point, huh?

264
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:41,021
{\an1}Not long after Hinoko left the
academy, we noticed her talents
and scouted her for the ANBU.

265
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:44,724
{\an1}She's only fourteen, but the
ANBU have total faith in her.

266
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:48,225
{\an1}Lord Hokage, I said not to call
me by, like, my real name.

267
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,660
{\an1}So then, your name's Hinoko,
huh?

268
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,526
{\an1}Well I think that's a really
cute na--!

269
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:59,062
{\an1}I, like, just hate to be called
by my name. I'd like you to be
more careful about doing that.

270
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:01,464
{\an1}So... what exactly can you do?

271
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,764
{\an1}My weapon is a chakra needle.

272
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:04,699
Huh?!?

273
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,101
{\an1}Once I aim, even if the target
leaves my sight,

274
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,169
{\an1}the chakra needle will, like,
follow 'til it hits it's
intended mark.

275
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:16,237
{\an1}That's perfect for
assassination...

276
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:24,041
{\an1}I don't, like, needlessly take
lives.

277
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:29,377
{\an1}I pierced its chakra stimulation
point, so it's, like, several
times livelier now.

278
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,312
{\an1}We'll get close using Ro's
jutsu,

279
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:36,513
{\an1}I'll seal Gengo's
movements with my shadow
Strangle Jutsu...

280
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,414
{\an1}...and Soku will finish him.

281
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:44,584
{\an1}A true collaboration indeed. It
seems that the synergy of this
strategy is practically ideal.

282
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:45,816
{\an1}Like, it sounds tedious.

283
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,451
{\an1}There two are exactly what you
need.

284
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,252
{\an1}I'm sure that it'll be fine.

285
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:52,353
What's wrong?

286
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,921
{\an1}Can you do something about that
whole "like" thing that you do?

287
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,122
Like, no!

288
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,156
{\an1}Well, that's that. So once
everything's ready--

289
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:02,991
{\an1}Is it okay to leave tomorrow
morning?

290
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,159
{\an1}It's not another shogi match, is
it?

291
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,160
{\an1}I just have a bit of business.

292
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:13,262
{\an1}So, anyway... I'll be heading
back a bit later than I thought,

293
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,531
{\an1}so i won't be able to visit next
month.

294
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:22,066
{\an1}Can you believe I have two
subordinates under me now?
That's not like me, huh?

295
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:32,638
{\an1}You know, Asuma, both you and my
dad...

296
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:36,073
{\an1}...had someone you'd give your
lives to protect.

297
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:38,708
{\an1}I haven't found anyone like that
yet...

298
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,609
{\an1}Big brother Shika!

299
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:41,875
Huh?!?

300
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:44,778
Mirai!

301
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,843
{\an1}Big Brother Shika!

302
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,145
Whoa, there!

303
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:48,911
Hehehe

304
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,080
{\an1}Shikamaru, you're so busy these
days!

305
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,381
{\an1}You don't need to come here
every month.

306
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:57,783
{\an1}I'm really not that busy.

307
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,319
{\an1}Oh, and this is our babysitter.
She watches Mirai for me from
time to time.

308
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:04,552
{\an1}Nice to meet you.

309
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,920
{\an1}He may not look it, but he's
Lord Hokage's right-hand man.

310
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,422
Oh, please...

311
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:14,223
{\an1}Oh, wow, I see! I'm sorry, I
still don't know these kinds of
things yet.

312
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:17,758
{\an1}She's new. She just recently
moved here from another Village.

313
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:22,627
{\an1}Many have come to live in the
Hidden leaf because of people
like you and Lord hokage.

314
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,428
Just my job...

315
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:28,330
{\an1}I hope the peace you've helped
to build will last for a long
time.

316
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:31,698
{\an1}(Mirai) Big brother!

317
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,198
Flowers!

318
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:38,000
{\an1}Oh, I see! you brought them for
your daddy, huh? You're so
clever, Mirai!

319
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,102
{\an1}You really do love Big Brother
Sikamaru, don't you, Mirai?

320
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,670
Uh-huh!

321
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,704
[chuckle]

322
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,739
{\an1}This peace will last, I'm sure
of it.

323
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:53,207
{\an1}Because I'll make it last.

324
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:02,844
{\an1}But why did I dream about that?

325
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,512
Damn it!

326
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:07,013
{\an1}...That's such bad luck.

327
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:19,553
{\an1}(Naruto) Hey, Shikamaru!

328
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:20,519
Huh?!?

329
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,421
{\an1}You're up awfully early, Ya
know?

330
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,689
Naruto...

331
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:27,888
{\an1}I could say the same about you!

332
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:33,192
{\an1}I woke up early, and I couldn't
get back to sleep. I'm just on
my way home from Ichiraku Ramen.

333
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:36,159
{\an1}Really??! Are they even open
this early in the morning?!

334
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:39,195
{\an1}Oh, yeah! They're open
twenty-four hours a day now!

335
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:42,062
{\an1}Okay, but still, who eats ramen
for breakfast?

336
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:46,565
{\an1}I could eat it breakfast, lunch,
and dinner! I think half my
body's mad of ramen by now!

337
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,766
[chuckle]

338
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,400
{\an1}Is it the garlic?

339
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,468
Oh, here...

340
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,635
{\an1}Have one'a these.

341
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:57,703
Oh!

342
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:01,371
{\an1}I love this gum! This sure
brings back memories!

343
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,005
I'll see ya.

344
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,940
Is it work?

345
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,775
{\an1}Yeah, just a little.

346
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:13,076
{\an1}Hey, don't just sit round eating
ramen. Be productive.

347
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,345
{\an1}Well, someone somewhere always
comes along with some annoying
mission for me...

348
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,312
{\an1}I've worked for six months
straight.

349
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:22,681
{\an1}This is the most important time
in your whole life.

350
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:26,181
{\an1}Yeah, I know, I know... but,
y'know...

351
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,316
No buts!

352
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,551
{\an1}Everybody recognizes your
ability now. Do as many missions
as you can so they say,

353
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:34,519
{\an1}"I gotta have Naruto on the
job."

354
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:38,454
{\an1}If you thing that they'll
approve you just because you're
a war hero, think again.

355
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,822
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:42,490
Look Naruto!

357
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:43,723
Huh?

358
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:49,159
{\an1}You are going to become the
Hokage. Don't ever forget that.

359
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:53,595
{\an1}Of course! 'Cause I never go
back on my word. That's my Ninja
Way.

360
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,796
{\an1}"Our" ninja Way, right?

361
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,462
Yeah.

362
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:02,097
{\an1}(Shikamaru) Naruto...

363
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:05,633
{\an1}Always stay just the way you
are.

364
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,567
{\an1}After all, that's the reason why
I'm here.

365
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:15,103
{\an1}Well, alright guys...

366
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,639
{\an1}Guess it's time to go to work.

367
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,317
{\an1}You'll surely be able to deceive
the enemy's eyes with this ruse.

368
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,753
{\an1}If we just kill the lookouts,
it'll be, like, easy to get past
the checkpoint!

369
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:06,587
{\an1}If we were to do that, and the
Leaf's involvement were
discovered...

370
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,788
{\an1}...it would mean big trouble.
Don't underestimate the enemy.

371
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:13,857
{\an1}If we stay too long, we'll just
like, increase the chances of
the enemy finding us.

372
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,325
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Shikamaru's Story,

373
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:21,794
{\an1}A Cloud Drifting in the Silent
Dark, Part 2; Dark Clouds,"

374
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,662
Soku, trust me.
