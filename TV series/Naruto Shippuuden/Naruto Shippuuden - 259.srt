00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,963
{\an1}That's why everyone's
so afraid of it, right?

156
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,466
{\an1}So why do these guys
want it so bad?

157
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:45,670
{\an4}The Nine Tailed Fox
has appeared in times
of consequence,
all through the ages.

158
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,976
{\an1}As powerful as any
act of nature.
men trembled before it.

159
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,480
{\an1}As for what they would want
with that malicious monstrosity,

160
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,948
{\an1}<i>That's a hard question</i>
<i>to answer, Naruto.</i>

161
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,454
{\an1}<i>They might be thinking</i>
<i>of somehow seizing</i>
<i>control of that power,</i>

162
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,088
{\an1}<i>bending it to their will.</i>

163
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,594
{\an1}It's a bitter pill to swallow,
knowing that those two will
be after you now.

164
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,363
{\an1}But that is your fate.

165
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,932
{\an1}Not to worry, though, after all
you will have me around!

166
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:14,567
{\an1}<i>Ah well! </i>

167
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,172
{\an1}I'm just gonna have to hurry
up and get stronger, then!
There's no choice!

168
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,578
<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Where am I? </i>

169
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,747
Good, you're out
of the woods.

170
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,415
<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>I...?</i>

171
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,850
{\an1}Sasuke!
[sobs]

172
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,687
{\an1}Heey, you're back!

173
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,355
Huh?

174
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,838
{\an1}You can be pretty
thoughtful, Naruto.

175
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,041
Nah, I didn't do
anything special.

176
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,510
{\an1}<i>You're a</i>
<i>good friend.</i>

177
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,913
[chuckle]

178
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,491
{\an1}[Itachi]
You're still too weak.
You don't have enough hate.

179
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,895
You never will.

180
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,499
Look I brought
you some apples!

181
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,636
Aah!

182
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,269
{\an1}Wha? Sasuke!

183
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,408
{\an1}Hey. What's that look?

184
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,410
Naruto.

185
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,412
{\an1}I want you to fight me.

186
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,449
{\an1}What!? We're in a hospital,
and you just got patched up!

187
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:36,816
{\an1}Shut up and fight me!

188
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,184
Huh??

189
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,419
...

190
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,891
{\an1}Do you really think
you saved me?

191
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:50,264
{\an1}I don't care if she's the Fifth
Hokage. you shouldn't have
gotten her involved in this.

192
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,064
What's that!?

193
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,006
{\an1}Hey! Sasuke!
Wait, don't do this!

194
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,907
{\an1}Naruto, say something!

195
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,909
{\an1}Actually, this
is perfect.

196
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,681
{\an1}I was just thinking 'bout how
I wanted to kick your butt.

197
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:15,355
{\an7}<i>What's this weird feeling?</i>
<i>My lower belly's all tight.</i>

198
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,693
{\an7}<i>And... and I'm getting chills.</i>

199
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:21,561
Heh!

200
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,330
What's so funny?

201
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,733
I'm not laughing
'cause it's funny.
I'm just psyched.

202
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,904
{\an1}'Cause I know that today is
the day when I finally beat you.

203
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,139
{\an1}What did you say?!

204
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:38,145
{\an1}You're right. Naruto is the
prize that the Akatsuki are
after. And we will have him.

205
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,248
{\an1}Don't talk nonsense,
you inept loser.

206
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,218
{\an1}I won't be such a loser
after I win today, will I!?

207
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,656
{\an1}Go away. You don't
interest me at the moment.

208
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:53,561
{\an1}You. An idiot like you
has no business acting
all high and mighty!

209
00:14:55,295 --> 00:15:00,000
{\an1}Ha! What happened to the
calm, controlled Sasuke?
Am I makin' you nervous?

210
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,271
{\an4}<i>It looks like you picked</i>
<i>a fight with me and now</i>
<i>you're too scared to go</i>
<i>through with it!</i>

211
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:04,971
<i>Is that it?</i>

212
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:05,906
{\an1}Let's just do this.

213
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,241
Put on your headband
and we will.

214
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,745
{\an1}Not to worry,
I don't need
that thing.

215
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,913
Just do it! Come on!

216
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:17,552
{\an1}You know puttin' your headband
on is a testament to fighting on
equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!

217
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,722
{\an1}See, there you go acting all
high and mighty again!

218
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,090
{\an7}<i>No, he's already....</i>

219
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,527
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>You don't honestly believe</i>
<i>that we're equals?!</i>

220
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,498
{\an7}<i>Can I? Can I really</i>
<i>keep up with him?</i>

221
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:31,932
What?!

222
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,501
Heck yeah I do!

223
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,901
{\an8}<i>No, I don't.</i>

224
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,340
{\an1}All this time, I've never
once thought that I was
inferior to you in any way!

225
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,410
{\an7}<i>You're everything I've</i>
<i>always wanted to be!</i>

226
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,712
{\an1}You're a complete embarrassment!

227
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,080
{\an8}<i>Just stop it.</i>

228
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,386
{\an1}Only because next to me, you're
embarrassed at how weak you are!
Isn't that right, Sasuke?!

229
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:52,754
{\an8}<i>Just stop it!</i>

230
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,490
{\an1}Narutoooo!!

231
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,958
Sasukeeee!!

232
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:58,626
STOP IT!!!!

233
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,035
{\an1}I'm not done [yet]!

234
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,972
HAAAAAAA!

235
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,708
Stop! No!!!

236
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:17,011
{\an8}<i>Too late--!</i>

237
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:18,413
{\an7}<i>Can't stop--!</i>

238
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,885
Auhh!

239
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,321
{\an1}What do you two think
you're doing up here?

240
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:30,425
{\an1}That was a little intense
for just a sparring match,
wasn't it?

241
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,894
What's wrong
with you two?

242
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:34,061
[pained grunts]

243
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,732
[pained grunts]

244
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:44,740
Heh.

245
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:45,239
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Sasuke.</i>

246
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,976
{\an1}<i>You you've really got</i>
<i>to watch this sense of</i>
<i>superiority you have.</i>

247
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,077
Huh?

248
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,279
That Chidori...

249
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:55,484
{\an1}It was not the size
you'd aim at a comrade
from the Leaf village.

250
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,252
<i>Were you really going</i>
<i>to kill him, Sasuke?</i>

251
00:16:58,787 --> 00:16:59,421
Hmph.

252
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:10,399
{\an7}<i>That hole in the water tower...</i>
<i>How did?!</i>

253
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,568
Agh!

254
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:17,004
{\an1}Naruto...
How far have you...

255
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,743
{\an1}I'm assuming it was you who
taught him that technique?

256
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,380
{\an1}I know you want to protect
him from the Akatsuki.

257
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:28,684
But still, to
entrust him with a
jutsu like that...

258
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,253
<i>After all, he could've</i>
<i>killed Sasuke.</i>

259
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,655
{\an1}Aren't you a fine
one to talk.

260
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,458
{\an1}Teaching the Chidori to
someone like Sasuke.

261
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:41,463
{\an1}I knew he was a hot-head, but I
never imagined he'd be willing
to use a jutsu that powerful

262
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:43,765
{\an1}against a comrade
from his own village.

263
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:49,238
{\an1}To Naruto, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time.

264
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:53,308
{\an1}In fact, it's the
competition between them
that keeps him going.

265
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:57,881
{\an1}<i>That's why he won't</i>
<i>stand for it when Sasuke</i>
<i>tries to belittle him.</i>

266
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:05,087
{\an1}<i>He's been dogging Sasuke's steps</i>
<i>every inch of the way, since</i>
<i>their first days at the Academy.</i>

267
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:09,692
{\an1}<i>As far as Naruto's</i>
<i>concerned, what you and</i>
<i>I think doesn't matter.</i>

268
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:14,731
{\an1}<i>There's only one person</i>
<i>whose approval he really</i>
<i>cares about: Sasuke.</i>

269
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:21,738
{\an4}On the other hand, it's hard
for Sasuke to watch Naruto's
strength and skills develop
at such an astonishing rate.

270
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:26,108
{\an1}He's come along so fast,
Sasuke must feel like
he's standing still.

271
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,911
{\an1}<i>[Jiraiya]</i>
<i>You mean revenge.</i>

272
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:31,581
{\an1}<i>His hatred of Itachi may be</i>
<i>driving him on too fast.</i>

273
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:34,984
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Sasuke can't acknowledge</i>
<i>Naruto's abilities.</i>

274
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:39,221
{\an1}<i>He's afraid that if he</i>
<i>does acknowledge them,</i>
<i>he somehow diminishes his own.</i>

275
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,927
{\an4}[sigh] It can
be hard work
maintaining
a rivalry.

276
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:49,532
{\an1}On top of everything else,
the both of them are
burdened by a dark past,

277
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,335
{\an1}That neither one had any
control over at all.

278
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:01,711
{\an8}<i>Damn it.</i>

279
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,080
{\an8}<i>Damn it! </i>

280
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,119
We are the Sound
Ninja Four.

281
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,755
{\an1}We're here on orders
from Lord Orochimaru.

282
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,658
You guys might
wanna think twice
about doing this.

283
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,761
Because I am in a really
bad mood right now.

284
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:25,803
{\an1}Oh, just stop all of
your prattling, you
little weakling.

285
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:28,404
{\an8}<i>Did he call me weak?!</i>

286
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:30,340
C'mon kid.

287
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,110
{\an1}I wanna play Do-Re-Mi
on those ribs of yours
'til they crack!!!

288
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:43,419
{\an1}What?! Orochimaru
left a Curse Mark
on Sasuke's body?

289
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:49,627
{\an1}Yeah. And he said Sasuke
would come looking for him
hoping to find more power.

290
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,496
I see. I didn't
realize that
had happened.

291
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:59,803
Orochimaru, huh?
Yeah, I ran into him
not too long ago.

292
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:00,671
You did?!

293
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:05,576
{\an1}<i>He was incredibly powerful.</i>
<i>The guy is bad news.</i>

294
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,047
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>everything'll</i>
<i>be fine!</i>

295
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,914
Uh?

296
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,485
Sasuke would never let
a guy like that sink
his claws into him.

297
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,353
He's already
a powerhouse!

298
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,989
{\an1}It's not like he needs
that kinda help, ya know.

299
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:21,925
{\an1}<i>[Naruto] [flashback]</i>
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>I guarantee it!</i>

300
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:24,294
Yaaagh!

301
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,194
Huagh!

302
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:26,397
Uwagh!

303
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:29,967
{\an1}You should
come with us.

304
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:33,237
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru
offers you power.

305
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,272
{\an1}What is your purpose
in this life?

306
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:39,843
{\an1}<i>To stay here in this</i>
<i>backwater village, hiding</i>
<i>with your little friends?</i>

307
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:44,815
{\an1}<i>Surely you haven't</i>
<i>forgotten...</i>
<i>Itachi Uchiha?</i>

308
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:48,419
Don't lose sight
of your purpose.

309
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,689
Life in this village
is little more than
bondage for you.

310
00:20:52,623 --> 00:20:55,994
{\an1}So sever your ties and
leave this pathetic place.

311
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,163
{\an1}<i>If you can do that,</i>

312
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,732
{\an1}There will be no limit to
the power you can wield.

313
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:05,904
{\an1}Remember your purpose!

314
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:16,580
{\an7}<i>My goal... is to kill Itachi!</i>

315
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:21,052
{\an7}<i>For that, I must have power!</i>

316
00:22:57,783 --> 00:23:01,754
{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Maybe I was the only one,</i>
<i>who thought that</i>
<i>we were friends.</i>

317
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,756
<i>I can't help it.</i>

318
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:06,892
{\an1}<i>I just can't bear the thought,</i>

319
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:12,097
{\an1}<i>of seeing you taken away,</i>
<i>by someone like Orochimaru!!</i>

320
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,433
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Parting.</i>

321
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:19,972
{\an1}<i>The rivalry between Sasuke and</i>
<i>me reaches a boiling point.</i>

322
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:24,176
{\an1}<i>You're going back to the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf Village, if I have to drag</i>
<i>you all the way there! </i>
