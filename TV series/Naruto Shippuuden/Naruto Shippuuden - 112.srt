00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,557
Even with treatment,
he will never

00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,458
get back to the
way he was before.

20
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,668
The strain was too
much for his body.

00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,637
The effort of restraining
the Three‐Tails

22

I won't know for sure until
I conduct a full examination.

Nevertheless, I'm fairly
certain that Yukimaru's powers

will never be the same.

will always be your real home.

I'm the one that you
can return to, Guren.

‐Do you mean‐‐ I promise,
for as long as I live,

50
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,134
I will keep thinking about
you, and I will never

And you'll never leave my

They're in no condition
to continue their mission.

67
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,061
Besides, now that the
boy has lost his powers,

68
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,997
Orochimaru will never
control the Three‐Tails.

69
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,135
The wisest choice now is to
regroup, reassess, and come up

70
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,302
with a new strategy.

KATSUYU: But, Orochimaru's
not the only one

after the Three‐Tails.

‐Yes, I'm well aware of that.

But if we couldn't
tame that tailed beast,

I sincerely doubt
that the Akatsuki

will have any more luck.

I'm sending a team
to relieve them.

As soon as their
replacements arrive,

they're to pull out
of there at once.

Tsunade's orders.

will keep an eye

anything were to happen,

we're in no condition
to deal with it.

We've all been injured,
some of us severely.

98

Lady Tsunade has wisely
decided that the best course

99
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:42,509
is for us to bring back the
intelligence we've gathered

so far, and then
decide what to do next.

first thing in the morning.

day, when you came to me.

Orochimaru had locked me up
after I failed his experiment.

He allowed me no food,
scarcely any water.

I was on the verge of dying.

Then, one day, you came and
gave me a drink of water.

Just a ladle full,

00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:09,109
‐Naruto, you were right here
in the room with Yukimaru.

166
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,343
You didn't see anything?

167
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:11,244
‐I'm afraid not.

168
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:13,580
‐Huh, some ninja you are.

169
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,281
But what do you
expect from a genin?

170
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,116
‐Shut up.

171
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,684
You slept right through it, too.

172
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,120
‐Hey, I'm not the one who
claims to be Mr. Super‐Stamina.

173
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,922
And I wasn't sitting
right next to him.

174
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:22,723
‐Stop it.

175
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,157
Arguing about it won't help.

176
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,258
‐Hm.

177
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,627
‐Forget how it happened.

178
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,028
I'm worried about him.

179
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,996
Yukimaru doesn't
have anywhere to go.

180
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,665
‐We must go and look for him.

181
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,266
We cannot just
leave him out there.

182
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,267
‐I agree.

183
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,169
‐There's no need for that.

184
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,303
‐Huh?

185
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:39,005
‐Our only interest in
the boy was his ability

186
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,607
to control the Three‐Tails.

187
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:44,811
Now that he's lost his powers,
he's no longer our concern.

188
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,913
‐His powers are
not the issue here.

189
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,115
‐I'm afraid Shino's right, Lee.

190
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,118
It's not our job to go
chasing after runaways.

191
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:54,788
And besides, we have our orders.

192
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,890
We're to return to
the village at once.

193
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,960
‐Yes, but‐‐ Naruto, do
you agree with them?

194
00:11:59,993 --> 00:12:02,536
‐Yep, nothing we
can do about it.

195
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,206
Don't worry, the kid
will be all right.

196
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:06,707
‐Naruto?

197
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,513
‐All right, it's time
we were on our way.

198
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:14,014
‐Sorry to keep you
waiting, Kakashi.

199
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:20,787
OROCHIMARU: I was
hoping we would

200
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,757
strike a blow
against the Akatsuki.

201
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,425
‐Yes, forgive me.

202
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,862
I wasn't expecting the
Hidden Leaf to interfere.

203
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:33,567
‐And so, the woman, Guren,
you're sure that she's dead.

204
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,969
‐Yes, my Lord,
I'm afraid she is.

205
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:36,903
It's a great pity.

206
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,939
She had remarkable abilities.

207
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:42,108
‐Hm, don't pretend
you didn't detest her.

208
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:46,412
Are you sure it wasn't
you who killed her?

209
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,148
‐Of course it wasn't.

210
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,016
‐Well, not to worry.

211
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,954
She's easily replaced, even
with her remarkable abilities.

212
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,289
‐As for the boy, Yukimaru‐‐

213
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,824
‐Never mind him.

214
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,025
At this point, it doesn't‐‐

‐Lord Orochimaru, hang on
while I fetch your medicine.

217
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,407
[choking]

218
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,011
‐That host body of his has
reached its limit already.

00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:15,982
[choking]

220

[laugh]

221
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:20,453
‐At this point, none of
it will matter much longer

222
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:26,960
because soon I will have
a new host body, his body.

223
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,462

[wind blowing]

227
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:37,971
‐Huh?

[gasp]

229
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:41,241
‐What is it?

230
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:41,842
What's wrong?

231
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:48,815
‐Nothing, there's nothing wrong.

232
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:54,755

‐You're finishing our report?

235
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,243
‐Yeah.

236
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,078
‐There's a fog forming.

237
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,680
‐The squad we're
relieving says it's

238
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,115
created by the Three‐Tails.

239
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:18,852
And it induces
hallucinations, so be careful.

240
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,187
‐Interesting, I
didn't know that.

241
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,790
Ha.

242
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,859
‐A black cloak with red clouds‐‐

‐Hm.

246
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,939
‐Bravo, Deidara.

247
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,974
As expected, that was awesome.

248
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,810
Well, so much for the look‐outs.

249
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:46,547
‐Looks like your information
was a little off.

250
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,848
Hm.

251
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:50,584
You specifically said the
leaf ninja weren't involved

252
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,385
in the battle for
the Three‐Tails.

253
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:53,887
Isn't that right?

254
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,890
‐Yeah well, that's how
it was supposed to be.

255
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,692
It's really weird.

256
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,060
[laugh]

257
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:02,202
‐Anyway it's not like these guys
gave us much trouble, is it?

258
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,170
Hey, let's fill our
quota right now,

259
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,506
while we've got the chance.

260
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,109
‐You're 100 years too
young to give me orders.

261
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,044
Hm.

262
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,012
‐Huh?

263
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,446
[explosion]

264
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,581
‐But, wait.

265
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:16,517
Remember what they said
about that fog causing

266
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,118
hallucinations.

267
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,987
‐Who do you think you're
talking to, you fool?

268
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,955
I can handle it.

269
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,164
‐Ah, his temper
hasn't improved any.

270
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,266
‐It would take a
long time to search

271
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,070
this whole lake for
the Three‐Tails.

272
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,975
Much easier if I make
the beast come to me.

273
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:42,909
Hm.

274

‐Whoa, look at it.

278
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,946
It looks a little like a turtle.

279
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:16,617
A huge, really dangerous turtle.

280
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,685
‐So, that's the Three‐Tails.

281
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,687
‐But you've done such
a good job so far,

282
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:22,889
I think I'll just
leave the rest of you.

283
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:25,826
‐Tobi, you wanted to be
a part of the Akatsuki,

284
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,561
and now you are.

285
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:28,962
You handle it.

286
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:29,796
Hm.

287
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,398

‐But this thing's
a water creature.

00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,881
I'm totally the wrong
man for the job.

294
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,751
Shouldn't we have assigned this
to somebody else, like Kisame,

295
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,653
or anybody else?

wrong, my lady?

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,445
‐Nothing.

308
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:45,946
‐Oh.

309
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,817
I can report that
everyone is safely back

310
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:52,719
within the land of fire.

311
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,254
‐Excellent.

312
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,355
Good work, Katsuyu.

313
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,456
You may go now.

314
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:56,957
‐Right.

315
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:10,076
‐I did it.

316
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,179
Victory‐‐ victory!

317
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,314
Did you see that?

318
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,683
Did you see me knock out
this giant monstrosity

319
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,084
with my jutsu?

320
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,554
I have to admit, at
first I had my doubts.

321
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:23,824
But I think I did pretty
well on my first assignment

322
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:26,026
as an Akatsuki, don't you think?

323
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,393
‐No, I don't.

324
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:29,963
We both know that it was
my detonating clay that

325
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:32,999
neutralized the Three‐Tails.

326
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,968
If it weren't for
my artistry, you

327
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,303
would still be thrashing
around underwater.

328
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:40,473
Since you're an Akatsuki
now, stop jabbering so much

329
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:41,875
and learn how to be cool.

330
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,544
That's the secret.

331
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:47,814
You've got no cool,
you've got no art.

332
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,216
You see, that's what art is.

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,953
It's passionate
emotions recollected

334
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,354
in cool tranquility.

335
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,690
‐Ha, talk about jabbering.

336
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:57,758
[laugh]

337
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,770
‐Oh, I was kidding!

338
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,105
[scream]

339
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,242
‐What is it?

340
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,845
‐It's just that‐‐ the ones
headed for the lake should have

341
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,114
been in contact by
now, don't you think?

342
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:18,552
‐Hm, we'd better send
a report, just in case.

343
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:21,087
[water rushing]

344
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,557
DEIDARA: Just make sure you
don't get too complacent there,

345
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,258
Tobi.

346
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,060
The Three‐Tails
was easily defeated

347
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,095
because it doesn't
have a jinchuriki host.

348
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:32,265
It has great powers, but not
the intelligence to control it.

349
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,540
[sigh]

350
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,341
‐Hey there, Tobi.

351
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:44,410
When I said be cool, I
didn't mean be comatose.

352
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,546
I'm talking to you.

353
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:46,547
TOBI: Oh, yes.

354
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,516
Hm, now just a little lower.

355
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,885
Ah there, that's the spot.

356
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:56,657
Hm, perfect, hm.

357
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,559
DEIDARA: Fall
asleep on me again,

358
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:00,634
and I'll make sure
you never wake up.

359
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,937
[scream]

360
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,907
‐Woo, I feel like I haven't
seen the old place for ages.

361
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,543
‐It has been one
mission after another.

362
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,013
‐All right everyone,
dinner tonight at Ichiraku.

363
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,480
[laugh]

364
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,883
‐Wait, Naruto.

365
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,218
‐Huh?

366
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,886
‐There's something I don't get.

367
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,188
You worried so much
about Yukimaru.

368
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,992
I'm surprised you would have
just left him like that.

369
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:27,227
‐He's OK.

370
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,095
Besides, where
he's gone, we would

371
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,665
have had a heck of a
time finding him anyway.

372
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,567
‐What are you saying?

373
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,302
‐I think what Pervy
Sage told me is true.

374
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,172
He said that, wherever
someone's still thinking of you,

375
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,807
that place is your home.

376
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,409
And if you just keep
thinking about a person,

377
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,478
then sooner or
later, your thoughts

378
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,580
are going to reach him.

379
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,649
‐Is that what I think it is?

380
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,149
‐Uh‐huh.

381
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:57,490
So I say, we've got to keep
sending our thoughts out there,

382
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:01,467
so that we can create a place
for Sasuke to come home to.

383
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:06,439
[music playing]

384

[theme music]

385
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,369
‐I always knew you
would come from me.

386
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:05,471
SASUKE: I'm stronger than
you, so at this point,

387
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:08,141
I don't see a reason to
hand my body over to you.

388
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:10,944
‐A bold statement from
a nursling Uchiha.

389
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,747
‐That's the only kind
Uchiha you can handle.

390
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,748
‐Silence!

391
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,950
‐Anyway, I don't
like your style.

392
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:20,486
The way you toy with people,
all for this vain, and frankly

393
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,856
stupid, cause of yours.

394
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:24,858
You disgust me.

395
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:28,228
