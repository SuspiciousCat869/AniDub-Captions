{\an8}[grunt]

151
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,616
{\an4}That child... He
just used Nature
Energy. So this
is...

152
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,254
It's a little
something called Sage
Mode!

153
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,589
{\an1}[angry grunt]

154
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,891
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

155
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,425
{\an7}<i>All this power...</i>

156
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,460
{\an7}[heavy breath]

157
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,930
Naruto, why do
you always keep
on-?!

158
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,699
Why is it
always you, huh?

159
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:33,103
{\an4}Listen, stop talking
all this nonsense
and let's go
back home!

160
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:37,573
{\an8}<i>I see... So  </i>
<i>that power has </i>
<i>a time limit...</i>

161
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,175
{\an8}<i>Well, then...</i>

162
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,677
{\an1}Fire Style: Fierce
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

163
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:43,745
Hm?

164
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:57,757
You disgust me,
Naruto... It's time
you get lost!

165
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,406
{\an1}Now disappear with
the thunder!

166
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:23,846
[attack yell]

167
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,395
{\an5}Seems you lost
focus... Your real
target was here
all along.

168
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,931
{\an1}Sasuke you'd... really
do this to
me?

169
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:47,900
[coughing]

170
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:49,936
[chuckle]

171
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,071
{\an1}What could possibly
be funny?!

172
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,076
{\an5}Sasuke... I've always
thought... that you
and I... were
alike.

173
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:01,145
{\an1}What are you
talking about now?!

174
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:03,414
I'm the son
of the Fourth
Hokakge.

175
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:08,419
{\an5}You're the son of
the Leaf's Police Force
Chief, from the prestigious
Uchiha Clan.

176
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:14,424
{\an4}Both of us grew up under exactly
the same shadow, being
constantly compared to our
fathers...

177
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:21,263
{\an4}So we know how hard it is to
live under that... to always be
under the watchful eye of
everyone.

178
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:27,168
{\an4}I thought you were
the one person in the
village who was able to
understand all that.

179
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:32,305
{\an4}But even though our
circumstances were the same, you
were totally different than
me...

180
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,075
You just kept on
progressing and
getting stronger...

181
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,410
At first, I
was frustrated.

182
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:45,616
{\an4}But then... I became
proud of you. That's why...
I decided to do my best to be
just like you.

183
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:49,519
{\an4}You've been my
rival and my
role model for
this entire time!

184
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,054
{\an1}Well, I'm different!

185
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,623
{\an4}You... You should've
just stayed the
same person that
you were.

186
00:16:54,657 --> 00:17:00,062
{\an4}Why, Naruto?! Why couldn't you
have just remained a loser, the
weak and useless son of the
Hokage?!

187
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:02,131
Sasuke...

188
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:05,734
{\an1}But even you...
even you had
to become strong!

189
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,636
You've no idea
how much that
made me--!

190
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,338
<i>Is that why?</i>

191
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,640
{\an4}Is that the
reason why you're
trying to find
more power now?!

192
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:18,077
{\an1}<i>That's right, Naruto! I wanted</i>
<i>the power to bring you down!</i>

193
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,114
{\an1}[grunt]

194
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,752
You're the real
loser here,... Sasuke...

195
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:33,392
{\an7}<i>What is this?! This red</i>
<i>chakra... He still has power</i>
<i>like this?!</i>

196
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:41,898
Naruto... His power
is still several
levels above yours.

197
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,566
Your only choice
is to use
mine...

198
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:49,004
[angry roar]

199
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:56,244
{\an4}I'm gonna stop you
even if I have to break
every last bone in your
body!

200
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,248
I've had enough
of this, what
are you?!

201
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:02,182
{\an1}I'm your friend,
Sasuke!

202
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:09,722
{\an4}That's why I'm telling
you, I won't let the likes
of Orochimaru get ahold
of you!

203
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:23,233
{\an1}Fine, I acknowledge you.
Now it's time we have this
out as equals.

204
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:28,738
{\an1}However, you still won't
be able to lay a single scratch
on my forehead.

205
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,544
Sasuke!

206
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:51,091
{\an1}[grunt] Rasengan!

207
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,026
Chidori!

208
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:07,538
Big Brother!

209
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,078
{\an5}I came to bring
you back, but it
seems I'm a little
late.

210
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:16,879
No! No way!

211
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:18,714
Naruto...

212
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,551
{\an1}...please, get along
with my little
brother.

213
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:23,885
[speechless]

214
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,092
{\an1}Forgive me... Sasuke...

215
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,693
[shakey breath]

216
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,077
[gasp]

217
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:40,585
[pained groans]

218
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:55,697
I must say,
that was quite
entertaining.

219
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,038
{\an1}(NARUTO) <i>[gasp] What is that</i>

00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:11,981
{\an1}<i>can you confirm what's</i>

<i>with your Byakugan?</i>
