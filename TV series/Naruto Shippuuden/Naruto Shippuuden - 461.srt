00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:59,806
{\an1}(Zetsu) Mother loved this world.
And she tried to love humans.

2
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,908
{\an1}But her hopes were dashed.

3
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:07,616
{\an1}She ate the fruit of the Divine
Tree to try to protect her
children.

4
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:13,589
{\an1}But...her real tale of despair
begins here...

5
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:19,061
{\an1}Shortly after, Mother gave birth
to twins.

6
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,696
They were...

7
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,668
{\an1}Hagoromo and Hamura.

8
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:33,178
{\an1}[birds chirping]

9
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:41,954
{\an1}(Hamura) Mother stares up at the
sky like that every day. I
wonder what she's looking for?

10
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,661
{\an1}How could we know? She
never tells us anything.

11
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,096
{\an1}No one knows what's
inside her heart.

12
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:55,304
{\an1}(Hagoromo) It could be that she
has feelings even we, her own
sons, aren't able to fathom.

13
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:06,483
{\an1}(Haori) Hagoromo! Hamura! Please
come with me!

14
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,785
Why, Haori?

15
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,490
{\an1}[birds chirping]

16
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,293
{\an1}If you use all the water
at your place,

17
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,230
{\an1}then there won't be any
left for the rice paddies
further downstream!

18
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,098
{\an1}That isn't my fault!

19
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,935
{\an1}Just hold up. What's
going on here?

20
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,471
[groan]

21
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,774
{\an1}I'll tell ya what's up!
This guy's been using
up all the water!

22
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,513
{\an1}What am I supposed to do?!
My paddy's upstream! I
can't help it!

23
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:36,017
{\an1}(Hamura) But until now, wasn't
there enough water for everyone?

24
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,655
{\an1}Yes, but all of a
sudden, the flow of the
river's gotten weak.

25
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:48,164
[footsteps]

26
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,770
{\an1}Has something happened
upstream, then...?

27
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,544
{\an1}Well, I would go check, but
there's a huge bear roaming
around up on the mountain.

28
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:00,878
{\an1}You gotta be careful.

29
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,752
{\an1}Recently, an old lady was
foraging for plants and she
got hurt really bad.

30
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:09,122
All right. We'll
go check it out.

31
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,057
{\an1}Oh, really? That'd be great!

32
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,661
{\an1}You be careful, Hagoromo.

33
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:14,827
We'll be fine.

34
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,630
{\an1}Okay, Hamura. Let's go.

35
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,264
Right.

36
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:21,670
[water flowing]

37
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,638
{\an1}Do you see anything?

38
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:24,673
{\an1}Hold on a minute.

39
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,713
{\an1}(Hamura) There's a huge boulder
in the riverbed upstream.

40
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:36,886
[water flowing]

41
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,922
[birds chirping]

42
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:43,961
{\an1}Oh, I see. So this is what's
blocking the flow of the river.

43
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:48,900
{\an1}Yes, but...where did it come
from? It wasn't there the
last time we were here.

44
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,405
{\an1}Well, either it fell
from somewhere, or
someone put it here.

45
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,840
{\an1}What do you mean, "someone"?

46
00:04:55,342 --> 00:05:00,113
{\an1}Nobody can move a boulder this
big except Mother and you, Elder
Brother.

47
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,881
{\an1}(Gamamaru) I put it there.

48
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:05,152
Huh?

49
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:09,056
{\an1}(Gamamaru) Hey, don't brush me
off like some bug!

50
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:12,394
{\an1}Because I'm definitely not a
bug!

51
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,062
{\an1}I'm actually a toad.

52
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,037
{\an1}Hamura...have I gone
completely crazy, here...

53
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,774
{\an1}...or is that talking
toad making bad jokes?

54
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,978
{\an1}(Hamura) Well, Elder
Brother...that must mean I'm
going crazy, too.

55
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:35,120
{\an1}Just listen, would you? Neither
one of you is going crazy! I
really am talking to you, okay?!

56
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,489
{\an1}But then again...

57
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,794
{\an1}...if you think that my jokes
aren't funny, then maybe you are
a little bit crazy.

58
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:49,570
{\an1}(Hamura) No one's hiding nearby,
and this doesn't seem like
Ventriloquism, either.

59
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:53,876
{\an1}You know, the two of you are
pretty mistrustful for humans.

60
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,378
{\an1}And you know, you're pretty
arrogant for a toad.

61
00:05:56,412 --> 00:06:00,583
{\an1}Hey, listen! We toads
have lived here far longer
than any of you.

62
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,084
{\an1}It's not my fault you
weren't aware of it!

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,090
{\an1}A real taking toad. Think people
would like it if we caught it
and took it home?

64
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:10,795
{\an1}What are you talking about, you
fool?! You really think that you
could catch me?

65
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,733
{\an1}[chuckle] For a little toad,
you sure do talk big.

66
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:17,602
{\an1}Uh oh, it appears that we have
another guest.

67
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,105

[roaring]

69
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,748
{\an1}That is one huge bear!

70
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:32,754
{\an1}What perfect timing. I can show
you just how strong I am.

71
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:36,424
[water blasting]

{\an1}[frightened roaring]

75
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:48,672
{\an1}I put this boulder here so you
two would come and I could meet
you.

76
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:54,344
{\an1}Anyway, my name is Gamamaru, and
you are Hagoromo and Hamura,
right?

77
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,848
{\an1}It called us by our
first names...

78
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,649
{\an1}Come with me, you two.

79
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:03,922
{\an1}Oops, I almost forgot.

{\an1}Oh, that wasn't too bad at all!

00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:22,042
{\an1}Alright...exactly why have you
brought us here?

83
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,479
{\an1}Do you two know what that is?

84
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:25,714
Yes, of course!

85
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:28,216
It's called the
Peak of Demise.

86
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:32,088
{\an1}And have you ever seen what lies
beyond it?

87
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,891
No, never.

88
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,860
{\an1}Mother has forbidden us
from going near that peak.

89
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:41,933
{\an1}It's a law that everyone must
follow. No one has ever seen
what's on the other side.

90
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:46,070
{\an1}The truth of the Divine Tree is
beyond there.

91
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,840
{\an1}Truth of the Divine Tree?

92
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,311
{\an1}(Gamamaru) The Divine Tree has
been absorbing the power from
this land.

93
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:56,215
{\an1}As long as the Tree exists, the
land will continue to weaken.

94
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,551
Is that true?

95
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,622
{\an1}But I've heard that the
power of the Divine Tree
makes this land thrive.

96
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:02,757
You're wrong!

97
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,829
{\an1}If you want to learn the real
truth, go see what's on the
other side of that peak.

98
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,031
Later!

00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,345
{\an1}(Peddler) Seriously? Lady
Kaguya's really not here?

102
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,783
{\an1}How many times do I have to tell
you? She isn't here.

103
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:29,821
{\an1}Oh! Welcome home,
Masters Hagoromo and Hamura.

104
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:30,755
{\an1}What's the matter?

105
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,791
This man is very
persistent.

106
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:34,860
And who are you?

107
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,863
{\an1}I'm a traveling medicine
salesman.

108
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:42,301
{\an1}I was hoping to do some business
here so I came to get Lady
Kaguya's permission.

109
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:44,571
Where is Mother?

110
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,075
{\an1}She said that she'd
be away tonight.

111
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:51,245
{\an1}(Hagoromo) I see, so she's
gone out again. She's been
away a lot lately.

112
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,915
So what do I do?

113
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,487
Well, now...

114
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,925
{\an1}...what's this? Let me take a
look at your medicines.

{\an1}[shocked yelling]

116
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,865
{\an1}(Peddler) What are you doing to
all of my merchandise?!

117
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:13,404
{\an1}These are hardly anything more
than weeds and moldy nuts. This
one's a poisonous mushroom.

118
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,875
{\an1}If anyone were to take these,
it'd make them even sicker.

119
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,312
{\an1}You're just a snake
oil salesman, and not
a very good one.

120
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,614
{\an1}[nervous chuckle]

121
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:25,218
{\an1}My mother lives here. As do my
elder brother and I.

122
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:28,922
{\an1}We three can cure any illness
anywhere at any time.

123
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:32,093
{\an1}So no one here will buy
anything that you have to sell

124
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,195
{\an1}Does your power come from
the Divine Tree, then?

125
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:39,200
{\an1}Listen, just get out of this
village. Or you're gonna be
very sorry.

128

{\an1}Ugh, they made me so mad my back
pain is flaring up again.

129
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,390
{\an1}The Divine Tree, huh?

130
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:04,730
{\an1}If I took even a little branch,
I could sell it for a fortune...

131
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:06,933
{\an1}Yes! While the cat's away...

132
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:10,870
{\an1}(Hagoromo) Forget it. Don't be
foolish. Go near the Divine Tree
and you'll die.

Ow, ow, ow!

you a question.

{\an1}Are you kidding?! You're not
getting anything out of me!

{\an1}If you give me an answer,
then I'll heal your back.

00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:51,016
{\an1}You've traveled around to many
different places, right?

146
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,553
{\an1}Oh, yeah! Everywhere! That's
how I make my living.

147
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,525
{\an1}Have you ever seen
what's beyond that peak?

148
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,529
{\an1}No, I can't say that I have.
But I've seen many other lands!

149
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,933
{\an1}What do they say about
my mother in those lands?

150
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,937
{\an1}Well, that's, uh...
I mean... uh...

151
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,539
{\an1}Please, the whole truth.

152
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,141
Okay.

153
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:17,113
{\an1}There have been rumors about
people staging rebellions here
and there...

154
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:20,251
{\an1}...largely over Lady Kaguya's
Ritual of the Divine Tree.

155
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:23,053
{\an1}And it's said that to
suppress the uprisings,

156
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,791
{\an1}Lady Kaguya has annihilated the
instigators in the Land of That.

157
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:32,097
{\an1}(Peddler) Lately, rumors are
swirling that Lady Kaguya is
just a tyrant...

158
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,865
{\an1}"Annihilated...?"

159
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,669
{\an1}No wonder Mother has been
away a lot...

160
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,242
{\an1}Leave now. And never
return. Trust me. It's
for your own good.

161
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:43,510
Yes sir!

162
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:55,825
{\an1}[insects buzzing]

163
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,094
{\an1}(Hamura) Everything seems
to be going well.

164
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,199

165
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:03,767
What's that?

166
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,635
{\an1}Oh--no news is good news...

167
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:07,271
Elder Brother...

168
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,575
{\an1}Are you still thinking about
what that toad said to us?

169
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:13,511
{\an1}Oh. No... It isn't about
that, it's just...

170
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,646
Hm? [gasp]

171
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:22,155
{\an1}They're taking part in the
Ritual of the Divine Tree...

{\an1}(Hagoromo) What's going on?

179
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,640
{\an1}It's time. I just received
notice to serve the Divine Tree.

180
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:39,574
You can't!

181
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:46,482
{\an1}I have no choice in the matter.
This is a ceremony that Lady
Kaguya established ages ago...

182
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:53,258
{\an1}(Haori) Hagoromo, Hamura...It
was only for a short time, but
I'm glad I got to meet you two.

183
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,460
{\an1}It was great. Please
remember me.

184
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:57,962
Haori!

185
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,279
{\an1}(Hagoromo) Mother...

186
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,415
{\an1}Please end the Ritual
of the Divine Tree.

187
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:17,818
{\an1}That is not possible.

188
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:19,120
But, Mother!

189
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,725
{\an1}I will not allow defiance.
Not even if it comes from
my own sons.

190
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:26,262
{\an1}Then please tell me this...

191
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:30,300
{\an1}What happens to those who go to
the Divine Tree as part of
the Ritual?

192
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,802
{\an1}Why does no one ever return
from it?

193
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:38,876
{\an1}Just accept that the ritual
is a necessity...at least
until the others arrive here.

194
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:39,810
"The others?"

195
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,384
{\an1}Do not concern yourself with
that. You do not need to know
about them just yet.

[grunt]

197
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:52,024
{\an1}Hagoromo, Hamura... I'm going to
be leaving once more.

198
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:53,693
{\an1}Take care of things here.

199
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:54,560
Yes, Mother.

200
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,838
Elder Brother...
You aren't...

201
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:04,272
Yes.

202
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,909
{\an1}I intend to go and
climb that peak.

203
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:11,246
{\an1}If Mother finds out, you'll
be in a lot of trouble.

204
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,848
{\an1}I'm prepared to face that.

205
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:17,153
{\an1}Okay, Elder Brother.
We'll both go.

206
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,111
{\an1}Just what is this...?

207
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,813

208
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,085

{\an1}Elder Brother! Open this one.

it... You went beyond the peak,
huh?

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,811

Where are we?

230
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:17,792
{\an1}(Gamamaru) This is the Land
of Toads.

231
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,264
{\an1}(Hagoromo) What is this...

232
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,600
{\an1}...strange power that I'm
feeling?

233
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:26,802
{\an1}Really? Wow, I'm impressed!

234
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:29,606
{\an1}To think that a human can
feel the power here...

235
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:33,611
{\an1}What you're feeling is
called Sage Power, and
it flows naturally.

236
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:36,646
{\an1}(Gamamaru) If you use it...

237
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:41,819
{\an1}[grunt] even someone like me
can do something like this.

238
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:42,920
Wow!

239
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:43,889
[crash]

240
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:44,756
Come on.

241
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:53,299
{\an1}Now, this is what is know as the
Memory Stone.

242
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:54,635
"Memory Stone"?

243
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,106
{\an1}(Gamamaru) It contains a record
of everything that occurs above
ground...

244
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,344
{\an1}And with this stone, we can look
at what happened in the past...

245
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:08,250
{\an1}(Gamamaru) Long ago, that tree
fell out of the sky...

246
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:14,290
{\an1}And, as if in pursuit, your
mother Kaguya appeared here
shortly afterward.

247
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,863
{\an1}When your mother arrived, she
fell in love with the ruler of
this land, and in time...

248
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,366
{\an1}...she became pregnant with the
two of you.

249
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:29,874
{\an1}However...Kaguya's destiny with
humans was to be mistreated by
them. So she became their enemy.

250
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:35,648
{\an1}Kaguya acquired the power of the
Divine Tree, and your father was
sacrificed to it...

251
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,417
{\an1}...along with all of his people.

252
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:43,591
{\an1}But to make sure mankind didn't
perish, she revived some humans,
erased their memories...

253
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:45,459
{\an1}...and returned them to their
lives.

254
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:48,263
{\an1}Only Kaguya knows
the whole truth.

255
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:52,801
{\an1}Where did Mother come from
anyway? Why's she protecting
the Divine Tree?

256
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,102
Don't know.

257
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,608
{\an1}Perhaps it's related to the fact
that she came from far up in the
sky.

258
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,277
{\an1}But regardless, one thing is
clear...

259
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:07,552
{\an1}(Gamamaru) Ever since the Divine
Tree took root the Nature Energy
of this land has been depleting.

260
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,421
{\an1}But how could that happen?

261
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,727
{\an1}It isn't just from the land,
either, but from humans too.

262
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,229
{\an1}As long as the Divine
Tree exists...

263
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:21,834
{\an1}...then this great land will
wither, and all of us will
suffer the same fate.

264
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,112
{\an1}We're going to have to speak to
Mother about all of this.

265
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,381
{\an1}But do you think she'll
even listen to us?

266
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,654
{\an1}Hagoromo, the power that your
mother possesses is immense.

267
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:42,725
{\an1}So I have serious doubts that
you'd be able to confront her
directly...

268
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,295
{\an1}(Gamamaru) ...even if you are
her son.

269
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:50,768
{\an1}Very well... Then will you teach
me how to use Sage Power,
Gamamaru?

270
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,871
{\an1}Brother! You're not planning to
fight Mother, are you?!

271
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,775
{\an1}No, it's just in case...

272
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,176
Yes, I see...

273
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,782
{\an1}You've inherited Kaguya's power,
and if you were to acquire the
Sage Power, too...

274
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,451
{\an1}...then you'd definitely be able
to take her on.

275
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:06,753
However...

276
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:07,621
What is it?

277
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,724
{\an1}(Gamamaru) Teaching you Sage
Power... is quite risky.

278
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,093
And why's that?

279
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:16,397
{\an1}Is there any guarantee that
after you acquire Sage Power...

280
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:18,399
{\an1}...you won't become the same as
your mother?

281
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,804
{\an1}Gamamaru... After all this,
you're suddenly scared?

282
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:22,937
What was that?

283
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:26,408
{\an1}You're just contradicting
yourself, you know?

284
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,812
{\an1}I mean, why did you lie
in wait for us, then?

285
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:34,351
{\an1}Admit it... you planned to pit
us against Mother and make us
fight from the very start.

286
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:38,622
{\an1}[scoff] You're really pretty
shrewd for a human, aren't you?

287
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,727
{\an1}(Gamamaru) You see, I had a
revelation.

288
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,661
{\an1}(Hagoromo) Revelation?

289
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,965
{\an1}(Gamamaru) Yes. Well, a dream.
Toads rarely, if ever, dream.

290
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,736
{\an1}But that dream was more like a
prophecy...

291
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,272
{\an1}I dreamed of you battling
against Kaguya.

292
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,942
{\an1}And how did it end?

293
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,047
{\an1}I don't think his dream
went that far. If it did, he
wouldn't be so nervous.

294
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,552
{\an1}Ah! How can you see so far into
a toad's heart that clearly?!

295
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:05,754
Who are you?

296
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:08,591
{\an1}[water splashing]

297
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,967
{\an1}Alright, clear your mind...

298
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:22,507
{\an1}Simply feel the Nature Energy
all around you and then pull it
into yourself.

299
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:36,723
{\an1}He's quite a surprise...Hagoromo
has managed to acquire Sage
Power in no time at all.

300
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,968
{\an1}Mother! You're back sooner than
expected...

301
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:50,806
{\an1}And where exactly is Hagoromo?

302
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,509
{\an1}Elder Brother is still out
patrolling the village...

303
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:55,545
Hamura!

304
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,045
[flinching]

305
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:01,050
{\an1}Trying to hide things from
me is useless.

306
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,823
{\an1}[strong wind blowing]

307
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:09,427
{\an1}[flinching in pain]

308
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,531
{\an1}(Kaguya) Also useless. Even if
you try to repel me with your
Byakugan...

309
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:18,671
{\an1}...the Byakugan I possess
is far more superior to the
one you have.

310
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:03,558
{\an1}(Kaguya) Both of you broke the
law, didn't you? You went to
that forbidden peak.

311
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:08,965
{\an1}Hiding things from me is
useless. I can read all of your
thoughts and feelings.

312
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:13,070
{\an1}(Hagoromo) Well then...you must
know why we're angry with you,
Mother.

313
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:15,906
{\an1}(Kaguya) It seems that you were
in love with that young girl...

314
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:21,211
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Fabricated Past."

315
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:24,716
{\an1}(Hagoromo) You must have
believed in love at some point
in the past!
