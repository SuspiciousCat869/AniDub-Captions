It seems ordinary
methods won't work.

00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,687
Doesn't matter.

13

But everyone stay on your guard.

00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:40,273
So what was that
huge wave just now?

23
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,275
Somebody kept crying out.

24
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:46,012
What the heck are Guren
and that ogre doing?

Where's Guren?

‐Not sure.

‐Trust me, if I could, I would.

34
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,542
But there's nothing I can do.

My bats have gone silent.

Man, I'm gonna feel
this in the morning.

The kid!

00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,653
How'd he get mixed up
with Orochimaru's people?

49
00:04:55,388 --> 00:05:00,193
Listen, follow that person
and never let them go.

he's fallen in with them?

00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,777
Perfect.

53
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,712

‐Stop interfering, boy.

00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,046
‐Why, you‐‐ what are
you doing with Sasuke?

OROCHIMARU: [laughs] Beginning
the transference ritual.

‐What do you mean?

61
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,020
OROCHIMARU: That is his wish.

62
00:05:54,688 --> 00:06:00,481
He'll have the power he so
desires, and I will have him.

63
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,102
‐Like hell you will!

64
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,404
We're taking him back to the
Leaf Village, you rotten snake!

65
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,740
‐[laughs] Nonsense.

66
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:11,177
Returning to that place is
the last thing he wants.

67
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,013
‐Even so, home is
with the people

68
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:15,481
who care for him, not with you.

69
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:17,984
Nothing'll ever change that!

70
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:20,253
‐You really believe
that, do you?

71
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,991
‐Shut your mouth.

72
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:29,730
‐Forget him, or you'll
come to regret it.

73
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:32,132
‐I said shut up!

74
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,099
Yaaahhhh!

00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:36,269
‐Aahhh!

78
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,575
That was close.

00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,176
‐Kakashi Sensei!

80
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,545
‐Watch it, will you?

81
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,514
I bust my tail looking for you
and that's the thanks I get?

82
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,183
‐But Orochimaru was right here.

83
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,217
‐Are you nuts?

84
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:53,887
I'd have picked up
his scent by now.

85
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,823
‐I'm guessing this
was an illusion.

‐Huh?

89
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,334
‐Huh?

90
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,203
‐You all right, Naruto?

91
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:05,038
‐Everybody's in one piece.

92
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,941
‐But that doesn't mean
our problems are over.

93
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,544
‐Hm?

94
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:11,044
SHINO: Look.

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,448
‐Wait, they're‐‐

96
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,684
‐Yeah, they're acting strangely.

97
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:20,721
Something is messing with
their sense of direction.

98
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:23,056
They'd be useless
for recon right now.

99
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,958
‐Wait, are you serious?

100
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:28,461
‐Their behavior began to change
as soon as the fog settled in.

101
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:31,665
‐And Naruto just got
caught inside an illusion.

102
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:34,601
This is no ordinary mist.

103
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:37,571
Naruto, what exactly
happened out on that lake?

104
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,405
‐Huh?

105
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:39,906
Mm.

106
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,547
Well, there was sort of
a giant rampaging turtle.

107
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,349
It was going after
those guys from before.

108
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:49,983
[gasp]

109
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,151
‐Say what?

110
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:51,985
A turtle?

111
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,254
What, are you pulling our chain?

112
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,822
You're telling us
a giant turtle's

113
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,123
putting out all that chakra?

114
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:58,058
(SHOUTING) Aw, shut up!

115
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,794
I'm telling you what I saw, OK?

116
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,670
Something had to cause that
giant wave a minute ago,

117
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:05,071
didn't it?

118
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:09,442
And worse, Gamakichi said it was
the Three‐Tails when he saw it.

119
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:11,344
‐What?

120
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:12,779
‐Are you sure?

121
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,249
One of the tailed
beasts appeared here?

122
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:17,383
‐Yeah.

123
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,320
Didn't get a chance to
count the tails, though.

124
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,055
‐Kakashi.

125
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,925
‐I thought we'd figured
out their objective.

126
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,461
This makes things a
little more complicated.

127
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:32,098
At any rate, we need to make
our way out of this fog.

128
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:35,101
Then we can hash out what we've
learned and plan our next move.

129
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:03,570
OROCHIMARU: Well?

GUREN (VOICEOVER):
What was that?

138
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,408
‐You're all right.

139
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:42,909
‐Yukimaru.

140
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:49,516
GUREN (VOICEOVER): That's right,
I was fighting the Three‐Tails.

141
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,153
I must have lost consciousness.

142
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:57,824
Its power was more
terrible than I imagined.

143
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:01,935
The others were probably
lost in the swell.

144
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,004
If the Leaf are on
the move, I'd better

145
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,972
find Rinji and the others.

146
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,173
But in this fog‐‐

147
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,246
‐Yukimaru, what happened
to the Three‐Tails?

148
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,615
‐I don't know.

149
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,217
Everything just went
quiet after that.

150
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,520
‐I see.

151
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:24,758
‐I'm glad, though, that
you finally woke up.

152
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,393
You were moaning the whole time.

153
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:32,666
I kept saying your name,
but you wouldn't wake up.

154
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,867
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Huh.

155
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,570
He was watching over me
the whole time I was out.

156
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,308
‐Well, then, what do you say
we catch up with everyone?

157
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,343
‐Sure.

158
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,045
Although, actually‐

159
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,613
‐What is it?

160
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,751
‐Well, it's strange, really,
but I'm feeling kind of weak.

161
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,489
‐You‐‐ you have a fever.

162
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,091
Since when?

00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:58,592

00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,856
Do you see something?

169
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:23,857
‐Yeah.

170
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,826
We should head back.

171
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,326
‐OK.

172
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,599
[wings flap powerfully]

173
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:33,900
KAKASHI: Well, what's the word?

174
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,368
HINATA: You were right, Sensei.

175
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,604
There's nothing
ordinary about this fog.

176
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:41,241
The whole bank's teaming
with chakra, a huge amount.

177
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,144
What's more, the entire
lake has been enveloped.

178
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,847
It's everywhere.

179
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,915
‐I suppose our
conclusion was right

180
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,484
that the Three‐Tails
was responsible for it.

181
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,219
‐Looks that way.

182
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,856
And based on
Naruto's account, we

183
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,824
know the fog brings
on illusions.

184
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,694
It might be acting as a barrier.

185
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:03,103
‐Probably meant to keep us
from the lake, I'll bet.

186
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:04,404
NARUTO: We gotta do something.

187
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,406
That little kid
is still in there.

188
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,073
‐Huh?

189
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:07,808
What do you mean?

190
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,409
‐I was telling you about him.

191
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,744
Remember, Sakura?

192
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,445
You know, the guy
I ran into when

193
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:13,747
I was heading out this way?

194
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,181
‐Yeah, that's right.

195
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,550
‐Oh, that.

196
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,851
I thought you were delusional.

197
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,352
(SHOUTING) Listen,
I'm not an idiot!

198
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,955
I met him before
we even got here.

199
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,323
He's out there, all right?

200
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,091
I know what I saw!

201
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,192
‐On the lake.

202
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,228
‐Please believe
me, Kakashi Sensei.

203
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,196
This kid isn't even a ninja.

204
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,365
I gotta see if he's OK.

205
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,101
‐Sorry, Naruto, but it's
out of the question.

206
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,537
‐Kakashi Sensei!

207
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,004
‐I have no choice.

208
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,106
You were just caught in
the Three‐Tails' illusion,

209
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,543
almost killing one
of your comrades.

210
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:45,378
I can't allow you
to fly solo anymore.

211
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:48,148
‐I‐‐ I see what
you're saying, but‐‐

212
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,316
‐Even more importantly,
what are we

213
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,819
going to do about the
mission now, Sensei?

214
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,555
I mean, forget about this mess.

215
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,056
We still need to
figure out where

216
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,559
Orochimaru's hideout is located.

217
00:12:58,592 --> 00:12:59,893
‐I don't know.

218
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:03,537
The situation is starting to
spin out of control a bit.

219
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,272
It's not really my call anymore.

220
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,742
I've already sent Pakkun
back to the village.

221
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:14,214
Until we get orders from
Lady Tsunade, we wait.

222
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,617
For now, just steer
clear of the fog

223
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,520
and keep an eye out for the
Three‐Tails or those others.

224
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:20,486
Got it?

225
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:21,454
ALL: Got it.

226
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,570
PAKKUN: That's pretty much it.

227
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:37,504
‐Huh.

228
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,840
The Three‐Tailed
beast disappeared.

229
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,709
No one has seen it since
the last great ninja war.

230
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:46,012
For it to resurface
again in this form‐‐

231
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:48,481
‐I'll bet Orochimaru is
cooking up trouble again.

232
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,350
I can smell it.

233
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:52,318
‐Well, at least the good
news is the Akatsuki

234
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:54,988
haven't checked the
Three‐Tails off their list yet.

235
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:57,558
This could turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

236
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:00,126
Hopefully we can get
to it before they do.

237
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,434
‐True enough.

238
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,037
But if the members of the
Akatsuki get wind of this,

239
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,273
the beast will likely be
caught up in a tug‐of‐war.

240
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:10,343
We can't let any of
them lay claim to it.

241
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,178
‐We'll capture it, then?

242
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,881
‐I don't think
it'll be that easy.

243
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:17,217
But there must be some
kind of precedent for it.

244
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:24,658
I'll start digging in
the archives in a moment.

245
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:25,926
‐Right.

246
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,161
‐In the meantime, you can
start mobilizing the squad

247
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,564
members I've laid
out for you there.

248
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:31,397
‐Right away, milady.

249
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,443
‐[sigh] All done.

250
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:45,111
‐You were a
tremendous help today.

251
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,412
Thank you so much.

252
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,914
‐Do you really mean it?

253
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:48,849
‐You bet.

254
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,851
Keep up the good
work, all right?

255
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:52,018
‐Will do.

256
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,687
[bird chirping]

257
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:00,226
‐‐[panting] That's‐‐
that's it for me.

258
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,034
I'm out.

259
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,069
‐We've only just begun.

260
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,471
This is where the real
challenge will come.

261
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,173
‐Excellently put, Lee.

262
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:11,444
[laughs] There's no quitting
in the springtime of youth.

263
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,679
‐That is right!

264
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,848
We must sharpen our
awareness of one another

265
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,884
to better keep each other safe.

266
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,053
We will own our
taijutsu together

267
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,222
and form an unbeatable duo!

268
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,456
[both grunting with effort]

269
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,458
‐You're wearing me out with
all of your showboating,

270
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,392
you lunatic!

271
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,828
Knock it off!

272
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,832
‐Uh, Lee, do you remember
the point of this exercise?

273
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,066
‐[frustrated yell]

274
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,168
It is partner coordination.

275
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,572
Increasing synchronicity
through training‐‐ I think.

276
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,640
‐That's right.

277
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,241
And tell me, how's
it going there?

278
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,777
Would you say you're
in harmony with Tenten?

279
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,045
‐Uh?

280
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,747
LEE (VOICEOVER): She
is breathing hard.

281
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,682
Oh no!

282
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,551
‐I understand, Sensei.

283
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,954
I was focused on the goal
and not on my partner.

284
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:54,588
‐That‐a‐boy!

285
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,589
That's my student.

286
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,490
You catch on quick.

287
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,893
‐[sigh] Enough is enough.

288
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,302
We've been at this for five
hours straight already.

289
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,870
I can't do it anymore.

290
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,806
‐Well, I still have
energy to spare.

291
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,541
‐Right on, Lee.

292
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:09,843
As soon as Tenten's
caught her breath,

293
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,778
I'll come at you with
a little taijutsu.

294
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:15,448
And I'll be coming full
force, so don't you hold back.

295
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,082
‐What?

296
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,684
‐Yes, Guy Sensei.

297
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:22,088
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): [groan]
When's it going to end?

298
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,056
Huh?

299
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,025
Wait a minute, you guys.

300
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:25,559
Look!

301
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:26,760
[bird calls]

302
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,595
Lee: Are they calling us in?

303
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:29,763
GUY: OK, team.

304
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:30,631
To be continued.

305
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,397
[bird calls]

306
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,799
GUY: Now get going.

307
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,401
Show them the fruits
of your massive amount

308
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,670
of training today.

309
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,437
‐Right!

310
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,907
‐[sigh]

311
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,442
‐And that's pretty
much where things

312
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,410
stand for the time being.

313
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:46,446
I want you to find
Kakashi and the others

314
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,448
and lend your support.

315
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,350
I'm sure I don't
have to tell you

316
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:54,755
your most critical objective
is sealing the Three‐Tails.

317
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:59,025
‐To do it will require extremely
delicate chakra control.

318
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,602
Ino, you'll be a member
of the sealing unit.

319
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,070
Between the two of us,
and Hinata, and Sakura,

320
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:05,572
we shouldn't have a problem.

321
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,339
‐Right.

322
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:07,541
Count on me.

323
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,810
‐Tenten and Lee, you'll
be filling the gap

324
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:12,478
that Hinata and Sakura
will be leaving.

325
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:15,048
With the Three‐Tails
being in play here,

326
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,618
there's bound to
be a confrontation.

327
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,019
‐Don't worry about a thing.

328
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:21,922
‐We will fight with the
full power of our youth.

329
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:24,591
‐I'll lead you back
to their location.

330
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,959
Try to keep up.

331
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,438
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
If I have to keep

332
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:41,107
nursing the sick like this,
I'm going to collapse myself.

333
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:50,250
This is the second time I've
had to play nurse for the boy.

334
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:57,824
If you give him that
much medicine, he'll‐‐

335
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:01,502
Could those pills be the cause?

336
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:04,671
In any case, I can't go running
into battle now with him

337
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,273
in tow like this.

338

[coughing]

339
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:15,616
‐Hey, Yukimaru, snap out of it.

340
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:20,453
‐You know, I‐‐ I found a
place where I can return to.

341
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,955
It's with you.

342
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:24,157
[gasp]

343
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,426
‐Finally, I found it.

344
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,544
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Oh,
Naruto, our shift isn't over.

345
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:44,678
We're still on watch.

346
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,005
‐Hm.

347
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,840
Quit slacking off, will you?

348
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,174
‐Huh?

349
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,310
Hey, Sakura.

350
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:13,279
I've, uh, been thinking
about something.

351
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,381
‐Huh?

352
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:18,184
‐But I‐‐ I can't figure
it out on my own.

353
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:25,526
During Pervy Sage's training,
he used to say something to me.

354
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,528
‐You mean Jiraiya?

355
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,696
‐A place where people
still think about you

356
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,198
is a place you can call home.

357
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:34,901
‐Has a nice ring to it.

358
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,804
‐Yeah, but I wonder
if it's actually true.

359
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:44,244
If it is, then all you'd have to
do is keep thinking of someone,

360
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,512
and then they'd come back.

361
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,918
[wind picks up]

362
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:52,986
You'd think.

363
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,056
But I'm not so sure
about that, either.

364
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:00,627
All the longing in the world
won't bring some people back.

365
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,069
Sharing your true
feelings with someone,

366
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,639
it's not all that easy, is it?

367
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:09,776
‐But if you put them out of
your head and give up on them,

368
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,545
there'd be nobody
left to remember them.

369
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,245
It's terrible.

370
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,617
‐That's true.

371
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,819
If you and I give
up, there really

372
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,122
will be no place for
him to return to.

373
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,390
Yep, no matter what
the others say,

374
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,927
we just have to keep
putting our faith in him.

375
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,930
That way there will always be
a place for him to call home.

376
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:30,931
‐Yeah?

377
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,399
You think so?

378
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,868
‐'Course I do.

379
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,369
‐Yeah, you're right.

380
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,738
Giving up isn't an option.

381
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,506
We just have to hang in there.

382
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,142
Hm, I'm feeling a
whole lot better now.

383
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,177
Thanks, Sakura.

384
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,278
‐Any time.

385
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,748
I guess I'll be heading
back to my position.

386
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,716
The next two‐man team
will swap in for us

387
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,954
in another 30 minutes,
so stay alert, OK?

388
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,388
‐Thanks again, Sakura.

389
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,269
OK, then.

390
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,640
‐So if somebody somewhere is
thinking about me, wherever

391
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:10,511
that person is is
where I belong.

392

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No
matter what anyone says, just

393
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:14,581
keep thinking about him.

394
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:21,387
And if he has no
place to go, then I'll

395
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,057
be the one he can come home to.

I'm here to relieve you.

Everything's quiet so far.

Sai, your post is over there.

What's up?

SAI (VOICEOVER): Well,
I don't see Naruto.

KIBA (VOICEOVER): What?

406
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,449
Did that idiot head
for camp before someone

407
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,518
could switch with him?

I‐‐ I'm not sure.

Wouldn't we have crossed paths?

KIBA (VOICEOVER): We're
talking about Naruto here.

He's probably out sleeping.
