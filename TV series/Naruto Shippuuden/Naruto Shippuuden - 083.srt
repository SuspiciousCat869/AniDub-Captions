00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:16,008
Tell me, how's Naruto's
training coming Along

4
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,009
-According to
Kakashi-sensei, he's

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,080
finally grasped the principles.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,032
He should only require a
little more time to perfect it.

7
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,023
-I see.

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,155
-Milady, now that Kakashi-sensei
has joined team 10,

9
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,126
I think team seven
is the best team

10
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:33,177
to send after him, my team.

11
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:36,198
Because we've worked so
closely with him in the past,

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,109
we're the best choice.

13
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,151
-Very sharp, Sakura,
just as I'd expect.

14
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,042
-However, we have no
way of knowing just

15
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:47,034
when Naruto will perfect
this new jutsu of his.

16
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,254
Perhaps we should send
a different squad.

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,079
-Sakura, pass this on.

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,091
Tell Yamato to have Naruto wrap
it up in the next 24 hours,

19

and telling him
if he can't manage

20
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:06,193
that, I'll have to send a
different squad as backup.

00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,074

Put together a list of squads
that work well with team 10.

like to tweak it a little,

now that you're with
us, Kakashi-sensei.

-She agrees that we'd be the
best squad to supply backup.

She also said in order
for her to send us,

Naruto will have to master

-Yeah.

She says you've got the
next 24 hours to wrap it up.

Use this when you get a
chance, to Kakashi-sensei.

could come up with,

given the limited
information that we have.

Once you've got it
clear in your minds,

74
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:29,296
run through a mental simulation
of it at least three times.

75

path they took from the fire

trail they left.

there named Naruto Uzumaki.

are you going?

right into an Ambush No.

different way into the Leaf.

What do you suggest we do now?

-We can't do anything
until we've found them,

161
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,511
so that's still our
first order of business.

-Remember what they said?

-We'll be back in no time,
so prepare yourselves.

00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,386
Stay right where you
are til we get back.

166
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:11,418
-That's what they said,
but they wouldn't really

167
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,500
be stupid enough to return to
the same place, would they?

168
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,391
-Well, we've got the other team
watching the collection office

169
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,522
in case they do.

170
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,453
-The loud mouth guy
doesn't bother me so much.

171
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,385
It's the other one
that I'm worried about.

172
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,416
And I'm betting they'll
take a different route,

173
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,407
but they're destination
will remain the same,

174
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,498
whether they're after
the bounty on Asuma,

175
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:34,410
or the jinchuuriki
inside of Naruto.

176
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,551
In either case, they're
target is the Leaf.

177
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,373
-There are many approaches
to the leaf village,

178
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,454
a lot of territory to cover.

179
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,464
How do we find them?

180
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,177
-That's how, up there.

181
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,537
-Hm?

182
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,410
-I'm on it.

183
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,488
-There you are.

184
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,404
INO: Headed straight for the
Leaf, just as we thought.

185
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,488
INO: [gasps]

186
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:32,399
-What happened?

187
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,549
Are you all right?

188
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,430
-Oh, man.

189
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,521
That was close.

190
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,492
-Did they spot you?

191
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:40,473
-I think we're OK.

192
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:44,455
They're taking a different
route, just as you predicted.

193
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,536
If we head Northeast,
we'll run into them.

194
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,586
It'll take about 10 minutes.

195
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,541
-What the hell was that about?

196
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,553
-It was nothing.

197
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,514
Nothing at all.

198
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,536
-Then let's keep moving.

199
00:12:05,546 --> 00:12:06,416
-Right.

200
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,561
-All right.

201
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,492
Let's go.

202
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,505
-Hidan.

203
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:45,476
-I know.

204
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:49,508
-What?

205
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,488
-Paper bombs.

206
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:58,552
-Kakuzu!

207
00:12:58,562 --> 00:12:59,593
-I hardened my arm.

208
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:01,554
I'm fine.

209
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,435
Just watch out for the shadows.

210
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,398
-Ha!

211
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:12,449
We won't fall for
that trick again.

212
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,460
-Hidan, above you.

213
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,602
-More paper bombs.

214
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:19,603
Hidan, look out!

215
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,440
-(VOICEOVER): Huh?

216
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,571
It didn't detonate.

217
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,413
[gasp]

218
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:41,864
-We've been had.

219
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,512
-Shadow possession
shuriken jutsu, achieved.

220
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:04,475
-(VOICEOVER): I can't move.

221
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:05,576
-Little jerk.

222
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:08,477
How did you do it when
I dodged your shadow?

223
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,609
-What I threw it you
were chakra blades.

224
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,431
Not only did they
absorb the chakra nature

225
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:17,622
of whoever wields
them, they compliment

226
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:20,544
and augment his jutsu.

227
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,665
-What the hell is this
kid talking about, Kakuzu?

228
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:26,457
-Will you shut up, you idiot?

229
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,528
SHIKAMARU: In short, having
absorbed the users chakra,

230
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,659
the chakra blades become
an extension of his jutsu.

231
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,491
So you see, I wasn't
trying to hit you.

232
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:37,512
I was aiming for your
shadows the whole time.

233
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:40,484
It's Asuma's gift to
you, a little memento

234
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:43,595
of the man you killed.

235
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:46,647
-The one worth 35 million, huh?

236
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:47,607
-(VOICEOVER): Asuma.

237
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,630
-If I were picking pieces
to represent Leaf's shinobi,

238
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,581
you know what?

239
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,653
I'd say you are most
like the knight.

240
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,604
-Why is that?

241
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:03,475
-It's not the most powerful
piece of the board,

242
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,626
but it can leap over
any of the others.

243
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,557
It's a unique ability.

244
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,479
It reminds me how
flexible your mind is.

245
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,477
-(VOICEOVER): So these
paper bombs are fakes.

246
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,549
Just ordinary pieces of paper.

247
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,619
Now I see.

248
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,541
The first set of paper
bombs on kunai knives

249
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,632
were meant to mislead
us, to make sure

250
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:39,603
that we would try and elude
the second set, attached

251
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,484
to chakra blades.

252
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:44,526
He then distracted us again
by drawing our attention

253
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,477
to the ground with
his shadow play,

254
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:48,558
so we wouldn't notice
his attack from

255
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,649
above until the last minute.

256
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,530
By allowing us no
time to think, he

257
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,692
was able to pierce our
shadows and paralyze us.

258
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:00,574
Quite the little
tactician, this one.

259
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,699
-All right, then.

260
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,680
It's time to finish this.

261
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,610
-Hey!

262
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,601
What's wrong with you?

263
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:16,492
Why are you so quiet
all of a sudden?

264
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:17,643
What the hell were
you thinking letting

265
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,644
yourself get caught too, huh?

266
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,504
Hey, you know what I think?

267
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,706
Things aren't looking too good
for us, that's what I think.

268
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,587
-Yeah, you're right.

269
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,708
As a matter of fact,
by my calculations,

270
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,570
it's all over for
you two, right now.

271
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:43,716
-(VOICEOVER): Nicely done.

272
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:50,569
-You fool.

273
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,702
-Hey!

274
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:57,723
What's going on now?

275
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,544
What are you doing?

276
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:01,735
-Just want to get it right.

277
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:04,616
Don't want to make the
same mistake as last time.

278
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:09,559
I need to be sure not to mess
up our order of attack again.

279
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,669
-Not your lucky day.

280
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,592
I'm afraid you chose the
wrong one of us to start with.

281
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,713
-This time, I'm going to see
to it we finish this once

282
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:18,613
and for all.

-I never forget a face, kid.

286
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,626
Someday I'm going to find you
and I'm going to kill you!

287
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:26,758
-Oh, man.

288
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:28,709
You really don't get it, do you?

-Kakuzu, duck!

290
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:38,684

Yeah.

298
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,766
When I attacked them
with the paper bombs,

299
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,598
he must have hidden
his arm in the ground

under cover of the smoke.

301

It's such a drag the way
each of these Akatsuki

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,632
has unique powers.

all over yet, is it?

As you can plainly see, my
abilities are countless.

305

You'd be wise to retreat
and plan your next move.

That is, if you're smart,
unlike my partner here.

307
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,701
Just remember, all the battle
plans you make mean nothing

308
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:35,672

ground doesn't go as calculated.

SHIKAMARU: You're right.

327
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,680
That was a direct
hit on a vital spot.

328
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,790
INO: What's that on his back?

329
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,762
I'm sensing some
very bad chakra here.

330
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:15,853
SHIKAMARU: I think
things just got serious.

331
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:16,873
Watch your step, Choji.

332
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:17,864
CHOJI: Right!

333
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:19,857
KAKASHI: Seems this
Kakuzu has only

334
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,867
begun to show us the
tricks up his sleeve.

335
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:26,707
NARUTO: Next time,
Kakuzu's abilities.
