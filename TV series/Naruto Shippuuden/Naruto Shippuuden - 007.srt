Send word to the
Hidden Leaf Village,

apprising them of the situation.

173
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,429
Tell them we have an emergency.

00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:36,930
Now!

00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,199
-Sir!

176
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,968
(TO HIMSELF) As bad as
things are, I have a feeling

177
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,070
they're about to get
much, much worse.

-Don't worry.

184
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,535
I'm sure Lord Kazekage
will be back soon.

It's even better reading

But I guess I should
get some sleep.

Huh?

It's morning already?

Oh no, that's not good.

195
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,617
I still haven't made
up that personnel list

That's not it.

No.

Not that.

have my own village

to think about, you know?

207
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,185
I've been gone too long,
so since I'm finished here,

208
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,453
I thought I'd head back.

209
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,456
-Yeah, but without
having any breakfast?

210

-Oh, I'll find it tea house
or something along the way.

211
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,995
Come to think of it, what
are you doing up so early?

212
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,763
-Believe me, I wish I wasn't.

213
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,965
But I'm supposed to be
your escort while you're

in our little village, remember?

00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,036
It's a drag, but
it's my mission.

--[chuckling] Sorry to
be so much trouble.

at the chunin exams, huh?

-Yeah.

220
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,119
I'll see you then.

It's time you became a jonin.

You won't have any
problem if you just

225
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,862
stop complaining about
what a drag everything is.

Hmm.

What's the matter?

-I wouldn't have
thought it possible.

237

We're being followed.

We meet at last.

the one that carried off Gaara.

Which means his
companion's the one who

set the trap in the village.

Looks like that didn't work,

Today, we'll look at
the 44th Battle Training

00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,200
Zone, the second of
the chunin exam sites,

00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,803
also known as The
Forest of Death.

318
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,038
This training ground
is a circle with radius

319
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,741
of 10 kilometers,
surrounded by a fence.

320
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,910
Each team of chunin
candidates enters

321
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,646
through one of the 44
gates in the fence.

322

The gates are
locked behind them,

323
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,816
and the teams race
to see who could

324
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,819
be the first to reach the tower
in the middle of the forest.

325
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,787
This isn't just any forest!

326
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,189
The trees are huge!

327
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,659
And it's got giant centepedes,
enormous leeches, and tigers!

328

Don't even let me get
started on the snakes!

329
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,230
When I think of how we
had to deal with all that,

330
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,500
and find the scrolls, and
fight off all the other teams,

man, I get that creeps
just remembering it.

332
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,872
Anyway, the point is, if you
could survive that place,

333
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,874
you might one day
be as good as Gaara.
