-Guy-sensei, are you sure?

00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,253
-Absolutely.

6
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,655
I feel perfectly fine.

7
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,157
All I needed was a little rest.

8
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,192
-Well, Neji?

9
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,460
-It's all right.

10
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,263
His recuperative
powers are amazing.

11
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,264
-But what about--

12
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,366
-Don't worry about me.

13
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,166
I'm ready to go.

14
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,838
-All right, everyone.

15
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,373
To keep to our
schedule, we're going

16
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,975
to have to move double
time from here on in.

17
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,976
-Aw.

18
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,777
-No!

19
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,379
Let us make it triple time.

20
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,148
Then we might actually
arrive ahead of schedule.

21
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,483
-Good thinking.

22
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,986
As a matter of fact, why don't
we make it quadrule time?

23
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,225
Eh, what's the matter?

24
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,193
-That's not even
physically possible.

25
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,430
-Would you guys please
stop getting carried away?

26
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,500
-Uh, Sensei, perhaps triple
time would be enough.

27
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,567
-Lee.

28
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,403
I think even that's pushing it.

29
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,980
-All right.

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,614
It's time.

31
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,188
That's enough rest.

32
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,156
We should get moving.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,628
OK, you two.

34
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,362
Wake up.

35
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,432
We're heading out.

36
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,200
-Right.

37
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,002
-OK, in a minute.

38
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,371
Just give me a minute more.

39
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,273
-I thought you were
going to save Gaara?

40
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,510
-You bet I'm going to save him.

the final stage.

-What should we do about
these annoying pests?

-They're getting
closer, and more quickly

00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,405
than we anticipated.

-Not a problem.

51
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,508
We delayed them just enough.

52
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,009
Ignore them.

53
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,613
In any event, we
have a backup plan.

up and finish our business

here.

58
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,092
We'll want a moment
to catch our breath

before greeting our guests.

60

-Oh, yes, indeed.

61
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,731
We must be ready to give
them a warm welcome.

62
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:17,569
-Blasted nuisances.

63
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,772
They're such a pain.

64
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,874
-I never thought we'd have
so much trouble finding

65
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,343
a Jinchuriki.

66
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,444
-Calm down.

67
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:31,350
We each just need to
fulfill our own part.

68
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,351
-Enough talk.

69
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:35,354
Concentrate, all of you.

70
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,323
There can be no mistakes
from this point on.

71
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,732
-Each squad understands how
and where it is to be deployed.

72
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,567
Our Kazekage is missing.

73
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,936
We've done our best
to hide that fact.

74
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,040
However, you must act under
the assumption that news of it

75
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,541
has leaked out.

76
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,777
At this very moment,
neighboring lands

77
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,546
might be planning to take
advantage of our confusion

78
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,082
by launching an
attack, so don't think

79
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:40,018
of this as standard
border patrol.

80
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,219
Very well.

00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,088

leave will depart at once!

00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,832
-Are we sure this is the
right thing to be doing?

84
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,335
-What do you mean?

85
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,937
-After all, Lord
Gaara's been kidnapped,

86
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,672
and instead of
trying to rescue him,

87
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,474
we're marching back and
forth on the border,

88
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:05,544
waiting for an attack
that may not even come.

89
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,713
-They're orders from on high.

90
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,481
Ours but to obey.

91
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,350
-No!

92
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,118
Lord Gaara is one of us.

93
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,787
He's our Kazekage,
no one else's!

94
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,456
-You think I don't know that?

95
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:21,059
Are you forgetting
Gaara's my brother?

96
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,396
-Please forgive me.

97
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,297
-This way.

98
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,797
-Right.

99
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:42,914
-Something's not right.

100
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,317
-Do you sense something, Neji?

101
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,451
-The enemy?

102
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,053
-Just the opposite, in fact.

103
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,689
I can't detect any
trace of the enemy.

104
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:53,725
That's what's so disturbing.

105
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,595
They were so intent
on delaying us.

106
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,998
Using such a powerful jutsu.

107
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,932
-So what do you think?

108
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,334
-Could it be that they--

109
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,209
-They're confidend they've
delayed us long enough.

110
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,277
-Yes, indeed.

111
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,613
I'm starting to
think the same thing.

112
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,081
-But that means--

113
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,973
CHIYO: What's he--

114
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,875
-Hang on, Gaara.

115
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:17,876
We're comin'.

116
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:28,954
-Naruto, not so fast!

117
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,889
Wait up!

118
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,857
Oh, brother.

119
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:38,330
-Why's that boy pushing
himself so hard to save Gaara?

120
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:42,634
He's not even from
the same village.

121
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,269
What is he?

122
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,972
What's that boy's story?

123
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:50,342
-Naruto is a
Jinchuriki, as well.

124
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,545
He has the Nine Tailed
Fox sealed within him.

125
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,254
It's not that he has any special
feelings for the Hidden Sand,

126
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:06,925
or its people, but he and
Gaara are both Jinchuriki.

127
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,031
Naruto knows how Gaara feels
better than anyone in the Sand

128
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,100
ever could.

129
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,003
After all, those
who are Jinchuriki

130
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,906
have been treated the
same way in every village.

131
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:40,625
That's why he feels this
desperate need to save Gaara.

132
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,394
It doesn't matter
whether Gaara's

133
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:46,998
from the Sand, or the
Leaf, or anywhere else.

134
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,434
He's a friend, the
only friend who's

135
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,670
felt the same pain
Naruto's felt.

136
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,178
Naruto's dream is to
become Hokage, so the news

137
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,249
that Gaara had been made
Kazekage hit him pretty hard.

138
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,451
-I see.

139
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,354
So Gaara was named Kazekage.

140
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:13,492
-He was frustrated, but at the
same time, deep in his heart,

141
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,128
he was profoundly
happy for Gaara.

142
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,330
-Well, I'm not about
to be outdone by him.

143
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,636
I'm still going to
be Hokage one day.

144
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:28,140
Just you wait, Gaara!

145
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:33,645
-You see, Naruto has
another remarkable gift.

146
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,248
He doesn't need
much time, or many

147
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,784
works to make friends with
almost everyone he meets.

148
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:48,460
-As for me, I've
lived a long life.

149
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:52,964
I've seen many things
over the years.

150
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,402
I thought I'd come to know
the ways of the world.

151
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,938
I knew that alliances
with foreign lands

152
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,774
were just for show,
and not to be trusted.

153
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:05,343
I knew that the only
way the Sand Village was

154
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,245
to be protected is
if I did it myself.

155
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:21,660
It was my jutsu that sealed
the Shukaku in young Gaara,

156
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,297
after consulting with his
father, the Fourth Kazekage,

157
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,932
of course.

158
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,334
I truly thought I was
helping my village,

159
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,871
but in fact I was jeopardizing
its very existence.

160
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:35,907
And now I find that my
peoples' survival depends

161
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:40,445
on one of those alliances with
a foreign land I never trusted.

162
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:44,216
I seem to have been
wrong about many things.

163
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,651
Perhaps everything.

164
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,787
I am old and weary.

165
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,291
I want nothing more
than to just give up.

166
00:14:53,325 --> 00:15:00,765
Oh, Kakashi, when I look at
them and see their youth,

167
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,771
their potential, I
envy them so much.

168
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,772
-No, no.

169
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,874
Your life has only just begun.

170
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,576
You're still young.

171
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,379
[laughter]

172
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,150
-Perhaps you're right.

173
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,419
Maybe there is some
purpose for keeping

174
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,755
an old bag of bones
like me around.

175
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,295
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): There
must be something I can do.

176
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,104
[groaning]

177
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,378
-It's almost finished.

178
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,616
[groaning]

179
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,422
GAARA: Whose hand is this?

180
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,161
It's-- it's mine.

181
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,404
Does this mean I've become
someone that people need?

182
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:18,643
Who's that?

183
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:22,514
Is that me?

184
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:31,156
Yes, it's me.

185
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:35,627
Me wanting to be
needed by someone.

186
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,529
Why?

187
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:38,997
Why did I want that?

188
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,502
Why did I yearn for that?

189
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,376
Those eyes.

190
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,345
That nose.

191
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:56,781
That mouth.

192
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,282
Why?

193
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,153
Why is that Gaara?

194
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,725
I was in there.

195
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:09,160
No.

196
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,497
What am I, anyway?

197
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm only aware of being me.

198
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:20,071
So who am I?

199
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:25,076
Am I anything more than just
this small consciousness?

200
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,328
-It is complete.

201
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:04,883
-Finally.

202
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,086
-So in the end, it did take
three full days and nights.

203
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,055
Hm.

204
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:16,060
-It seems to get more
exhausting every time.

205
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,429
-My shoulders are stiff.

206
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,801
-Well done.

207
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,068
Good work, everyone.

208
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,804
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): That
can't be a good sign.

209
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,872
Dammit!

210
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,474
If only there was
something I could do.

211
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:19,357
-So, this is the place?

212
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,893
-Gaara's on the other
side of that boulder.

213
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,996
-It won't be easy getting
past that barrier.

214
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,264
-What's the plan?

215
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,966
ROCK LEE: We smash our way in.

216
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:28,533
-No, Lee.

217
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:31,836
-Huh?

218
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,576
-Late as usual, Kakashi.

219
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,680
-Well, you see, we ran into a
little trouble along the way.

220
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,948
-Naruto!

221
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,949
Sakura!

222
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,684
-Wait a minute.

223
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,055
By a little trouble, you don't
mean me, do you, Kakashi?

224
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,957
-Well?

225
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,259
-Naruto.

226
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,028
-Looks like we were just
a step behind you guys.

227
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:57,862
-Yeah.

228
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,464
Who's that old lady?

229
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:00,398
-Oh.

230
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,799
This is Lady Chiyo.

231
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,102
She's an adviser from
the Sand Village.

232
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,304
-Very pleased to meet you.

233
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:10,275
-Well then, let's
do this, Kakashi.

234
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:10,775
-Right.

235
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,747
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Hang on, Gaara.

236
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,248
Just hang on!

237
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,297
[theme music]

238
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,817
GUY: Listen up.

239
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,886
The title of the next
episode, Button Hook Entry,

240
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,589
refers to the ninja tactic
of breaking through a barrier

241
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,392
by deploying themselves to
the left and right of it.

242
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:10,028
This, of course, is not to be
confused with my own Dynamic

243
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,264
Entry, which is not a
jutsu, as some people

244
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,832
think, but an effective
technique when

245
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:15,967
speed is of the essence.

246
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,636
It also makes an excellent
diversionary tactic.

247
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,604
There.

248
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,239
Now you're ready
for a test, or maybe

249
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:22,774
even a mission of your own.

250
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,676
[LAUGHTER

251
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:28,513
NARUTO: Next time, Charge
Tactic, Button Hook Entry.

252
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,350
[theme music]

253
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,794
KAKASHI: The Leaf
Village fashion report.

254
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:45,963
Today we'll be taking a look
at some indispensable shinobi

255
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,398
accessories.

256
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,400
Number one, the Leaf headband.

257
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,235
It tells the world
you've been recognized

258
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,904
as a full fledged shinobi.

259
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:55,840
Not only handy in defense,
but a tasty fashion statement,

260
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:56,841
as well.

261
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,409
It's usually worn
over the forehead,

262
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,744
but it doesn't have to be.

263
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:02,980
Everyone has their
own individual style.

264
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,249
Next is this shuriken
and kunai set.

265
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,217
Very practical.

266
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,252
Useful in all kinds of combat.

267
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,754
Of course, no set's
complete without

268
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:11,956
a handsome and handy holster.

269
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,991
Finally, there's the
official Leaf vest.

270
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,294
With this vest's
convenient compartments,

271
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,829
you'll never have
to fumble around

272
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,530
for scrolls in the
midst of battle.

273
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,666
They're right there
at your fingertips.

274
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,568
-And if you act
right now, you'll

275
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:26,904
also receive this waterproof
ventilated form fitting action

276
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,172
suit!

277
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,341
-Thanks, but I don't think
anyone's really interested

278
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,042
in one of those--

279
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,310
-Not interested?

280
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:35,446
Are you crazy?

281
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,148
-Well, until next time.

282
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,117
So long.
