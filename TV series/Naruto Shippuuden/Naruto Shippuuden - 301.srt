{\an1}Who are you
aiming at?!

00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:21,008
{\an1}What can we do?!
You're too fast
for our attacks!

{\an1}[groan]

4
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:26,812
{\an1}I'll say it again.
I use Lightning Style.

5
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:29,348
{\an1}And when I arm myself
with Lightning Style..

6
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:33,784
{\an4}my speed and defensive
power exceed the limits
that my body normally
puts on them.

7
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:38,687
{\an1}So unless you attack
with Wind Style, you'll
never be able to stop me.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,190
{\an1}But even with Wind Style,
we can't land a blow!

9
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:44,325
{\an1}No...

Instead of doing it quietly,

25
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,353
{\an1}We haven't
inflicted
any damage!

{\an1}Yes.

{\an4}The Third Lord Raikage was
blessed not only with speed
and power but also extraordinary
physical resilience.

31
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,949
{\an4}Even long distance Wind Style
attacks, the only ones that
can reach him, cannot deal
him a decisive blow.

32
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:29,286
{\an1}We need a
more powerful
Wind Style User.

33
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,656
{\an1}Well, I'm not a half

myself, you know...

34
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,759
{\an1}So how did he
actually die,
anyway?

35
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:46,464
{\an4}In order to let his people
get away, he used himself
as a decoy and faced ten
thousand of the enemy alone.

36
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:53,869
{\an1}It's said that he lasted for
three days and three nights to
buy his comrades enough time.

buy me some time...

39
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:05,779
{\an1}..so that at last I can
finish up summoning him.
I guess I'll take over.

by himself in an

102
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:43,610
{\an4}The fewer the fingers he uses,
the more focused the energy,

his Lightning Style also
makes his body impenetrable.

If he's as impenetrable
as you say he is, then
how'd he get that?

{\an1}Oh, that.

00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:35,513
{\an1}He was wounded when
he stopped Eight Tails,
who was on a rampage.

119
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,782
{\an1}Lord Third fought him
by himself to protect
the Cloud.

{\an1}You mean the Eight
Tails hurt him?!

121
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,020

the most shameful
moment of his whole
life.

122
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:49,657
{\an1}But other than saying that,
he never spoke of it any
further at all.

123
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,926
{\an1}Not even Lord Fourth
knows the details.

{\an1}Hmm..

125
00:10:54,961 --> 00:11:00,063
{\an4}Okay, I get that ordinary
attacks won't affect him.
But if he got injured
fighting the Eight Tails...

126
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:03,700
{\an1}And the Eight Tails'

He's just about the same
age as the two of us!

138
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,175
{\an1}Yeah, that's right!

139

to defeat Pain of the
Akatsuki!

140
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,581

an enemy that even the hero
of the Hidden Leaf village
can't?

out right now?!

<i>You've battled the</i>
<i>Third Raikage before,</i>
<i>right?</i>

206
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:56,717
{\an7}<i>Yeah, a long time ago.</i>
<i>He was really strong</i>
<i>and could take some</i>
<i>serious punishment.</i>

207

00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:32,753
{\an7}<i>I don't know what Naruto means</i>
<i>to do, but that's an ordinary</i>

{\an7}<i>And it's faster.</i>
<i>Now I just need</i>
<i>to get out of the</i>

226
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,208
{\an7}<i>I can aim right</i>
<i>for his arm!</i>

227
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,925
{\an1}It worked!
t's just like I
thought it would!

228
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:31,427
{\an1}<i>I see, so that scar</i>
<i>on his chest.. that's</i>
<i>how it happened!</i>

{\an1}[victory grunt]

230
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,703

00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:45,772
{\an1}[cheering,]
Yeah, all right!
Nice work, Naruto!

232
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,773
{\an1}Yeah!

233
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,607
{\an1}That was quite
a sharp move.

234
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,311
{\an4}When I talked with him,
the EIght Tails told me
that when he fought
against the Third Raikage,

235
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:56,545
{\an1}..both of them fell
forward, ready to
attack.

236
00:19:56,578 --> 00:20:02,050
{\an4}I just figured he must have
gotten the scar by stabbing
himself in the chest with
his own move.

237
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,820
{\an1}That's why he was
always so embarrassed
about it.

238
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:13,291
{\an4}A shinobi with an invincible
spear and an impenetrable
shield. It certainly does
pose a paradox.

239
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:16,760
{\an1}I guess this shows
that Lord Third's
spear is more powerful.

240
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:22,464
{\an1}Mhm.

241
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:28,002
{\an4}You know, I'd say
the shinobi who has
the best shield is
now probably Gaara!

242
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,743
{\an1}In my heart, I always
knew you'd would become
Tsuchikage one day.

243
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:44,347
{\an4}But just look at you now!
You're nothing more than
a stubborn old fool with
a bad back!

244
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,551
{\an4}I'll admit that punch had
some real power to it,
but you overdid it and put
yourself out of commission!
