prone to seasickness.

00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:40,757
{\an1}Please, just let me off!

Oh, come on! It's just
seasickness, ya wimps!

11
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,207
{\an1}Knowing what it is
doesn't make it any
easier...

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,546
{\an4}We should go dock
somewhere and wait for
us and the weather to
get better.

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,917
{\an7}I agree.

14
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:02,794
{\an4}We'll have to go a bit
off course, but that's
okay. There's an island
to the east of here.

15
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:06,934
{\an1}I think it's uninhabited.
And it's inside the
neutral zone.

16
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,638
{\an1}Let's see...
Ah! here it is!

17
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,710
{\an7}Wherever it is, just go
there!

{\an1}Hey, over here! It's
good to see you!

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,641
{\an1}What in the world
are you doing here?!

{\an1}It was awful! Everyone
else was getting sick!

34
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:43,428
{\an1}So you came here to let poor
Guy Sensei recover, huh?

[groaning]

36

{\an1}But... Why are you here?
A mission?

37
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,943
{\an7}That's right. Lady
Tsunade assigned
it to us.

38
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,784
{\an1}<i>We're going to the</i>
<i>eastern sea, too? </i>

39
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,289
{\an1}The Fourth Great Ninja
War will soon begin.

40
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,229
But before
it does...

41
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:07,668
{\an1}We have to gather herbs
for medicine and for
food pills.

42
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,572
{\an1}Ah...! Right there...

43
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:14,112
{\an1}<i>Nanakusa Island. It's a</i>
<i>treasure trove of</i>
<i>medicinal herbs. </i>

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,850
{\an1}<i>I've marked sites where</i>
<i>they can be found. </i>

45
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:23,328
{\an1}Let's see: Mandra Plant,
Energy Ginseng, Huge Mato
Plant, and Red Newts, too.

46
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,131
Wow, there sure
is a lot there.

47
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,134
{\an1}Wait, what is this?

48
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:32,008
{\an1}Go there only if you have
the time. Understood?

49
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:32,876
Right.

50
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:36,449
{\an1}So you're the team
captain on this mission?

51
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,418
Mm-hmm.

52
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,454
{\an1}Guy Sensei fell asleep.

53
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,189
{\an1}Huh?

54
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,959
{\an1}Okay, everything's
all ready.

55
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,928
We can get goin'
anytime you want,
guys.

56
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,933
{\an1}Hey! The remnants
of Team 10 without
Shikamaru.

57
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,169
Naruto! We
aren't remnants!

58
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:51,040
{\an1}Yeah, at least call us
the leftovers!

[grunting]

60
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,045
{\an7}Gimme a break, you're
one to talk, you know.

61
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,017
{\an7}Team 7's been scattered
all over the place 'cause
of you.

62
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,219
{\an1}What...?

63
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,556
That's right. Sai's
been sent on another
mission as well.

64
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,499
{\an1}Oh, I see... That means
that everybody is doing
something important...

65
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,137
{\an1}I feel like I should be
doing something, too!

66
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:13,545
{\an4}Uhhh... yeah, but
Naruto! You're about to
start a big mission of
your own!

67
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:16,383
{\an1}After all, that's the
whole reason for this
journey.

68
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,553
{\an1}Well, I guess so, but--

69
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:23,728
{\an1}I have an idea. You can't
set sail until Guy Sensei
feels better, right?

70
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,531
Why don't you come
and help us 'til then?

71
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:28,403
{\an1}What? Really? Just
gathering herbs?

72
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:32,209
{\an1}Yep, you got it, just
gathering herbs. Pretty
easy, right?

73
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:35,448
{\an1}<i>Wrong! How many guesses</i>
<i>is that?! </i>

74
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,284
<i>Uh, is it</i>
<i>this?</i>

75
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,956
{\an7}What are you even looking
at?! That's totally
different!

76
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:45,431
{\an7}Ugh, come on! I have no
idea what I'm doing! This
doesn't even come close
to being easy!

77
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:50,405
{\an4}Aw, man, I should've just
stayed back with the others
and kept an eye on Guy
Sensei.

78
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:56,483
{\an5}Once Guy Sensei is back
to feeling better, I think
we're gonna have to discuss
our sailing schedule with him.

79
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:59,522
{\an1}But if I stayed there,
I'd only be killing
time...

80
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:02,627
{\an1}<i>Here. You can use this as</i>
<i>a example. </i>

81
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,700
{\an4}You know, once the Fourth
Great Ninja War begins,
people are gonna start
being injured.

82
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,470
Could be hundreds
or even thousands.

83
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:14,480
{\an5}And this work is
absolutely essential if
we're going to be able to
treat all of them.

84
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:15,514
{\an1}Right.

85
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:19,588
{\an1}[sighing]

86
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:24,462
{\an4}Lady Tsunade said this is
a treasure trove of
herbs, but finding them
sure is difficult!

87
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,465
Should we look somewhere
else?

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,470
{\an1}We better go and check
out the higher elevations.

89
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,075
{\an1}We need to find all
the ingredients for
food pills.

90
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,477
Sure, okay.

91
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:34,981
We can never have enough
of those!

92
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,419
{\an1}<i>Hey! Wait for me! </i>

93
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:41,725
{\an1}Mmm.
[gagging]

94
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:43,428
{\an1}So bitter!

95
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,966
{\an1}Welp, at least I
know how they taste!

96
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:51,240
{\an1}All right! Let's find
'em!

97
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:52,241
Naruto...?

98
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:56,683
{\an1}This one? Nope! This one?
Nope! This one? Nope!

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,954
{\an1}Wait! I think I got one!

100
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:06,032
{\an4}Well, it kinda tastes
like one, but it kinda
tastes like something
different, too...

101
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,504
{\an1}It's so weird... You'd
think the Mandra Plant
would be growing

102
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:11,808
{\an1}practically everywhere
around here.

103
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:15,681
Maybe the weather just
wasn't right. Hey!

104
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:17,517
{\an1}Energy Ginseng!

105
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,688
Great! Good eye, Choji!

106
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,557
{\an1}It's coming in really
nicely.

107
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,562
{\an1}These'll make great food
pills.

108
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,365
<i>Not so fast! </i>

109
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,534
{\an1}Uhhh?!

110
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,569
[grunting]

111
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:35,014
{\an4}Sorry, but we were here
first. That patch of
energy ginseng is ours
for the taking.

112
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:40,355
{\an4}Based on your headbands,
I'm guessing that you're
all from the Hidden Leaf
Village.

113
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:42,191
{\an1}Who are you?

114
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:46,466
{\an4}Well, I guess I shouldn't
expect someone from the
Five Great Nations to
know anything about

115
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,335
{\an1}us little
country folk.

116
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:55,681
{\an5}The three of us are
shinobi from Benisu
Island down in the
southlands.

117
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,584
My name's Bando;
I'm a jonin.

118
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm Sada, a genin.

119
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:00,456
I'm Kiji.

120
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,394
We heard that the next
Great War could begin at
any moment, so we came

121
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,865
over here to gather
some medicinal herbs.

122
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,266
{\an1}<i>No wonder! </i>

123
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,806
{\an1}That's why we couldn't
find anything no matter
how hard we looked.

124
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,578
{\an1}You guys got here
first and picked
everything.

125
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:16,850
{\an1}You're right. We've
covered just about every
site here.

126
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:21,390
{\an4}But look, we don't want
to be the bad guys and
leave you in a bind.
Here.

127
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:22,425
<i>Right. </i>

128
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:25,931
{\an1}<i>Really?! </i>

129
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:30,139
{\an1}Thank you so much, Bando!
This'll help the Allied
Shinobi Force!

130
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,710
{\an1}Sure thing! I'm
only happy to help
out.

131
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,411
{\an1}Okay, then...

132
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,053
{\an1}Hm!

133
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,761
All right, let's see
here... carry the one--

134
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:47,134
What do you say to this
amount for each one of
those bushels?

135
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,769
Isn't that a
little much?!

136
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:52,276
{\an1}Oh! You Hidden Leaf ninja
sure drive a hard bargain!

137
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:57,350
{\an5}This is absolutely the
lowest offer that I can
give you, though. There,
does that sound better?

138
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,053
{\an1}You want us to
pay you for them?

139
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:01,456
{\an1}I thought you were just
giving it to us!

140
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,460
Huh?!

141
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:08,269
{\an4}You've got to be kidding!
If a small nation like
ours just gave everything
of value away, then we'd

142
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,539
{\an1}never be able to survive!

143
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:14,746
{\an4}But, fine, if the Hidden
Leaf isn't interesting in
buying from us, we can
sell to other feudal

144
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,152
{\an1}lords in other lands.
It's no skin off my nose.

145
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:22,025
{\an1}Shinobi aren't the only
people who get wounded
in a war, after all.

146
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,798
{\an7}And you want to make
as much money as you can
off their suffering, is
that right?!

147
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,936
{\an1}You get money for the
missions you take on,
don't you?

148
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,941
<i>You price them</i>
<i>by rank, right?</i>

149
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:32,943
{\an1}Right.

150
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:35,747
{\an1}Look, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:40,155
{\an4}But try to understand. We
don't have the resources
you Great Nations have,
but we still have to

152
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,459
{\an1}raise money for our
self-defense.

153
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:43,761
Here we go!

154
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:44,997
{\an1}Here we go!

155
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,535
{\an1}Pick one for the money, it
makes the whole world go
round.

156
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,143
{\an1}And then Pick two for
money, it's the truest
treasure to be found.

157
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:59,487
{\an4}Pick three, pick four,
pick them by the pound.
Pick five, pick six, the
riches will abound. It's

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,423
{\an1}like pulling money right
out of the ground!

159
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,127
{\an1}What should we do now?

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,196
{\an1}We can't complete our
mission like this!

161
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:09,337
{\an5}I agree completely, but
we can't just grab their
stash and take it from
them, either.

162
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,744
{\an4}No, of course not! It
wouldn't be right, and
besides, we can't start
trouble with other

163
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,149
{\an1}shinobi or we'll threaten
the Allied Shinobi Force!

164
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,021
{\an1}<i>I don't know what you're</i>
<i>so worried about. There's</i>
<i>plenty to go around! </i>

165
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:22,659
{\an1}This island is a treasure
trove of herbs, right?

166
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:27,600
{\an4}So what if someone took
the herbs from all around
here? We'll just go and
look somewhere else!

167
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:31,874
{\an4}Yeah, exactly. There are
rare herbs waiting to be
picked all over this
island.

168
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:36,048
{\an4}But just because they're
out there, that doesn't
mean they'll be easy for
you to get.

169
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,187
{\an8}Bando's right. Most of
them are hard to get to.

170
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,090
Leave everything
to me, then.

What's wrong with you?

{\an1}My tummy... it's hurting.

{\an3}Uh...

182
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:09,704
{\an1}I don't get it. How can I
get a tummy ache from eating
nothing but medicinal herbs?

183
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:14,379
{\an7}Oh no, Naruto! Instead
of medicine, maybe you've
eaten something
poisonous!

They left these so more
would grow next year.

to throw him back.

Yeah!

I'd be glad to pay.

Nah, I told you: this
one's on the house.

323
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:18,117
{\an5}Just because we're
shinobi from another
land, that doesn't have
to make us enemies.

324
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,219

together.

Let's just be grateful

Oh. Sure.

it.

That's awesome, thanks!

came from, too.

{\an7}Yeah! Thank you very
much!

You guys are awesome!

340
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:15,246
{\an1}No, not us! You're the
awesome ones! We've all

{\an1}Bando... Are you sure
about all this?

344
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,381
{\an1}You gave them stuff for
free!

345
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:42,291
{\an4}Not quite. It's only
free until I call in this
debt with the Allied
Shinobi Force.

346
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,427
{\an1}It's a loss now for
a gain later.

347
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:45,595
{\an8}Ahhh!

348
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,473
{\an1}Now... we must say
farewell!

349
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:55,345
But only for a short
while. And best of all,
thanks to this trip,

350
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,316
