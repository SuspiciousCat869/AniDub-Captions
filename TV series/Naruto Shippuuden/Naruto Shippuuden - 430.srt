1
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,802
Acrobat!

2
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,122
{\an1}So the Jinchuriki can
fight a little...

3
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,027
{\an1}I'm infallible!  But
I can't be affable!

4
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,701
{\an1}Itachi! If you know where
Sasuke is, then tell me!

5
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,881
Sasori! Deidara!
I'm done here.

6
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:54,052
{\an1}What do you mean,
you're done?!

7
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:55,955
{\an1}I'm leaving the Akatsuki.

8
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,227
{\an1}Wait? You're what?! Really?!

9
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,530
{\an1}I'm leaving and so is Nagato.

10
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,267
{\an1}Hey! Come back here!

11
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,405
{\an1}So what now, Sasori,
my good man?

12
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,508
{\an1}Do you even need to ask?

13
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,878
We'll take them
down ourselves!

14
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,747
{\an1}It's three against two.

15
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,215
Doesn't matter.

16
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:18,821
{\an1}I guess you're right. Humph!
I'll show them my art!

17
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,160
What is that?!

18
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,194
Hey, you!

19
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,696
{\an1}What are you doing,
causing trouble in

20
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,031
{\an1}the Hidden Waterfall?!

21
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,637
Who's that girl?

22
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,507
{\an1}Seven Tails' Jinchuriki!

23
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,810
She is?

24
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,111
Hey, Chomei!

25
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,015
{\an1}Fuu, they're comrades.

26
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,820
{\an1}Comrades? Of mine?

27
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,189
Hey, Jinchuriki!
They're the enemy!

28
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,029
{\an1}I have no clue what
you're trying to say!

29
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,300
{\an1}It's four against two...

30
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,234
Retreat.

31
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,403
What?!

32
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,176
{\an1}But I will get you next time!

33
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:01,780
What?! They're
running away?!

34
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,893
{\an1}You're Fuu of the Hidden
Waterfall, right?

35
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:13,095
{\an1}Yo, gimme a fist bump!

36
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,648
{\an1}Hold on. What's the matter?

37
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,416
You seem kinda
shady, mister.

38
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,954
{\an1}Whatchu talkin' 'bout, baby?

39
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,090
{\an1}C'mon girl, gimme a fist bump!

40
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,294
{\an1}Now what's wrong?!

41
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,764
{\an1}Did you forget the
whole shady thing?

42
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:41,836
{\an1}Aw, what're you talking
about? C'mon!

43
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,839
{\an1}Yo, just gimme a fist bump!

44
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,773
No way!

45
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:45,908
Fist bump! Now!

46
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:46,776
No way!

47
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:47,911
{\an1}Just give it here!

48
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:48,845
I said no!

49
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,613
Give it!

50
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,081
No way!

51
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:54,787
{\an1}Just hold your fist out and
give him a bump, okay?

52
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,024
{\an1}Yeah! Gimme a fist bump!

53
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:58,124
No!

54
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,609
{\an1}Just wait! You've
got a duty to fulfill!

55
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,511
{\an1}As if! I don't take
orders from another

56
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,180
{\an1}village's shinobi!

57
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,550
Please, listen.
We're comrades.

58
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,352
{\an1}You could even say
we're friends.

59
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,890
{\an1}Friends? Really? Friends?

60
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:24,628
{\an1}That's right. You do not
have to be alone.

61
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:38,614
{\an1}Whoa! Looks like Fuu's
softened up to Gaara!

62
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,316
{\an1}This started out with
trouble, but the

63
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,852
{\an1}result is acceptable!

64
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,589
{\an1}Y'know, Octopops, I
think your goatee

65
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,224
{\an1}and shades are to blame.

66
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:49,128
Hey, shut up! On
to the next one!

67
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,836
{\an1}Ten Tails? What's that?

68
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:57,007
{\an1}It's a giant weapon the
Akatsuki summoned!

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,044
{\an1}It absorbed the Tailed
Beasts' chakra, which is why

70
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,380
{\an1}we can't use our full power.

71
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,817
{\an1}But right now, Ten
Tails can't summon

72
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,619
{\an1}its full power either.

73
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:09,590
{\an1}The princess of Rappu Castle
sealed it away. But the Ten

74
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:13,396
{\an1}Tails will reach ultimate power
on the night of the full moon.

75
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,666
{\an1}The Akatsuki'll go to the
castle and target the

76
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,002
{\an1}princess. Unless every
Jinchuriki comes

77
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:21,373
{\an1}together, we won't have a
chance against Ten Tails.

78
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:25,412
{\an1}And so the Nine of us have
gotta protect the princess

79
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:27,515
{\an1}and her fortress! Yea!

80
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,995
{\an1}Yo, gimme a fist bump.

81
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,402
What was that?!
What's the big deal?!

82
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,377
{\an1}Hey, Son Goku! Tell your
jinchuriki we are not enemies!

83
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,913
Hear that?

84
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:51,682
Yes. I'm sorry.

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,686
{\an1}There have just been a lot
of suspicious characters

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,254
{\an1}around these parts lately.

87
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,424
So I assumed you
were with them.

88
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,295
{\an1}Listen, I'm telling you,
the goatee and shades

89
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:02,764
{\an1}make you look suspicious.

90
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,568
{\an1}Chillax! There's no need to
critique my physique!

91
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,572
What "suspicious
characters?"

92
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,309
{\an1}I don't know who they are...

93
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:14,513
{\an1}But they've been kidnapping
children from our village.

94
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:23,226
It appears to be
tracking prey.

95
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:24,928
Chomei!

96
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,065
{\an1}Go and chase 'im away!

97
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,166
Agreed.

98
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:32,739
Scale Powder!

99
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:38,346
A summoning?

100
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,820
{\an1}Interfere, and there
will no mercy.

101
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,389
Huh?! Sasuke?!

102
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:46,958
Naruto...

103
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,529
{\an1}They allowed you to
leave the village?

104
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:52,432
{\an1}Who cares? You're going
back there right now!

105
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,602
I don't take
orders from you!

106
00:07:54,636 --> 00:07:57,339
{\an1}You're the one who's been
kidnapping the children?!

107
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,442
{\an1}And what if I am?

108
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:03,447
{\an1}Sasuke! I knew you were
Orochimaru's underling, but

109
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,484
{\an1}I never thought you'd stoop
this low!

110
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,022
You don't even
know about Itachi!

111
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,090
{\an1}Don't you dare say his name!

112
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:13,196
{\an1}Itachi deserted the Akatsuki!
And he's looking for you!

113
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,831
He what?!

114
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,399
My, my...

115
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,306
{\an1}A gathering of Jinchuriki. I
wonder what you're planning?

116
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,110
Orochimaru...

117
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,948
You're probably
close to helpless because

118
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:30,452
{\an1}your Tailed Beast powers
have been stolen from you.

119
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:34,557
{\an1}Sasuke, shall we destroy
them together?

120
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,561
{\an1}Orochimaru, I'm done here.

121
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,201
{\an1}What?! What does that
mean, "you're done?"

122
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,503
{\an1}I'm going after Itachi.

123
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,007
Hey, stop!

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,109
Naruto!

125
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,644
{\an1}Don't forget our mission!

126
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,213
{\an1}You're behind the
kidnappings!

127
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:53,150
{\an1}And for that, I'm going to
punish you for your behavior!

128
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,453
{\an1}You're a powerless
Jinchuriki...

129
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,556
I wouldn't make
idle threats!

130
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,928
Summoning Jutsu!

131
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,570
{\an1}What are you going to do
now? [chuckling]

132
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,208
Son Goku!

133
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,577
[roar]

134
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,119
Lord Orochimaru!

135
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,754
I'm okay!

136
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,329
{\an1}I'm all out of chakra...

137
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,797
Shukaku!

138
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:29,067
[roar]

139
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,042
Lord Orochimaru!

140
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,244
I'm okay!

141
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:37,712
My turn!

142
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:43,753
Lord Orochimaru!

143
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:45,690
I'm okay...

144
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,491
{\an1}Tailed Beast Lariat!

145
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,335
Lord Orochimaru!

146
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,737
{\an1}I'm not going to lie,
I've been better...

147
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:58,574
Take this!

148
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:06,419
Well, then?!

149
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:07,387
Got 'em!

150
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,122
{\an1}No, that's just shed skin.

151
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,560
{\an1}Even weakened, the Tailed
Beasts still pack a punch

152
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,029
{\an1}when they join forces.

153
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:15,530
{\an1}He's as tough as ever.

154
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:17,066
{\an1}But he looks worn out!

155
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,969
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru...

156
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:20,671
{\an1}I'll get you next time!

157
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,909
{\an1}That's one problem down.

158
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:27,748
{\an1}Now, Roshi, come with
us so we can put a stop

159
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,317
{\an1}to the Akatsuki's plot.

160
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,455
All right. Next.

161
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,724
{\an1}We'll join Yugito
and the others.

162
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:43,536
{\an1}I couldn't locate Yagura,
the Three Tails' Jinchuriki.

163
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,174
{\an1}He was nowhere in
the Land of Water.

164
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:47,675
Any clues?

165
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:50,646
{\an1}There's a rumor that
supposedly Yagura is heading

166
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,716
{\an1}to some wetlands somewhere.

167
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,719
{\an1}But I can't verify it.

168
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,256
{\an1}Does that matter? Even if
you can't verify it, we

169
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,591
{\an1}still need all the
Jinchuriki, right?

170
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,962
{\an1}Yeah, unless every
Jinchuriki is there

171
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,466
{\an1}together, we can't
beat Ten Tails!

172
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,969
{\an1}The Akatsuki will begin
their attack the next time

173
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:09,239
{\an1}the moon's full, 'cause
that's when the seal

174
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,075
{\an1}on Ten Tails will weaken.

175
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,178
All right, how
much time's left.

176
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:15,848
{\an1}About seven days. I
say we split up and

177
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,317
{\an1}search for Yagura.

178
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,652
I agree.

179
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,788
{\an1}Because otherwise, we'll
have to fight the Akatsuki

180
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,391
{\an1}one member short.

181
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,494
{\an1}We'll split into two-man
teams and search in all four

182
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,963
{\an1}directions, no exceptions!

183
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,600
{\an1}All right, everyone! Whether
we find him or not, make

184
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,771
{\an1}sure you're at Rappu
Castle in seven days!

185
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,307
{\an1}Let's go, Yugito!

186
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:37,177
Huh?

187
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,490
{\an1}I look forward to
working with you.

188
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,625
Okay, then...

189
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,212
{\an1}You see anything?

190
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,582
{\an1}No. Too much mist.

191
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:08,888
{\an1}Well then I'll check
around in Sage Mode.

192
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:17,934
What's that?!

193
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,170
What's wrong?

194
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,605
{\an1}They're Leaf shinobi...

195
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,909
{\an1}And they're here looking for me.

196
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,051
Get on.

197
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:37,562
{\an1}It seems that no one wants to
give Jinchuriki their freedom.

198
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,664
Yeah...

199
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:42,302
{\an1}To them, we're just dangerous
Tailed Beasts vessels.

200
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:45,206
{\an1}But we're not dangerous, and
neither are the Tailed Beasts!

201
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,097
{\an1}You're Yagura, the
Three Tails' Jinchuriki.

202
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,470
{\an1}Yo, gimme a fist bump.

203
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,972
I refuse.

204
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,376
Isobu, tell him
what's going on!

205
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:15,514
{\an1}Look, I know that these two
seem suspicious, but they're

206
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,950
{\an1}Jinchuriki and they're
friends, too.

207
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,655
{\an1}Jinchuriki have no friends.

208
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:25,828
{\an1}You see, for us, simply existing
fills people with fear, and

209
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,064
{\an1}with resentment and hatred.

210
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,868
{\an1}Sometimes people from
our own village hunt us.

211
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,340
{\an1}That's our fate as
Jinchuriki.

212
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:38,145
{\an1}So I want no part of this.
I'll stay here, alone.

213
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:41,249
{\an1}We really need your power.

214
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,285
Begone!

215
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,122
{\an1}Please, come with us.
This is your destiny.

216
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,561
{\an1}I'm tired of destiny being
forced upon me!

217
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,669
{\an1}Shall I use force?

218
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,138
{\an1}No, you just stay
out of this.

219
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,513
{\an1}We're all Jinchuriki,
just like you are.

220
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:05,417
{\an1}The fate forced on me
as a Jinchuriki

221
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,885
{\an1}is more than enough!

222
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,694
{\an1}Whether it was forced upon
you or not, it's still your

223
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,462
{\an1}fate. You gotta deal with it!

224
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,397
Shut up!

225
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:16,766
Just listen...

226
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:20,070
{\an1}Fool, ya fool, your destiny
is something that you just

227
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,340
{\an1}gotta see through,
no matter what!

228
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,679
[attacking yell]

229
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:32,688
Bee!

230
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,991
Why didn't you!

231
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:39,230
{\an1}We're Jinchuriki,
just like you are.

232
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:42,635
{\an1}We don't resent you, fear
you, or hate you.

233
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,738
{\an1}Now, gimme a fist bump!

234
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,978
Come on. Combine
your power with ours.

235
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,750
{\an1}It's almost the night
of the full moon...

236
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,285
{\an1}Why isn't Octopops here?

237
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,088
He's the one who
planned all of this!

238
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,693
{\an1}It's not just one person that's
missing; it's really three.

239
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,196
{\an1}Look, are we gonna be
able to pull this off?

240
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:29,099
{\an1}It seems doubtful.

241
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:32,003
What should we
do, Aunty Yugito?

242
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,070
What was that?!

243
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,844
{\an1}Oh, I mean. Big Sis Yugito.

244
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:39,580
{\an1}We have no choice but to
maintain faith that Bee and

245
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,183
{\an1}the others will show up.

246
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:42,350
It's the enemy!

247
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,032
Go!

248
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,770
[charging yell]

249
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,608
{\an1}Let's join in! Humph!

250
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:03,179
No need to rush.
Wait for moonrise.

251
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,751
[battle cry]

252
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,922
{\an1}Those weird Akatsuki
guys are moving in!

253
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:12,526
{\an1}Stop them! Don't let them
get inside the castle!

254
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,396
[attacking yell]

255
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,702
{\an1}Water Style: Bubble Jutsu!

256
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:22,440
{\an1}Lava Style: Scorching
Rocks Jutsu!

257
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,945
{\an1}Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

258
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,014
[battle cry]

259
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,363
{\an1}Looks like we're going to
have to get involved. Hmph!

260
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,599
{\an1}That's not necessary.

261
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,505
[roar]

262
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,342
{\an1}The Gedo Statue?!

263
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,879
{\an1}They're gonna attack us
with that huge thing?!

264
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,617
{\an1}It's not at full strength,
but it should do.

265
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,654
{\an1}But there's no art to it!

266
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:00,927
{\an1}It's a Tailed Beast Bomb!

267
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:05,332
{\an1}Damn it! I'm not strong
enough to stop it now!

268
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,884
{\an1}Are you guys all okay?

269
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,061
{\an1}All right! Now charge!

270
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:51,998
[attacking yell]

271
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,200
{\an1}Oh, no! This is bad!

272
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,004
Steam Dash!

273
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,347
Wait, that's-!

274
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,918
{\an1}Stay calm, my friends!

275
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,756
{\an1}Now that we're here, you
don't have to worry!

276
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,593
Sorry I'm late.

277
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,528
{\an1}It's about time, Octopops!

278
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,265
{\an1}You did it! You found
Yagura and Three Tails!

279
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:20,003
{\an1}Yeah! All nine of
us are together!

280
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:23,074
{\an1}Now, you Jinchuriki!

281
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,852
Raise your fists
up into the air!

282
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:32,687
Yeah!

283
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,102
{\an1}What is happening?!

284
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:45,538
One Tail.

285
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:46,372
Two Tails.

286
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,441
Three Tails.

287
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:48,408
Four Tails.

288
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:49,477
Five Tails.

289
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,478
Six Tails.

290
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,613
Seven Tails.

291
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,348
Eight Tails.

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,784
{\an1}And Nine Tails, y'know!

293
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,924
{\an1}We are the Jinchuriki! And
we stand against you!

294
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,463
{\an1}Actually, that is
kind of artsy!

295
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:06,433
{\an1}It doesn't matter now if
they're together.

296
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,761
{\an1}Wait, what! They have Tailed
Beast Bombs too!

297
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:27,196
And what of it?

298
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,313
Shukaku!

299
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:41,682
Matatabi!

300
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,683
Isobu!

301
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:43,819
Son Goku!

302
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:44,787
Kokuo!

303
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,855
Saiken!

304
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:46,856
Chomei!

305
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,025
Gyuki!

306
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:49,193
Kurama!

307
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:03,246
{\an1}This is really not good.

308
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:20,837
{\an1}Don't think that you've won!

309
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,508
{\an1}Next time, I swear you're
going down! Humph!

310
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,987
[relieved sigh]
Man, am I tired.

311
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,224
