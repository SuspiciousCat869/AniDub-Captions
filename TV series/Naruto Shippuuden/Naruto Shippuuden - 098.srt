[shattering sound]

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:09,710
‐What the?

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,451
‐Huh, they broke
down the barrier.

4
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,354
These Leaf ninja
aren't that bad at all.

5
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,657
‐Guren.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,925
‐Hey, what are you?

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,828
Hmm.

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,295
‐Kakashi Sensei.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,198
‐Reinforcements, huh?

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,167
‐Is everyone OK?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,468
‐Naruto, was that?

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,470
‐Yeah, the collaboration
ninjutsu we've

13
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,372
been working on
with Pervey Sage.

14
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:40,774
‐Really?

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,176
‐Now it's my turn
to have some fun.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,244
OK, you.

17
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,445
Don't try to escape.

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,580
‐Huh.

19
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,815
So another big
talker has shown up.

20
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,551
Are you all like this?

21
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,820
‐Hinata, you lousy.

22
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,022
Just what have you
done to her, huh?

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,424
‐Hmm hmm.

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,927
NARUTO: What's our next
move, Kakashi Sensei?

25
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,169
KAKASHI: As you can see,
Hinata's been taken hostage.

26
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,005
So we've got to keep our cool.

27
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:07,140
We can't just rush
in against her.

28
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:10,010
Besides, any shock, and
that crystal might shatter.

29
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:11,177
And Hinata with it.

30
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,746
‐A tricky situation.

31
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,314
‐Ha ha ha.

32
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,983
(VOICEOVER): We we will look
for an opening from above.

33
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:18,184
(VOICEOVER): Right.

34
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:19,252
‐You will realize that
you have only one option.

35
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,353
‐Hey, Gamatatsu, you
ready for one more?

36
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,454
(VOICEOVER): If you
return to your village,

37
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:21,988
and leave me alone,
I'll release the girl.

38
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:22,689
‐Yeah.

39
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:24,691
But just one more, OK.

40
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:28,261
‐I've got to control my chakra,
so Hinata doesn't get hurt.

41
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:32,999
‐Don't move.

42
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:33,967
‐Now Gamatatsu.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,835
(VOICEOVER): Wait.

44
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:35,468
‐Wind style.

45
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:35,902
Tall water pistol.

46
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,442
‐Huh.

47
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:45,311
‐My crystal style can
crystallize anything.

48
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:48,649
You'll need about ten more years
experience to challenge me,

49
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,350
boy.

50
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,184
Crystal style:

51
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:52,586
Burst Crystal Falling Dragon!

52
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,456
‐Run, Gamatatsu.

53
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,135
‐Is everybody all right?

54
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:02,603
‐Yes sir.

55
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,541
(VOICEOVER): Man, what
the heck was that?

56
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,577
‐She not only
crystallized your jutsu,

57
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:13,113
she turned it against you.

58
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,381
Listen Naruto, I'll
get her attention.

59
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,250
When you see your
chance, grab Hinata

60
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:18,451
and get her away from here.

61
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:18,952
Got it?

62
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:19,919
‐But‐‐

63
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,354
(VOICEOVER): Naruto,
Hinata's safety

64
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,189
is our top priority right now.

65
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:24,691
‐All right.

66
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,326
‐What are you hiding for?

67
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,194
There's nothing you
can do as long as I

68
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:29,796
hold your little friend hostage.

69
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,674
Huh, it looks like
they're giving up.

70
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,375
‐Let Hinata go.

71
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:45,345
Take me as a hostage instead.

72
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:45,846
‐Nice try.

73
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:50,283
Huh.

74
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:55,622
‐Naruto, now.

75
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,057
‐Go, Gamatatsu.

76
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,535
[squeaking]

77
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,003
‐Oh no, you don't.

78
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,472
Uhh.

79
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,612
Dammit all.

80
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:12,979
Just look at my clothes.

81
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,014
(VOICEOVER): Guren.

82
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:17,984
Are you all right?

83
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:19,285
‐Yeah, yeah.

84
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,021
(VOICEOVER): I'm so
relieved to hear it.

85
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:24,958
‐Huh, they can sure move fast
when they're running away.

86
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,893
Rinji, keep an eye out.

87
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:27,994
Don't lose them.

88
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:28,729
‐Will do.

89
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:35,268
[theme music]

90
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,820
‐Way to go, Gamatatsu.

91
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,989
OK, you can spit her out now.

92
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,224
‐Be careful.

93
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,025
Gently now.

94
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,892
Nice and easy.

95
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,233
‐That's it.

96
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,603
Nice and easy.

97
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:37,504
That's the way.

98
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,105
Put her down slowly.

99
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,574
Slowly.

100
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,008
[fly buzzing]

101
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:42,509
‐Huh.

102
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:46,813
‐Hinata.

103
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,781
‐Unbelievable.

104
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,151
How could you do
that, you blockhead?

105
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:51,652
‐Oh.

106
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,686
Oh no.

107
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,253
No.

108
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:53,954
Stop cracking.

109
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,955
Stop cracking.

110
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,156
‐Hinata.

111
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:56,623
‐Hinata.

112
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:03,570
‐It stopped.

113
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:04,871
‐Damn.

114
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,907
Guess I'm too late.

115
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,575
‐Pakkun.

116
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,611
‐They finished analyzing
that insect of Shino's.

117
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,313
There's no mistaking it.

118
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:16,216
The enemy uses some kind
of crystal style jutsu.

119
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:18,051
‐Yes, we know.

120
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:21,454
‐The researchers say the effect
on the insect was thorough.

121
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,625
That thing was crystallized
inside and out.

122
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:28,094
‐So it was true what she said,
that her crystal style works

123
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:29,429
on anything.

124
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:32,432
‐Even Sai's super beast scroll
was completely crystallized.

125
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,601
This jutsu is a problem.

126
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,936
‐That's putting it mildly.

127
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:39,405
It's like I said, its
effects are thorough.

128
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,907
‐You mean‐‐?

129
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,375
‐Yeah.

130
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,811
They found that even the
insect's bodily fluids

131
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:45,712
were crystallized.

132
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,212
‐What?

133
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:47,213
But then‐‐

134
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:48,348
‐Hinata.

135
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:51,852
She's going to be OK,
right Kakashi Sensei?

136
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,319
‐Uhh, yeah.

137
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:56,489
We need to get her back to
the village immediately.

138
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,423
‐That's right.

139
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,358
Grandma Tsunade.

140
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:00,801
Grandma Tsunade
will fix everything.

141
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,869
‐OK, calm down Naruto.

142
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:04,638
[crystal shattering]

143
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,806
‐No, Hinata.

144
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,482
‐Sakura.

145
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:17,150
‐It's all right.

146
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,318
She's alive.

147
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,385
‐What a relief.

148
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,921
‐Yeah, I'll say.

149
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:21,822
‐Phew.

150
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,957
I was scared for a minute.

151
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,791
‐Idiot.

152
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,093
Dropping her for a lousy fly.

153
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:30,864
‐Huh, what is it, Shino?

154
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:34,868
‐I was remembering what happened
to one of those insects.

155
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,738
After it was captured by
the crystal style jutsu,

156
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,673
it shattered in my hand.

157
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,543
And yet, Hinata survived.

158
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:43,944
‐It's true.

159
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:46,713
The same thing happened with
those crystals we encountered.

160
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:47,313
They shattered.

161
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,520
What do Hinata and the
insect that was sent back

162
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,821
to the village have in common?

163
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,559
‐Uhh.

164
00:07:58,592 --> 00:07:59,392
‐Be careful, Hinata.

165
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,367
Take it easy.

166
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,305
‐When I saw that I was going
to be hit by her jutsu,

167
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:08,374
I released chakra from all
my chakra points at once,

168
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:10,143
and surrounded myself
with a barrier.

169
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,881
‐I see.

170
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:18,351
So her crystal style doesn't
work on everything after all.

171
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:20,353
It can't crystallize chakra.

172
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:23,023
Hmm, quick thinking
in a tight spot.

173
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:25,091
Well done, Hinata.

174
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,092
‐Thanks.

175
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,228
‐Yeah, that was awesome.

176
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,163
Of course, I expected as much.

177
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:31,164
‐Woof.

178
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,634
‐Well, I'm glad you're OK.

179
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,738
‐I'm sorry, Naruto if I, well,
if I caused you any worry.

180
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:40,206
‐Hey, you don't
have to apologize.

181
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,975
Don't be silly.

182
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,845
‐Naruto.

183
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,713
‐All right, then Kakashi.

184
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:47,714
What do we do now?

185
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:48,682
Any thoughts?

186
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:52,719
‐Well, that depends.

187
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:53,419
‐Uhh.

188
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:54,688
I'm all right, sensei.

189
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:55,656
Really.

190
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,423
‐Don't push yourself.

191
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:01,094
‐We're lucky Hinata was the
only one hit by that jutsu.

192
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,436
‐Since we don't have any
countermeasures to this crystal

193
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:06,540
style, caution's the
best policy for now.

194
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:07,941
‐We should have gone after them.

195
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:09,209
Why'd we let them go?

196
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:11,645
‐I share your
frustration, Naruto.

197
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,147
We certainly don't want
to lose track of them.

198
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,281
‐He's right.

199
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,951
Remember how much trouble
it was finding them?

200
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:20,020
If we let them go, who
knows if we'll ever

201
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,455
be able to pick up
their track again?

202
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:23,289
‐All right, then.

203
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,457
Here's the plan.

204
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,760
There are enough of us
to split into two groups.

205
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:29,530
So, Sakura and Sai, you two
will stay here with Hinata

206
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:31,031
until she's recovered.

207
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,132
‐Right.

208
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,868
‐The rest of us will try
and pick up their trail.

209
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,237
Of course, since they
leave no scent behind,

210
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,573
it's impossible to
track them that way.

211
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:40,907
Even for Akamaru.

212
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,043
‐They don't make it
easy for us, do they?

213
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,345
‐But, how are we
going to track them,

214
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,213
if they're impossible to track?

215
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,783
‐I think we might be able
to use those surveillance

216
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,051
bats of theirs.

217
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,719
But we can't get too close.

218
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,755
We don't want them
spotting us first.

219
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:58,725
However we go, we have to move
deliberately and cautiously.

220
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,060
‐That makes sense.

221
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,903
‐Doesn't sound like fun,
but I guess it's a plan.

222
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,137
‐One more thing.

223
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,772
We have to be very
careful if we run

224
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,942
into any more of those
crystal barriers.

225
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,611
If you do find
any of these guys,

226
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,813
don't try to attack
or capture them.

227
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,449
After all, remember our
mission is to investigate them.

228
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,450
Got it?

229
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,785
‐Got it.

230
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,088
‐If you're done with us, I
guess we'll be on our way.

231
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,923
‐Thanks.

232
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,658
See you next time I need you.

233
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,627
‐I'll be heading
home too, Kakashi.

234
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,961
That all right?

235
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,229
‐OK, Pakkun.

236
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,565
Thanks for your help.

237
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,799
‐Well, see you later.

238
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,700
‐Bye, bye everybody.

239
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,403
‐All right then.

240
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,171
Let's move out.

241
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:06,306
‐Guren.

242
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,007
‐What is it?

243
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,709
Is everything all right?

244
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,944
‐I met somebody that I know.

245
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:11,745
‐What?

246
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,146
‐So, who was it?

247
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,915
‐The boy with the headband.

248
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,650
‐Headband, huh?

249
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,852
Could it be that
kid we just saw?

250
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,887
‐You say you knew
this boy from before.

251
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,423
Tell me how.

252
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:24,625
‐Oh yeah.

253
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:27,393
I met him when I was with
Kabuto the other day.

254
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,230
He told me about how we all
have a place to go home to.

255
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:34,367
He even asked me if I
wanted to go there with him.

256
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,203
But then I decided
not to go, because I

257
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:40,006
think there's somewhere else
I'll go home to some day.

258
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,142
‐A coincidence, you think?

259
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,109
‐Must be.

260
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:44,377
There's no way
they could possibly

261
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,948
know that Yukimaru has
anything to do with us.

262
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:50,150
All right, Guren, what's
our next move going to be?

263
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,819
‐There's only one move.

264
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:53,854
You're a good boy.

265
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,522
You did the right thing.

266
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:58,458
There's no where for you to
go home to with those people.

267
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,366
Your home is with me.

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,234
‐Yeah.

269
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,703
‐But this boy.

270
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:05,506
If he's a friend of yours,
I'd like to meet him.

271
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,274
Do you remember where you
saw him this last time?

272
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:09,843
(VOICEOVER): You
going to track him?

273
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,244
‐Yeah.

274
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,980
Once I decide to go after
something, I stick with it.

275
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,116
That's just the way I am.

276
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,886
(VOICEOVER): That's a
dangerous habit, Guren.

277
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,154
‐Kabuto.

278
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,690
‐If you're not careful, it
can get you into trouble.

279
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,592
‐What do you mean?

280
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,361
‐You don't feel even
a little bit guilty?

281
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,030
Because from what I
just heard, you're

282
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:33,366
very lucky they didn't take
this boy away with them.

283
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,337
And you know what would happen
if you were to lose Yukimaru.

284
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,374
Guren, you would also lose
Lord Orochimaru's trust.

285
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,782
‐I'm sorry, but the
rest of you will

286
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,517
have to stay here
and keep an eye out

287
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:52,819
for those meddlesome leaf ninja.

288
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,856
The last thing we want right
now is any kind of distraction.

289
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:56,957
‐Hold on.

290
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,424
You're really planning
on leaving us here?

291
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:03,103
‐Rinji, just shut up,
and do what Kabuto says.

292
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,838
‐If you say so.

293
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,840
Very well, I will obey.

294
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,875
‐Nothing personal.

295
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:09,876
All right, let's go.

296
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,687
From this point forward,
the fewer witnesses

297
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:22,055
there are, the better.

298
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,323
‐Why do you say that?

299
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:25,325
Is there something you
don't want people to see?

300
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:28,194
‐Well, it's not something
most people see every day.

301
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,495
That's for sure.

302
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,897
Just keep rowing.

303
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:31,898
You'll find out.

304
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,037
Is anything wrong?

305
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,838
‐Kabuto.

306
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:40,807
I, I have a bad feeling.

307
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,710
The last time I took the
medicine it made my head

308
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,011
hurt a lot.

309
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,146
‐Don't worry.

310
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,214
Everything's going to
be perfectly all right.

311
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:50,116
And if anything
does happen, Guren's

312
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,719
here to take care of you.

313
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,487
‐You are?

314
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,756
‐Yeah.

315
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:56,790
Of course I am.

316
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:06,807
‐I knew it.

317
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,510
It was a big mistake taking
our eyes off those guys even

318
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:10,777
for a minute.

319
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,879
And now we have to try and
pick up their trail again

320
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:13,814
from scratch.

321
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,516
‐And what's even
worse, we've got

322
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,884
to watch out for
those stupid bats.

323
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:19,653
‐There is another option.

324
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:20,787
Risky perhaps, but.

325
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,594
‐Sounds to me like you've
got an idea, Shino.

326
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,664
‐As Naruto said, keeping
away from the bats,

327
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:33,166
only makes our job
more difficult.

328
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,235
Perhaps we should reverse
our way of thinking

329
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:39,039
and, instead of avoiding
them, we use them.

330
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,406
‐Eh, how do we do that?

331
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,775
What do you mean?

332
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:44,678
‐If we continue to stay out of
the range of the bat's sonar,

333
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:47,180
they won't detect our presence.

334
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,249
And if they don't
detect our presence,

335
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:51,251
they won't report
back to their master.

336
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:52,452
‐Yeah, of course.

337
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:53,987
I think I get it now.

338
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,189
‐Now that You mention
it, you're right.

339
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,291
Good thinking, Shino.

340
00:14:58,324 --> 00:14:59,560
‐Hey, wait.

341
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:00,426
What's the plan?

342
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,368
Does everybody get the plan?

343
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,037
‐What do you mean, do we get it?

344
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,138
Who wouldn't get it?

345
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,541
We're all chunin and
jonin here, aren't we?

346
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,642
Oh, I forgot.

347
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,810
One of us is only genin.

348
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,877
‐Shut up.

349
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,279
You trying to pick a
fight, or something?

350
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,147
Anyway, I get it.

351
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,248
I get it.

352
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,217
I was only making sure
everybody else did.

353
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,019
‐You sure about that? huh?

354
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,756
‐To get back to my
idea, what do you say?

355
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,190
‐I say we try it.

356
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,760
Naruto, create
three shadow clones.

357
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,729
Spread them out about
10 meters apart,

358
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,797
and send them running
through the woods.

359
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,665
‐What?

360
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,633
But if I do that,

361
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,634
‐Just do it.

362
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,467
‐OK, fine.

363
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,268
I'll do it.

364
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,203
I'll do it.

365
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,005
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

366
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,079
But aren't those bats sure
to detect us if I do this?

367
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,814
‐That's just what we want.

368
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:48,314
‐Huh?

369
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,622
‐I see one.

370
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,723
It's working.

371
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,792
A bat wouldn't be
flying in daylight

372
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,535
unless it had somewhere
important to go.

373
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:02,302
‐All right.

374
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,837
After it everyone.

375
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,271
‐So, what's the deal?

376
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,908
Why are we following
a bat, any way?

377
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,975
‐I knew it.

378
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,477
You never understood
the plan, did you?

379
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,779
Think about it.

380
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,781
That bat's going to make a
beeline back to it's hideout

381
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,983
to let the enemy know
that he found us, right?

382
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,984
‐Mm hmm.

383
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,753
‐So that means if
we follow the bat,

384
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,387
it will lead us to
the enemy's hideout.

385
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,322
See?

386
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,323
‐Huh, I get it.

387
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,625
That's a good plan.

388
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,393
‐Man, you're always two
steps behind everyone else,

389
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,362
aren't you, genius?

390
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,697
‐Oh, yeah.

391
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,599
You think you're so smart
just because you're a chunin.

392
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:36,336
Well, just take this.

393
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,239
[screaming]

394
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:42,108
‐Aww, seriously dude,
what have you been eating?

395
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,076
‐Ha ha.

396
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:44,377
Catch you later, sucker.

397
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,654
‐I get a strange feeling
every time I come here.

398
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,022
‐What happens now?

399
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:01,134
‐What happens is I perform
a little test, with him.

400
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,636
And with help from Guren.

401
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,240
Here, put this on, will you?

402
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:24,525
‐Wait.

403
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:26,793
If you give him
that much, he'll‐‐

404
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:30,196
‐Do you really want to question
Lord Orochimaru's plan?

405
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,832
‐Uh.

406
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,433
‐Call it a mission.

407
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:37,704
A mission that would benefit
from your unique talents.

408
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:42,108
In fact, you're the only one
who could possibly do it.

409
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,310
‐I'm the only one.

410
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,647
‐And afterwards, who knows?

411
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,414
I might even reconsider.

412
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,217
‐Huh.

413
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,319
‐I might change
my mind about who

414
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:55,556
is best suited to be my vessel.

415
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,968
‐No need to be worried.

416
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,237
It's going to be so
much fun, Yukimaru.

417
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,406
You'll see.

418
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,975
This medicine's
different from the last.

419
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,712
This one shouldn't cause
you any pain at all.

420
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:14,347
Besides, you can't go home
until you've taken it.

421
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,360
Now it's your turn, Guren.

422
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:28,829
‐Stop bossing me around.

about to happen?

[Yukimaru screaming]

00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:43,777
‐Careful now.

430
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,811
It's coming.

431
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:45,345
‐What is?

432
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,938
‐The test was successful.

433
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,040
It's about to appear.

434
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,809
‐What's about to appear?

435
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,210
‐A tailed beast.

436
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,178
‐A tailed beast?

437
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,680
‐Ha ha ha.

[theme music]

441
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:03,837
‐I'm sensing something.

442
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,138
‐What is it, Shino?

443
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:08,509
‐My insects have
detected a strange chakra.

444
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,210
‐A strange chakra?

445
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,512
‐Very.

446
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:14,047
In fact, I've never sensed
so much chakra in one place

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,649
before.

‐I think Akamaru's picking up on
the same thing as your insects.

00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:20,621
‐What could it be?

450
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:22,455
What's going on over there?
