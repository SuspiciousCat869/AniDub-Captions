{\an1}Uh, oh... She's shaking it
too much!

[yelling]

153
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,395
{\an1}Place your bet! What is it?
Odd or even?!

154
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:59,163
{\an1}Even!

155
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:00,898
{\an1}Even, okay?

156
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:04,635
{\an1}Right. And I'm odd! The
bets have now been placed!

157
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:08,607
{\an1}The winner is...!

158
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,811
{\an1}Oh, boy... I rolled snake
eyes.

159
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:15,816
{\an1}I don't feel so good...

160
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,951
[groaning]

161
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,553
{\an1}What's up with this
raccoon dog?

162
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:20,621
{\an1}It's called cheating!

163
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,491
[growling]

164
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,429
How about this?

165
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:28,798
[screaming]

166
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:29,466
Quick! Run!

167
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:30,599
{\an1}Move it, Octopops!

168
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,935
{\an1}No bra...

169
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,236
{\an1}Get yourself together!

170
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,338
This way!

171
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,007
Hey, stop!

172
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,115
[grunting]

173
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,983
Whoa...

174
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,319
{\an1}That went pretty well!

175
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:47,821
{\an1}Went well how?!

176
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:51,459
{\an1}We got the Nine Tails
Jinchuriki without a
scratch! We worked together,

177
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,294
{\an1}now we're pals, a
friendship match!

178
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,463
Ramen...

179
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:58,166
{\an1}I need ramen from
Ichiraku.

180
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,603
{\an1}Yo, stand up! Gimme a fist
bump!

181
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,306
Huh?

182
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,209
{\an1}No, gimme ramen, you chump!

183
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,511
{\an1}Hey, you've got some real
potential!

184
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:08,378
{\an1}Hmm?

185
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,013
{\an1}C'mon, gimme a fist bump!

186
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,615
{\an1}Gimme ramen, ya chump!

187
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,017
{\an1}We're friends, me and you!

188
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,686
{\an1}Eatin' menma and char siu!

189
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,020
{\an1}Let's help each other!

190
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,622
{\an1}Add an extra egg to my
order.

191
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,791
Huh?!

192
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:23,629
{\an1}We Jinchuriki should be
pals. That's right, each and
every one of us!

193
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:28,536
{\an1}But now, we're far apart,
both guys and gals, and
we're feeling suspicious!

194
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,038
{\an1}You mean that you're
planning on finding the rest
of us?

195
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:33,542
{\an1}That's our plan, at least
for now.

196
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,377
Let's go!

197
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:53,166
{\an1}I wanted to settle this
amicably, but the time for
talk has long passed.

198
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:57,371
{\an1}You may use force if it's
necessary. Just make sure
you bring Naruto back before

199
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,771
{\an1}he crosses the border.

200
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,274
Right!

201
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:04,145
{\an1}And what should we do about
the Jinchuriki from the
Cloud and Sand?

202
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,515
{\an1}I won't ask you to try to
capture them.

203
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:10,986
{\an1}We are talking about
Jinchuriki here. Seizing
three is near impossible.

204
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,088
{\an1}Your priority's getting
Naruto.

205
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:16,459
{\an1}At this moment, the
Jinchuriki are traveling to
the northwest.

206
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:19,964
{\an1}Our best guess is that they're
headed for the Hidden
Waterfall Village.

207
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:20,565
Go!

208
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,966
Right!

209
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,676
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts' power is
at less than one hundred
percent right now. And do

210
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,844
{\an1}you have any idea why that
might be?

211
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,249
{\an1}I believe it's because most
of that power was stolen.

212
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,984
{\an1}Yep! Got it in one!

213
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,189
{\an4}That's why their chakra
gets used up in no time at
all if they use their full
power.

214
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:44,125
{\an1}Their power was stolen?! But
who could do that?

215
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,328
The Akatsuki.

216
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,096
{\an1}The Akatsuki...?

217
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,568
{\an1}Their plan is to use the
power of the Tailed Beasts
to change the world.

218
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:55,839
{\an7}We know of a princess who's
taking a stand to oppose the
Akatsuki.

219
00:13:55,872 --> 00:14:00,579
{\an7}So our plan to counter them
is to protect her and take
back the Tailed Beasts' power.

220
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:03,349
{\an1}Huuuh. Where is this
princess?

221
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:07,420
{\an1}In a certain castle. But
first, we have to gather our
comrades together.

222
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:10,323
{\an7}We're going to contact all
nine Jinchuriki.

223
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:14,528
{\an7}The Akatsuki are sure to
make their move during the
next full moon. We gotta be

224
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,365
{\an1}ready by then...

225
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,568
{\an1}We should avoid all major
routes.

226
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,703
My man.

227
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:26,142
{\an1}Hold on just a minute! Look!

228
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:31,148
{\an1}A tea stand? What's
the big deal?

229
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,986
{\an1}The big deal is that it's
not a tea stand, it's a
ramen stand!

230
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,458
{\an1}<i>It's the Ichiraku branch on</i>
<i>this mountain pass! It's</i>
<i>world famous! </i>

231
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,433
{\an1}Please, control yourself for
now.

232
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,636
{\an1}But even when we get to the
Hidden Waterfall, it doesn't

233
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,538
{\an1}have any famous
shops like this one.

234
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,242
{\an1}Get a move on! Before they
catch up, we gotta be gone!

235
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,844
{\an1}Aw, come on, guys...!

236
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:02,620
{\an1}Looks like they're already
here. Instead of scrambling,
why not hunker down and

237
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,056
{\an1}why not hunker down
and prepare for them?!

238
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:05,690
Hm.

anyone who hasn't had the
chance to eat ramen as

244
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,456
{\an7}good as this ramen!

[grunting]

250
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,007
{\an1}Please don't try to
resist. We only have
business here with Naruto.

251
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,378
{\an1}I don't want your
business!

{\an1}Huh?! A Sand Clone?!

{\an1}Huh?! An octopus leg?!

256
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:02,991
Huh?

257
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,761
Acrobat yeah!

258
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,499
{\an1}Are you okay, Yugao?!

259
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:10,567
Let's do this!

00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:40,106
{\an1}They got away. Rather,
they made a tactical
retreat.

283
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:43,444
{\an1}Yeah, but I seriously doubt
that they've given up for
good.

284
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:47,182
{\an1}Hey, Eight-O! Is one time
the limit for a Tailed Beast
Lariat?

285
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,752
{\an1}It seems so. Sorry, Bee.

286
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:54,023
{\an1}Don't worry about it, my
friend! All right, c'mon,
let's go.

287
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:56,593
Hm?

288
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:04,435
{\an1}I guess that this isn't
the time to be eating, after
all...

289
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,938
{\an1}No, of course not.

290
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,306
[sighing]

291
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,915
{\an1}One Jinchuriki is hard
enough, but with three of
them working together,

292
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:16,484
{\an1}ordinary methods just
won't work.

293
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:18,586
{\an1}Yes, but now it's become
apparent...

294
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,657
{\an1}...that at least for the
moment, the Tailed Beasts
aren't able to release their

295
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,859
{\an1}full, original power.

296
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:26,361
{\an1}It seems their chakra runs
out almost right away.

297
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:30,667
{\an1}I put a tracker on them.
We'll wait for
reinforcements for now.

298
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,670
{\an1}We're okay, Captain
Yamato.

299
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,505
{\an1}Let's go after them!

300
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:39,244
{\an1}The Tailed Beasts may be low
on chakra, but this is still
Gaara and Killer Bee.

00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:42,515
{\an1}We can't make any
mistakes. And besides...

302
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:51,191
{\an1}The Hidden Waterfall's just
as I expected. The scenery's
amazing.

303
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,761
But, Octopops...

304
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,263
{\an1}What are we gonna do now?

305
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:59,034
{\an1}I mean, we don't even know
what the Seven Tails
Jinchuriki looks like.

306
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:03,105
{\an1}Chill, it's sure to work
out quick! Jinchuriki
are fans of arithmetic.

307
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:07,444
{\an1}I hate arithmetic. Everyone
hates arithmetic. Stop
talking nonsense!

308
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:10,514
{\an1}Bee... Watch out. I sense
something ominous.

309
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,248
<i>Naruto! </i>

310
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:13,217
<i>Gaara! </i>

311
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:19,692
{\an1}<i>Wait, that's... Itachi.</i>

312
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,102
{\an1}The Akatsuki.

313
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,670
{\an1}That's them, huh?

314
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:32,942
{\an1}Every member of the Akatsuki
possesses a unique and
fearsome ninjutsu.

315
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:38,347
{\an1}And Itachi also wields the
Sharingan and can put Tailed
Beasts under genjutsu.

316
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:41,183
{\an1}So don't look directly into
his eyes...

317
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,357
{\an1}We've become aware that a
group of Jinchuriki have
joined together and are

318
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:48,459
{\an1}behaving suspiciously.

319
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:52,264
{\an1}We, the Akatsuki, cannot
overlook that, so we'll stop
you.

320
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:56,069
{\an1}Yo, listen to this, fool, ya
fool! You just straight-up
stole our line!

321
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:58,838
{\an1}So what's the situation
Akatsuki, what's your
design?

322
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,173
[chuckling]

323
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:02,677
{\an1}Do you guys really want to
tangle with us?

324
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,814
{\an1}Leave that one to me. I'll
handle him.

325
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:08,483
{\an1}An even three on three.

326
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,185
{\an1}Yeah! That sounds
perfect to me!

327
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:14,124
{\an1}Now, just hold your horses,
you guys! We Jinchuriki get
into formation, fight with

328
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:17,928
{\an1}coordination, dance in joint
collaboration, and-

329
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:20,397
[yelling]

330
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,001
{\an1}Wait, Naruto! I'll take
care of that one!

331
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:29,608
{\an1}Well... looks like I get to
take you on.

332
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:30,543
Hmm...

333
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,618
{\an1}For some reason, I really
want to take you down.

334
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,021
{\an1}I'll beat you at your own
game! Humph!

335
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:42,024
{\an1}Wrong! Not if I can help it!

336
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:47,563
{\an1}Hey, Itachi! Sasuke left
the Leaf Village to go after
you! So what are you gonna do?!

337
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,586
Wake up, Naruto!
It's a genjutsu!

338
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,892
{\an1}We don't want a brawl! We
just want safety for us all!

339
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,726
Heh.

340
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:14,796
Hah!

341
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,765
{\an1}All right! Acrobat!

342
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,236
{\an1}For Jinchuriki! Lifelong
security!

343
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,686
{\an1}Gimme a fist bump!

344
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,193
{\an1}For us, simply existing
fills people with fear. And
with resentment and hatred.

345
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,363
{\an1}That's our fate as
Jinchuriki!

346
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:10,533
{\an1}Fool ya fool! Your destiny
is something that you just
gotta see through, no matter

347
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,703
{\an1}what! We're all Jinchuriki,
just like you!

348
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:19,211
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: "Killer Bee
Rappuden: Part 2"

349
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,480
{\an1}We don't resent you, fear
you, or hate you.
