asking you to...

292
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,710
{\an7}No, you're wrong!

293
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:50,079
{\an5}I didn't agree
to do this
for you guys!
It was for me!

294
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:52,147
It was for myself...

295
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:57,383
{\an7}<i>I've always watched Naruto and</i>
<i>Sasuke's backs from behind.</i>

296
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,251
{\an7}<i>This time I wanted to </i>

297
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,585
{\an8}<i>Ino... Choji...</i>

298
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:06,587
{\an7}<i>Thank you for believing in me!</i>

299
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,056
{\an7}<i>Thank you for asking me to join</i>

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,525
{\an7}<i>I'm really, really...</i>

301
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:13,725
{\an8}<i>...grateful!</i>

302
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:20,728
{\an4}Elder Sister, the
big one and the
blonde can't move
anymore.

303
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,130
{\an1}Soon, big forehead will-

304
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:23,897
[gasp]

305
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,665
{\an8}Big forehead's chakra
suddenly spiked!

306
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,533
[gasp]

307
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:34,736
{\an7}<i>Finally I have enough chakra!</i>

308
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:38,704
{\an7}<i>I will protect Choji and Ino, no</i>
<i>matter what!</i>

309
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:40,872
{\an8}<i>I'll end this...</i>

310
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,174
{\an8}<i>...in one blow!</i>

311
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,773
[gasp]

312
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,543
{\an1}This is over right now! Cha!

313
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,576

{\an1}[screaming]

315
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,246
{\an1}I didn't lose. I didn't! There's
no way that I would ever lose!

316
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,548
Elder Sister!

317
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,183
{\an1}We lost! We definitely lost!

318
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:01,784
{\an1}(SAYA) Mamushi! You'll clean
toilets for a hundred years!

{\an1}(INO) [groggy moans]

321
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,221
{\an1}Hey! How are you feeling?

322
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:11,689
{\an1}I extracted the venom. The
numbness will wear off soon.

323
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,690
{\an1}<i>Oh. Thanks.</i>

324
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:14,391
No...

325
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:17,193
{\an1}Don't thank me! I owe you two an
apology...

326
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,059
{\an1}<i>Huh?</i>

327
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,060
{\an1}You saw with The Mind
Transmission huh?

328
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:24,397
{\an1}I put you both in danger because
of my own personal reasons...

329
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:26,831
{\an1}<i>Yeah, you sure did.</i>

330
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:27,431
[shocked groan]

331
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,066
Nah, just kidding!

332
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,235
{\an8}I'm glad that
we asked you
to join our
team!

333
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,403
Ino...

334
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,071
{\an1}That's right! I'm happy about
it, as well!

335
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,440
{\an4}I feel like the three
of us can defeat just
about anyone we might come
across!

{\an1}Really you guys...?!

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,579
{\an1}Uh... I guess I should say
thank you too!

{\an1}Come on! Let's
get going to
the central tower.

344
