00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,377
What is it?

2
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,289
I see...

3
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:49,438
{\an1}Huh? There's lots and
lots of shinobi?

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,921
{\an1}Well, according to
these birds...

5
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,262
{\an1}There's a war going
on, is that right?

00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,500
{\an1}[affirmative grunt]

7
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,890
{\an4}We need to find Sasuke
before we get mixed up in
this whole ridiculous
conflict!

completed our patrol

No incidents to report.

Hidden Leaf Home
Watch Unit Two.

11
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:10,041
{\an1}We patrolled the western
sector. No incidents to
report.

12
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:14,556
{\an1}Roger that! Unit One will
now go and patrol the
northern sector.

13
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,702
{\an1}Right! And Unit Two will
head for the southern
sector.

14
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,349
{\an1}You all do your best,
Konohamaru.

15
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:24,559
{\an1}We will! You guys,
too, Watase! See ya!

16
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,550
{\an1}It kinda feels like we're in
the battle, too! It's sort
of exciting!

17
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,725
{\an1}Yeah, it feels like
the real thing!

18
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,766
{\an1}This isn't some kind
of game, you guys!

19
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,978
{\an1}If people like those
wrestlers and boxers show up
again, we have to protect

20
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,118
the Hidden Leaf
Village, you got it?!

21
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,490
Yeah!

22
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:49,482
You bastard! I'm
going to kill you!

23
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,560
{\an1}What was that scary
voice, Konohamaru?!

24
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,633
{\an1}You're gonna pay!

25
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:58,748
{\an1}That's the Intel Division
over there. Of course!
It's the prisoner!

26
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,455
{\an1}Prisoner? Who is it?

27
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,469
{\an1}Big Brother Sasuke's partner
from the Akatsuki or The
Taka or something.

28
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,844
{\an1}But I'll forgive you!

29
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,491
{\an1}Let's go. It's okay.
Come on, you guys.

30
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,686
{\an1}You bastard! I hope
you suffer and die!

31
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:22,767
{\an1}But you're so handsome!
[giggling]

32
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,380
But still!

33
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,659
{\an1}Who do you think you are!
How dare you try to kill me!

34

[cough]

35
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:39,595
{\an1}Karin... if you're slow enough
to get taken hostage, then
you're just a burden.

36
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,234
{\an1}Why that little--!

37
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:48,727
You're an idiot!
But I still want you!

38
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,709
No!

39
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:56,555
{\an1}That idiot tried to kill me!
There's no forgiveness for
that!

40
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,097
{\an1}But he's so handsome!

41
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,172
{\an1}What is she doing?!

42
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,347
{\an1}It's that picture she
brought with her.

43
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,959
{\an1}She's been in there talking
crazy to it again. Poor
thing...

44
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,434
She must've
suffered so much.

45
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,848
{\an1}Oh, wait... Do you mean
that picture of Sasuke?

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,356
[giggling]

47
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,866
{\an1}Aren't we supposed to
confiscate that thing?

48
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,806
We tried!

49
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,716
{\an1}But she went nuts!
Completely wild!

50
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:27,064
{\an1}She's a lot quieter with it,
so we let her keep it.
Anyway, it's just a picture.

51
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:31,480
{\an1}Okay then, no harm done, I
guess. You want to play a
quiet game of cards?

52
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,451
Sure.

53
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,462
[giggling]

54
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,454
{\an1}Boy, it sure would be great
if Sasuke were here at this
hideout.

55
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,364
After all this
place is special.

56
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,045
{\an1}Orochimaru's favorite spot.

57
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,467
{\an1}Hey! Sasuke! Are you here?

58
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,614
The size of this
hideout is ridiculous!

{\an1}[painful grunting]

60
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,461
What's wrong?

61
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,878
{\an1}It's nothing. My head
just started hurting.

62
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,854
{\an7}<i>Oh, man is he gonna go</i>

66
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,096
{\an1}Yeah, what is it?

67
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,339
{\an1}You know, there's something
about you that's always
bothered me quite a bit.

68
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,879
Oh, yeah?!

69
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:58,860
{\an1}Well, I'm always concerned
about you, Jugo. Your
presence is thrilling.

70
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:01,871
{\an1}I'm here because I made a
promise to Kimimaro.

71
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:06,520
{\an4}Why are you here? Are you in
Team Taka just to cause
trouble with Sasuke and
Karin?

72
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:08,026
Why, huh?

73
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,367
{\an1}Yeah, why are you here?

74
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,374
{\an1}You wanna know why?

75
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,087
{\an1}<i>It's you. I knew you'd come.</i>

76
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:28,901
{\an1}<i>You being here must mean</i>
<i>that you killed Orochimaru.</i>

77
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,306
That's right.

78
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:34,822
{\an1}But never mind that for now.
Let's get you out of there.

79
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:51,381
{\an1}Aaaah, free at last!
Thank you, Sasuke.

80
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:55,362
{\an1}Suigetsu, you're the first.

81
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,904
{\an1}Now come with me.

82
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:02,455
{\an1}What do you mean, "the
first?" Who are the others?

83
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:08,977
{\an4}There are two others: Jugo
of the Northern hideout, and
I'm also getting Karin of
the Southern hideout.

84
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:15,701
{\an4}I understand why you'd pick
me, of course. But choosing
those two is making me
wonder about you, Sasuke.

85
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:20,117
{\an1}Do you ever shut up? Come
on, get dressed. We're
leaving.

86
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,399
Can I ask you
something Sasuke?

87
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:25,503
What is it?

88
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,012
{\an1}Why are you dragging
a team together?

89
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,253
{\an1}Because I have a goal...

90
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:33,364
{\an1}...and having a team will let
me reach that goal faster.

91
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:35,271
{\an1}Since I joined with
Orochimaru...

92
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:40,122
{\an4}I've been preparing for when
this would happen. I have
monitoring a number of
shinobi.

93
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:43,835
{\an1}Carefully selecting the
most powerful ones who
catch my eye.

94
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:45,708
Huh...

95
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,318
{\an1}Now that I gathered my
perfect team...

96
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,830
{\an1}Here it is. This is my plan.

97
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:56,078
{\an1}My ultimate goal is to kill
Itachi Uchiha of the
Akatsuki.

98
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:59,089
{\an1}But to succeed, I'll need
help from all of you.

99
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,566
{\an1}Of course, it's your choice.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,413
{\an1}Karin. You said you had
something else to do.

101
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,118
Decide.

102
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,192
Oh. Uh.

103
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,665
{\an1}Well, on second thought...

104
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,371
{\an1}That other thing isn't
really important.

105
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:15,549
{\an1}Karin, just be honest and
tell the truth, would you?

106
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:19,998
{\an4}The only thing you're really
interested in is being
around Sasuke, isn't that
right?

107
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:22,374
{\an1}What?! No, that's
just ridiculous!

108
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:26,086
{\an1}It's ridiculous how
ridiculous that is! No,
you're ridiculous!

109
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,468
{\an1}What I am, is right! I mean,
why else would you get all
flustered like that?

110
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,839
How rich!

111
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:35,888
{\an7}I know the truth, you know.
About how long ago you
wanted Sas-

112
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,129
Agh!

113
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,608
{\an1}Suigetsu, don't get
Karin worked up.

114
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:44,150
{\an1}Didn't I tell you to
try and get along?

115
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,593
{\an1}All right, I will.

116
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:49,168
{\an1}I'm sorry, Karin. Truly.

117
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,243
{\an1}Now, look, you may hate it...

118
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:55,257
{\an1}But I'm not going anywhere.
I'm sticking like glue to
Sasuke.

119
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,305
{\an1}At least I am, until I can
locate one of the Seven
Hidden Mist Blades.

120
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,226
{\an1}I'm on the hunt for Kisame
Hoshigaki's giant sword, The
Shark Skin Samehada.

121
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,267
{\an1}Then it's all set.

122
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,880
{\an1}Now that we're a team, we
all move together, as one.

123
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:15,128
{\an1}And from this point on, we
four will be known as the
Hebi.

124
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:19,109
So, why?

125
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:22,689
Heh!
[chuckling]

126
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,540
{\an1}I would love nothing better
than to break both of those
two losers up for good!

127
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:32,959
{\an4}I just want to break
everything in two! I can't
help myself! Especially when
it comes to those guys!

128
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:36,404
{\an1}I see. You're reprehensible,
you know that?

129
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,278
Huh?

130
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:43,731
{\an4}Yeah, right. You kidding me?
You want to talk
reprehensible? Then Sasuke's
the worst of all!

131
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:45,672
{\an1}What do you mean?

132
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:50,655
{\an4}Come on! After he'd defeated
Itachi, I thought that he
had reached his goal and was
finished.

133
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:08,687
{\an1}We are no longer the "Hebi."

134
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:15,946
{\an1}From this day on, our team
will be the "Taka".

135
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,991
{\an1}And Taka has but one goal.

136
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:20,495
Our mission...

137
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,722
...is to destroy
the Hidden Leaf!

138

141

sir" to you.

142
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,376
{\an1}No, wait. You say, "Are you

it?

00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,316
{\an1}I'm here to capture you.

144
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:55,823
{\an1}Suigetsu, take the right.

145
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:58,064
{\an1}Jugo, take the left.

146
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,710
{\an1}Karin, behind me;
cover my back.

147
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:16,663
{\an1}Then I'll sting ya
like a killa bee!

148
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:22,752
Sasuke!

149
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,695
And end my flow
with a killer blow!

[attacking yell]

152
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,592
{\an1}Sasuke, the three of us
will take care of him.

153
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:59,215
{\an7}The fact is, this guy is
incredibly strong. So we'd
better go at him as if we
are trying to kill him.

154
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,029
{\an1}That might be our best
chance of taking him while
he's still alive.

{\an1}I'll take over, you guys!
Just run while you can!

159
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:34,007
{\an1}Thanks, Suigetsu...

160
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,412
{\an1}Let's go, Sasuke.

[angry growl]

162
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:43,575
{\an1}Yo, I'm not letting y'all
get away this late in the
game, fools, ya fools.

{\an8}[growling]

{\an1}All of us nearly died! But
somehow, we managed to
finish the job.

165
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:03,913
{\an1}But the next thing you know,
we're crashing the Five Kage
Summit and we're in a battle

168
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,723
No!

169
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:19,269
{\an1}Jugo, relax. It's
just a genjutsu.

170
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:23,584
{\an1}You saw through the
genjutsu, but it's too late!

171
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:36,866
{\an4}<i>And when the fist fight was</i>

Whoa! What the
hell's he doing?!

[annoyed sigh]

175
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,569
To be honest,
I hate you all.

176
00:14:56,602 --> 00:15:01,386
{\an4}I lead you idiots to water,
and you splash it in my face
instead of drinking it.
That's why--

177
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,159
[angry roar]

178
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:06,538
{\an1}Agh! A rampage! Whoa,
is he out to kill me?!

179
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,742
Just die!

180
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:18,246
{\an1}You know, I think I
hate you the most of all!

181
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,941
What is this?!

182
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:38,117
{\an1}I've been here so many times
before, but... I never knew
this existed.

183
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,958
[gasp]

184
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:43,103
{\an1}Is this... one of Orochimaru's
secret rooms?

185
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:56,718
Huh?

186
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,057
{\an1}What?! This is?! <i>Orochimaru</i>
<i>planned all of this?</i>

187
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,539
{\an7}<i>This intel. It could change</i>
<i>the whole outcome of this</i>

[coughing]

00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:29,468
{\an1}What are you doing?

190
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:36,593
{\an1}This scroll might be a very
nice little present for
Sasuke.

191
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,604
{\an1}We've found something
incredible down here, purely
by chance!

192
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,682
[coughing]

193
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:45,726
{\an1}That punch is water under
the bridge for right now,
Jugo.

194
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,875
[coughing]

195
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,784
Come on, Jugo,
snap out of it!

196
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,929
{\an1}We've got to find
Sasuke, and fast!

197
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,433
The birds around
here are uneasy...

198
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:12,588
Over there.

199
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,994
Let's go.

200
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:29,951
{\an1}You wasted no time
coming after me.

201
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:32,092
{\an1}What are you doing out here?

202
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:33,263
{\an1}Or not, as it seems to be...

203
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:36,441
[gasps]

204
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:40,991
{\an1}I passed by two towns on my
way here, but they were both
completely deserted.

205
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:45,373
{\an4}It seemed really odd to
me. Do you happen to know
anything about what's
going on?

206
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:49,053
{\an1}First, you're gonna have to
answer our question! Now how
come you're outside?!

207
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:51,829
{\an1}What happened to our
original that was with you?

208
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,212
{\an1}If you hate it so much that
I'm outside now, then you
ought to capture me.

209
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,988
{\an1}After all, you do
outnumber me this time.

210
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:02,400
{\an1}Hold on, you didn't kill our
original, did you?!

211
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:05,946
{\an1}With this many of you, now.
I hope it's more of a
challenge.

216
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,232
This is a war...

217
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:41,039
Our orders...

218
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,911
{\an1}Take down the enemy...

219
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:46,023
{\an1}So Madara's done it.
He's begun his plan.

220
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:51,843
{\an1}Capture Killer Bee
and apprehend Naruto
Uzumaki, as well.

221
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,461
Sasuke...

222
00:18:56,494 --> 00:19:01,110
{\an4}If you attack the Hidden
Leaf, I'll have no choice. I
will fight you. Don't doubt
that.

223
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,954
Until that day,
save your hatred.

224
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:07,400
{\an1}Then you can throw
all of it right at me.

225
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,544
{\an1}I'm the only one who can
handle all that hate.

226
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,585
{\an1}Do you understand?

227
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,793
[chuckle]

228
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:18,740
{\an1}Fine by me. But at least
I'll take you down first.

229
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:26,702
{\an1}If you don't hurry, more and
more will join up with him
one after another...

230
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:27,907
[chuckle]

231
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,218
{\an1}It's because you know the
pain of solitude like I do...

232
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:34,664
{\an1}It's that very pain that
makes you and I stronger,
Naruto.

233
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,575
{\an4}Which means if I can just
break that bond, I'll be
able to achieve even greater
strength!

234
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:45,637
{\an1}Did you forget, Naruto... just
what true strength really
looks like?

235
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,655
{\an1}I feel the Uchiha at last
being freed from this
rotting Shinobi world.

236
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:56,073
{\an4}And besides, isn't what I'm
doing exactly what you Leaf
Shinobi have wanted all
along?

237
00:19:56,107 --> 00:20:03,033
{\an4}You've always snubbed and
put down the Uchiha clan. So
I'll simply help erase the
Uchiha from your memories...

238
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:05,273
{\an1}By killing all of you.

239
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,916
{\an1}And then, by destroying...

240
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,856
{\an1}The Hidden Leaf Village!

241
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:15,309
{\an1}Severing all bonds with the
Hidden Leaf will be the
ultimate purification!

242
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:19,859
{\an1}And that shall lead to the
Uchiha's true restoration!

243
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,701
{\an1}I think that it's time for
me to come and find you.

244
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:34,477
{\an1}It's time to cut you down.

245
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:44,748
{\an1}You're not Hidden Leaf
Village shinobi. You're not
part of the promise.

them, Brother.

<i>When you possess</i>

250
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:05,088
{\an1}The scenes burned into these
eyes that used to belong to
my brother...

251
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:10,741
{\an1}They're disgusting and sad.
They weigh me down. But
that's only fitting...

252
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:14,288
{\an1}Just you watch, brother!
