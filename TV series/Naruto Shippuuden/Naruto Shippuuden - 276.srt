1
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:17,368
We're out!

2
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:30,728
Wait, I thought we were on
an island. 'Cause this sure
looks like land to me!

3
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:34,570
Minor stuff you don't
need to know. Ready? It's
time to go!

4
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,827
"Attack of the Gedo
Statue"

5
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,402
[sighing]

6
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:34,475
I'm tired of playing
cards.

7
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:37,582
Is there anything else to
amuse ourselves with?

8
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:42,892
Hmm.

9
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:45,230
I guess we have no
choice.

10
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:58,323
Ha! Found them! They're
here...

11
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:15,090
So before I can get the
Feudal Lords,.. I have
to take you down you
first... is that it?

12
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,494
I think you mean get
through us.

13
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,537
[chuckling]

14
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:35,565
It seems the battle
outside is becoming
heated.

15
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,706
How can I focus on this?
They're breaking my
concentration!

16
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,601
Lava Style!

17
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,309
Uh!

18
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:00,581
[yelling]

19
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,286
Chojuro.

20
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,925
I won't let you harm Lady
Mizukage!

21
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,430
[yelling]

22
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,304
Hm?

23
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:18,584
I sense Eight and Nine
Tails' chakra...

24
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:20,655
They've emerged!

25
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,961
I have to tell him...

26
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:42,532
It looks like the Eight
and Nine Tails have
finally appeared.

27
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:48,476
But if the two of them
are back in our realm,
then what are we going to
do about the Feudal Lords?

28
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,521
Do you still want all of
them captured so that we
can use them as
bargaining chips?

29
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,361
No. I don't need the
Feudal Lords anymore.

30
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:03,206
If we capture them, the
nations will pressure the
Allied Shinobi Forces to
retrieve them.

31
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:08,249
That tactic was only to
get them to hand over the
Tailed Beasts to us.

32
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:15,130
Now that the Eight and
Nine Tails have emerged,
there's no need for
indirect measures.

33
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,401
The Raikage's no fool.

34
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:22,612
He's known from the very
beginning that the Feudal
Lords hold no value in
this war.

35
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:28,757
If Project Tsuki no Me
succeeds... it's all
over.

36
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:34,001
Awww... So Black Zetsu is
fighting the Mizukage for
nothing?

37
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:39,980
No. Shinobi still cannot
simply disregard the
Feudal Lords who hired
them.

38
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:43,319
Have Black Zetsu continue
his guerilla assault.

39
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:50,100
If he can stall the
Mizukage and her men,
that'll split up the
enemy's battle strength.

40
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:54,709
All right, then. And what
about you, Tobi? What
will you do?

41
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:59,686
It's finally time for
me to join the fight.

42
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,527
First I'm going to steal
some power.

43
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,814
Ninja Art!

44
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,689
Four Flames Formation!

45
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,464
Very nicely done.

46
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:28,376
Once inside this barrier,
even those controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu are
helpless.

47
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,415
[panting]
Yeah.

48
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,795
[yelling]

49
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,680
[panting]

50
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,316
This...

51
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,153
... is the last one!

52
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:54,829
[struggling]

53
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,637
Help me...
I'm dying!

54
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:00,808
You've used up too much
chakra.

55
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,379
Don't use that Ninja Tool
anymore!

56
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:07,922
Yeah, but, I'm just
so good with this thing.

57
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,671
Thanks, big guy from the
Leaf!

58
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:16,607
Hm?

59
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:21,148
It's far from over.

60
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:24,388
The battle... is just
starting.

61
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:27,829
Oh, really? Now, that's
an interesting opinion...

62
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:31,335
...considering that we
just won.

63
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:37,515
We fought to the end to
defend the coastline.
Your amphibious operation
is a failure!

64
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,887
Summoning Jutsu!

65
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:58,757
[gasping]

66
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,166
You're... no way!

67
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:07,007
Hm?!

68
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:32,859
[roaring]

69
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,796
What the hell
is that thing?!

70
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:36,767
It's even bigger than
Choji!

71
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,739
I got a bad feeling
about this.

72
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:43,781
That's not just big, it's
enormous!

73
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,555
I didn't expect you
to assess the situation
so perfectly.

74
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:48,724
[grunting]

75
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,799
Choji! Come on!

76
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,709
Here. You guys, please
deal with Kakuzu and
Hizashi, all right?

77
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,979
I'll handle that thing!

78
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,284
Sealing Corps!

79
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:05,591
Gedo Statue, go.

80
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:15,845
There it is...

81
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,015
[roaring]

82
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,196
Choza.

83
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,065
Ready, dad?

84
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,134
Yeah!

85
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:33,547
[roaring]

86
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,551
Choji! Go now!

87
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,322
[yelling]

88
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:40,795
[grunting]

89
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:42,932
Huh?!

90
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,036
He stopped me?!

91
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:47,542
What just
happened?!

92
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:51,583
[roaring]

93
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,797
What's going on up
there?!

94
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,441
<i>Incredible chakra!</i>

95
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,578
Hmm?

96
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:11,155
An immense chakra field
has appeared on the
battlefield near
Darui's First company!

97
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:14,161
What is it?!

98
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:16,499
<i>We've contacted the First</i>
<i>Company.</i>

99
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:21,075
<i>It's some sort of</i>
<i>humanoid monster. It's</i>
<i>ravaging our troops. And</i>
<i>it appears to be</i>

100
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:22,110
<i>controlled by...</i>

101
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,412
Well, who is it?!

102
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:26,620
<i>We believe it's Madara</i>
<i>Uchiha.</i>

103
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:30,961
If that's true, then we
need to revise our battle
strategy right now.

104
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:35,270
The leader has joined the
battle? But why would he
do that?

105
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,376
We don't have enough data
to make an assessment.

106
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,891
Naruto, you really ought
to preserve that mode for
the fight that's ahead.

107
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:49,933
Or you'll use up all your
strength and end up
seeing red!

108
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,738
There's no time
for me to waste!

109
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,943
Incoming!

110
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:58,617
Killer Bee and Naruto
have escaped! They broke
right through the barrier
together.

111
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,925
They what?! It's supposed
to be impenetrable, even
to Jinchuriki!

112
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,469
And it would have been
for one, but this was
both of them. The barrier
just wasn't strong enough!

113
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,641
Both of them?!

114
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:13,514
It seems Master Bee is
working with Naruto.

115
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,016
[growling]

116
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,389
All right, so what do we
do now?

117
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:23,767
I'm gonna go and stop the
Jinchuriki myself!
Tsunade! You're with me!

118
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,305
But who's going to manage
Headquarters?

119
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,142
Shikaku of the Leaf!

120
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,346
Yes, sir. I understand.

121
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,850
You can just
leave it to me.

122
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:33,219
All right! Come on!

123
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:34,454
Tsunade!

124
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:35,958
Lord Raikage!

125
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:38,697
Please don't knock down
any walls on your way
out, okay?

126
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,466
[grunting]

127
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,204
Let's go!

128
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:45,143
[growling]
Right.

129
00:11:57,602 --> 00:12:02,043
[struggling]
I can't believe this!

130
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,145
[gasping]

131
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:13,499
Get back! Everyone,
retreat to the coastline!

132
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:18,242
Earth Style! Mountain
Jutsu!

133
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,093
[yelling]

134
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:37,782
[roaring]

135
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,486
Ah!

136
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,004
What is that thing?

137
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:52,712
It's got too much power!
It's extraordinary!

138
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:58,255
Given the intel gathered
so far, and based on the
data that Temari of the
Sand gave to the Allied

139
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,659
Forces Council...

140
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,495
I wonder if that
thing is--

141
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:07,608
According to intel from
the Sand's Kazekage...

142
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:14,354
Madara takes the
Jinchuriki power and
seals it inside of an
enormous humanoid statue.

143
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:19,297
Bee's octopus leg clone
most likely has been
absorbed into it already.

144
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,068
A humanoid monster.

145
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,774
Don't tell me... Is that
it?!

146
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:33,159
[roaring]

147
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:37,367
That thing countered my
special reserve move that
easily?!

148
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,841
If he seals Jinchuriki
power inside of that
thing...

149
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,617
[gasping]

150
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:47,822
That means...

151
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,358
You...!

152
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:51,128
[gasping]

153
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,399
Damn it!

154
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:59,177
Sorry, you don't get to
have those Ninja Tools!

155
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:03,520
I don't want them. I
just want what's inside
them.

156
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:08,295
Once I'm finished, you
can have them back if you
want them so badly.

157
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:16,211
First you used the Nine
Tails Chakra-bearing
Kinkaku and Ginkaku to
their fullest effect on

158
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,548
the front line.

159
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,552
Now that you're through
with them...

160
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:24,461
...you want to seal their
Nine Tails chakra inside
that monstrous creation
of yours.

161
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:29,872
So there are some smart
ones in the Allied Forces
after all?

162
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:32,243
Am I wrong?

163
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:36,485
It really is a true
shame... that you're my
enemy.

164
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,391
So then, that monster
is...

165
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,061
No way!

166
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,265
[gasping]

167
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,209
Uh!

168
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,281
Damn it!

169
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,563
Shikamaru! No!

170
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,585
Are you all right,
Shikamaru?

171
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,525
You're a lifesaver,
Choji!

172
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,898
Sorry to bother you
twice.

173
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,635
Don't worry about it.

174
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,337
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,377
What happened to him?

176
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,450
<i>He disappeared with the</i>
<i>Ninja Tools.</i>

177
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,992
[roaring]

178
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:38,242
Huh?

179
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,950
They retreated?!

180
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,443
[grunting]

181
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,806
Choza, seal me!

182
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,578
Hurry! hurry up and seal
me!

183
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:24,602
[yelling]

184
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,386
Don't be afraid! Surround
them!

185
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,465
The tide of battle has
turned against us.

186
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:00,373
We must contact HQ and
rethink our strategy.

187
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,343
I know.

188
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:07,287
It's almost dark. We have
to be prepared for a
night assault.

189
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,675
No matter what, I will
not lose this war.

190
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,046
I have prepared
for far too long.

191
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:28,495
My long-standing
ambition, Project Tsuki
no Me, shall at last be
realized tomorrow.

192
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,573
He's already sealed
Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

193
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:40,319
He only has part of Eight
Tail's chakra. Merely a
single tentacles worth.

194
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:44,394
It sure seems to me that
he's losing his patience.

195
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:47,968
But I'll go along with
your plans tonight...

196
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:52,611
... while I bide my time
and keep some of my
pieces in reserve.

197
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:53,813
[gasping]

198
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,709
[panting]

199
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:28,817
Good work, Sai. Get as
much rest as you can
tonight.

200
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,522
Kakashi...

201
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:36,298
All right! All of you who
are still fit for guard
duty... gather around!

202
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,402
I cannot see the enemy.

203
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:42,811
What's the plan? Retreat?
Or advance?

204
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,453
Right now,... this
company is without a
captain.

205
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:51,061
We'll just have to stand
our ground and wait for
further orders.

206
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:56,606
Right. Luckily, we have a
bunch of Sensory-Type
ninja who are ideal
for this.

207
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,510
[barking]

208
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,651
They're not coming.

209
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:07,795
<i>I don't sense anything in</i>
<i>the sand either. We can</i>
<i>safety assume they've</i>
<i>retreated.</i>

210
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,132
[exhaling]

211
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:15,677
With the Reanimation
Jutsu, I'd think the
wiser move would simply
be to continue fighting.

212
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:19,384
So do you believe that
they have a better plan
in mind?

213
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,023
Please, Lord Gaara! Take
this!

214
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,260
You must keep your
strength up, after all.

215
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,699
Thank you, but first...
Give it to my comrade,
here.

216
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:31,108
Really? To this guy?
He's just a little
old man.

217
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,580
I'm the Tsuchikage, girl!

218
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,682
[gasping]

219
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:41,395
We don't have any idea
what they may be planning
in the dark of night.

220
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:44,502
So stay on guard at all
times.

221
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,670
Yes, sir!

222
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,547
[chatting]

223
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,354
Oh, come on! Where is my
Ninja Tool?!

224
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:57,661
Please? I really wanna
have it back!

225
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,366
You were told not to use
it anymore!

226
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,504
<i>Yeah, but I want to!</i>

227
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:08,516
And besides, I'm really
good with that fan! I
mean, it's such a waste
for me not to have it!

228
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:14,327
I told HQ that Madara's
taken a Treasured Tool.

229
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,033
And that he got the
Nine Tails Chakra.

230
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm very sorry. This was
all my fault.

231
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:24,114
If only we'd realized
sooner.

232
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:27,353
No. you did a good job
out there.

233
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:30,226
It can't be helped that
he's unstoppable.

234
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,541
But in any case, we held
the enemy for one more
day...

235
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:43,520
Forty thousand out of
eighty thousand.

236
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:47,561
Those were our losses,
the number of casualties
that we suffered.

237
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,704
Fifty thousand out of one
hundred thousand.

238
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:55,544
That's how many Akatsuki
fell today.

239
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,419
Each side lost nearly
half their force.

240
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:03,660
Yes, but our side is made
up of living flesh.

241
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,505
Meanwhile, the
enemy is...

242
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,802
Everybody... just
hold on! I'm on my
way!

243
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:07,641
Your former teammate
Sasuke has been gripped
by hatred for a long
time.

244
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:12,216
Have you ever really been
able to do anything for
him at all?

245
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,322
Ever since that day...

246
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:20,567
That's right, you've
known it ever since that
day.

247

<i>Shippuden: Unison Sign.</i>
