out with one attack?!

{\an1}It really was a blessing that
this gang of thieves escaped
into our territory.

most skilled in the organization
and the pride of our clan.

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,262
{\an1}You had no chance of escaping.

{\an1}You were brilliant
as usual, sir.

7
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,933
{\an1}So what do we do with them now?

8
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:42,234
{\an1}What we always do.

9
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:43,834
{\an1}Understood.

10
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:47,336
{\an1}Teach them a lesson and make
an example out of them!

11
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,070
Yeah!

{\an1}Y'know, honestly, until Sasuke
came, everyone was getting fed
up!

37
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:42,240
{\an1}We were making no progress on
the big problems, but our work
load just kept on increasing!

38
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:47,609
{\an1}All Captain Fugaku said was
just to listen to the
Hokage, and keep waiting!

39
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:53,545
{\an7}If things were going to change
just by waiting, then they
would've changed a long time
ago.

40
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,313
{\an1}Absolutely! We have to
apply pressure, too!

41
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,381
Lord Fugaku's
ways are too weak.

42
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:02,415
{\an1}Yeah!  We're gonna do things
your way, Lieutenant.

43
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,116
Hm.

44
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,585
{\an1}It's very easy to just
run your mouth.

{\an7}<i>Humph. None of this... has</i>

47
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:24,958
{\an1}The recent activities of
the Leaf Police Force are
indefensible!

48
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,792
{\an1}I admit, there's no doubt
that crime has gone down,

49
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:32,361
{\an1}but the villagers are growing
more and more uneasy every day!

50
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:35,429
{\an1}I believe that this
is a form of protest.

51
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:38,497
{\an1}They're annoyed because their
situation hasn't changed...

52
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,598
{\an1}They're losing patience.

53
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:44,265
{\an1}It takes time for things
to truly change.

54
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,832
{\an1}My father understands that.

55
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:51,135
{\an1}However, some others feel
frustrated by it.

56
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:53,436
{\an1}Especially the younger
generation.

57
00:04:53,469 --> 00:05:01,105
{\an1}And the one at the center of all
this is the clan's most gifted
member, Sasuke.

58
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,975
{\an1}Sasuke, you're back!

59
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,984
{\an1}Perhaps they're being rather
rough, but they're still
fulfilling their duties.

60
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:33,085
{\an1}I believe my father would like
to keep observing them.

61
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:46,857
{\an1}Besides... if we make the wrong
move, then we'll only invite
more resistance.

62
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:52,593
{\an1}Man, what a drag... Everybody in
the village is so high-strung
because of those guys...

63
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,695
{\an1}Yeah, it's so annoying.

64
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:58,295
{\an1}It wasn't that long ago that
this place was filled with
people and food stands!

65
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,564
{\an1}They're so strict about
the regulations. So
it's all deserted now.

66
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,165
{\an1}I know.  You're right.

67
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,566
{\an1}I mean, what could
Sasuke even be thinking?!

68
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,635
{\an1}I really wish that I could just
go ask him, but he's so
unapproachable these days.

69
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:14,235
So you think it'll ever
go back to how it was?

76
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,676
{\an1}Hold on... when did
you get back here?

77
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,810
{\an1}Just this minute!

78
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,811
{\an1}Pervy Sage said he had to make
a stop along the way,

79
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,111
{\an1}so I figured that I'd
just come home first.

80
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:41,747
{\an1}You know, you look a
little more distinguished!

81
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,548
{\an1}Really?  You guys haven't
changed at all!

82
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:48,016
{\an1}What're you talking about? Here,
just take a look at this...!

83
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,317
{\an1}See?
Huh?? What the--!?

84
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:54,618
{\an1}While you were away from the
village, the rest of us became
chunin.

85
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,687
{\an1}Not only that!  Neji, who's a
class ahead of us, is now a
jonin.

86
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:02,489
{\an1}So I'm... the last one from our
class who's still a genin?!

87
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,856
{\an1}Well... actually, Sasuke's
still one, too.

88
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,491
He was at the Feudal
Lord's office till now.

89
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:11,192
{\an1}What happened? What's
going on with Sasuke?

90
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:17,595
{\an1}Uh, yeah, Since you've been
gone, things have gotten a
little complicated...

{\an1}Yeah, you're right. He's back!

98
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,774
{\an1}So you start breaking the rules
the minute you return?

99
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,108
{\an1}Seems you haven't
grown up at all.

100

That may be, but you
sure have changed.

calling someone like Lord
Danzo "old man."

the hell is he?

{\an1}One of the Leaf's top officials!

130
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:09,964
{\an1}What's more, he's always at odds
with Lord Fourth and Lord Third.

131
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:13,766

me a very strict warning.

involved with him.

bad terms with the Lieutenant.

{\an1}More importantly, about
Sasuke...

144
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:51,282
{\an1}Pervy Sage told me that... if a
friend wanders off the path, you
have to pull them back onto it.

145
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:54,483
{\an1}So next time, we have to
make sure we stop Sasuke.

146
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,117
Yeah.

147
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,590
{\an1}Lieutenant... You want us to
leave them be?  Really?

148
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:14,724
{\an1}It's just, that kid's bound to
give you more trouble!

149
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,692
{\an1}Shut up!

150
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,592
Lieutenant!

151
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:22,494
{\an1}I have work to do now.  Listen,
you're members of the Leaf
Police Force.

152
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:25,496
{\an1}Solve it.  Stop depending on me.

153
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:40,268
{\an4}That Naruto Uzumaki... He's
seems to have gained a lot of
strength in the past three
years.

154
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:47,805
{\an7}<i>I don't know how he trained...</i>
<i>But he's nothing like how he</i>
<i>was in the past.</i>

155

{\an7}<i>I'm still not strong</i>
<i>enough. </i>

156
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,874
{\an8}<i>How do I...?</i>

<i>the Hokage's son yesterday.</i>

162
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:54,432
{\an1}<i>What?! I just saw them!</i>
<i>They were walking around</i>
<i>like nothing happened!</i>

163

{\an4}<i>They act all big with us</i>

<i>a powerful official, huh?  </i>

164

{\an1}<i>They're just the Hokage's</i>
<i>lapdogs, after all.</i>

165
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:07,237
{\an1}There's been a lot of
gossip going around...

166
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,271
{\an1}I know... Letting him
go was a big mistake!

167
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:13,005
{\an1}We've clamped down
on everyone until now.

168
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:16,508
{\an1}So when we make an exception,
they all drag us through the
mud!

169
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,742
{\an1}But the Lieutenant said
to leave him alone!

170
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:22,076
{\an1}He also told us to think
for ourselves and handle
things on our own!

171
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:26,645
{\an1}For the sake of our clan,
we have to make the
right decision now...!

172
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,514
{\an1}I'm gonna go all out and whip up
something really special today!

173
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,681
{\an1}[door slamming open]

174

{\an1}What's going on?!  You can't
just barge into someone's house!

175
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:44,619
{\an1}Especially with your
dirty shoes on!

176
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:50,120
{\an1}Bring us Naruto Uzumaki!  We
want to question him about
interfering with our duties!

177
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,723
{\an1}I don't know what you're talking
about!  Interfering...?

178
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:57,223
{\an1}Look, I know my son, and he
would never, ever do anything
like that!

179
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:00,993
{\an1}Hey, wait a minute! Who gave you
the authority to do this?!

180
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,627
{\an1}I'll tell Minato and you'll
get an earful, y'know!

181
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,961
Protect him, and
you'll come, too!

186
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:32,705
{\an1}The captain wants you.
Lieutenant, please come
with me right now.

187
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,606
[gasp]

188
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:42,175
{\an1}I had some misgivings, but I
never expected this!

189
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:45,777
{\an1}The Police Force raiding the
Hokage's home without
authorization!

190
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,845
{\an1}My sincerest apologies.

191
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:53,613
{\an1}At least... there was no one who
got hurt in this incident...

192
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,481
{\an1}What will Fugaku do?

193
00:14:55,514 --> 00:15:00,316
{\an1}He'll investigate... and
take the appropriate
disciplinary measures.

194
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,218
{\an1}I just hope that they ease
up a little bit now.

195
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:16,356
What the hell?

196
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,591
{\an1}Lieutenant!  We're sorry!  We
just did it for the Uchiha!

197
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,329
{\an1}Enough. Just throw all
of them into a cell.

198
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:33,564
{\an1}<i>Sir!</i>

199
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:40,299
{\an1}You told me you were going
to take a different path.
And you did become stronger.

200
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:46,435
{\an1}But after all the boasting you
did, I had hoped there was some
substance behind it.

201
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:50,871
I guess it was
for nothing, though.

202
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:59,073
{\an1}All you really ended up doing
was empowering fools to
indulge in idiotic behavior.

203
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:02,508
Nothing good has
come out of this.

204
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,944
You will never
measure up to Itachi!

205
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:14,479
Someone like you doesn't
belong in my unit.

206
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:18,848
{\an1}You are now relieved of all
your duties as lieutenant.

207
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:21,549
{\an1}You're dismissed from the
Leaf Police Force.

208
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,486
{\an1}The Leaf Police
Force really did that?

209
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:35,121
{\an1}So what's gonna happen
to Sasuke, I wonder...

210
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,323
I'm not sure.
But, you know...

211
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:42,458
{\an1}Even if this incident does
get him fired rom the
force, who really cares?

212
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:46,659
{\an1}We'll just give him a slap on
the back and welcome him right
back onto our team again.

213
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:49,660
Yeah!

214
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:02,733
{\an7}<i>What the hell... have I been</i>
<i>doing...  for the past three</i>
<i>years...</i>

215
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:07,702
{\an7}<i>Why is he so different from me?!</i>

216
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:15,871
{\an7}<i>It's power... I need power.</i>

217
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,774
You've come.

218
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,812
{\an1}You wanted to see me. You must
have something up your sleeve.

219
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,512
{\an1}I only came to see what
exactly you're offering.

220
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:40,481
{\an1}Oh, is that so?  You only came
here to see that, did you?

221
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:44,683
{\an1}I want to take advantage of you,
too. I thought that we'd have a
nice chat.

222
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:48,351
{\an1}Well, then...? What is
it that you want?

223
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:53,854
{\an1}I want power...
Enough power to beat him.

224
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,655
{\an1}Yes, of course. I
predicted as much.

225
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:59,289
{\an1}But...  are you sure?

226
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:02,557
{\an1}Not only is Naruto Uzumaki
the son of the Hokage...

227
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,093
{\an1}<i>...he's also the Nine Tails'</i>
<i>Jinchuriki, which is essential</i>
<i>to this village.</i>

228
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:13,095
{\an4}If you reach your goal, it's
quite possible that the Uchiha's
standing in the village will
become even worse.

229
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,895
{\an1}I don't care.

230
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,529
{\an1}Beating him's all
that matters to me.

231
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,765
{\an1}I don't care about the
Uchiha or the Leaf.

232
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:22,965
{\an1}What's so funny?
[chuckle]

233
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:28,301
{\an4}I remember a shinobi who
deserted the village long ago
saying something just like
that...

234
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:36,371
{\an1}He betrayed everyone, committed
numerous crimes, and in exchange
obtained frightening power.

235
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,272
{\an1}The name of that shinobi
is Orochimaru...

236
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:46,341
{\an1}He's one of the Three Legendary
Sannin, like Jiraiya, Naruto's
mentor.

237
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,076
{\an1}The Legendary Sannin.
I'm listening...

238
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,177
{\an1}<i>He has knowledge of the myriad</i>
<i>jutsu in this world, including</i>
<i>forbidden ones. </i>

239
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:59,047
{\an1}I can't think of a single person
better than him to learn from.

240
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:08,250
{\an4}<i>However... he is a man who has</i>
<i> lived within darkness.</i>
<i>Remember that's the price you'll</i>
<i>pay.</i>

241
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:11,218
{\an1}I'm looking forward to it.

242
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,586
{\an1}Very well, then.

243
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,921
{\an1}Before sunrise, go to the tower
at the border. And I'll take
care of the rest of it...

244
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,991
{\an1}We aren't done here yet. I
want to know what you're
getting out of this.

245
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,859
{\an1}It's your choice whether
you believe me...

246
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:35,029
{\an1}But I am one of the many who do
not look with much kindness upon
that creature, the Nine Tails.

247
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:39,296
{\an1}It's nothing but a monster. It
could rampage at any moment,

248
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,698
{\an1}and I doubt that it's wise to
leave such power unbridled...

249
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:46,532
{\an1}I feel that we need the power to
be able to fight against it.

250
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:48,500
{\an1}Humph.

251
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,071
Now, go...

252
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:03,706
{\an1}The contract has been fulfilled.

253
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:07,408
{\an1}And now the rest of
it will be up to you.
