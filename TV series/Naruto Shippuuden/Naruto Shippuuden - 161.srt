00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,887
{\an1}-How dare those guys
just come in here

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,323
{\an1}and mess up our entire
village like this.

4
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:22,691
{\an1}UDON: Konohamaru!

5
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:25,462
{\an1}MOEGI: Konohamaru!

00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:26,431
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Udon.

Moegi.

00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,469
{\an1}Just in time guys.

00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:31,803
Come on!

10
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,739
{\an1}It's up to us to save the
Hidden Leaf from this disaster.

11
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:34,940
-What?

12
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:37,243
{\an1}We just managed to get
away from all the trouble.

13
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,113
{\an1}Now you want us to go back?

14
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:41,315
{\an1}-Big brother Naruto
is away right now,

15
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:44,352
{\an1}so it's our duty to protect
the village while he's gone.

16
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,787
{\an1}-Yeah, but there's
nothing we could

17
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:48,624
{\an1}do, not against monsters
as powerful as these.

18
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,026
[explosion]

19
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,995
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: I'll just
blast it with the new jutsu

20
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:53,997
{\an1}that Naruto taught me.

21
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,433
{\an1}UDON: What new justu?

22
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:58,237
{\an1}MOEGI: It's probably just
the usual sexy jutsu.

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,840
-No.

24
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,977
{\an1}NARUTO: Konohamaru, I've got
this totally cool new jutsu

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,178
{\an1}I want to teach you.

26
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,615
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: What's with
you all of a sudden?

27
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:13,021
{\an1}-Well, I uh-- what I mean is
it's time for me to step up,

28
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,024
{\an1}time for me to become a teacher.

29
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,025
Huh?

30
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,062
{\an1}-And what is that
supposed to mean?

31
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,396
NARUTO: Mm.

32
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,500
{\an1}KONOHAMAURU(VOICEOVER):Don't
tell me he came up with some

33
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,802
{\an1}awesome new sexy jutsu.

34
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:24,870
{\an1}NARUTO: Anyway, look.

35
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,572
{\an1}This new jutsu that
I'm going to teach you

36
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:28,509
{\an1}is like nothing you've
ever seen before.

37
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:29,943
{\an1}It's totally different and cool.

38
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:30,777
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Come on!

39
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,180
Just show me!

40
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,850
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) I wonder what
kind of sexy jutsu it is.

41
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:37,086
-All right.

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,088
{\an1}The first step's rotation.

43
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,157
Whoa!

44
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,560
{\an1}So we are going to
add motion to it, huh?

45
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:44,295
-That's right.

46
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,730
{\an1}And the second step's power.

47
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:47,765
{\an1}-Oh, I see, attack
with the risque.

48
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,135
Awesome!

49
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:52,738
{\an1}NARUTO: And then third,
comes the final step.

50
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,007
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Ugh, seriously?

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,011
{\an1}There's still more?

52
00:01:57,044 --> 00:01:58,012
{\an1}NARUTO: Containment.

53
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:59,281
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Woah.

54
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:02,184
{\an1}The most points go to the
best cute expression, eh?

55
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,519
{\an1}-What are you talking about?

56
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,053
Quit kidding.

57
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:08,292
{\an1}-At first, I thought
what he meant

58
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:12,764
{\an1}was just another sexy jutsu,
but this is way different.

59
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:16,569
{\an1}With this jutsu, I can
go on A-ranked missions.

60
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,105
{\an1}-What do you mean
A-ranked missions?

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,210
{\an1}We've got other things to worry
about at a time like this.

62
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:22,977
-Yeah.

63
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,580
{\an1}Moegi's right Konohamaru.

64
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:27,182
{\an1}Right now our duty is to
locate any civilians who

65
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,818
{\an1}might need rescuing and then
evacuate them to safety.

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,367
[monster roars]

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,936
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: We're supposed to
evacuate the children and those

68
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,572
{\an1}who can't fight, huh?

69
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,640
-Mm hm.

70
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,277
{\an1}I'll check out how
things are in block c.

71
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,878
{\an1}-I'll check block e.

72
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:51,714
-All right.

73
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:53,115
{\an1}I'm going to block b then.

74
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,783
I'll go see if
there's anyone there

75
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,686
{\an1}who didn't make it out already.

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,255
{\an1}-Just be careful, Konohamaru.

77
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:13,073
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Hello,
is anyone here?

78
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:14,275
Anyone?

79
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,711
{\an1}OLD WOMAN: Help me.

80
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,179
-Where are you?

81
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,147
Can you hear me?

82
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,589
{\an1}Are you all right?

83
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:30,995
Just hang on.

84
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,173
{\an1}How could someone do
something like this?

85
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,643
{\an1}NARUTO: If we can't merge,
I've got to figure out some way

86
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:44,646
{\an1}to pull in nature
energy while I'm moving.

87
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,250
{\an1}FUKASAKU: But I already told
you that it's impossible.

88
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:50,387
{\an1}I never imagined this would
happen after coming so close.

89
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,293
{\an1}-I'm not just going to give up.

90
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,331
{\an1}There's no other choice, so
I'll find a way to make it work.

91
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,701
{\an1}FUKASAKU: But I'm telling you
that there is no other way.

92
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,207
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,343
I know that this
is hard to accept,

94
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:12,915
{\an1}but it's just not physically
possible to do that.

95
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,452
{\an1}NARUTO: That code
on your back, that's

96
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:18,824
{\an1}a message to me from Pervy Sage.

97
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:19,725
-Of course.

98
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:20,925
I know that.

99
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,261
{\an1}And thanks to you it
has also become a key

100
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,431
to solving the
mystery behind Pain.

101
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,867
-Not just that.

102
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,437
That was also a
message to me directly,

103
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,341
{\an1}telling me to never give
up until the very end.

104
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,076
{\an1}-But it simply cannot be done.

105
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,916
{\an1}NARUTO: Look, I'm
Pervy Sage's student,

106
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,121
{\an1}and if that message was
my master's ninja way,

107
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:48,761
{\an1}well then, I have no time
to waste whining and moaning

108
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,597
about this.

109
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,101
[music playing]

110
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,442
{\an1}-Thank you young man.

111
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:47,343
-Sure.

112
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:48,879
You're going to
be all right now.

113
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:58,958
[screaming] That
crest, it's the gang

114
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:13,242
[screaming] That
crest, it's the gang

115
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,780
{\an1}that killed uncle
Asuma the Akatsuki.

116
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:22,321
{\an1}PAIN: Is Nartuto Uzumaki
in this village, or not?

117
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:24,222
Tell me now.

118
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:25,658
{\an1}-You want Naruto.

119
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,027
No way!

120
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:30,130
{\an1}Naruto is one of us, and we
would never sell out a comrade.

121
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:36,839
{\an1}PAIN: The will of fire, hm?

122
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,374
-What of it?

123
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,077
-If you do not
answer my question,

124
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,379
{\an1}then you will have no future.

125
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:43,213
{\an1}So I will ask again.

126
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,859
{\an1}NINJA: What the hell is that?

127
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:56,097
{\an1}-Will I find Naruto Uzumaki
somewhere in this village

128
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,231
or won't I?

129
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,600
Tell me.

130
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,802
{\an1}-I don't know anything.

131
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,905
{\an1}Now get lost, will ya?

132
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,709
{\an1}-We just told you we
don't know where he is.

133
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:06,844
Let us go.

134
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,579
-I see.

135
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,582
{\an1}Then, I shall pas
judgement on you.

136
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,860
{\an1}PAIN: It seems that
you truly did not know.

137
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:57,541
KONOHAMARU
(VOICEOVER):What's going on?

138
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:59,911
{\an1}The enemy didn't do anything,
but the guy on the left

139
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:01,846
{\an1}just stopped moving
all of a sudden.

140
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,581
{\an1}What did the enemy do to him?

141
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,284
Was that chuunin
killed without being

142
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,519
{\an1}able to fight back at all?

143
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,923
{\an1}Whatever it is, I got
to get out of here now.

144
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,595
Did he hear me?

145
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:33,787
{\an1}-It seems you've gotten too
used to having your own way.

146
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,689
{\an1}Well, that ends right here.

147
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,725
I have no mercy
for thugs like you.

148
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:41,629
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Ebisu sensei.

149
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:49,740
{\an1}EBISU (VOICEOVER): Go.

150
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:50,875
{\an1}Get out of here Konohamaru.

151
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,856
{\an1}EBISU: Your fight's right here.

152
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:43,540
{\an1}It's going to take way
more than that to kill me.

153
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,512
-Ebisu sensei.

154
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,921
{\an1}EBISU (VOICEOVER): I
have to buy some time

155
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,289
{\an1}to allow Konohamaru to escape.

156
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:13,612
{\an1}KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

157
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:17,617
{\an1}What should I do?

158
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,619
How can I--

159
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,730
{\an1}EBISU (VOICEOVER):
Good, he got away.

160
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,276
{\an1}Let my guard down.

161
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,648
{\an1}Big mistake, but at least I've
done what I needed to do here.

162
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:50,659
{\an1}PAIN: Now is Naruto Uzumaki
in this village, or isn't he?

163
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,596
{\an1}If you know, tell me.

164
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,403
-Wha-- Naruto?

165
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,939
{\an1}KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Big brother Naruto?

166
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:04,510
{\an1}PAIN: It appears that you
do know Naruto Uzumaki so

167
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,011
{\an1}tell me where he is now.

168
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:16,792
{\an1}-I may not look it, but I'm
ranked an elite instructor,

169
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:20,697
{\an1}and Naruto was my student.

170
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,300
{\an1}Long ago, I considered
him to be nothing

171
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:26,972
{\an1}but a nuisance who stood in
the way of Konohamaru's rise

172
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,208
to hokage.

173
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:32,511
{\an1}I was absolutely certain of it.

174
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:37,352
{\an1}However, Naruto didn't allow his
cursed fate to discourage him.

175
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,422
{\an1}With unending optimism
and determination,

176
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:44,827
{\an1}he faced one challenge after
another and overcame them.

177
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,764
{\an1}The important lessons
I wasn't able to teach,

178
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,267
despite being an
instructor, Naruto

179
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,436
{\an1}taught them to my student.

180
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,512
PAIN: Enough.

181
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,516
{\an1}You've rambled on for
far too long already.

182
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,551
{\an1}I'll give you one more chance.

183
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:08,391
{\an1}Do you know where Naruto
Uzumaki is or don't you?

184
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:13,897
{\an1}Answer me right right now or
I'll kill you in a heartbeat.

185
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,299
EBISU: Naruto.

186
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,304
{\an1}You You will overcome
the death of you master

187
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,707
{\an1}and carry on his legacy.

188
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,642
{\an1}The indomitable will
that you possess

189
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:28,049
{\an1}will teach Konohamaru-- no--
everyone in the Leaf village

190
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:28,883
many lessons.

191
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:37,693
{\an1}Naruto is one of us, a comrade
of the Hidden Leaf village.

192
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,096
{\an1}Ask all you want.

193
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,899
{\an1}I have no intention of telling
you Akatsuki anything about him

194
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,301
at all.

195
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,271
{\an1}KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Ebisu sensei.

196
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,539
PAIN: I see.

197
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:56,617
{\an1}In that case, Naruto--
Because when they look at me,

198
00:13:56,617 --> 00:14:05,196
{\an1}In that case, Naruto--
Because when they look at me,

199
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:06,596
{\an1}they don't really see me.

200
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,700
{\an1}They just see the
grandson of the Hokage.

201
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,037
{\an1}I can't stand it anymore!

202
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,578
{\an1}That's why I just got to
become a Hokage right now.

203
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,212
NARUTO: Sorry.

204
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:19,646
{\an1}It's not that simple.

205
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,647
KONOHAMARU: Huh?

206
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:22,750
NARUTO: You keep
saying Hokage Hokage.

207
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,354
To really be a
Hokage, you're going

208
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:29,459
{\an1}to have to defeat me in battle.

209
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,296
{\an1}-From now on, we are rivals.

210
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,630
{\an1}-Challenge accepted.

211
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,669
{\an1}And, one day, we'll fight
for the title of Hokage.

212
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,507
{\an1}Until then, let's both look
forward to that day Konohamaru.

213
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:51,454
{\an1}EBISU (VOICEOVER): It
seems this is it for me.

214
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:55,225
{\an1}I hope you were able
to get away Konohamaru.

215
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:55,725
PAIN: Die.

216
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,970
-Come on!

217
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:05,804
Fight me.

218
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,747
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) I always taught
that in the ninja world,

219
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,951
{\an1}there are no shortcuts.

220
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:17,886
{\an1}EBISU (ANGRILY): No Konohamaru!

221
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,722
{\an1}Why didn't you run when
you had the chance?

222
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,791
{\an1}You have so much potential.

223
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,128
{\an1}One day you could
even become Hokage.

224
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:28,800
{\an1}You can't just throw
your life away like this.

225
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,539
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Long ago,
I made a promise.

226
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:36,511
{\an1}I promised Naruto to fight him
over the title of Hokage one

227
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:37,512
day.

228
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,948
{\an1}We both promised.

229
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:44,987
{\an1}Big brother Naruto is my rival,
so I'm not choosing an escape

230
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:52,431
{\an1}route because Naruto won't
be on that shorter path.

231
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:53,432
So fast.

232
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,873
{\an1}(VOICEOVER) One thing's certain,
if he catches me, I'm dead.

233
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:29,611
{\an1}If he catches me, he'll kill
me with that weird jutsu.

234
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:44,963
-Konohamaru!

235
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,375
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Se-- Sensei!

236
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,380
{\an1}PAIN: Is Naruto Uzumaki
in this village, or not?

237
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,517
Tell me now.

238
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,884
KONOHAMARU
(VOICEOVER): I get it.

239
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,853
{\an1}So this is what you
see if you get caught.

240
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:04,988
PAIN: Speak.

241
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:05,723
Answer me.

242
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,301
{\an1}It seems that you
truly did not know.

243
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,804
{\an1}KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm starting

244
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,973
{\an1}to figure out this
guy's ability.

245
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,410
I don't have a
clue if he's here.

246
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,618
-No, Konohamaru.

247
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,411
{\an1}KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Brother Naruto.

248
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,082
{\an1}NARUTO: Konohamaru, I've got
this totally cool new jutsu

249
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,183
{\an1}I want to teach you.

250
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:56,720
{\an1}It's an A-ranked jutsu
and hard to master.

251
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,562
PAIN: I see.

252
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:07,066
{\an1}Then I shall pass--
a shadow clone!

253
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,504
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A
super advanced ninjutusu

254
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:13,107
{\an1}that combines chakra rotation,
power, and containment.

255
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:13,975
{\an1}KONOHAMARU: Rasengan!

256
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:30,663
EBISU: What?

257
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:33,700
{\an1}When did he learn--
I'm a genin honored

258
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,002
{\an1}with the name of this village.

259
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:38,440
{\an1}My surname is Sarutobi and
my given name is Konohamaru.

260
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,409
{\an1}You will remember me.

261
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:57,764
-One more time.

262
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:58,699
{\an1}We got to keep trying.

263
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,508
{\an1}FUKASAKU: Sage jutsu is not
meant for everybody, not

264
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,944
by a long shot.

265
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,813
{\an1}You could say it's
possible because it's

266
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,582
{\an1}you and Jiraiya-boy.

267
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:16,554
{\an1}Because, otherwise, I wouldn't
have even brought you here.

268
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,961
{\an1}And unless you already possess
enormous chakra inside of you,

269
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,397
{\an1}the nature energy would simply
take over and transform you

270
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,299
immediately.

271
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,338
{\an1}And also, you must possess the
guts to never ever give up.

272
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:40,919
{\an1}You are such a stubborn lad.

273
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:43,522
{\an1}Let's take a little
break Naruto-boy,

274
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,191
{\an1}otherwise, I won't
last much longer.

275
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:46,759
-No.

276
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:47,895
We can't stop.

277
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,763
{\an1}I've got to work even
harder than I did just

278
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:50,797
{\an1}to get to this point.

279
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:51,866
Now come on!

280
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,134
FUKASAKU: Just
listen Naruto-boy.

281
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:58,173
{\an1}This sort of training has
never been tried not once.

282
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,545
{\an1}I mean to try to gather nature
energy whose main principle is

283
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:03,647
stillness while
you're running, well,

284
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,417
{\an1}it's just like trying to make
yourself look to the left

285
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,053
{\an1}when you're already
looking to the right.

286
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:09,621
NARUTO: Ah ha!

287
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:14,360
-What?

288
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:15,061
What is It?

289
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:35,588
[music playing]

290
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:45,600
[music playing]

291
00:21:56,723 --> 00:22:00,661
{\an1}PAIN: All of you, you push
death out of your thoughts.

292
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:06,903
{\an1}In battle, both sides suffer
death, injury, and pain.

293
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,971
Feel pain.

294
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:11,075
{\an1}Contemplate pain.

295
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,144
Accept pain.

296
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:15,580
Know pain.

297
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:20,419
{\an1}Next time, on Naruto
Shippuuden, Pain to the World.

298
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,922
Almighty push.

299
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:41,579
{\an1}-My sexiness will get Sasuke
this time. [laughter] Now,

300
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,348
{\an1}this ought to do it.

301
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:44,183
-What was that?

302
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:45,283
{\an1}What ought to do it?

303
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,557
{\an1}-I thought we could
just hang out.

304
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,326
{\an1}May be sit around and talk.

{\an1}Don't be so uptight
and boring Sasuke.

308
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,737
{\an1}-This is shear heaven.

309
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:03,540
{\an1}-Just what the hell do you
think you are doing Suigetsu?

310
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,643
{\an1}SUIGETSU: I could ask
you the same thing.

311

-What?

312
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,113

happen to be-- I

313
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:12,819
{\an1}mean-- I-- none of you business.

00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:13,953
Damn!

315
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:17,258
{\an1}It was the perfect
opportunity to-- Oh well,

316
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,297
{\an1}it's fine because at least
I got a hold of this.

317
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,236
