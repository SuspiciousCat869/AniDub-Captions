I'm sorry. But Izumo and
Kotetsu both disappeared
all of a sudden,

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:52.499 position:7% line:83% align:start
so I just got out of there as
quickly as I could...

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:58.773 position:5% line:77% align:start
To be completely honest, I don't
even remember how I made it back
to the Village at all.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:02.076 position:7% line:77% align:start
I understand.  I'm sorry that
you had to go through all
that...

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.750 position:16% line:77% align:start
But even if you remember
something that seems minor,...
please...  be sure to tell me.

Ageha... an
Ageha butterfly...

He probably means
the Shinobi Ageha.

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:35.176 position:5% line:77% align:start
In this season, it's not unusual
to see them in the forest near
that village.

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
And is this butterfly
poisonous or anything?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.950 position:5% line:77% align:start
No, but... It has powdery scales
that are known to encourage the
flow of chakra.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're used as one of the main
ingredients in food pills.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.325 position:33% line:77% align:start
[sigh] I can't believe
Izumo and Kotetsu could
be beaten so easily.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thanks, everyone. It
looks like we're all set.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:07.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not quite.  Team
7 is still-

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:10.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry we're late,
Lord Hokage...

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:13.446 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, we're all here now.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.684 position:7% line:83% align:start
Time is tight. So I'll explain
the mission now.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:22.190 position:10% line:5% align:start
I hope that this is way more
exciting than looking for a lost
cat or something super lame like
that!

00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:24.659 position:38% line:17% align:start
Ahem...

00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
This mission is a very
important one, okay?

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.730 position:80% line:89% align:start
Heh!?

00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:35.368 position:5% line:71% align:start
Three teams of shinobi that had
been dispatched on secret
missions have all gone missing
for some unknown reason.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:39.841 position:16% line:77% align:start
So your mission is to go
out and conduct a search to
try to find them.

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:42.977 position:66% line:89% align:start
Aw yeah!!!

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:50.918 position:7% line:77% align:start
However, if you do find them,
you're to contact the Hidden
Leaf right away.

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.788 position:38% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Minato)</i>
 <i>Any attempts at rescue</i>
 <i>are forbidden.</i>

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:56.389 position:50% line:89% align:start
But why is that?

00:05:56.423 --> 00:06:04.699 position:7% line:71% align:start
Considering who's been chosen
for this mission, the answer to
that should be pretty obvious to
everybody.

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:09.503 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know!  Is it 'cause all of us
are elite ninja overflowing with
unbelievable talent?!

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:16.310 position:5% line:77% align:start
Nearly all of the shinobi who've
gone missing are very
experienced jonin...

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:20.480 position:5% line:77% align:start
But the only one who was able to
make it back to the village was
a genin.

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:27.288 position:5% line:77% align:start
So it could mean that those with
experience and maturity are the
ones who are being targeted.

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.389 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mmm... and so that means?

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:35.263 position:5% line:71% align:start
It means that we were picked to
handle this situation because
we're newbies who just became
genin.

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:37.765 position:21% line:83% align:start

it that way...

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.424 position:7% line:83% align:start
Isn't the village where we're
heading still a ways off?

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:05.159 position:64% line:89% align:start
Look there.

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.294 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:14.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
And then we'll have to get word
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:18.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what Lord Hokage ordered,
after all. All right?

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:18.839 position:83% line:89% align:start
Mhm.

00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:22.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold on... hey guys! Stop!

00:12:23.511 --> 00:12:26.046 position:80% line:89% align:start
What?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.587 position:5% line:5% align:start
Damn it. Exactly what the Fourth
Hokage feared was going to
happen has just happened...

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.022 position:83% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:39.594 position:10% line:71% align:start
It's probably safe for us to
assume that the same thing has
happened to the captains of the
other teams, as well.

00:12:39.628 --> 00:12:41.596 position:27% line:89% align:start
The other teams, really?

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:47.468 position:7% line:77% align:start
Wait, so it's not only us? You
mean, Sasuke and Kiba and...
everyone's been left behind?

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:55.009 position:7% line:77% align:start
Prob'ly. I just hope Kakashi's
team isn't arguing among
themselves right now...

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.878 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since <i>one of them</i> can
be a real drag.

Why, you--!

00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:01.315 position:50% line:89% align:start
Wait, you loser!

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:04.785 position:7% line:83% align:start
No!  I already told you guys!
I'm never gonna give up!

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.854 position:41% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but where are
you even going?

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:09.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, uh, I don't know,
exactly, but still!

00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:15.530 position:10% line:77% align:start
Sometimes it's hard to believe
you're really the son of the
Fourth Hokage...

00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:18.899 position:7% line:89% align:start
What did you just say to me!?

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:23.672 position:16% line:77% align:start
Do you really think that the
Hokage would send us out without
setting up any safeguards?

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:25.239 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:30.411 position:33% line:77% align:start
Listen, I saw him pass
out special kunai to
all the team captains.

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:32.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
What?  Special kunai?

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.516 position:55% line:89% align:start
Did I stutter?

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:39.320 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>The ones he marks when he uses</i>
 <i>the Transportation Ninjutsu</i>

Transportation Ninjutsu?

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.702 position:44% line:83% align:start
Look, you know the
Summoning Jutsu, right?

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:54.868 position:38% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Naruto)</i>
 <i>Yeah...</i>

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.605 position:41% line:83% align:start
Well... Think of it
as that type of jutsu.

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:02.409 position:5% line:77% align:start
The special kunai is the target.
And no matter how far away you
are...

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:06.146 position:21% line:83% align:start
...you can transport right
to the kunai in an instant

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.651 position:30% line:77% align:start
Lord Fourth is the only
one who's currently able
to use that jutsu.

00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:13.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, okay!  I get it! I gotta
say, my Dad's pretty cool!

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on! I'm sorry, but I don't
think that's gonna work...

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:20.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:23.230 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>Uhhh... but that's...</i>

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:25.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
I found it at the spot
where he disappeared.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.436 position:5% line:89% align:start
This situation just got worse...

00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:38.078 position:7% line:77% align:start
I can practically see the big
commotion that I'm certain Lee
must be raising because of Guy

00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:40.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sensei disappearing
all of a sudden...

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:45.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei! Guy
Sensei! Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei!

00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:46.855 position:52% line:89% align:start
Slow down, Lee!

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.021 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have to calm down!

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:50.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, you are asking me
for the impossible!

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:55.195 position:16% line:77% align:start
Is the Shinobi Code more
important to you two than the
life of Guy Sensei?!

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not what we're saying!

00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't believe this,
you blockhead!

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:07.441 position:27% line:89% align:start
Guy Sensei...!!

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.914 position:5% line:5% align:start
What do you think
you are doing?!

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:15.916 position:27% line:5% align:start
Just listen, would you!?

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:20.454 position:7% line:77% align:start
Shortly before Guy Sensei went
missing, there was an unusual
chakra current underground.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
So did you detect it
with your Byakugan?

00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:27.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. But the current's
not there anymore.

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:30.431 position:41% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Neji)</i>

[sigh]

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:43.711 position:10% line:83% align:start
The key players will be the
members of Kurenai's team.

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.245 position:33% line:89% align:start
What do you mean? Why?

 <i>Hinata's Byakugan,</i>

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>and Shino's Parasitic Insects...</i>

 <i>the other three teams.</i>

00:15:55.289 --> 00:16:01.228 position:7% line:71% align:start
And even more than that, they
can probably find the place
where the team captains are
being held right now, as well.

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:05.767 position:10% line:77% align:start
Yeah, you're right!  That'll
make things way faster than just
moving ahead blindly.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.138 position:10% line:77% align:start
In situations like this one,
panic and proceeding without
thinking are our worst enemies.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
It just makes more work for
everyone.

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:20.615 position:7% line:77% align:start
So until we're able to join up
with Kurenai's team... we'll
just sit tight.

00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:34.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
Good! Asuma's team is over
in that direction.

00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those guys are just sitting
there, doing nothing.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:44.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure they know that
we're looking for them.

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:47.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
In any case... lets join up
with Shikamaru quickly.

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:52.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then we can pass his ideas on to
the other teams and all come up
with a unified plan.

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:58.018 position:5% line:71% align:start
The reason is because I have a
feeling there's someone who's
going act without thinking
things through...

00:16:58.051 --> 00:17:02.456 position:10% line:77% align:start
Our individual abilities are
going to come in very handy in
this situation.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:08.763 position:13% line:71% align:start
Yeah, Shikamaru is smart, but
he's still gonna need all our
skills when it comes time to
put a plan into action!

00:17:08.796 --> 00:17:10.732 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:19.373 position:5% line:77% align:start

team should be over in this
area.

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:20.575 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:17:53.273 --> 00:18:00.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
