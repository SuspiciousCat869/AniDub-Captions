1
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,345
{\an1}UTAKATA: I believe
that's my seat.

2
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,381
-Huh?

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,650
Utakata?

4
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,951
-It's Tonbee.

5
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,118
He wants you.

6
00:00:58,728 --> 00:00:59,895
{\an1}-I leave it to you.

7
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:11,909
-Again.

8
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,515
{\an1}- He sure went through
a lot of trouble

9
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:20,085
{\an1}to set up this many traps
just to guard an open field.

10
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:23,589
{\an1}Talk about going overboard.

11
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,158
- As we speak,
someone is setting off our traps

12
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:28,928
and rapidly
approaching our fort.

13
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:30,630
{\an1}In case this is a
malicious attack,

14
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,100
{\an1}I have alerted the Hidden
Leaf, in accordance

15
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,103
with the Leaf
master's instructions.

16
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,805
{\an1}It's impossible for
any ordinary person

17
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:40,641
{\an1}to get close to this fort.

18
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:44,078
{\an1}But if an enemy does succeed
in reaching this place...

19
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:45,748
{\an1}- If the three of
us work together,

20
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,516
{\an1}we should have no trouble
fighting them off.

21
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,719
We'll show them.

22
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,788
{\an1}-Why did they target this place?

23
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:55,291
{\an1}What reason could they
have for coming here?

24
00:01:55,291 --> 00:02:01,666
{\an1}- My guess is the forbidden
jutsu that our clan possesses.

25
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,201
{\an1}CHUSHIN: All those traps.

26
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,272
{\an1}Once you get past 'em,
there's a huge ravine.

27
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:10,610
{\an1}And on top of that, on the
other side, there's a barrier.

28
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,012
{\an1}You think these people are
a little cautious, or what?

29
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,782
Am I right,
or am I right, Nango?

30
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:15,114
You tell me.

31
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,654
-Yeah.

32
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:22,990
{\an1}CHUSHIN: Was that it?

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,293
{\an1}You're not a man of many
words, are ya?

34
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,028
- Enough of your
babbling, Chushin.

35
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,898
Understand?

36
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,566
{\an1}You know what they say.

37
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,967
{\an1}A loose mouth reveals
an empty brain.

38
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:35,204
-Funny.

39
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:36,105
{\an1}I'd say you're the one who
looks bad every time you

40
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,507
{\an1}open your mouth, Benten.

41
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,381
{\an1}- Going to such extremes
as they have shows

42
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,084
{\an1}they're protecting
something valuable.

43
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:47,251
Get in position.

44
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,470
That must be it.

45
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,603
Ha!

46
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:13,013
-What?

47
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:15,383
The barrier...
it's been penetrated.

48
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:19,020
-These men...
they mean business.

49
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,956
-Benten.

50
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:20,356
-I'm on it.

51
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,879
{\an1}-Now we climb this mountain.

52
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,582
{\an1}TONBEE: Lady Hotaru, take this.

53
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:46,720
{\an1}We must keep your grandfather's
forbidden jutsu safe,

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,623
{\an1}so you and our guest,
Utakata, must go.

55
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,525
{\an1}Escape to the secret
village in the mountains.

56
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,494
-What about you?

57
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:56,130
{\an1}-I shall follow you soon.

58
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,498
Now hurry.

59
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:58,934
-No way.

60
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,235
{\an1}If we go, we go together.

61
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,872
{\an1}- The enemy is at our
doorstep as we speak.

62
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,408
{\an1}This is no time for arguments
and self-indulgence.

63
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:06,308
-Huh?

64
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:10,580
-Are you coming?

65
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,119
{\an1}-Please go, Lady Hotaru.

66
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:23,127
Utakata, wait.

67
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:33,439
I beg of you,
take good care of Lady Hotaru.

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,273
{\an1}- I'll repay you for
your hospitality.

69
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,857
{\an1}-Whew, that was a close one.

70
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,593
{\an1}This isn't going to
be an ordinary climb,

71
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,228
is it, Akaboshi?

72
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,898
{\an1}- Considering what
we've been through,

73
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:56,633
{\an1}there's gotta be something
pretty special waiting for us

74
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,436
at the summit.

75
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:03,574
- Lady Hotaru,
you must be extremely careful.

76
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:08,046
{\an1}Whatever happens, you must
not leave Utakata's side.

77
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,716
{\an1}- Tonbee, you have to promise
that you'll follow us.

78
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,818
Promise me.

79
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,620
{\an1}- Lady Hotaru, think of your own
safety now, and nothing else.

80
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,865
{\an1}TONBEE (VOICEOVER):
Lord En no Gyoja, I

81
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,433
{\an1}promise to buy them as
much time as possible.

82
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,310
{\an1}I will protect Lady
Hotaru, no matter what.

83
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,647
[theme music]

84
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:22,733
{\an1}SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade,
we just received this.

85
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,043
-This can't be.

86
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,737
[boom]

87
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:57,173
[groan]

88
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,641
-Lady Katsuyu.

89
00:07:58,641 --> 00:07:59,308
-Oh.

90
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,011
Kakashi.

91
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,779
-Really?

92
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,948
{\an1}Lady Katsuyu came
this far to greet us?

93
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,017
-No.

94
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:06,818
She didn't.

95
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:09,187
-Hm?

96
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:09,854
{\an1}-There must be trouble brewing.

97
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,628
The only time...

98
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,431
{\an1}- The only time Lady
Tsunade uses Lady Katsuyu

99
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,366
{\an1}is when there's some
kind of emergency.

100
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,436
-Got it.

101
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,638
{\an1}So we're dealing with
an urgent situation.

102
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,707
{\an1}HINATA (VOICEOVER): I
know how you feel, Shino.

103
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,878
{\an1}When you're not allowed to
finish what you want to say.

104
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:31,946
-What?

105
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,882
A secret treaty?

106
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:35,482
-Yes.

107
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,852
{\an1}Back during the Third
Great Ninja War,

108
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:39,788
{\an1}the leader of the Tsuchigumo
clan, En no Gyoja,

109
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,590
{\an1}passed down a jutsu which was
responsible for wiping out

110
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:41,858
{\an1}an entire village.

111
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:03,481
The Third Hokage
demanded that such

112
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,317
a dangerous and
destructive jutsu

113
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:08,654
{\an1}be classified as forbidden.

114
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:11,291
{\an1}And in exchange for
that, the Hidden Leaf

115
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,161
{\an1}agreed to provide them with
aid whenever the Tsuchigumo

116
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,832
{\an1}clan found itself in danger.

117
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:20,534
{\an1}KATSUYU: Kakashi, you are
to report to the village

118
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,371
{\an1}for debriefing about
your last mission.

119
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,573
-Understood.

120
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,975
{\an1}We're battling against time.

121
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,112
{\an1}Team 7 will go with Captain
Yamato, and head for Mt.

122
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,412
{\an1}Katsuragi immediately.

123
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:32,482
-Right.

124
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:35,252
- But you're not
coming, Kakashi-sensei?

125
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:37,688
{\an1}-Do you have a problem with me?

126
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:41,792
{\an1}- Uh, that isn't what I
meant, Yamato.

127
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,527
{\an1}TSUNADE: En no Gyoja passed away

128
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,697
{\an1}a year ago, and the fort on Mt.

129
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,301
{\an1}Katsuragi is now occupied
by his granddaughter

130
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:51,871
{\an1}Hotaru, and a servant.

131
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,707
{\an1}Whoever is attacking the
fort is undoubtedly after En

132
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:58,245
{\an1}no Gyoja's forbidden jutsu,
and we must prevent them

133
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:01,682
{\an1}from getting their hands
on that jutsu at all costs.

134
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:04,752
{\an1}-But why did you send Naruto?

135
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,587
{\an1}TSUNADE: It's a counter
measure against the Akatsuki.

136
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:09,924
To keep him safe
amongst friends.

137
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:10,326
-Gen!

138
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,060
-Ko!

139
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,226
-Zet!

140
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:11,226
-Ka!

141
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,116
{\an1}CHUSHIN: Did this
feeble old man really

142
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:34,152
{\an1}intend to protect the
whole fort by itself?

143
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:35,620
-Who cares?

144
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,989
It still took
longer than planned,

145
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:37,622
{\an1}so hurry up and start searching.

146
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:45,765
{\an1}-So that's it, huh?

147
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,168
{\an1}The fort of the Tsuchigumo clan?

148
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,171
Hm?

149
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,272
Captain Yamato?

150
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:51,605
-Hm?

151
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,850
{\an1}- So, have you figured out
what happened here yet?

152
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,318
{\an1}-Doesn't look like a fight.

153
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:02,952
Sai.

154
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:05,222
Report.

155
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,555
{\an1}- I found fresh footprints
heading directly

156
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,658
toward the fort.

157
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:11,295
{\an1}The enemy is a group of four.

158
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,931
{\an1}- These kunai are from
traps around the fort.

159
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,768
{\an1}The enemy tripped them,
but seemed to escape injury.

160
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,903
{\an1}- Then there must be
other traps in the area.

161
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,671
{\an1}- We'll simply follow
the trail of the ones

162
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,074
{\an1}that the enemy has
already triggered.

163
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,742
-Good idea.

164
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,077
{\an1}Because that way,
we'll get to the fort

165
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:28,648
{\an1}without setting off
any of the other traps.

166
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,616
{\an1}- Where's the forbidden
jutsu of En no Gyoja?

167
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,261
{\an1}-Look, you've lost this fight.

168
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,229
{\an1}You might as well tell us.

169
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,533
-I know nothing.

170
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,834
{\an1}-Playing dumb is pointless!

171
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,336
{\an1}-The granddaughter.

172
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,038
-Hm?

173
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,039
-Yes.

174
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,674
{\an1}En no Gyoja has a granddaughter.

175
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:55,379
Perhaps she can
tell us where it is.

176
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,714
{\an1}-Did you help her to escape?

177
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,085
{\an1}-You think she has the jutsu?

178
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,119
Is that it?

179
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,453
Hey!

180
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:01,986
-Stop.

181
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,556
Enough.

182
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,791
{\an1}I know where we can find her.

183
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,328
{\an1}We've run out of time here.

184
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,629
{\an1}Seems like somebody
else is trying

185
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,097
{\an1}to interfere with our mission.

186
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,976
{\an1}- Looks like we've
reached a dead end here.

187
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:24,879
{\an1}-We'll just lay a bridge across.

188
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,346
{\an1}Wood Style Jutsu.

189
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,956
- Not too shabby
there, Captain Yamato.

190
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:37,527
{\an1}- You mean you're
glad I came along?

191
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:39,262
{\an1}-Don't push your luck.

192
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:39,629
Let's just go.

193
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,674
{\an1}Hang in there, man.

194
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,944
We've got you.

195
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,547
- He's weak,
but he still has a pulse.

196
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:55,747
He'll be OK.

197
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,851
{\an1}-We're a step behind them.

198
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,120
{\an1}Sai, go on and check the
area, and see

199
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,189
{\an1}if there's anyone else around.

200
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:02,322
-Right.

201
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,763
-Good.

202
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,467
{\an1}He's finally coming around.

203
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,835
{\an1}-Don't be afraid.

204
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,003
{\an1}We're from the Hidden
Leaf, and we're

205
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,907
{\an1}dispatched here to
provide assistance.

206
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:19,375
{\an1}And I presume that you're
Lady Hotaru's servant.

207
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:19,408
Is that correct?

208
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,881
-That's right.

209
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:25,682
I'm Tonbee.

210
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:49,008
{\an1}Lady Hotaru is on her way to a
small village in the mountains

211
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,213
{\an1}that the Tsuchigumo
clan uses as a hideaway.

212
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,481
{\an1}- I found a collapsed
opening in the hillside

213
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,319
{\an1}behind the mansion that
looks like an escape route.

214
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,987
-Yes, that's it.

215
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,789
{\an1}That's how she got away.

216
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,857
-OK.

217
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,527
{\an1}We'll follow to make
sure that she's safe.

218
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,662
{\an1}Sakura, I want you to
remain here with him

219
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:07,863
{\an1}and continue to tend
to his injuries.

220
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,932
-Yes, sir.

221
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,401
- Naruto, Sai,
it's time for us to move out.

222
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,508
-Utakata?

223
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:47,876
{\an1}There's something I
wanted to ask you.

224
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,717
{\an1}When we reach the
hideaway, will you still

225
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:55,318
{\an1}continue to teach
me jutsu there?

226
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,457
-Continue?

227
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,459
I don't recall
teaching you anything.

228
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,629
-Don't recall?

229
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,432
{\an1}What about all the lessons
you gave me back at the fort?

230
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:11,504
{\an1}- Whatever you learned,
you learned on your own.

231
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,207
{\an1}Besides, after we reach the
village, you won't need me.

232
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,442
{\an1}- But there's nobody
that's stronger than you

233
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,143
in the village.

234
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:18,244
Nobody!

235
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:20,147
{\an1}And I want you to teach me.

236
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:22,115
{\an1}There's no one else that
I'd rather learn from.

237
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,785
You saved me the
first time we met.

238
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:24,151
{\an1}Don't say you've forgotten.

239
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:35,297
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER):
Stubborn fools.

240
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,613
{\an1}[panicked shouts]

241
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,858
{\an1}HOTARU (VOICEOVER):
What was that jutsu?

242
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,293
It was amazing.

243
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,136
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): Now that
they've discovered my location,

244
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,605
{\an1}I'll have to stay out of
sight until things quiet down.

245
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,476
{\an1}-Are you all right?

246
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,912
You're hurt.

247
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,548
Please,
come back to our fort with me

248
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:22,551
{\an1}and allow me to tend
to your wound there.

249
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:25,789
{\an1}You came to my aid,
so you must let me help you.

250
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:25,955
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): Fort?

251
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:37,535
-Try to hold on.

252
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,605
{\an1}I'm going to go get some help,
so don't move from this spot.

253
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,672
Just stay here.

254
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:41,607
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

255
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,374
{\an1}I used too much chakra.

256
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,350
{\an1}HOTARU: Ever since that
moment, I've

257
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,151
{\an1}wanted to be just like you.

258
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,025
{\an1}- But I didn't actually
save you that time.

259
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,361
-You did!

260
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,665
{\an1}- The ninja who attacked were
coming after me, not you.

261
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,803
{\an1}I merely fought them in
order to protect myself.

262
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:09,204
{\an1}I wasn't trying to save you.

263
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:11,274
- Even so,
after watching you handle them,

264
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,643
{\an1}I knew that I wanted
to be strong like you.

265
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:14,977
{\an1}No, I must be strong.

266
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,713
{\an1}I simply have to be.

267
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,116
{\an1}That's why I wish to
learn your amazing jutsu.

268
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:20,718
{\an1}- And being strong is
all that matters to you?

269
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:24,054
{\an1}-What do you mean?

270
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:24,988
{\an1}- I fear you would
end up regretting

271
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:27,358
{\an1}that I was your teacher.

272
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:28,894
You don't really
want to get mixed up

273
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,763
{\an1}with someone who's a wanted man.

274
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,031
{\an1}-I don't care about your past.

275
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,567
I trust you.

276
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,704
{\an1}No matter what happens, I will
always consider you my master.

277
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:38,672
{\an1}-I'm not your master!

278
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:41,776
{\an1}Don't call me that!

279
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:42,877
Damn.

280
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,077
{\an1}-Get away from that girl!

281
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,229
{\an1}UTAKATA (VOICEOVER):
A shadow clone.

282
00:17:59,229 --> 00:17:59,696
How annoying.

283
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:15,715
-Give it up!

284
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:16,481
{\an1}You're comin' with me!

285
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,617
-No!

286
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:18,784
-Huh?

287
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:19,318
{\an1}HOTARU: He's not your enemy.

288
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:20,786
{\an1}He's protecting me!

289
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:21,120
-Naruto!

290
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:31,633
{\an1}Please forgive Naruto for
jumping to conclusions.

291
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,701
{\an1}Your servant Tonbee
had informed us

292
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:36,204
{\an1}that only you had come this
way, Lady Hotaru.

293
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,039
{\an1}- So Tonbee's still
alive and well?

294
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,675
-Don't worry.

295
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,110
He's fine.

296
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,145
He's under the
care of our medic.

297
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:45,882
-I'm so glad.

298
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:47,183
{\an1}YAMATO: From here on out, you'll
have our protection as well.

299
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:55,092
{\an1}-Listen, I'm really sorry.

300
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,228
{\an1}-You can take over, then.

301
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,630
{\an1}I leave it to you.

302
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,665
-Hm?

303
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:01,400
Uh, sure.

304
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,870
{\an1}I always complete my
missions, so... huh?

305
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,103
{\an1}-She's all yours.

306
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,739
Take care.

307
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,576
HOTARU: Utakata!

308
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:10,744
-Hold on.

309
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:11,077
{\an1}Where are you going?

310
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,984
-Can't you stay?

311
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,184
{\an1}At least for a little longer?

312
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,320
{\an1}Until we reach the village.

313
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,056
{\an1}-Those guys are strong.

314
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,158
{\an1}You can rely on them now.

315
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:25,327
{\an1}-I don't need bodyguards.

316
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,331
{\an1}I need someone to teach
me jutsu of my own.

317
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:29,599
Come with me.

318
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,366
I beg you!

319
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:42,714
{\an1}I'll take my training
more seriously than ever!

320
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,250
{\an1}I'll endure any hardship, and
I'll never, ever cry about it!

321
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,723
{\an1}And I'll never again
call you master.

322
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,928
I promise you.

323
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:59,232
{\an1}And you're not my master!

324
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:03,104
{\an1}-I told you not to call me that.

325
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:05,239
Master.

326
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,507
{\an1}I'm not foolish enough
to be called that.

327
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:30,235
[theme music]

328
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,037
{\an1}- Just why are you
people following me?

329
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,141
{\an1}- 'Cause we're your
bodyguards, that's why.

330
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:03,341
{\an1}HOTARU: I have no need for that.

331
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,443
{\an1}I can protect myself just fine.

332
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:07,312
{\an1}You Hidden Leaf ninja may leave.

333
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:09,249
{\an1}NARUTO: You're talking nonsense!

334
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:11,050
YAMATO: Oh well,
I guess we'd better just

335
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,519
{\an1}do as she says and leave.

336
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,354
NARUTO: What?

337
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:16,556
{\an1}Next time on Naruto
Shippuden, Successor

338
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,525
{\an1}of the Forbidden Jutsu.

339
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,661
{\an1}YAMATO: Now, now, don't worry.
