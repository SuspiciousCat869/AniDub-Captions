1
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,399
Long time no see,
Ino-Shika-Cho brats.

2
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:19,606
If I remember
correctly, you're
Kakuzu...

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,219
We took the Kin.
The Gold Shogi
General is ours. And
we know the moves.

4
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:29,025
Of Kaku the bishop.
You're good, so
we'll attack.

5
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:34,770
The brat who uses
shadows. Your being
here means only one
thing, you must

6
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:36,840
have taken down Hidan.

7
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:41,584
Did he get his head
chopped off again
while he was praying?

8
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:47,228
Or since he's not
here, does that mean
he's still alive out
there somewhere?

9
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,635
Who even cares if
he's dead or alive?!

10
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:55,410
So I'm on defense with
no rook, and my gold and
silver generals taken?

11
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,324
And this one makes
it five...

12
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,299
Wait, that's right.

13
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,740
If he's got five
hearts now, we gotta
stop him five times!

14
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,011
Yeah, you're right
about that...

15
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:16,085
I think it's time
to start the game
in Kaku Mode.

16
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:20,828
(painful grunts)

17
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,648
Hmph! By the way...

18
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:36,225
We've got our own
gold and silver pieces
taken from your side,
too. Don't you want to

19
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,163
know who they are?

20
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,408
Lady Tsunade's love,
Dan Kato...

21
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:46,714
And also...

22
00:01:54,261 --> 00:02:00,440
Your former teacher,
son of the Third Hokage,
Asuma Sarutobi!

23
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:00,842
(gasps)

24
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,746
Asuma Sensei!

25
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:08,156
So I guess you aren't
the only ones who've
managed to take your
opponent's game pieces.

26
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,262
And there are still
others yet remaining.

27
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,601
It's ironic, huh?

28
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:16,774
Why you- !

29
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:19,813
<i>Choza!</i>

30
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:22,318
Is the Four Flames
Formation ready?!

31
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,057
You must hurry and shut
me inside the barrier!

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,896
Before I use Ghost
Transformation Jutsu!

33
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,637
I know, but it's not
that simple, not with
you as our opponent!

34
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,611
Huh?

35
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,684
<i>Some weird black</i>
<i>things are showing up!</i>

36
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,220
<i>Be careful!</i>

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,358
(chuckle)

38
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,930
Now let's begin
our counterattack!

39
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:55,417
We still owe you one.
I hope you haven't
forgotten, you
stringy mess!

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,325
Sorry, but I don't
remember anyone who
can't make me money.

41
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:03,333
They say that money
talks, even in hell.
So tell me, is that

42
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,705
saying true for
you, o dead one?

43
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:09,980
Masters!

44
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:11,517
Izumo, Kotetsu!

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,558
Shikamaru! Choji! Ino!
Help us seal him away!

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,662
Hmph! All right!

47
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:18,496
Yeah!

48
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,533
Huh?

49
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:24,141
Izumo, Kotetsu, you
two and Darui will
take care of Kakuzu.

50
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:29,318
Kakuzu uses Earth Style.
Darui uses Lightning
Style. He's your anchor.

51
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,692
Shikamaru and the
others will fight
Asuma.

52
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:37,334
No way! It's far too
harsh to ask them
to do that! I mean,
Master Asuma was their

53
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,806
teacher! That's
just too cruel!

54
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,146
They were Asuma's
subordinates, the
former team Ten.

55
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:46,219
So they know more
about Asuma than
anyone else.

56
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,824
They have the best
chance of winning.

57
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:50,427
Yeah, but...

58
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,505
I won't stand for any
complaining! This is
war! And it's one that
we have to win!

59
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,842
But I...

60
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:00,748
I don't...

61
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:09,706
(fighting grunts)

62
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:10,841
Watch out!

63
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,753
Jump in, Choji! Or
it's like I'm only
fighting Shikamaru!

64
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,659
Yeah, but if I do
that, I'm just
going to hurt you,
Ino.

65
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:24,001
I'm stronger than
you guys think. Sorry,
but I don't want to
end up hurting either

66
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:24,836
one of you.

67
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,307
You really think
you can fight
better than us?

68
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:31,148
Then go ahead, just
try to hurt us!
Bring it on!

69
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,090
Come on, tough
guy! If you think
you're so strong,
then prove it to me!

70
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,025
(sigh)

71
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,463
Damn it...
This is such
a drag.

72
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:43,239
<i>Choji! Are you</i>
<i>being gentle simply</i>
<i>because these two</i>
<i>are your friends?</i>

73
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:44,843
Asuma Sensei,
he just-

74
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,649
If that is the case,
then you're completely
in the wrong here.

75
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:51,055
Sparring with a
tough partner will
only help to make
them stronger.

76
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:54,529
So you'd actually be
doing them a favor
by fighting hard.

77
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:55,965
Huh?

78
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:02,512
Don't you understand
that? All right, then
I'll show you. Come on.

79
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:06,653
You and I are going
to spar right now.
And if you're able to
strike me even once,

80
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:11,663
then all of you will
pass. What's more,
you have a whole hour
to land that blow.

81
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,201
But if you can't hit
me, Choji...

82
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:18,644
<i>Then not only will</i>
<i>you be sent back to the</i>
<i>Academy, but Ino and</i>
<i>Shikamaru will, too!</i>

83
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:19,345
(gasp)

84
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,883
Seriously?!
That's not fair!

85
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:26,526
Think of me as your
enemy and attack
for your sake as
well as theirs.

86
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,866
<i>Transform your</i>
<i>kindness into</i>
<i>strength.</i>

87
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,674
<i>Choji!</i>

88
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,811
Hey! Are you
all right?!

89
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,649
Uh...
Yeah.

90
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:42,759
What's the matter
with you three?
Engage Asuma! Now!

91
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,471
<i>It won't help your</i>
<i>friends by running</i>
<i>away. Instead, you</i>
<i>should be trying to</i>

92
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:53,112
<i>make yourself</i>
<i>stronger so that</i>
<i>the next mission</i>
<i>goes perfectly</i>

93
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:54,883
<i>and everyone</i>
<i>gets back safe!</i>

94
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,323
<i>The choice is</i>
<i>simple you're</i>
<i>either a leader</i>
<i>or a coward!</i>

95
00:07:58,356 --> 00:07:59,893
<i>Which are you?</i>

96
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:05,738
I'm counting on
you...Shikamaru.

97
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,879
Fine I'll do it!

98
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:11,950
Shikamaru, how?!

99
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,991
Ino? And what
about you?

100
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:16,827
Choji!

101
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,164
Look around at
your comrades!

102
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,709
(fighting screams)

103
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:49,626
That's right!
Come and get it!

104
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,336
Choza!

105
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,174
Yeah, I know!

106
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:02,885
(fighting screams)

107
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:18,049
Choji, do you
remember what Asuma
Sensei told us?
His last words?

108
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:18,984
Huh?

109
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,796
Choji...

110
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:30,775
<i>You're a thoughtful,</i>
<i>loyal friend, and a</i>
<i>kind soul. In time,</i>
<i>you'll become a</i>

111
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:36,720
<i>stronger shinobi</i>
<i>than anyone else.</i>
<i>So be more confident</i>
<i>in yourself.</i>

112
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,598
(growl)

113
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,327
Ino, you can
be bossy, but
you're also
compassionate.

114
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,076
Choji and Shikamaru,
they're both so
awkward and clumsy.
Watch over them.

115
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:13,192
<i>Let's do this,</i>
<i>you guys.</i>

116
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,261
Yeah!

117
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,698
<i>Uh-huh!</i>

118
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,208
We're all counting
on the three of you!

119
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:32,899
All right!

120
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:41,348
The kunai were just
a distraction.
This was their plan
all along.

121
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,001
So did it work?

122
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:58,115
No, not yet!

123
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,294
Asuma! Sorry, I
must stop you!

124
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:09,939
Nice plan, considering
how fast you put it
together. Keep on
trapping me like that.

125
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:10,875
<i>Right!</i>

126
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:14,616
Once again! But this
time, our aim is just
to capture, not destroy.

127
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,018
Understood.

128
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,991
Damn it! Where's
that Sealing Team?!
What's keeping them?!

129
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,140
He's strong!

130
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:27,942
Damn it!

131
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,433
Fire Style!
Burning Ash!

132
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,139
What is this?!

133
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,509
A smoke screen!

134
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,182
(screaming)

135
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:08,356
(gasp)

136
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:19,712
It's you three...

137
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:45,531
It took a while to
find that sword,
but it was important.

138
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,102
Now, where's Kakuzu?

139
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,185
I'll try this fan
I picked up earlier...

140
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,863
(swinging grunt)

141
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,971
Hey, I'm pretty
good with this
thing!

142
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,215
You're not
getting away!

143
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:21,936
Yeah! That was
awesome! I got the
lightning one!

144
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,811
This fan is
phenomenal! But
whose is it?

145
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:33,025
Oh, boy. It feels
like it uses an
enormous amount of
chakra...

146
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,265
Well, I can't worry
about that right now!

147
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:46,920
Did you two actually
believe that I'd
just stay put?!

148
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,828
Captain Darui, sir!

149
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:54,368
I got the orders
from HQ! However...

150
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,138
(swinging grunt)

151
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:04,121
Captain, we should
use Lightning Style,
a single blow...

152
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:08,764
I'm sorry, I can't
right now. I went
overboard earlier...

153
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,834
Black Panther!

154
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,139
Laser Circus!

155
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:17,113
Double Black Panthers!

156
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:24,094
So I don't have enough
chakra left. Can you
two just give me a
moment to recover?

157
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,597
Come on. We'll
get him.

158
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,533
Right!

159
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,308
Sorry, guys.
Can't be helped.

160
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:46,071
We're all prepared
for the inevitable.

161
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:51,281
So, Sensei, I sure
hope you're prepared
for it as well.

162
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:58,496
Choji, Shikamaru,
Ino. All of you have
become fine shinobi.

163
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,932
(gasp)

164
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:10,486
Asuma, it's all
thanks to you...

165
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,396
Show me what you've
got, Ino-Shika-Cho!

166
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,212
We'll take him
down in one shot!

167
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,922
A substitution
Jutsu! Run!

168
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,904
Your movements are
slow, Choji! Speed
it up, man!

169
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,207
Here he comes!

170
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,787
Shikamaru! Weave
Shadow Possession
webs and then lead me
over towards Choji!

171
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,456
I was already
on it!

172
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,427
Shadow
Possession
Jutsu!

173
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,231
One more move!

174
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,274
Even if it's a bluff,
since he knows about
the Mind Transfer Jutsu,
he'll ward it off.

175
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:58,583
And if he dodges
the Shadow Possession,
he'll be in Ino's
blind spot.

176
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:00,119
And then..

177
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:03,492
<i>Partial Expansion</i>
<i>Jutsu!</i>

178
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,129
Checkmate, Asuma!

179
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,766
Do it now, Choji!

180
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,668
Good!

181
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,943
What are you
doing, Choji!

182
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:15,283
Snap out of it!
We all prepared
ourselves for this!

183
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,653
Choji!

184
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,557
I'm sorry...

185
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,401
This is way too much
for me! I can't do it!
I can't take our Sensei
down! I just can't!

186
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,403
Choji!

187
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:25,871
(hit grunt)

188
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:26,773
Move it!

189
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:27,407
That's...!

190
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,075
(gasp)

191
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:31,315
Wind Style! Dust
Storm Jutsu!

192
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,387
Damn! He
dodged it!

193
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,074
Are you all right?

194
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:45,544
Yeah, but just
barely.

195
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:50,554
But, why?! Why does
it all have to
end up like this?

196
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:55,029
It's too late to
complain about it
now! We agreed to
take Asuma Sensei

197
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,498
down, remember?!

198
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:00,439
What's with the long
face, Choji? I'm an
enemy now, accept it!

199
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:04,247
You don't need to
hold back. I'm
already dead!

200
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:08,489
Yeah, I know...
I know that, but
still...

201
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,297
Even way back then,
Sensei, you...

202
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:23,219
What is it, Choji?
Do you want the three
of you to be sent
back to the Academy?!

203
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,699
I wonder if he
can do this...

204
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,815
C'mon, fight me!
Stop acting like
such a coward!

205
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,925
(painful grunts)

206
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,964
That's not the way.
It'll just backfire.

207
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,035
Huh?

208
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,874
This whole thing isn't
about Choji being scared
of fighting. It's more
that the last thing he

209
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:55,249
wants is to hurt
Asuma Sensei the way
he's hurting right now.

210
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,690
He's kind, right
down to his very
core.

211
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,527
But as things
stand now...

212
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,635
Yeah, it seems we
have no choice...

213
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,743
Hey, Choji!
Enough Already!
Fight, fatso!

214
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:09,545
Mmm...

215
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,718
Shikamaru...

216
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,289
Did you just
call me fatso?!

217
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:16,693
Uhh...

218
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:20,867
Yeah, that's right.
I did call you fatso!
Because Asuma
Sensei does!

219
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,236
Hm?

220
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:26,478
Is that true?
Sensei?

221
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,315
Uh... that's right.

222
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:33,225
Sure is! And he also
said a fatso like you
would never be able to
land a punch against

223
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:34,361
him in a million
years!

224
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:35,964
You're going
overboard
there, Ino.

225
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,367
(angry growl)

226
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,443
Even if you're my
Sensei... Anyone
who calls me that...

227
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,080
is gonna get it!

228
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,552
(fighting growl)

229
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,403
I'm sorry, Sensei...

230
00:18:55,436 --> 00:19:01,415
But I can't do it.
I can't bring
myself to hit you!

231
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:08,362
<i>Please, Sensei!</i>
<i>Only send me back to</i>
<i>the Academy, okay?</i>

232
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:11,869
<i>Please don't punish</i>
<i>Shikamaru and Ino!</i>

233
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:19,417
(crying)

234
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:24,294
I understand, Choji.
We'll chalk this
up as my loss.

235
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:28,302
No matter how angry
you may become, you're
still able to suppress
that feeling and put

236
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:33,145
yourself into your
opponent's shoes. You
have true kindness
within you, Choji.

237
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:38,188
I want you to keep
nurturing that
kindness. Because
someday it'll become

238
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,761
your greatest
strength.

239
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:44,000
But you know when
you're sparring with
someone, uh...

240
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,871
Yeah, I know,
Sensei!

241
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:49,344
I don't want to beat
people up like you
or Shikamaru or Ino,
you know, my friend's

242
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:51,014
from the village.

243
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,753
But if I'm ever up
against anybody who
wants to hurt my
friends, then I'm

244
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:56,191
gonna fight them
with everything
I've got!

245
00:19:56,224 --> 00:20:01,435
Even if those friends
like Shikamaru and
Ino, who really know
better than to push

246
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,508
me. Keep calling
me unpleasant names
like "fatso."

247
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:06,478
(angry growl)

248
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:13,660
You know, Shikamaru
and Ino, he does have
a point. Choji's not
really fat, he's just

249
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:16,431
...Pleasantly plump.

250
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:18,737
(giggle)

251
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:30,827
Asuma Sensei said
that it's okay
if this is the
way I am!

252
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,469
That's enough,
Choji. Listen up!

253
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:38,643
I know you're a
truly kind person.

254
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:42,216
But right now,
taking me down is
the kindest thing
you can do.

255
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,324
This is the time
for you to transform
your kindness into
strength!

256
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,797
Now is the
time, Choji!

257
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,502
Please!
Stop me!

258
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:59,852
Snap out of it,
fatso! Take me
down!

259
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:00,587
(gasp)

260
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:05,362
Did you just
call me "fatso?"

261
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:09,572
Well, did you?!
Is that what you
just said to me?!

262
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:16,686
<i>You're wrong!</i>
<i>I'm not fat!</i>

263
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:24,735
I'm just
pleasantly
plump!

264
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:02,931
I thought it was
just an oath, part
of a ritual.

265
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,872
I thought I'd just
change naturally
when I got older. I
thought that both my

266
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:09,878
my heart and
my body would
get stronger.

267
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:11,949
But now, I...

268
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,422
It's time
to change!

269
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,432
Next time on Naruto

Ino-Shika-Cho Formation!
