1
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,252
<i>Nine Tails'</i>
<i>chakra mode.</i>

2
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:30,962
It's great for lighting
up the night, but it
could cause Naruto lots
of strife, even cost

3
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,099
him his life. It's
like a double-
edged knife.

4
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:39,345
Naruto may have
learned to use the
Nine Tails' Chakra
Mode, but he hasn't

5
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:42,384
made the Nine Tails'
his friend yet.

6
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,025
The Nine Tails'
continues to sap
Naruto's chakra.

7
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,664
And if it reaches
zero, he'll die.

8
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:53,641
Oh, yeah. His tension
is high, but stopping
his passion would be
a real shame. That

9
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,077
would make me cry.

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,521
I guess it's okay
to use the Nine
Tails' chakra like
a flashlight...

11
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:04,529
But stick close to
Naruto! Don't let him
out of your sight!

12
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,632
Yeah!

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,490
<i>Naruto...</i>

14
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:29,613
You waste my chakra
on something so
trivial?!

15
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:35,490
I've been inside you,
watching you, for a
very long time now.

16
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,531
Naruto...

17
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:43,473
After all you've been
through, you're still
so naive...

18
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:47,716
I can stop this. I
know that I can.
You have to let me.

19
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:52,424
I'll take it all
on myself. All the
hatred and all the
pain.

20
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,565
Because that's
my role.

21
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:01,376
You know, it looks
like you've put on
some weight. Let me
guess, you're using

22
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,750
my chakra again,
aren't you? And
what's got you
talking to me all

23
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:10,561
of a sudden, anyway?
Usually you never
say anything to me at
all unless I make you!

24
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,070
What, are you lonely
or something and you
want somebody to keep

25
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:17,408
you company for a
little while?

26
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:21,416
'Cause I'm kinda
busy now! Let's
do this later!

27
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,794
Do you seriously
believe that you
can end this war
all by yourself?

28
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:32,037
It's simply
not possible.

29
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:37,348
I'm sure you've
sensed by now just
how massive the
enemy force is.

30
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:44,195
This is Madara we're
talking about, after
all. There's no telling
what he'll do...

31
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:49,906
Of course, if you
want to borrow more
of my power...

32
00:02:55,785 --> 00:03:00,027
Hmph! I'm not gonna
fall for that trick
anymore!

33
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,231
(chuckling)

34
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:06,372
I see you've gotten
a bit smarter since
last time...

35
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,878
I am when it's
that obvious!

36
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,917
We'll talk after
the war. Later.

37
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:19,800
If your comrades
are killed, hatred
will arise from
their deaths.

38
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:25,377
Are you planning to
defeat all of the
enemy before that
happens?

39
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,456
Then again, if you take
down the enemy, they'll
bear you hatred.

40
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,230
You really think you
can take that on all
by yourself?

41
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:39,639
If you do, then you're
completely deluded.

42
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,651
Stop treating me
like I'm stupid.

43
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,409
Stop treating me
like I'm stupid.

44
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:43,253
You don't understand
a thing! You're so
naive!

45
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:49,599
Do you honestly believe
that you can take on and
erase everyone's hatred?

46
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:02,525
The war has
already started.

47
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,134
I bet there are a lot
of casualties by now.

48
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:21,395
And the resulting
hatred to match
as well.

49
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:29,679
You've seen it firsthand.
Your former teammate
Sasuke has been gripped
by hatred for a long time.

50
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:34,723
Have you ever really
been able to do anything
for him at all?

51
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:44,809
Ever since that day.
That's right. You've
known it ever since
that day.

52
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,887
I wonder who I'm going
to be fighting...Hm?
Which one of these guys
is it gonna be?

53
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,532
The one with the dog
for a hat? Or the kid
with the hood and the
shades?

54
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,869
Or...

55
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,512
So, um, Sensei?

56
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,683
What is it?

57
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,656
Uh, the thing is. I
really don't want to
have to fight against
my friends, you know?

58
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,429
Well...Look, Choji,
this isn't like a
fight.

59
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:33,473
This is traditional
Shinobi hand-to-hand
combat! Even our Hokage
and those before him

60
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:37,715
participated in such
drills and became
stronger through
sparring.

61
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:43,927
Yeah, uhh, look, Sensei
just go ahead and
put down that I went
out of bounds, okay?

62
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,432
And then you can move
on to the next pair.

63
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,102
Hey. Wait!

64
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,541
You might be calling
this training or
whatever, but if
there's gonna be a

65
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:54,281
winner, then it's
actually a match.
And since that's the
case, wouldn't it

66
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:57,822
save you some trouble
to decides who wins
from the start?

67
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:00,160
(sigh)

68
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:04,869
Boy, he really has no
motivation. He is
never gonna make
chunin like that!

69
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:07,542
<i>That's not</i>
<i>necessarily true.</i>

70
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,579
Huh?

71
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:12,217
It's because, people
can change over the
course of a lifetime.
A lot can happ-

72
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,355
You are so hung up
on minor details!

73
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:18,831
Come on, Shikamaru!
You are the laziest
kid that I've ever met!

74
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,603
And Choji, you're
just a coward!

75
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:24,642
Hey, Ino, do you
know those two
boys or something?

76
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,247
Yeah, our parents
are friends.

77
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,457
Forget it...
Shikamaru, Choji,
give the Unison Sign.

78
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,161
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.

79
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:41,108
Hm...

80
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,146
Mm...

81
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,289
I'm really sorry,
Shikamaru.

82
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:52,431
Nah, it's okay. I
know that you stink
at stuff like this.

83
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,334
And it's a drag
for me, too.

84
00:08:54,368 --> 00:09:01,449
Mm-hm! Good, Unison
Sign complete! Next
up is, Naruto Uzumaki.

85
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,286
You better
believe it!

86
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,723
Wait, is he
the one...?

87
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,960
My parents said that
I wasn't supposed
to talk to him...

88
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:10,568
Out of everyone here
I wanna be paired with
him the least!

89
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:14,308
And Sasuke Uchiha!
Step forward, you
two!

90
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,978
Sasuke! Get him!

91
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,180
Go, Sasuke!

92
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:20,654
<i>I wish I could do</i>
<i>the Unison Sign</i>
<i>with Sasuke!</i>

93
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,792
You've got this,
Sasuke!

94
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:25,296
You're totally
gonna win I'm
sure of it!

95
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,444
Mmm! What's with
him acting all cool!
Dammit! Why does he
get all the attention!

96
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:36,887
<i>I'm gonna take Mr.</i>
<i>Popular down and</i>
<i>become the new hero!</i>

97
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,561
Let's go! I'm
gonna win this
for sure!

98
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:43,099
Um, best of
luck, Naru-

99
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,301
Take him down,
Sasuke!

100
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,575
All right, it's
Naruto Uzumaki
versus Sasuke
Uchiha-

101
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,344
Come on! Let's
just do this
idiot!

102
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:53,453
Hey, stop that,
Naruto! You need
to make the proper
Spar Sign before you

103
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,558
two begin! It's
simple etiquette.

104
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:59,198
I don't care about
any of that stuff I
just want to hurry
up and defeat this

105
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:03,507
jerk already! It's
time for a new Mr.
Popular around here,
you know?!

106
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,813
Whatever, loser.
But I'll make it
quick, if that's
what you want.

107
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:11,556
Enough, both of
you! Good grief!
Shinobi Hand-to-
Hand combat is a

108
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,863
traditional drill
passed down from
generation to
generation.

109
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:17,167
You might think
it's stuffy to
be so formal,

110
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,877
but here at the Academy
we have respect for
tradition. This stuff
matters!

111
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,285
First you always face
and make this one-
handed sign toward your
opponent before starting.

112
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,826
It represents half of
the two hands used to
activate a jutsu and

113
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,297
indicates your
intention to fight.

114
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,069
Now, we call this
the Spar Sign.

115
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:41,115
When you finish sparring
and the bout is concluded,
you each extend forth
the Unison Sign and lock

116
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:45,490
your fingers around
each other's. This
indicates that you
recognize each other

117
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:50,968
as comrades. That's
the etiquette of
shinobi hand-to-hand
combat.

118
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,109
Are you listening,
Naruto? I've explained
it twice now!

119
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,345
Yeah, yeah...

120
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:59,151
Come on! One yes
is fine, you fool!

121
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,121
I get it,
okay?!

122
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,067
Naru-

123
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,904
Pound that kid into
the ground, Sasuke!

124
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:14,816
Begin!

125
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,871
Whoa! He's
so cool!

126
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:28,042
Oh, Sasuke,
you rock!

127
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,046
Whoa... So fast!

128
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,029
<i>Sasuke...</i>

129
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,903
<i>That look in</i>
<i>his eyes...</i>

130
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:45,276
<i>It's the same look</i>
<i>that everyone</i>
<i>gives me.</i>

131
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,846
<i>No...</i>

132
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,086
<i>No, it's stronger</i>
<i>than that.</i>

133
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:52,057
<i>Wait...</i>

134
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,063
<i>...it's not</i>
<i>for me.</i>

135
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:06,318
Sasuke wins. Now,
make the Unison
Sign. So we can
move on.

136
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,655
Hey, come back!

137
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,424
Huh?

138
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,063
You weren't even
looking at me! That
didn't count! You're
a turd! No, you're

139
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,869
crap! Hard and runny!
You're stupid! Stupid!

140
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:19,979
Uh, that's not really
an insult. This guy's
so dense, he can't
even swear properly.

141
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:25,423
I wish he'd make up
his mind. You can't
have be constipated
and have the runs, th-

142
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:27,862
Again, hung up
on minor details!

143
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,266
Hmph!

144
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,205
Got something to say
to me, you hard and
runny crap-turd?!

145
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,744
Ow!

146
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,484
I told you, Hand-
to-Hand Combat is a
sacred tradition! Now
make the Unison Sign!

147
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,123
And you, too!
Do it, Sasuke!

148
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,735
Come on, you two...

149
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,414
You wanna go another
round, you loser?!

150
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,753
Hey! Enough! Quit
it, both of you!

151
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,557
Naruto's just
the worst!

152
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,126
Yeah, what's
up with him?

153
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,648
It appears you
do remember...

154
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:35,029
So, what happened to
Sasuke after that?
Where is he now?
Where you able to

155
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:40,941
erase his hatred? No,
in fact, quite the
opposite, right?

156
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,818
Just snap out of it
already, will ya?!

157
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:51,930
What the heck do you
know about it. It's not
like you ever had a family
in the first place!

158
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:57,240
You were on your own
right from the beginning!
You don't know anything
about it!

159
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,037
Naruto...

160
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,178
No matter what you
may say to me now,
I'm not changing.

161
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:23,459
I'm still going to
kill each and every
person in the Hidden
Leaf, including you!

162
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:28,737
But, is that really
the only way, Sasuke?

163
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,273
Yes.

164
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:37,253
Your only choices are
to kill me and become
the hero who saved
the entire village...

165
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:42,197
...or get killed by
me and be known as
a loser!

166
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:50,981
<i>His hatred has grown</i>
<i>ever stronger! You</i>
<i>weren't even able to</i>
<i>protect someone you</i>

167
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,854
<i>consider to be your</i>
<i>closest friend!</i>

168
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:59,464
No matter who you're
dealing with, no one
can erase or fight
that much hatred.

169
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,905
And you certainly
can't take it all
on yourself.

170
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,515
Okay...

171
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,188
You finished?

172
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,629
What did you say?!

173
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,607
I get it. Are you
just trying to scare
me into doing nothing?

174
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:26,285
That's exactly what
you want, Nine Tails.

175
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:28,088
Isn't it?

176
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,367
Hey...

177
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,757
You're the one who
doesn't get it.

178
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:52,403
Who are you to be so
confident, when you
couldn't even save
Sasuke?

179
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:54,575
(painful growl)

180
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:59,117
Once you question
your beliefs, then
it's all over. I
don't know how yet,

181
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:03,527
but I will find a
way to save Sasuke
and stop this war!

182
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,100
(worried growl)

183
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:19,525
A Ritual Altar? He's
planning to seal me
up again! Not inside
that baby?!

184
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:33,987
All right look, you
stupid fox! You're
in my body, and you
owe me rent! So for

185
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,293
payment, I'll take
your chakra! You
got that?

186
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:45,343
All right...

187
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,615
You're done!
Sage Art!

188
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,288
Massive Rasengan
Barrage!

189
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,182
Once more!

190
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:08,455
<i>What kind of</i>
<i>power is this?!</i>

191
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:32,938
No way! This is
really the Nine
Tails...

192
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:37,380
Naruto...
How dare you!

193
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:44,528
You have infuriated
me! Naruto!

194
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:49,070
You still have
this much power?!

195
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:52,811
Wow. You really
are amazing.

196
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:57,821
(angry growl)

197
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:03,733
Isn't this the
Six Paths?!

198
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:18,462
You'd better watch
out, Naruto...

199
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,278
Hah!

200
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:33,158
<i>So the little brat</i>
<i>thinks it's all</i>
<i>grown up, does it?</i>

201
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:41,475
Hey! You know
what, Nine Tails?

202
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,884
Hnh! I believe I'm
gonna come after all
of that hate that's

203
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,322
inside of you,
too, someday!

204
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:52,497
You've made me
miserable my
whole life.

205
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:58,042
But I know just how
bad it feels to be at
the mercy of your hatred
and to feel ruined by it.

206
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:06,425
Arrgh! Are you
stupid?! I am the
Nine Tails! I can't
and won't be changed

207
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,765
by some mere brat!
I am hatred!

208
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,040
That's fine by me.
'Cause I'm not a
little brat anymore.
And it's more

209
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,577
challenging
this way.

210
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:17,347
Later!

211
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,903
Nine Tails...

212
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:35,182
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am naive.
It's funny. You've
always been with me,

213
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:42,263
inside me. Like how
mom and dad stayed
with me. You know
everything about how

214
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:48,142
I feel, and everything
that I went through
growing up. Of course
I'm pretty sure you

215
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:54,955
didn't like doing it,
but still, you continued
to watch over me this
whole time.

216
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,895
That's why...

217
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:03,807
I want you to stay
there a little longer
and watch over me.

218
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,548
Sasuke, you too.

219
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:12,156
You might never have
cared about me at all
from the very start.

220
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,096
I've always been
watching you...

221
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,433
...Always.

222
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:24,314
That's right! I'm
gonna help Sasuke
and stop this war!

223
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,784
Yo!

224
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:30,961
Naruto, you're shining
bright, but you're
looking awfully grave
in this full-moonlight.

225
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,232
So try to lighten
up, all right?

226
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,769
Yeah!

227
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:47,260
<i>Hm? What's this? Did</i>
<i>you have a fight with</i>
<i>the Nine Tails again,</i>
<i>my good friend?</i>

228
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:51,969
Tailed Beast Mode's
a tug of war, 'tween
Nine Tails chakra and
yours. When your chakra

229
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,540
runs out, it's
curtains, no doubt!

230
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:56,344
<i>So don't be too</i>
<i>reckless, yo!</i>

231
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,591
I know that I'm
taking a chance.
But I have no
choice.

232
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:08,402
I don't go back on
my word, ever. Because
that's my nindo, my
ninja way.

233
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,939
Hm?

234
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,580
Now hurry up!
Let's go!

235
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,521
Hey, wait for
me, yo!

236
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:03,766
<i>There you go. I've</i>
<i>taken care of your</i>
<i>external wounds.</i>
<i>Please get some rest.</i>

237
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,108
You doing all right?
It appears that they're
targeting out Medic
Ninja.

238
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,878
<i>Yes, Neji.</i>

239
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:13,620
It's easy to get
discouraged. We don't
even know who it is
that we're supposed

240
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:16,324
to be fighting
right now.

241
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:20,600
<i>Next Time On Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Medic Ninja</i>
<i>In Danger.</i>

242
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:24,708
<i>I know. We have</i>
<i>to be careful.</i>
