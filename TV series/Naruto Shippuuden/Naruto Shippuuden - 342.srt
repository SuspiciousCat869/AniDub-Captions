1
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,149
Look, I had...

2
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:54,154
{\an1}I had my Father. I had my
Mother. And I had Pervy
Sage.

3
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,028
{\an1}Kids love looking up to
their heroes!

4
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,834
{\an1}That's why I can run forward
without hesitation!

5
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:18,607
{\an1}And I will become the
greatest Hokage of them all!

6
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,279
{\an1}That's my dream! I
won't give up on it!

7
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:30,217
[defiant roar]

8
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,858
{\an1}I guess that crack in your
mask will have to come
first.

9
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,962
{\an1}You will not touch the
statue!

10
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:51,736
[angry roaring]

11
00:01:57,307 --> 00:02:05,012
[roaring]

12
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,691
{\an1}Naruto! You know his
abilities, right?

13
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,294
{\an4}Your window is the
instant he tries to pull
you in, that's when he'll
become solid. If you

14
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,364
{\an1}attack him normally, you'll
just pass right through him.

15
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,999
{\an1}That means go for a
counterattack.

16
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:31,436
{\an1}Diversionary tactics! Create
an opening through close
combat!

17
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,604
{\an1}Avoid using big moves!

18
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:37,139
{\an1}Thanks, but I already know
that! That's why I created a
clone!

19
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,910
{\an1}Master Bee! Please,
raise me up high!

20
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:43,813
I got this!

21
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,949
I'd better avoid
direct attacks...

22
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:49,384
Up you go, yo!

23
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,023

26
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,604
This one?

27
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,908
{\an1}I guess not. Then
it must be...

28
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,562
{\an7}<i>[chuckle] Nice timing!</i>

29
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,743
I'll deal...

30
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,647
{\an1}...with you first!

31
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:32,136
{\an7}Nice moves, Bushier
Brow Sensei!

32
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:36,673
{\an1}Okay! I think I've put
enough chakra into this now!

33
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:38,408
Sorry, but...

34
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,776
I'm going...

35
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,112
{\an1}...after the Gedo Statue!

36
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:44,547
{\an8}Hm?

37
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,381
Kamui!

38
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:52,087
{\an1}If I gouge out its head, it
shouldn't be able to
survive, Statue or not!

39
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,962
So naïve.

40
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,633
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

41
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,701
{\an7}<i>What just happened?!</i>

{\an8}<i>Don't tell me...</i>

43
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:23,947
He vanished?

44
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,624
Naruto!

45
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,727
{\an1}Damn it! These boulders
are in the way!

46
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,695
Master Bee!

47
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,629
Got it!

48
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:50,870
Huh?

49
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,408
Go fly!

50
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:01,645
{\an7}<i>He cut the rock with his</i>
<i>Lightning Blade! Nice,</i>
<i>Kakashi!</i>

51
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,748
{\an1}I'm not going to be in time!

52
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,427
{\an1}Naruto! Just keep going!

53
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,661
{\an1}I'll take care of the kunai!

54
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:28,968
Kamui!

55
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:34,605
Damn it!

56
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:42,446
{\an1}He's really strong! I can't
get my attacks to land!

57
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:44,581
You all right?!

58
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:45,648
Yeah...

59
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:49,051
{\an1}But... if even that attack
isn't good enough...

60
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,786
What can we do?!

61
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,764
[gasps]

62
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:15,974
{\an1}Man, what is happening
all of a sudden?

63
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,578
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi, you see that?

64
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,344
Yeah.

65
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,947
Huh?

66
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,248
{\an1}There's a crack in his mask...

67
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,349
What?!

68
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,718
{\an1}Seriously, where?!

69
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,922
{\an1}You're right! It's
true! On the left side!

70
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:37,825
{\an1}It looks like your earlier
attack hit right before it
passed through him!

71
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,595
{\an1}Nice work, Naruto! Let's
keep going, then!

72
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,999
{\an1}Yeah, all right! Now I feel
like we might be able to get
somewhere against him!

73
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:51,336
{\an1}No... to be honest, it
didn't look to me like
Naruto's attack landed.

74
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,405
{\an1}You're doing it again! You
always say things like that!

75
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,674
{\an1}So... was it something else?

76
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,543
What's going on?

77
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:03,914
{\an1}From the looks of that
crack, it doesn't seem to
be from Naruto's punch.

78
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:08,684
{\an1}That mask was scored,
carved, by something a lot
sharper...

79
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:10,385
Wait a minute!

80
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,491
{\an1}You're wide open! Gotcha!

81
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:18,927
Do not mock me!

82
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,061
{\an1}Uchiha Flame Formation!

83
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,331
Hot! Hot! Hot!

84
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,568
Whoa!

85
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,604
{\an1}Are you all right?! Are ya,
Octopops and Eight-O?!

86
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,807
{\an1}Agh! Do I look it?!

87
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,112
{\an4}Now that he's erected a
barrier, we have no choice
but to tackle the masked guy
first.

88
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,613
{\an1}That's been my plan right
from the beginning!

89
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:44,881
Damn it!

90
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:51,854
I thought so...
No... It can't be...

91
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,556
Except...

92
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,525
{\an1}I'd never heard... that the
Kamui could be stopped!

93
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,401
{\an1}But... if that chip
in his mask...

94
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,938
{\an1}...was caused by the
kunai I used my Kamui on...

95
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,008
{\an1}That means his ninjutsu is...

96
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,479
{\an1}It's no use just thinking
about it...

97
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:28,185
{\an1}It's not an implausible
theory, but it's not
impossible, either...

98
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,954
{\an1}Guy, Naruto, Master Bee...

99
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,121
Huh?

100
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,925
{\an1}There's something I want to
test. Please, lend me a
hand.

101
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:55,741
Let's do it!

102
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:56,641
Right!

103
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:01,545
Yo!

104
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,586
[attacking yell]

105
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:16,558
{\an1}Impressive destructive
power.

106
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:19,327
How's that?!

107
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:21,762
{\an1}No chance to pull
me in, huh?!

108
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,004
{\an1}You underestimate the
Sharingan. I can read your
movements.

109
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,106
I'll keep these.

110
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,276
{\an1}He becomes solid when
he absorbs things!

111
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:37,276
Now!

112
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:38,877
Rasengan!

113
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,412
{\an1}Don't you see that
it's futile?!

114
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:18,044
{\an4}It went like you said,
Kakashi Sensei! I don't
really get why, but I
finally landed an attack!

115
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,546
{\an1}I see... It wasn't that Naruto
undid his Rasengan...

116
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:30,054
{\an1}...but that you used the
Kamui to send the Rasengan
away... right, Kakashi?

117
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:36,558
{\an4}As I suspected. I thought
you had two different jutsu,
one to slip through things
and one to

118
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:39,962
{\an1}pull things in or take
them out. But, no...

119
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:42,730
{\an1}It's all just one
single jutsu!

120
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,469
{\an1}Are you sure it's just one?

121
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,804
Yep.

122
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:55,108
{\an1}Well, there's no one better
at jutsu analysis and
breakdown.

123
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,210
{\an1}His jutsu... Can you explain
it to us quickly?

124
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:03,415
{\an4}Knowing exactly what it is
and how it works might
change how we approach the
battle.

125
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:06,117
{\an1}The gist of his jutsu is
very simple.

126
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:11,888
{\an4}You see, the jutsu he
uses to pull things in and
the one where he slips
through objects are

127
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:14,991
{\an1}both the Transportation
Technique.

128
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:18,793
{\an1}Wait, what do you mean? Just
how were you able to
determine that?

129
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:20,929
Well...

130
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,831
{\an1}Let me explain in order.

131
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,333
{\an1}First, that crack in his
mask...

132
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,871
{\an1}That mark is from my
Lightning Blade kunai knife.
There's no doubt about it.

133
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,343
{\an1}And I can tell from the look
of the wound on his right
shoulder that it was caused

134
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,811
{\an1}by Naruto's Rasengan
just now.

135
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,116
{\an1}What those two things
have in common...

136
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:49,753
{\an4}...is that they both involve
areas of his body that were
overlapping and in contact
with

137
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:54,491
{\an1}Naruto's body while he was
slipping through him.

138
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,595
{\an1}Also... there is one other
thing that the two have in
common. And that is...

139
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:10,904
{\an4}...the both of them were
caused by a kunai knife and
by a Rasengan that I had
teleported using my Kamui.

140
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,411
{\an1}In short, I can deduce from
all this that his
Transportation Technique...

141
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:22,047
{\an1}...and the time-space of my
Kamui are linked!

142
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:34,791
{\an4}Wait just a second! What are
you saying? How come his
Visual Jutsu and yours are
both linked?!

143
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:40,896
{\an4}Does that mean that all
Transportation Techniques
are linked between all
users?

144
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,000
{\an1}No... That's not the case. I
suspect that it's just him
and me.

145
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:51,038
{\an1}Never mind that! Why did
your kunai hit but I wasn't
able to land my punch?

146
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:56,242
{\an4}That's right, fool! Even
with shared time-spaces it
should still be impossible
to hit a guy that

147
00:15:56,276 --> 00:16:00,045
{\an1}can slip through everything
like it was nothing at all,
ya fool!

148
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:03,482
{\an1}Except that our theory that
he slips through things was
wrong.

149
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,950
{\an1}I still don't get it. What
do you mean?

150
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,155
{\an1}Although it looks like your
attack slipped right through
him...

151
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:15,959
{\an1}...in fact, only the part of
his body that would have
been in contact with yours

152
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,861
{\an1}was transported into
time-space.

153
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:24,433
{\an4}In other words, the left
side of his mask that your
punch "slipped through" was
simply

154
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:28,436
{\an1}transported into time-space
and no longer existed on
this plane.

155
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,204
{\an1}At least materially.

156
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:32,873
And then...

157
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:40,213
{\an4}Almost simultaneously, I
hurled that kunai into
time-space using Kamui,
remember?

158
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:51,621
{\an4}Just as his momentum carried
him forward... when he
extended his arm toward you
in order to grab you...

159
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:57,227
{\an1}...My kunai finished entering
time-space and it scored
his mask.

160
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,995
{\an1}The same... with my
Rasengan?

161
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,364
Yeah...

162
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,974
So that's what
happened, huh?

163
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,244
{\an1}But how come both your
Visual Prowess are linked?

164
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,814
Kakashi, is he?

165
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,550
{\an1}Just where did you
obtain that eye?

166
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,018
Where?

167
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:32,423
{\an1}[chuckling] During the last
Great War, if I dare say.

168
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,494
{\an1}The Battle of Kannabi
Bridge...

169
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:42,532
{\an1}The same battle where you
earned the nickname "The
Sharingan Hero."

170
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,733
Wait, are you?

171
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:50,704
{\an4}I thought I told you not to
flap your mouth so readily!
You have sunk so low as to
become

172
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,941
{\an1}nothing but talk! Your words
are worthless and
meaningless!

173
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:03,048
{\an1}It is too late for regrets.
Reality just keeps cruelly
moving forward.

174
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:11,255
{\an4}You have seen reality, so
you ought to know. Not one
wish ever gets granted in
this miserable world.

175
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,026
{\an1}That is why I shall guide it
toward the dream of Infinite
Tsukuyomi.

176
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:23,899
{\an4}I shall create a world where
it won't be necessary for a
hero to pathetically make
excuses in front of a grave.

177
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:24,899
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

178
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,369
{\an1}Hey, are you all right,
Kakashi?!

179
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:32,240
{\an1}Bastard! Are you still
yakking on about that?!

180
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:37,411
{\an1}I told you! I won't quit! My
dream is to be Hokage!

181
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:41,714
{\an1}I've been entrusted with way
too much by way too many!

182
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:43,649
You tell him!

183
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:44,849
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]

184
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:50,388
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]
Entrusted...

185
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:57,361
{\an4}But, Naruto... What if you
were to lose the things
Jiraiya and the Fourth
Hokage entrusted you with?

186
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,030
{\an1}I wonder what they
would think.

187
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,370
{\an1}I've always wanted to do
something about all of this
hatred...

188
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:12,273
{\an1}I'm just not quite sure how
to go about it as of yet.

189
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:18,345
{\an4}If I can't find the solution
to this problem, then
perhaps I'll entrust you to
find it instead, Naruto.

190
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:21,947
I'm very glad I
made you my student.

191
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:29,887
{\an1}You must find that answer
for yourself. Because even I
don't know it...

192
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,991
{\an1}I'm certain that you'll be
able to find the answer,
Naruto.

193
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,728
{\an1}Because I believe
in you completely.

194
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:44,000
{\an1}If you fail at the things
you were entrusted with...

195
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,270
{\an1}I wonder what you'll think
of yourself, as well?

196
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:58,077
{\an1}If you postpone dealing with
problems and cover them up
with the word "hope..."

197
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:07,052
{\an4}...all that awaits you is
empty reality. Both the
entrusted and those that did
the entrusting all in vain.

198
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,388
[growling]

199
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:14,692
{\an1}I sealed half of the
Nine-Tails' chakra inside
of you, because I believed

200
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,761
that you could
master this power.

201
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:20,997
I did it because
you're my son.

202
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:29,070
{\an1}Naruto! Switch with me!

203
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:33,374
{\an1}There's something I
want to say to him.

204
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:44,250
{\an1}Sorry, but your words don't
apply to this guy.

205
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:46,918
{\an1}That's Nine Tails!

206
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:51,423
{\an1}The Fourth entrusted him
with me and Naruto's...

207
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:56,060
{\an1}... befriended me now and
mastered my power, too!

208
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:07,336
{\an1}The Fourth Hokage sealed me
inside Naruto as a force to
help take you down.

209
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,909
Go, Naruto!

210
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,044
{\an1}You will not fail!

211
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,012
Yeah!

212
00:22:57,328 --> 00:23:01,498
{\an1}<i>That man, he couldn't be!</i>
<i>There's absolutely no way!</i>

213
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:05,535
{\an1}<i>Kakashi, I've got a pretty</i>
<i>good idea of what you're</i>
<i>thinking right now.</i>

214
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:10,373
{\an1}<i>But you need to just leave</i>
<i>it be. There's no time to</i>
<i>wallow in sentimentality.</i>

215
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:14,242
{\an1}<i>Your former subordinate</i>
<i>Naruto has already jumped</i>
<i>into action!</i>

216
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:19,013
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Who Are You?"</i>

217
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:24,150
{\an1}<i>How foolish, attacking</i>
<i>all by yourself.</i>
