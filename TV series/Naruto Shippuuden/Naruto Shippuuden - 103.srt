00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,240
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Remember?

166
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:43,877
You kept at it and you got it.

167
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,545
‐Heh.

168
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,781
Don't patronize me.

169
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,916
Of course I can do it.

170
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,184
Sure I can, no sweat.

171
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,341
‐You've got it?

172
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,576
You've got what?

173
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,278
‐The way to defeat the enemy.

174
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,080
‐You've got a plan, huh?

175
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,183
Listen, I told you about
their smokescreen, didn't I?

176
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,719
We couldn't see a thing.

177
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,188
And amazing as it sounds, even
Akamaru's nose was useless.

178
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,292
We were fighting blind, but they
could see every move we made.

179
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,161
Keeping as far
away as we possibly

180
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,565
can from that damn smokescreen,
that's a plan, if you ask me.

181
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,766
‐No, no!

182
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,536
Run away and just abandon
the field to the enemy?

183
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,671
We will never defeat
them that way.

184
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,840
‐Yeah, but like I said
before, these guys are tough.

185
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,576
‐And like I said before,
I have come up with a way.

186
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,544
TENTEN: Well, well.

187
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,245
Could it be now that
you're a chunin,

188
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,780
you've started to
use your brain?

189
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,182
You're not just a
workout fanatic anymore?

190
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,684
YAMATO: Well done, Lee.

191
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,386
OK, then, let's
hear your strategy.

192
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,020
‐Right.

193
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,122
My strategy is‐‐

194
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,392
ALL: Your strategy is?

195
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,668
‐My strategy is this.

196
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,904
‐What, Lee?

197
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:06,172
‐One word.

198
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,374
[gulp]

199
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:09,309
‐Spirit!

200
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,577
With enough spirit
and fortitude,

201
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,213
there is no enemy
we cannot defeat!

202
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,548
Hello?

203
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,117
What is the matter
with everyone?

204
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,884
‐Spirit?

205
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,052
That's all their is?

206
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,286
That's your great strategy?

207
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,855
You kept us waiting for that?!

208
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,989
‐What is wrong?

209
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:23,824
I do not understand!

210
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:24,625
What did I do?

211
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,992
‐Forget it.

212
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,828
He's still just a
workout fanatic.

213
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,830
LEE: What in the world
has come over you?

214
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,297
KIBA: Why, I oughta‐‐

215
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,298
LEE: Kiba, ow!

216
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:39,172
‐Are you ready?

217
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,042
‐Yeah.

218
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,177
‐Shino, how's it going?

219
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,680
‐I need a little more time.

220
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:47,881
‐All right.

221
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,916
Sai, we'll keep
the same formation

222
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,918
that Yamato used
when he was captain.

223
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:53,019
Got it?

224
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:53,887
‐Right.

225
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,721
Understood.

226
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,690
‐Speaking of Yamato, I forgot.

227
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:58,358
You came from the
same place he did.

228
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,593
‐Hm?

229
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,101
‐Where's that?

230
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:02,669
‐The ANBU Black Ops.

231
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,304
Things like
formations, teamwork,

232
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,707
and protecting your comrades
aren't a high priority

233
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,974
with them.

234
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:09,275
Things are different now.

235
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,112
You're to protect your
comrades at all costs.

236
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,080
Is that understood, Sai?

237
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,448
‐There's no need to worry.

238
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:16,449
‐Hm?

239
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,685
SAI: That's the
reason I'm still here,

240
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,253
because depending
on your friends

241
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:23,156
is something I believe in now.

242
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,257
‐Heh.

243
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,359
Well, so you're finally
getting it now, huh?

244
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:32,398
‐They say wherever someone
is still thinking of you,

245
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,868
that place is your home.

246
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,236
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

247
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,172
You will always have a home
as long as there's someplace

248
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:44,244
where friends are thinking of
you, friends who depend on you.

249
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:47,113
‐I found out where
it is, my home.

250
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,083
Right, Guren?

251
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:52,018
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That mixed‐up kid.

252
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:54,020
He doesn't get that she's
not thinking about him

253
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,155
like a friend.

254
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,657
She's got him fooled.

255
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,558
KAKASHI: They're here!

256

‐You again!

262
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:29,696
‐My home.

263
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,766
I finally found
out where I belong.

264
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,467
‐You've tricked
Yukimaru into believing

265
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,969
that you're his friend!

266
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,437
‐[growls] No.

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,138
No!

268
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:39,606
Shut up!

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,574
Noooo!

that's the smokescreen guy.

278
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,707
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
So he's the point man.

279
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,242
‐All right.

280
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,211
‐Huh?

Aaauughh!

He was right.

We're ready to

You are not blind.

You can still see
