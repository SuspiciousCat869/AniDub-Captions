1
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:15,596
Kiba, when we get to the
Land of Iron, please
find Naruto quickly.

2
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,231
{\an1}Yeah, I got it!

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,035
[sigh]

4
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:22,970
{\an1}What is wrong, Kiba?

5
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,640
{\an1}Ino wouldn't stop crying
when she heard the bad news.

6
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,178
{\an1}<i>Sakura looks really</i>
<i>determined but I don't know</i>
<i>how she's gonna tell Naruto.</i>

7
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,448
{\an1}And something tells
me it's going to be
really uncomfortable.

8
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:37,453
{\an1}Well, I am sure that Sakura
is giving the matter a
good deal of thought.

9
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,488
{\an1}And of course,

10
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:43,993
{\an1}Because four-man squads are
the standard, all search
missions usually include me.

11
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:47,730
{\an1}But Sai also wants us
to keep this entire
thing top secret.

12
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,633
{\an1}And I'm supposed
to use my nose,

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,904
{\an1}to see if Danzo's ANBU from
the Foundation are following us.

14
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:57,140
I mean, talk about
working us to the bone!

15
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,576
Right, Akamaru?

16
00:00:58,842 --> 00:00:59,843
[whine]

17
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,517
{\an1}<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>Just look at</i>
<i>what you've done!</i>

18
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,820
{\an1}<i>That's why I can't</i>
<i>stand shinobi!</i>

19
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:12,790
{\an1}Sorry. Please, forgive us.
I will repair it myself,
I promise.

20
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:22,669
{\an1}Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of
the Uchiha's hatred,

21
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:26,805
{\an1}and intends to strike
deep into the world
with that curse.

22
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:35,015
{\an1}<i>That hate is his most </i>
<i>powerful weapon, his friend,</i>
<i>and the source of his power.</i>

23
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,319
{\an1}<i>That is Sasuke's</i>
<i>Ninja Way!</i>

24
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:42,857
{\an1}<i>Sasuke chose this path</i>
<i>all on his own.</i>

25
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:49,130
{\an1}The only thing left to do
is to ask him myself.

26
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:57,072
{\an1}It seems that Cee was right.
The Hokage has indeed fled.

27
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,042
Yep, and all
thanks to Sasuke.

28
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,276
[gasp]

29
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,011
Wha?

30
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:14,625
{\an1}Anything Akatsuki is
bad news, and honestly
won't make any sense!

31
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:15,726
{\an8}<i>Sasuke?!</i>

32
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:18,896
{\an1}Return Sasuke
right now!

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,768
{\an1}That will depend on your
response to what I'm
about to tell you.

34
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:26,371
{\an1}Just calm down, Raikage.

35
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,107
{\an1}Let's hear him out,
and take it from there.

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,808
Rrrgh.

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,079
Go heal Sasuke.

38
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,447
{\an1}A-Aaah!

39
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:39,050
So that's what
Madara's ability is.

40
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,019
{\an1}It's the
Transportation
Technique.

41
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:47,993
Where am I?

42
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,966
{\an1}Now, are all of you
finally prepared to listen?

43
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:57,971
{\an1}First tell us: why are you
trying to win over Sasuke?

44
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:06,481
{\an1}Sharingan that actually acquire
the Susano'o are quite rare.
I like to stock up on good eyes.

45
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:13,988
{\an4}By battling the Five Kage,
he'd hone his visual prowess
even further, which is
exactly why I sent him here.

46
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:18,360
{\an1}I was hoping to weaken the
Five Kage and take at
least some of you hostage.

47
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,462
{\an1}But I guess that
was too much to ask.

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,232
Take us hostage?
Whatever for?!

49
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,002
{\an5}[Madara]
To ensure that Project
Tsuki no Me was
implemented smoothly.

50
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:32,142
{\an1}I'm truly surprised that
the infamous Madara
Uchiha is still alive.

51
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:36,112
{\an4}But I'm confused:
why do you of all
people need such
roundabout tactics?

52
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:40,684
{\an1}With all your power, you
ought to be able to bring
any plan to fruition easily.

53
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:45,556
{\an1}My injuries from my battle
with the First Hokage
Hashirama were too severe.

54
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:47,859
{\an1}I currently have little power.

55
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:51,195
I am but a shell
of my former self.

56
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:57,035
{\an1}Oh, I get it. Then this
plan of yours is to restore
your power, is that it?

57
00:03:57,335 --> 00:04:02,340
{\an5}Hum. I suppose you
could say that.
But there's so
much more to it.

58
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,879
{\an1}What are you scheming?!
Exactly what is this
Project Tsuki no Me?!

59
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:11,852
{\an1}It'll be a long story,
so I'll need to sit down.

60
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,788
{\an1}That's enough! Just tell us:
what kind of plan is it?!

61
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,832
{\an1}All shall become one with me,
in a complete possession form
that unites all.

62
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,240
{\an1}What do you mean?!
Become one and
unite all of us?!

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,142
{\an1}What does that even
mean?!

64
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:40,248
{\an1}There's an ancient stone
tablet passed down
within the Uchiha clan.

65
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,818
{\an1}It's in a room beneath
the Hidden Leaf.

66
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:47,356
{\an1}<i>Upon it are written</i>
<i>secrets engraved by the</i>
<i>Sage of Six Paths himself.</i>

67
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,494
{\an1}<i>They cannot be read</i>
<i>without visual powers.</i>

68
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:54,831
{\an1}<i>With the Sharingan,</i>
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan, and</i>
<i>Rinnegan, respectively,</i>

69
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,701
{\an1}<i>more and more knowledge</i>
<i>is progressively revealed.</i>

70
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:04,074
{\an1}And your story's becoming
more and more unbelievable.
The Sage of Six Paths is a myth!

71
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:07,545
It is the truth.
He did indeed exist.

72
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:10,314
And he left that
stone tablet behind.

73
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:11,817
Don't change
the subject!

74
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:17,021
{\an1}And what exactly does this
Sage of Six Paths have to
do with your plan, anyway?

75
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:24,329
{\an4}Do any of you know why he
became a legendary figure,
one that is revered like
a god among shinobi?

76
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:30,436
{\an1}This is where the link between
that man and my purposes lies.

77
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:37,745
{\an4}Madara Uchiha, you possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan and
your fellow Akatsuki member
possessed the Rinnegan.

78
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,847
{\an1}Do you know all the
tablet's secrets, then?

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,348
{\an1}Let's hear them!

80
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:46,353
{\an1}The Sage once saved the world,
from a certain monster.

81
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,023
What monster?

82
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:54,029
{\an1}Gaara, you once held merely
one small piece of that monster
sealed away within you.

83
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:01,771
{\an4}<i>It was the aggregate of</i>
<i>all of the Tailed Beasts,</i>
<i>a creature that possessed</i>
<i>almost infinite chakra.</i>

84
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,406
<i>Ten-Tails!</i>

85
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,663
"Declaration of War"

86
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:05,370
{\an4}It was the aggregate of
all of the Tailed Beasts,
a creature that possessed
almost infinite chakra.

87
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,107
<i>The Ten-Tails!</i>

88
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,509
{\an1}But I thought there were
only nine Tailed Beasts!

89
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,415
{\an1}I just told you, it was
the aggregate of all nine
of the Tailed Beasts.

90
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,986
{\an1}<i>Shukaku, Gaara's Tailed</i>
<i>Beast known as...</i>

91
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,523
<i>The One-Tail!</i>

92
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,995
{\an1}<i>The fiery Wraith Cat of the</i>
<i>Hidden Cloud's Yugito Ni'i...</i>

93
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,531
<i>The Two-Tails!</i>

94
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,336
{\an1}<i>The former Mizukage's...</i>

95
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,873
<i>The Three-Tails!</i>

96
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,511
{\an1}<i>Roshi of the Lava Style's...</i>

97
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:44,847
<i>The Four-Tails!</i>

98
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,417
{\an1}<i>Han of the Hidden Stone's...</i>

99
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:50,452
<i>The Five-Tails!</i>

100
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,824
{\an1}<i>The Rogue Ninja Utakata's...</i>

101
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,793
<i>The Six-Tails!</i>

102
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:00,797
{\an1}<i>Fuu of the Hidden Waterfall's...</i>

103
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>The Seven-Tails!</i>

104
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,772
{\an1}<i>Killer Bee,</i>
<i>Raikage's younger</i>
<i>brother's...</i>

105
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,740
<i>The Eight-Tails!</i>

106
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,012
{\an1}<i>And the Fox Spirit of</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf...</i>

107
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,782
<i>The Nine-Tails!</i>

108
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,520
{\an1}<i>The Ten-Tails' chakra</i>
<i>was simply divided up</i>

109
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:24,523
{\an1}<i>to create the nine Tailed</i>
<i>Beasts that we know today.</i>

110
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:28,393
{\an1}By the Sage of Six Paths' hand.

111
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:30,730
I really don't like
where this is going.

112
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:34,268
So that's why the
Akatsuki were collecting
all the Tailed Beasts?

113
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:41,008
{\an4}The Sage of Six Paths
developed a certain Ninjutsu
in order to protect the
world from the Ten-Tails.

114
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:48,348
{\an4}That Ninjutsu is still
being secretly passed down.
It is the Sealing Jutsu
process for Jinchuriki.

115
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:51,920
{\an1}<i>Yes, the Sage was the</i>
<i>Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki. </i>

116
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:56,191
{\an1}<i>He sealed Ten-Tails within</i>
<i>himself to suppress the monster.</i>

117
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:05,034
{\an4}<i>The Sage, who saved humanity</i>
<i>from being terrorized by the</i>
<i>beast, was revered as a</i>
<i>savior, and as a god.</i>

118
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:12,007
{\an4}<i>But the Sage feared that upon</i>
<i>his death, the seal would come</i>
<i>undone and Ten-Tails' immense</i>
<i>chakra would reemerge.</i>

119
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,644
{\an1}<i>So in his final moments,</i>
<i>he summoned the last of</i>
<i>his strength,</i>

120
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:22,052
{\an4}<i>to partition the</i>
<i>Ten-Tails' chakra into</i>
<i>nine pieces and scatter</i>
<i>them all across the world.</i>

121
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:29,659
{\an4}<i>Then he sealed away the</i>
<i>body of the monster, now</i>
<i>devoid of chakra, and</i>
<i>hurled it up into the sky.</i>

122
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,597
{\an1}<i>And it became the moon.</i>

123
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,167
This tale is
ridiculous.

124
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,703
{\an1}I mean, what human being could
do something like that?!

125
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:45,077
{\an1}As Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki,
the Sage had already advanced
beyond the realm of humanity.

126
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,914
So you're trying to
reassemble those nine
separated chakras.

127
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:53,385
{\an1}In other words all of the
nine Tailed Beasts, and
obtain that immense power.

128
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,889
I can understand that
part of your plan.

129
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,158
{\an1}But what are you planning
on doing with all that power?

130
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,831
{\an1}Revive the Ten-Tails, of course!
And become Ten-Tail's
Jinchuriki!

131
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:11,872
{\an4}I would then use its
tremendous chakra to
strengthen my visual prowess,
and launch a certain jutsu.

132
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,676
{\an1}But what certain jutsu?
Which one do you mean?

133
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,312
{\an1}Just what are you plotting?!

134
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,483
{\an1}A Super Genjutsu where I project
my eye off the moon's surface...

135
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,685
{\an1}An Infinite Tsukuyomi.

136
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:28,357
{\an1}<i>All humans living on this</i>
<i>earth will be placed</i>
<i>under my genjutsu!</i>

137
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:34,997
{\an4}<i>And as a result, by</i>
<i>controlling every single</i>
<i>one of them, I shall</i>
<i>unify the entire world.</i>

138
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:43,373
{\an4}<i>I will create a world without</i>
<i>hatred or war. Everything</i>
<i>will become one with me,</i>
<i>everything will be united.</i>

139
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,476
{\an1}That is Project Tsuki no Me.

140
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,249
{\an1}You're insane! I'm not just
handing the world over to you!

141
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:57,221
{\an4}That kind of peace
is just an illusion.
Peace is only meaningful
when it's achieved honestly.

142
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:03,262
{\an4}So what exists inside
such a genjutsu world?
There's no hope, no dreams!
It's just an escape!

143
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:05,898
You want to unite
the whole world, huh?

144
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:09,301
Interesting that
Danzo mentioned
something similar.

145
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:13,138
But it sounds to me
that instead of wanting
to unite the world,

146
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:16,709
{\an1}You actually want to
make the world yours
and only yours!

147
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,610
{\an1}Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

148
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,983
{\an1}And yet, with all your talk,
what have you Five Kage
accomplished?

149
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,287
{\an1}You of all people should
know the truth by now.

150
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,326
{\an1}There is no hope!

151
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:37,531
{\an1}To hope is equivalent to
giving up, and it's the
biggest deception of all.

152
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:43,839
{\an1}Now, turn over the remaining
Eight- and Nine-Tails,
and cooperate with my plan.

153
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,174
Or this is war.

154
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,510
{\an1}War, you say?

155
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,778
Eight-Tails?

156
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,948
{\an1}What do you mean?!
You captured Bee!

157
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,618
{\an1}Eight-Tails' capture failed,
and he escaped.

158
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:00,523
{\an1}Now, there's a shinobi
who's a perfect Jinchuriki.

159
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:03,160
{\an1}There's no one quite like
your younger brother.

160
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:04,027
Huhh?

161
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:08,799
{\an1}Oh, so it's true.
I had a feeling he escaped.

162
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,536
That giant fool!

163
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:18,243
{\an4}He used this chance to
run off and play hooky?!
Unforgiveable! He's gonna
get my Iron Claw for this!

164
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,845
{\an1}I won't give up Naruto Uzumaki.

165
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,247
{\an1}And neither will I!

166
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,783
What about you,
Raikage?

167
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,885
I'll never hand
over my brother!

168
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:32,425
{\an4}I may not have any strength,
but I do have the powers of
the seven Tailed Beasts
I've collected.

169
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,827
{\an1}You have no chance
of winning.

170
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,029
{\an1}We won't abandon hope.

171
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,432
Very well.

172
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:43,937
{\an1}I hereby declare war on you all.
the Fourth Great Ninja War
begins now.

173
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:48,241
{\an1}What?! You're starting the
Fourth Great Ninja War?
Are you mad?!

174
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,052
{\an1}The next time we meet,
will be in battle.

175
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:12,334
{\an1}All right, then.
What should we
all do now?

176
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:18,541
{\an4}Our nations must form an
alliance. It's the only
way to fight the power
of seven Tailed Beasts.

177
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,279
{\an1}Lord Raikage,
you opposed
this idea.

178
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,849
{\an1}It seems my little
brother is safe.

179
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:30,019
{\an1}But we cannot allow
ourselves to be bullied by
the Akatsuki any longer!

180
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,157
Form the alliance and
we'll settle this!
For good!

181
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,992
{\an1}What do we do about
the Hidden Leaf?

182
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,261
{\an1}The Hokage ran off,
remember?

183
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,730
There's too much
suspicion around Danzo!

184
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:43,401
{\an1}And after what's happened
at this summit, he's
completely lost our trust.

185
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:48,673
{\an4}When the Hidden Leaf's
ninja find out about this,
his standing in the Leaf
will become shaky.

186
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,876
{\an1}He must be deposed soon.

187
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:56,349
{\an5}And I'll pass on the
news about the Allied
Shinobi Forces to a Leaf
ninja that I trust.

188
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:56,983
{\an1}Who is that?

189
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,919
Kakashi Hatake of
the Sharingan Eye.

190
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,624
{\an1}Do you mean the son
of the White Fang?

191
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,364
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Right here and now, this young</i>
<i>shinobi, no matter how awkward,</i>

192
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:15,669
{\an1}<i>is bowing his head with respect</i>
<i>and affection for the Cloud and</i>
<i>Leaf, village and nation.</i>

193
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:19,840
{\an1}So, Lord Raikage,
as one of the Five Kage,

194
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,243
{\an1}Tell me, what do
you think of this?

195
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:28,850
{\an1}That's acceptable.
He at least seems more
trustworthy than Danzo.

196
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,718
Heh. Indeed.

197
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:31,453
{\an1}Mmm.

198
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,891
{\an1}Lord Raikage, we must
take steps to find
Killer Bee right away!

199
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,961
{\an1}If the Akatsuki are after
Eight- and Nine-Tails,

200
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:41,665
{\an1}Then that means they're
probably still pursuing Bee.

201
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:46,403
You're right. Okay, then
send word back to the
village immediately.

202
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,005
Have them put
together a search
party and find Bee!

203
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,674
{\an1}Yes, sir!

204
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,743
{\an1}And, we ought to inform
Samui's team right away, too.

205
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,681
{\an1}Omoi and Karui are
really distraught.

206
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:59,817
{\an1}In order to stop Madara's
Project Tsuki no Me,

207
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,622
{\an1}we absolutely must keep
the Eight- and Nine-Tails
out of his clutches.

208
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:07,693
{\an1}I believe it's imperative
that our forces find them
before anyone else does,

209
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,929
{\an1}and get them out of
sight and into hiding
as fast as we can.

210
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,501
{\an1}Yes, that's absolutely right!
If Ten-Tails were revived,
we'd be done for!

211
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:21,241
{\an1}Yeah, but I can't even imagine
the power Madara has amassed
with seven Tailed Beasts.

212
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:26,145
{\an1}And if he possesses
jutsu that utilize them,
that would be his secret weapon!

213
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:29,816
{\an1}Yes, I agree; otherwise,
he wouldn't have been
quite so bold.

214
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:32,919
{\an1}I believe the Allied
Shinobi Forces,

215
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:38,192
{\an4}must also plan to use
the strength of the Eight-
and Nine-Tails in battle,
don't you all agree with that?

216
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,732
{\an1}No, absolutely not.
This is also a war to
protect both of them.

217
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:48,738
{\an1}I think the reason why
Madara is waging war with
his seven Tailed Beasts,

218
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,974
{\an1}is that in his weakened
state, it's too difficult
for him to capture

219
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:56,512
{\an1}the Eight- and Nine-Tails
with just the remaining
Akatsuki members.

220
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:59,715
{\an1}And even if it were possible,
the risks are too high.

221
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:03,886
Also, he may be hoping
to lure the two out
with this war.

222
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,359
{\an1}For many reasons, using the
Tailed Beasts in battle is
not a wise strategy.

223
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:12,296
{\an1}I agree; we must find
a different plan.

224
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,465
{\an1}Yes, I also concur
with the Kazekage.

225
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:20,837
{\an4}If we consider the worst-case
scenario, it's like offering
the Tailed Beasts up on a
silver platter!

226
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:27,478
{\an4}Besides which, military
strategy is a foreign concept
to my little brother,
the Eight-Tails Jinchuriki!

227
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,783
{\an1}I could never predict
what he'd do.

228
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:32,950
Yea-yah!

229
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,622
{\an1}And he might bring his
own brand of chaos with
him to the battlefield.

230
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,159
{\an1}<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>The same could be said,</i>

231
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,260
For Naruto.

232
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,530
Yeah, that's for sure.

233
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,930
{\an1}Heh, I'll say!

234
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,803
{\an1}Very well, then Eight-
and Nine-Tails will be
under protective custody.

235
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,805
What say you,
Lord Tsuchikage?

236
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:51,538
Mmm.

237
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,577
{\an1}We'll share Intel on Killer
Bee with all you Stone,
Mist, Sand and Leaf.

238
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:59,413
{\an1}Use it to put together Tracking
Units and get them moving!

239
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:03,585
{\an1}Instruct them all to
inform me the moment
they locate Eight-Tails.

240
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,488
{\an1}My younger brother will
only listen to me!

241
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:10,225
{\an4}<i>[Raikage]</i>
<i>And Kazekage.</i>
<i>We'll trust you to</i>
<i>speak with Kakashi.</i>

242
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:11,693
Fine.

243
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:17,132
{\an4}<i>[Raikage]</i>
<i>I saw Kakashi Hatake and</i>
<i>the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki</i>
<i>brat on our way here.</i>

244
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:21,571
{\an5}They might still be
in the Land of Iron.
So I'd look around
here first.

245
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:23,973
{\an1}Understood.

246
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,679
Um? Excuse me?
May I say something?

247
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:29,513
{\an1}What is it?

248
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,683
Uh. Right.
Well, you see,
it's just--

249
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,385
{\an1}Spit it out, boy!

250
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,885
Oh. Aah.

251
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,625
{\an1}In the Akatsuki, there's
another member of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

252
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:44,995
{\an1}<i>Kisame Hoshigaki. He has chakra</i>
<i>equal to that of a Jinchuriki.</i>

253
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:49,467
{\an1}<i>and his sword, Samehada,</i>
<i>or Shark Skin, is the most</i>
<i>terrible of all the blades.</i>

254
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:55,073
{\an4}<i>When his chakra and sword merge,</i>
<i>even though he's human, </i>
<i>he has power close to </i>
<i>that of a Jinchuriki.</i>

255
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,310
{\an1}<i>He is like a Tailed Beast</i>
<i>without the tail!</i>

256
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,112
<i>Or so my elders</i>
<i>have told me.</i>

257
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,049
{\an1}He's extraordinary.
Please do not
underestimate him.

258
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,419
Yes, we already
know about that!

259
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:09,356
{\an1}But anyway, are all of you
sure about this plan?

260
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,094
{\an1}We don't know just how
much power Madara's seven
Tailed Beasts possess.

261
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:20,368
{\an4}If we hold Eight- and Nine-Tails
back and our Allied Shinobi
Forces are wiped out while
protecting the two of them,

262
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:24,772
{\an1}Then our entire effort
would have been meaningless,
all for naught!

263
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:28,409
{\an1}If that's the case,
it's better to use them
right from the start,

264
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:32,714
and let them wage a
two-front war alongside
our combined forces.

265
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,517
[Mifune]
Actually, I
wonder about that.

266
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,218
Mmh?

267
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:41,256
{\an1}The world's first Allied Shinobi
Force is being formed here,
right at this very moment.

268
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,493
And its strength
is also unknown.

269
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:49,132
{\an1}And there must be some risk
in Madara using the power
of the seven Tailed Beasts.

270
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:53,804
{\an1}<i>Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone</i>
<i>out of his way to come to this</i>
<i>Summit and try to negotiate.</i>

271
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:57,508
{\an1}He must be facing unfavorable
circumstances just like us.

272
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,545
{\an1}Furthermore, we Samurai
shall also participate
in this war!

273
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:06,350
{\an1}Is this more satisfactory,
Lord Tsuchikage?
Do you still harbor doubts?

274
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:07,719
Hnh.

275
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:13,091
The Raikage and Kazekage
went back upstairs, too.

276
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:16,796
{\an1}I bet that Sasuke and
Karin must've just gone
on ahead without us.

277
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:18,798
{\an1}What do you say,
should we go up, too?

278
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:23,436
{\an1}Yeah, but it's heavily guarded.
We're sure to be found out.

279
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,639
{\an1}Maybe. But I've got a
trick up my sleeve.

280
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,542
{\an1}<i>[Kurotsuchi]</i>
<i>what the hell was he?</i>

281
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,945
Yech, he is disgusting!

282
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:46,026
{\an7}<i>If we just do what we always do,</i>
<i>we'll never find Sasuke.</i>

283
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,796
{\an7}<i>I'm going to have</i>
<i>to use Sage Mode.</i>

284
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,033
{\an7}<i>But I need to find a way</i>
<i>to make it last longer.</i>

285
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,638
{\an1}[Yamato]
Naruto! Come down, already.

286
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:57,640
Hm?

287
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,278
{\an1}Finally! We found you guys!

288
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,181
What? Sakura?

289
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,986
Sai, Kiba, and
even Bushy Brows?

290
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,955
Why are all
of you here?

291
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,090
Naruto.

292
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:18,361
{\an1}I need to talk to you,
right now.

293
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,436
{\an1}<i>[Rock Lee]</i>
<i>What?! What is happening here?</i>

294
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,406
{\an1}<i>Sakura, are you</i>
<i>telling the truth?</i>

295
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,407
{\an1}<i>[Kiba]</i>
<i>Sakura, are you?!</i>

296
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,242
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>Is this truly</i>
<i>how you feel?</i>

297
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,544
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Wait, Yamato.</i>
<i>Let's hear her out.</i>

298
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:08,948
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Sakura, Is this for real?!</i>

299
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:13,386
{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>Yes, I just finally</i>
<i>realized my true feelings.</i>

300
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:18,324
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Sakura's Feelings.</i>

301
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:22,129
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>What... what is going on?</i>
