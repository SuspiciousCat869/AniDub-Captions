the way out here!

140
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,696
{\an1}<i>Of course I'd come</i>
<i>as far as this!</i>

141
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:19,802
{\an4}<i>It's always Sasuke this</i>
<i>and Sasuke that, chasing</i>
<i>after him and putting</i>
<i>yourself in danger.</i>

142
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:23,773
{\an1}You're Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki!
The Akatsuki's after you!

143
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,377
{\an1}So you worry about your
own skin for a change!

144
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,149
{\an4}Don't you get it? I'm trying
to tell you that you don't
have to chase after Sasuke
and endanger yourself!

145
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:37,856
{\an4}<i>I came out here to find you</i>
<i>because I want you to return</i>
<i>to the Village right away!</i>
<i>That's all!</i>

146
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,303
{\an1}I'm sorry, but it still sounds
like an excuse you made up.

147
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:52,473
I know you, Sakura.
Maybe better than
you think.

148
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,010
{\an1}Then why don't you understand
what I'm trying to say?

149
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,181
{\an1}I don't care about Sasuke
at all anymore since he's
become a criminal.

150
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,951
{\an1}So the promise between us
doesn't stand anymore!

151
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,624
{\an1}But it's not just about
that promise now.

152
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:13,562
{\an1}Maybe I understand better
why Sasuke has become
obsessed with revenge.

153
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,633
{\an1}And is causing so much damage.

154
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,541
Sasuke really loved his
family and his clan.

155
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:28,714
{\an1}And I think it's because he
loved them so much that he just
can't forgive what happened.

156
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:34,154
{\an4}If that's true, then why
would he join the Akatsuki
after defeating the
unforgivable Itachi?

157
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,263
{\an1}That's not how it went down.
What really happen--

158
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,230
Naruto!

159
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:43,898
Ah!

160
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:44,698
Eh?

161
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:58,681
{\an4}For now, we need to keep
what Madara said in
complete confidence
between the three of us.

162
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,683
{\an1}It must stay secret.

163
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:05,989
{\an4}<i>We're in the middle of</i>
<i>rebuilding the Village,</i>
<i>and can't afford any more</i>
<i>chaos and confusion.</i>

164
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,661
{\an1}<i>Besides, until we check the</i>
<i>facts, we can't trust Madara.</i>

165
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:13,566
{\an1}<i>There's too much we don't</i>
<i>know about his claim</i>

166
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:18,571
{\an4}<i>that the upper echelon of</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf Village</i>
<i>used Itachi to slaughter</i>
<i>the Uchiha clan.</i>

167
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:22,908
{\an1}We need to keep this quiet-
especially you, Naruto.

168
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:34,055
It doesn't matter even
if there isn't a promise
between us anymore.

169
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:34,655
{\an1}Uh?

170
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,826
{\an1}Because rescuing Sasuke is just
something that I have to do.

171
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:51,007
{\an1}What do we now, Sakura?
Look, why don't we just go
ahead and tell him the truth?

172
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,144
Gyaaahh!

173
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:56,680
Enough! I'm
going home!

174
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,184
{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

175
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:01,153
{\an1}Kiba, Lee, Sai!

176
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:03,088
But, Sakura...

177
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,890
Agh. Let's
just go.

178
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:28,250
{\an7}<i>Naruto... I'm so sorry!</i>

179
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,003
{\an1}Hey, are you really
okay with this, Sakura?

180
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,343
{\an1}Kiba, I need a favor.

181
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:52,010
What?

182
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,683
{\an1}I want to go look for Sasuke
now! I need your help.

183
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:32,155
If we just got rid of
the Eight-Tails and
Nine-Tails right now,

184
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:35,560
{\an1}we could completely mess
up Madara's twisted plan,

185
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:38,397
and remove a chunk of
the Cloud and Leaf's
battle strength.

186
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,565
{\an1}Two birds with one stone!

187
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,002
{\an1}No, I'm not going to do
things like that this time.

188
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,672
{\an1}Why not?! That's not like
you, ya stubborn geezer!

189
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,278
{\an1}<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>Then let me ask you this.</i>

190
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:55,316
{\an1}Sure! Go head,
no holds barred,
ask away!

191
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,488
When did all of you
forsake yourselves?

192
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,221
What?!

193
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:05,695
It's because
I remembered.

194
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,330
What are you
talking about?

195
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:11,868
{\an1}I remembered who I was before
I got so stubborn.

196
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:25,684
{\an1}Ponta!

197
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,860
{\an1}Well, he sure may be big, but
your bear isn't worth shredding!
