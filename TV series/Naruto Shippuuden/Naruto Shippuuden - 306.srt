00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,283
Oh...

147
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,642
[sipping]

148
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,812
{\an1}Is someone there?

149
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,052
Must be my
imagination...

150
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,799
{\an1}Well, it's going
to take a little
more time...

151
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:21,401
Oh, uh, how
much more time?

152
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,639
{\an4}Try not to be
impatient. It's
important that
you rest.

153
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:27,608
Oh, all right...

154
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:35,484
{\an1}Doctor! Please wait!

155
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:38,554
{\an1}Hey, that's Neji.

156
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:39,722
{\an1}Hide!

157
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:42,992
Why exactly are
we hiding?

158
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,628
{\an1}It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

159
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:50,100
{\an1}You have to heal her!
Hinata's eyes must be
better by this weekend!

160
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:54,039
Huh? Did she injure
her eyes or something?

161
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:57,642
{\an1}She was looking forward
to seeing the fireworks
display this weekend!

162
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,945
{\an1}<i>I want her to go,</i>
<i>whatever it takes!</i>

163
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,548
{\an1}I understand, but
something like this
isn't that simple.

164
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:09,021
{\an1}Hm. If I only had
access to some Eyebright.

165
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,490
{\an1}And what is
that? Eyebright?

166
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:14,493
{\an1}It's an extremely
rare medicinal plant.

167
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,965
{\an1}And it's said to be
very effective in
treating eyestrain.

168
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:23,972
{\an4}<i>But Eyebright only grows</i>
<i>in remote areas, and even</i>
<i>there it's exceedingly</i>
<i>difficult to find.</i>

169
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,975
{\an1}<i>Although, now that</i>
<i>I think about it...</i>
<i>That's right!</i>

170
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:30,745
{\an1}<i>I heard that someone</i>
<i>recently saw some growing</i>
<i>in the Valley of Judgement.</i>

171
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:32,181
{\an1}The Valley of
Judgement...

172
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,984
Now, hold on...
Don't think of
looking for it.

173
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:38,321
{\an1}Even jonin have been
known to get lost in
the Valley of Judgement.

174
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,023
If you go, you
won't come back.

175
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:44,027
If Hinata rests
quietly, then she'll be
fine in a week or so.

176
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,529
{\an1}She simply needs to
be patient a little
longer.

177
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:49,166
{\an1}But one week
is too late!

178
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,984
There you are! I
figured you'd show up!

179
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,519
{\an1}Naruto... Sakura...

180
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,023
{\an1}You're going to the
Valley of Judgement,
aren't you?

181
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,327
So you do have a
soft spot inside
you after all!

182
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:19,266
{\an4}Yeah, um, we didn't
mean to eavesdrop on
what you were saying
earlier... Right?

183
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,770
{\an5}Yeah! But we were
right in front of
Hinata's house and
listened anyway!

184
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:29,245
{\an5}So we're gonna
come with you to go
get some of that
Eyebright stuff!

185
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,213
No thank you.

186
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:41,959
{\an5}Ugh. Do as you
please. But don't
expect my help if
you lag behind!

187
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,561
{\an1}Yeah right, like
we'd want your help.

188
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:48,465
{\an7}You should focus on what
really needs help: That
annoying personality of
yours.

189
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:52,570
{\an1}You know, Neji, if you
weren't going, then Naruto
and I would've gone anyway.

190
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:56,607
I wanna make sure
Hinata gets to see
those fireworks!

191
00:13:56,641 --> 00:14:02,415
{\an7}<i>I'm gonna make sure she can</i>

{\an1}That mist is

197

{\an1}Are we even going
to be able to find
that medicinal plant?

198

199
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:30,178
{\an1}You two stay here. Since
you don't have the Byakugan
you'll only slow me down.

200

{\an1}Neji!

doing, Naruto?

{\an4}Tying us together, of
course! That way we won't
get separated walking through
all that mist down there!

203
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:44,294
{\an8}This is perfect!
It's our red
string of destiny!

here?

208

this is., don't you, Neji?

282
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,903
{\an3}Yes.

{\an5}Back then, before the
fireworks show, Naruto
and Sakura came to tell
me what happened.

288
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:41,692
{\an7}<i>They explained everything</i>
<i>that you went through to</i>
<i>try and help me.</i>

289
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,328
{\an1}So, you knew...

290
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:50,001
{\an1}I've always wanted to
tell you this... to say...

291
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:51,871
...Thank you, Neji.

292
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:02,015
{\an4}Okay, Neji. Are you ready
to do this? After all, compared
to Senbon Sparring, this is
practically nothing!

293
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:04,117
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Sounds good!</i>

294
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,321
{\an4}<i>And this is your chance</i>
<i>to show me just how</i>
<i>much you've progressed</i>
<i>since then!</i>

295
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:21,069
{\an5}<i>(Hinata)</i>
<i>Until Naruto comes, we'll</i>
<i>do everything we can to</i>
<i>hold our position!</i>

<i>You're Kabuto Yakushi.</i>
<i>I see... You're still an</i>

297
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:09,457
{\an5}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>Yes. And right now, you're</i>
<i>on the same side as me, I</i>
<i>reanimated you to be my pawn.</i>

298

<i>(Hayate)</i>
<i>Just, what am I?</i>

299
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:15,196
{\an5}<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>Well, there's no doubt</i>
<i>that the body count has</i>
<i>increased by this point.</i>

300
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:18,132
<i>(Kabuto)</i>
<i>I guess I'll begin</i>
<i>the next stage...</i>

301
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,871
<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"Fade Into the Moonlight"</i>

302
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:24,273
<i>(Hayate)</i>
<i>This... is war?</i>
