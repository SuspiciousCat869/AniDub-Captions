1
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:10,047
{\an1}<i>[Foo]</i>
<i>It appears to be a jutsu,</i>

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,686
{\an1}<i>where a plant-like clone</i>
<i>with no chakra latches</i>
<i>onto a life form.</i>

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,222
{\an1}<i>And then feeds on</i>
<i>that host's chakra.</i>

4
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,226
{\an1}[Torune]
That's why even you
didn't notice it.

5
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:24,232
{\an5}[Foo]
Most likely a ninjutsu
by that Akatsuki at
the Summit.

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:25,702
And?

7
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,974
The other one?
The one who's
been following us?

8
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:32,211
{\an1}He's still tailing us,
and I think I know
who he is.

9
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:34,281
{\an1}the Hidden Mist
Byakugan wielder.

10
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,050
That one eh?

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,858
There.

12
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,435
{\an1}It'd be a stroke of luck
if he falls for this.

13
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:50,672
{\an1}[Torune]
Those traps of yours
are quite special.

14
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,173
{\an1}<i>It'll work.</i>

15
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:58,117
{\an1}Whether he survives or dies,
We must make sure to get
his right eye.

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,018
Yes, sir!

17
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,222
{\an1}Kisame Hoshigaki.

18
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,492
{\an1}Pleased to meet you
after the fact.

19
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:14,172
{\an1}Ki-sa-me... Ho-shi-ga-ki.

20
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:19,948
{\an1}You've got ink in your mouth.
So The rumors are true.
you really are an octopus boy.

21
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:24,055
{\an1}Now get ready, 'cause I'm gonna
make you weep! You sharky creep!

22
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,757
Wheeee!

23
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:33,567
{\an7}<i>A Tailed Beast cloak, with</i>
<i>only seven chakra tails!</i>

24
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:35,738
{\an7}<i>That means he's not</i>
<i>completely serious yet!</i>

25
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:36,972
{\an1}Hey, did you know?

26
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:38,442
Did I know what?

27
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,781
{\an1}In the wild, octopi eat sharks!

28
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,088
{\an1}That blade dodged him!

29
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,033
{\an1}Bee!

30
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,306
{\an7}<i>That blade siphoned off</i>
<i>Bee's chakra again,</i>
<i>and it's grown even bigger!</i>

31
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:07,751
{\an1}It appears that this time, the
shark shall devour the octopus.

32
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,792
{\an7}<i>That sword Sharkskin's</i>
<i>got a big appetite, and</i>
<i>it's a speed-eater.</i>

33
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,898
{\an7}<i>But it can only devour</i>
<i>six tails' worth of</i>
<i>chakra at a time, huh?</i>

34
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:26,645
{\an7}<i>If that's the situation with</i>
<i>this version, my next version</i>
<i>should do the trick.</i>

35
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,588
{\an1}This is the first time
Samehada has ever
grown this big before,

36
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:36,425
{\an1}and the delight it's feeling
isn't trivial, either.

37
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,129
What'll you do, Bee?

38
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:41,767
{\an1}<i>[Eight-Tails]</i>
<i>I'll help. Enter</i>
<i>Tailed Beast State!</i>

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,377
<i>[Mizukage]</i>
<i>Based on the marking</i>
<i>pattern here,</i>

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,447
Ao's that way.
Let's hurry
ahead quickly.

41
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:52,616
{\an1}Yes, ma'am!

42
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:37,636
{\an1}The Tailed Beast vs.
The Tailless Tailed Beast

43
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:40,740
{\an1}You need to watch over
my body soon, Torune.

44
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,602
{\an1}A booby-trap, huh?
It's one of Danzo's.

45
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:06,379
Uhh??

46
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,689
{\an7}<i>What?! Why am I</i>
<i>seeing my own body?!</i>

47
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,361
{\an1}'Cause I got you.

48
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:18,696
{\an8}<i>What's going on?</i>

49
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:21,434
{\an1}Mind Transfer
Puppet Curse Jutsu.

50
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:27,609
{\an7}<i>Damn it! That object curses</i>
<i>whoever attacks it, activating</i>
<i>a Mind Transfer Jutsu!</i>

51
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,350
{\an1}<i>That's right. Your consciousness</i>
<i>is sealed inside that puppet.</i>

52
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,386
{\an1}I'm in possession of your body.

53
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,925
{\an1}And now I will
retrieve what's ours.

54
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:47,671
{\an1}Of course, I
should have known.

55
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:55,083
{\an1}<i>Forget it. Only we Hidden Mist</i>
<i>ANBU, the Shinobi Tracking Unit,</i>
<i>can undo that Barrier Ninjutsu. </i>

56
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:58,955
{\an1}<i>The Mist will do anything to</i>
<i>protect this precious Byakugan.</i>

57
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,725
{\an1}<i>Don't think you'll</i>
<i>reclaim it easily.</i>

58
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:06,265
{\an1}So it automatically
activates when danger
threatens the eye, huh?

59
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,138
{\an1}That's quite an appropriate
jutsu for one of your kind.

60
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,508
{\an1}The Undertaker Squad.

61
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,645
{\an1}And I didn't think
it would be easy.

62
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:21,921
{\an1}Taking your eye means that I,
as the jutsu caster, will lose
my eye as well. You know that.

63
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:26,562
{\an1}That was Danzo's order?
What does he think his
subordinates are?

64
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,267
{\an1}<i>[Foo]</i>
<i>If the Mist's military power</i>
<i>is diminished because of it,</i>

65
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,837
{\an1}<i>losing one of my eyes is</i>
<i>a cheap price to pay.</i>

66
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,343
{\an1}<i>Although thanks to your barrier,</i>
<i>that's not going to happen.</i>

67
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,213
{\an1}But there are plenty
of other options.

68
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,721
{\an1}Enter Tailed Beast State, Bee!

69
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,392
{\an1}No way, fool, ya fool!

70
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:51,532
{\an1}Merge with you and each attack
will have too much power and
destroy the whole area.

71
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:54,335
{\an1}<i>[Bee]</i>
<i>Master Kin and Ponta are</i>
<i>here with us, don't forget.</i>

72
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:58,275
{\an7}<i>Plus, I finally managed to</i>
<i>sneak off under the radar.</i>

73
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:02,481
{\an7}<i>If I let you out, it's</i>
<i>like setting off a Killer</i>
<i>Bee is here beacon!</i>

74
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,785
{\an1}It's not like you to
make excuses, Bee!

75
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:09,559
{\an1}So what are you going to do?
Fight in Version 2 State?

76
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,628
{\an1}Yeah, man!

77
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:16,034
{\an1}Except, most of my chakra got
taken away, during those last
few exchanges with Kisame.

78
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,605
{\an1}so you're gonna have to lend
me some of yours, okay?

79
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,738
Yegh.

80
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,744
{\an1}<i>[Eight-Tails]</i>
<i>If it weren't for me, you'd have</i>
<i>already lost a long time ago.</i>

81

{\an1}A cheeky personality, but I'm
grateful for your hospitality!

82
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,554
Yeeeah!

83
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:30,589
Eh?

84
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,567
{\an1}Going into Tailed Beast State?

85
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:42,739
{\an1}No, this is Tailed
Beast's power that's
trapped in humanoid form.

86
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,509
{\an1}<i>It's Version 2 State!</i>

87
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,350
<i>[Bee]</i>
<i>Lariat! </i>

88
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:55,224
{\an7}<i>Samehada's so excited,</i>
<i>it's tripping over itself.</i>

89
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:59,364
{\an7}<i>The earlier chakra's</i>
<i>nothing compared to this</i>
<i>volume and quality.</i>

90
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:04,004
{\an7}<i>I'm amazed he can</i>
<i>control this much chakra</i>
<i>without losing his mind.</i>

91
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,380
{\an7}<i>Samehada can't devour</i>
<i>this much chakra!</i>

92
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:11,781
Yeeahh!

93
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:23,700
Yes, you did it!

94
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,437
{\an1}[Bee]
Can't believe I was reduced
to Version 1 State.

95
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,842
He's still alive!
Hurry up and
finish him off!

96
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,750
{\an1}Heh. Well, you've
certainly done it now.

97
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:42,927
{\an1}Huh?

98
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,330
What's going on?!

99
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:52,274
{\an1}The thing about me is,
the stronger my opponent is,
the stronger I become as well.

100
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,411
{\an1}I will not tire.

101
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,882
{\an1}I will not fall.

102
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:04,425
{\an4}That blade of his steals
his enemy's chakra and
transfers it to its master
in the form of stamina!

103
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:12,437
{\an1}That's right. And that's
why I have often been called
the Tailless Tailed Beast.

104
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:15,975
{\an1}Water Style! Super Exploding
Water Shock Wave!

105
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:23,854
{\an8}<i>What are you plotting?</i>

106
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,894
I'm simply going to jump
down now and behead you.

107
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:32,801
{\an1}If I can't remove your eye,
I'll just take your whole
head back to the Leaf.

108
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,302
{\an1}You'd kill yourself?!

109
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:39,476
{\an1}No. I'll undo the Mind
Transfer Jutsu just before
the blade hits your neck.

110
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:47,555
{\an4}<i>Either way, you'll die. And then</i>
<i>once I'm back in my own body,</i>
<i>I can simply retrace my steps</i>
<i>here to grab your head. </i>

111
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,895
{\an1}Fine. But you'd
better be careful.

112
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,831
{\an1}<i>Or else you'll fail.</i>

113
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,135
{\an1}What does that mean?

114
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:02,744
{\an1}If you get nervous and undo your
jutsu even a second early, I'll
be able to dodge that scythe!

115
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,648
If I'm not dead,

116
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,489
{\an1}<i>You're going to have a serious</i>
<i>fight on your hands when you</i>
<i>return to grab my head. </i>

117
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:11,790
Hmpf.

118
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,908
[panting]

119
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,582
Thanks, you
saved me.

120
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,050
{\an1}What's going on?

121
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:34,423
An enemy's jutsu.
I couldn't move
my body at all.

122
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:37,160
<i>If not for you,</i>
<i>I'd be dead.</i>

123
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,432
Whew. That was way too
close for comfort!

124
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,870
I'm sorry if I
made you worry.

125
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,840
{\an1}So you couldn't move?

126
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,644
{\an1}Must have been a
genjutsu or something.

127
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,649
{\an1}A type of Mind
Transfer Jutsu.

128
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:56,188
{\an1}<i>Your right eye. It looks</i>
<i>like the enemy was after</i>
<i>your Byakugan.</i>

129
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,859
{\an1}And they almost succeeded
in destroying it.

130
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,898
I'm sorry, but can
you untie me now?

131
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:04,701
{\an1}<i>Of course.</i>

132
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:08,006
{\an1}I'll also undo that jutsu
protecting your right eye.

133
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,076
{\an1}Great. Thank you.
That would help a lot.

134
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:12,345
Hm?

135
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,483
{\an1}I wonder what that is?

136
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:20,424
No! Don't!

137
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,361
{\an1}<i>He hasn't undone the</i>
<i>Mind Transfer Jutsu yet!</i>

138
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:31,205
{\an8}<i>She fell for it.</i>
<i>If she undoes the</i>
<i>jutsu, I couldn't</i>
