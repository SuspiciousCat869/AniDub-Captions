1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,471
{\an1}So how the hell am I
supposed to beat that guy?

2
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,672
{\an1}Well, that I don't know,
I'm afraid.

3
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:23,041
{\an1}Uh, hey, hold on, Octopops
trained here too, didn't he?
I can just go and ask him!

4
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:29,144
{\an1}No. he's never going to tell
me. Not with his attitude.

5
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:30,712
Perhaps...

6
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,947
{\an7}<i>I wonder if Octopops</i>
<i>had a dark side too?</i>

7
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:38,781
Hey, Motoi?

8
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:43,717
Can you help me out?
Can you tell me more
about Octopops?

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,218
Like, how he grew up,
and what his
personality is like.

10
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,820
{\an1}Maybe I can get a few
hints from all that stuff.

11
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:55,289
{\an1}Then I can figure out what's
different between us and why he
can control his Tailed Best!

12
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,025
{\an1}If you're also a Jinchuriki,
you know what it's like to
live with that burden.

13
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,726
{\an1}Tell me, isn't that true?

14
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:05,760
{\an1}Yeah, I do know
all about it.

15
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:09,762
{\an1}And he should be able
to understand what it's
been like for me, too!

16
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:15,198
{\an1}To be honest, I don't
normally like to prattle
on about other people.

17
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:21,034
But Naruto, you're
also a Jinchuriki just
like Master Bee is.

18
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,502
{\an1}And controlling the Nine Tails
will lead to world peace.

19
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:27,703
{\an1}I'll do it.

20
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:29,104
Ah! Thank you!

21
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:32,139
{\an1}<i>Now, I told you earlier,</i>

22
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:37,774
{\an1}<i>As a fellow Jinchuriki,</i>
<i>you know what it's like</i>
<i>to live with that burden.</i>

23
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,676
{\an1}As you can well imagine.

24
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:47,678
Incredible power breeds
dread and ill feelings.

25
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,914
{\an1}<i>Master Bee was long feared and</i>
<i>resented by the other villagers.</i>

26
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:59,382
{\an1}<i>But he never got depressed or</i>
<i>complained, not even once.</i>

27
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:03,618
{\an1}<i>He was always cheerful,</i>
<i>continuously working</i>
<i>the people around him.</i>

28
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:09,421
{\an1}<i>Instead of feeling shame</i>
<i>at being a Jinchuriki,</i>
<i>he turned it into a positive.</i>

29
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:15,791
{\an1}<i>It seemed to me that he decided</i>
<i>to take pride in himself and</i>
<i>even added self-expression.</i>

30
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:16,290
Yo!

31
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:21,193
{\an1}And the main reason that
he was able to take pride
in being a Jinchuriki,

32
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,594
{\an1}<i>Was probably,</i>

33
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,062
{\an1}<i>thanks to his older brother,</i>
<i>the Raikage.</i>

34
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:31,497
{\an1}For ages now,
to prevent betrayal,

35
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:39,135
{\an4}Jinchuriki have almost always
been selected from blood
relations of the Five Kage,
like siblings or spouses.

36
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:44,170
{\an1}A Jinchuriki is both an ultimate
power to protect the Kage,

37
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,238
{\an1}And a symbol of the
Kage's ultimate strength.

38
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:54,207
{\an1}<i>I believe Master Bee strove</i>
<i>diligently to become a worthy</i>
<i>Jinchuriki for Lord Raikage.</i>

39
00:02:55,908 --> 00:03:00,276
{\an1}<i>It is said that he mastered</i>
<i>this Waterfall of Truth</i>
<i>challenge in no time at all.</i>

40
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,544
{\an1}I have deep respect,

41
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:06,379
{\an1}for the kind of
person Master Bee is.

42
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:10,313
{\an1}In my eyes,
he is a true hero.

43
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,182
{\an1}To be such a
well-loved Jinchuriki,

44
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:18,152
{\an1}Master Bee must be
quite a great man.
And you must be, too.

45
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:19,551
{\an1}Ah...

46
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,987
Wait, that's it!
I've got it!

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,687
You can go ask Ocotopops
for training hints on my
behalf, Motoi!

48
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,022
Would you please
do that for me?

49
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,489
{\an1}I'm sorry.
I can't.

50
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:32,290
Aaagh!
Come on!
Why not?!

51
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,858
{\an1}I am not worthy of
such an errand.

52
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:37,692
Huh?

53
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,494
{\an1}Because... I once tried
to kill Master Bee!

54
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:43,762
[gasp]

55
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:30,842
"Killer Bee and Motoi"

56
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,410
But why?! You said
that you respected
Octopops! Just now!

57
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,479
I'm sure there's
some explanation.

58
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,115
{\an1}So, what was it, tell us?!

59
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,382
{\an1}It's time I confessed.

60
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,320
{\an1}Since you're a Jinchuriki
too, I think it's okay to
tell you about that incident.

61
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,154
{\an1}Incident?
What do you mean?

62
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:02,189
{\an1}It all took place
30 years ago.

63
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:09,092
[roar]

64
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:21,297
{\an1}<i>Back then, the Jinchuriki</i>
<i>that contained the Eight Tails,</i>

65
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:24,765
{\an1}<i>wasn't strong enough</i>
<i>to completely control</i>
<i>the Tailed Beast.</i>

66
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:30,701
{\an1}<i>The Eight Tails would get</i>
<i>loose, rampage, and wreak</i>
<i>havoc on the Hidden Cloud.</i>

67
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:37,503
{\an4}Each time, the previous
Raikage-Lord Third-would
stop the Eight Tails
with his elite force.

68
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:41,139
Listen! I need you
to hold the Eight
Tails still!

69
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:44,908
{\an1}And while you're doing that,
I'll imprison him in the
Sealing Urn.

70
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,175
{\an1}Understood.

71
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,142
Okay! Get to it.

{\an1}We can't give up!

There. Got him.

[big roar]

{\an1}Back off, accursed humans!

84
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,013
Yaaahh!

{\an1}You lost your father

Ha ha ha!

105
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:56,857
Ha ha!

106
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:00,960
Ah?!

107
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:16,299
{\an4}<i>The Jinchuriki responsible</i>
<i>for my father's death,</i>
<i>died when the Eight Tails</i>
<i>was extracted and sealed.</i>

108
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,633
{\an1}<i>That was the</i>

109
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,782

<i>Eight Tails' Jinchuriki.</i>

110
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,750
{\an1}Why, then?
Why try to
kill Master Bee?

111
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,387
{\an1}I assumed that it
wasn't possible to
control the Eight Tails.

112
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:08,255
{\an1}<i>I believed that there</i>

{\an1}<i>I was only a child...</i>

{\an1}<i>But all I could think</i>
<i>about was getting revenge.</i>

116
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:05,247
{\an4}Got a song in my heart
that's gotta come out,

{\an1}ain't no doubt the rhymes I

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,884
{\an1}Ain't nothing gonna keep me down

119
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,952
{\an1}<i>Master Bee...</i>
<i>was always laughing.</i>

120
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:26,189
{\an1}<i>I started hating him more</i>
<i>and more because it seemed</i>
<i>like he didn't care at all.</i>

121
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,226
{\an1}My hatred of Eight Tails shifted
to Master Bee, his Jinchuriki.

122
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,227
I thought...

123
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,229
{\an1}if I killed Master Bee,
the Eight Tails would also die.

124
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,371
Hm?

Ha ha!

127
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,079
{\an1}So, I attacked Master Bee
from behind.

128
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,282
{\an1}But when I failed, I became
terrified and ran away.

129
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:31,850
{\an1}I had masked my face,
but it was possible that
Master Bee recognized me.

130
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:35,752
{\an1}As a result,
I just stopped
talking to him.

131
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,922
{\an1}But after all that,
how did you come to
respect Master Bee, then?

132
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,656
{\an1}My hatred didn't
disappear overnight.

133
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,826
{\an1}<i>For a long time, I continued</i>
<i>to follow Master Bee and</i>
<i>keep an eye on him.</i>

134
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,361
{\an1}But, I wasn't the only one.

[chuckle]

143
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,713
{\an1}Oh, yeah? You think you're bad?
That's far from the worst
I've ever had.

144
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:42,881
{\an1}Yo, yo, check it, yo!
I ain't gonna get mad,
I'll just keep being glad.

145
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,316
{\an1}C'mon, c'mon, yo!

146
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,950
Yo! Hey, yo!

147
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:57,122
{\an1}<i>Almost anyone else would have</i>
<i>gone insane. And I realized,</i>

148
00:14:57,822 --> 00:15:00,789
{\an1}<i>Master Bee's suffering was</i>
<i>even greater than mine.</i>

149
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:03,623
Why tell us this?

150
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,460
Well, truth be told,
I'd rather have
Master Bee hear it.

151
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:12,894
{\an1}But the reason that I'm
telling Naruto this,

152
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,062
is that he's a
fellow Jinchuriki.

153
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:15,963
Hm.

154
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,865
{\an1}And yes, I am well aware
that I ought to tell Master Bee
the truth someday.

155
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,700
{\an1}Or this isn't a true confession.

156
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,403
{\an7}<i>[Dark Naruto]</i>
<i>Heh heh! </i>
<i>How convenient for him.</i>

158
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:33,804
{\an1}Heh heh!

159
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:35,604
{\an3}Mm.

160
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,307
{\an1}Naruto, where are you going?

161
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,608
I just want to be
alone for a while.

162
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:03,917
{\an1}It's that boy!

163
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,085
I told you to stay
away from him!

164
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:07,352
{\an1}Go away!!

165
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,920
[cheering]

166
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,921
{\an1}You're a hero, Naruto!

167
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:16,590
Ha ha ha!
Thank you, Naruto!

168
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,726
{\an4}To all of the people in
my village, I was a relic
of the past that they
wished would disappear.

169

{\an4}<i>[Temari]</i>
<i>Gaara's the Kazekage, remember?</i>

{\an7}<i>A lot of people</i>

<i>He earned that from them.</i>

172
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:48,936
{\an7}<i>And Gaara's become Kazekage.</i>

173

{\an4}Why didn't you give them
your autograph at Ichiraku?

176
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:06,211
{\an1}Can't blame you, you know.
I mean, after all, they came
kissing up to you like that.

177
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:11,380
{\an1}They were completely
disgusting, weren't they?

178
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:13,747
Who the hell are you?

179
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:16,149
{\an1}Don't you remember?

180
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,551
{\an1}Everyone in the village used
to treat us like outcasts,
and then they try to pull that?

181
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,387
{\an1}I am the real you. The one that
exists in your heart, I am you.

182
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:32,222
{\an8}<i>The real me.</i>
<i>I never gave it</i>

183

00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:44,528
{\an7}<i>It's true. I'm still not</i>

185
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,600
Where'd Naruto
run off to?

186
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,368
Wait, you don't
think that...

187
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:02,701
{\an1}This is a secret location.
An enemy couldn't possibly--

<i>[Motoi]</i>
<i>Yaaagh!</i>

189
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:06,304
{\an1}Huh? That sounded
just like old man Motoi!

190
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,974
Augh! Rrgh!

191
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,142
Huh? No! Motoi!

192
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,511
{\an1}Naruto! Use Formation C!

193
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:25,445
{\an1}Why?! Why's he doing this?

194
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,346
{\an1}Naruto! Come on! Focus!

195
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,314
{\an1}Stop, Octopops!
Just stop it!

196
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:36,217
{\an1}Listen to me, okay?
Motoi really does trust you!
And he cares about you!

197
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,253
That's the squid!
It isn't an
octopus at all!

198
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,254
{\an1}What? A squid? Are you sure?

199
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,855
{\an1}1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

200
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:51,990
{\an1}You don't have to count!
An octopus's head is round!
A squid's pointy!

201
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:53,191
Oh. Right.

202
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,793
{\an1}I thought 'cause Motoi confessed
what he tried to do, Octopops
got mad and then attacked him.

203
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,028
{\an5}We got worried about
you, and when we went
to go look for you,
this guy attacked us!

204
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:06,564
{\an1}Okay, I got it.
This is the squid
from before!

205
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:08,498
Ahg! Gaah!

206
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,265
{\an1}Naruto! Fight first,
talk later, okay?

207
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,132
Yeah, gotcha.

208
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,900
{\an1}Wood Style!
Silent Strangle Jutsu!

209
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,638
{\an1}Hang on, old man Motoi!
We're coming to get you!

210

Nice one, Octopops!

{\an1}Bee, why did you save me?

218
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:05,956
Hm?

219
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:10,525
{\an1}You knew, didn't
you, Master Bee?
You knew all along.

220
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,295
{\an1}<i>That I tried... to kill you.</i>

221

{\an1}Hm. Y'know, I don't
remember that happening.

[gasp]

224
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:34,968
{\an1}All that I do remember is...

225
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,604
{\an1}<i>Motoi and me, Motoi and me.</i>

226
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:42,138
{\an1}<i>Motoi and me spending time</i>

00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:51,409
{\an1}The two of us smiling,

{\an1}<i>The times Motoi</i>
