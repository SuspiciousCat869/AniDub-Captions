1
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:20,276
-The things this boy can do.

2
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,017
I must admit, he's
piqued my interest.

3
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:00,258
-Damn it.

4
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,463
[theme music]

5
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,902
-Don't tell me.

6
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,507
The fourth tail's emerged.

7
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,877
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
The fourth tail?

8
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,952
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
The chakra that's

9
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,257
leaking out seeks stability.

10
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:14,762
It's trying to assume the
complete form of the Nine

11
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,766
Tails.

12
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,939
This is not the same
chakra as before.

13
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,277
It's more intense.

14
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,714
Far more malevolent.

15
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:30,294
It's using Naruto's
body as a medium,

16
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:33,868
but it's just like a
miniature Nine Tails.

17
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:49,625
The force of that shockwave
from just a single of his hand.

18
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:51,630
Damn it!

19
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,968
SAI (VOICEOVER): I
can't get any closer.

20
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,477
-That was Naruto's attack?

21
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,831
-Yes, it was.

22
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,550
-Hm.

23
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,844
-Captain Yamato.

24
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:06,551
Is there something you're
not telling me about Naruto?

25
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:09,892
There is, isn't there?

26
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:11,829
Tell me what's happened to him.

27
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:21,115
-Sakura.

28
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,654
No matter what
happens, don't worry.

29
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:30,468
It was for this,
exactly for this reason,

30
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:36,748
that my superiors chose
me to lead this team.

31
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,673
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): For to be
subjected to that much chakra

32
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:53,649
and still be-- How is
he still able to move?

33
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:45,214
-So, I take it Sasori won't
be coming after all, huh?

34
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:02,465
-Kabuto.

35
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,950
-So, I take it Sasori won't
be coming after all, huh?

36
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,162
It's strange.

37
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,132
Sasori was the only
person who knew

38
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,270
that I would be here today.

39
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:33,247
Not even his fellow Akatsuki
were privy to that information.

40
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:37,022
And yet you're here, Leaf ninja.

41
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,796
I can't imagine Sasori being
forced to reveal the secret,

42
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,936
even under torture,
which makes me think

43
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:47,076
he must have told you willingly.

44
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,715
I suspect he was hoping
that, by coming here,

45
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,953
you would gather enough
information about Lord

46
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:56,061
Orochimaru to enable you to
take him down once and for all.

47
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:59,903
It seems Orochimaru has turned
out to be quite a handful, even

48
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:02,876
for the Akatsuki.

49
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:07,852
I must say, your disguise
earlier was perfect.

50
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,464
Lord Sasori.

51
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:15,702
If you hadn't pulled
out that kunai,

52
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:20,144
I wouldn't have gotten
away from him in time.

53
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,418
-After all, you're the one
who sent this kid to me,

54
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,455
and he's come in very handy.

55
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,386
-You wouldn't have been
able to pull that off,

56
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,927
unless you had met
Sasori personally,

57
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,931
and that's the
only occasion I can

58
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:51,009
think of when he could have
told you about our rendezvous.

59
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:55,819
-Go the the Tenchi Bridge in
the Village Hidden in the Grass,

60
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:58,524
10 days from now at noon.

61
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:03,167
One of Orochimaru's henchmen
is working for me as a spy,

62
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:06,407
and that's where I'm supposed
to rendezvous with him.

63
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,881
However, I don't think I--

64
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:16,862
KABUTO: There's no way that
Sasori could've been aware

65
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:19,902
that the jutsu placed
on me had worn off,

66
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:24,044
so for him to have divulged such
sensitive intelligence to you,

67
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,985
it means Sasori was
acknowledging your power.

68
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:31,392
Sasori bore a grudge
against Orochimaru.

69
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,196
He always said he
would be the one

70
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:36,837
to personally bring
Orochimaru down.

71
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,943
The fact that Sasori ended
up involving all of you

72
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,449
in this matter
means that he must

73
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:46,557
need you to do the job for him.

74
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,929
Or, to put it another way.

75
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:52,068
He's either been captured
or he's no longer alive.

76
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,437
-Unfortunately, it's the latter.

77
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:30,382
-That's wonderful news.

78
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:04,518
-What's this?

79
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,904
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): That's--

80
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,308
SAI (VOICEOVER): Is that chakra?

81
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,431
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
That is going to be trouble.

82
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:59,967
One can't be on the receiving
end of that much concentrated

83
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,471
chakra and survive.

84
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,324
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

85
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:13,294
What are you doing?

86
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,691
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): How
ever do you plan on fighting me,

87
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:47,065
weighed down with
such dense chakra?

88
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:50,071
[wicked laughter]

89
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:08,041
So, that's his plan.

90
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,491
-Triple Rashomon.

91
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,728
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): This
battle's too intense.

92
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:06,797
I can't find a way in.

93
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,803
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen!

94
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:27,632
-What on Earth just happened?

95
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:32,241
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): What we
saw just then was definitely

96
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,312
Lord Orochimaru's
Triple Rashomon.

97
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:43,665
Destroyed in the
blink of an eye.

98
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:49,376
Never imagined
would be like this.

99
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:08,775
-He's closer to becoming the
Nine Tails than ever before.

100
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:20,740
-Naruto.

101
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,590
[theme music]

102
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,014
KABUTO: These are no longer
ninja fighting each other,

103
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,149
but monsters.

104
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:07,888
Is this how he hopes
to save Sasuke?

105
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:09,959
By turning himself into that?

106
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:11,095
SAURA: Naruto.

107
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,431
-The boy is gone.

108
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,967
Only the monster remains.

109
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,473
What a pitiful child.

110
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:17,475
SAKURA: That's enough.

111
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:18,845
Naruto!

112
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,815
Please, don't do this!

113
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,051
YAMATO: No, Sakura!

114
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:23,020
Stay away from him.

115
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:23,855
SAKURA: I'll do it.

116
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,859
I'll rescue Sasuke!

117
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:26,994
YAMATO: Next time.

118
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,798
Sakura's Tears.

119
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,970
[theme music]

120
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,136
-Today we'll be examining
the famed Nine Tailed fox.

121
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:51,446
The Nine Tail is known for its
ferociously destructive nature.

122
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,616
Now that its fate is
inextricably linked

123
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,959
with Narutos, it has no choice
but to render him assistance.

124
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:00,732
But while they have a symbiotic
relationship for the moment,

125
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:03,002
there's little doubt
the Nine Tail is only

126
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:06,844
waiting for the chance to
take over Naruto completely.

127
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,015
By calling on the
Nine Tail within him,

128
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:12,990
Naruto is able to exert
incredible destructive power.

129
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:17,165
However, it seems that every
time he unleashes this power,

130
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,139
Naruto inflicts damage
on his own body.

131
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,643
Just as Master
Jiraiya suspected,

132
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:26,886
the Fourth Hokage's seal
formula may be weakening.

133
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,027
As one who inherited The First
Hokage's DNA and his jutsu,

134
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,499
I'll help in any way
that I can, of course.

135
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,640
But if it turns out
to be a disaster,

136
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,543
don't hold me responsible.
