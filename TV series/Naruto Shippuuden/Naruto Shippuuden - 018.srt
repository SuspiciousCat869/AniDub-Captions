-And how do we do that?

-Before we can even think
about breaking through,

69
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,415
we should know what
kind of barrier it is.

are fastened around the

The tags are in five
different places.

87
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,197
But they have to be taken
down at the exact same moment.

88
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,401
-So we'd have to remove
them simultaneously?

-Right.

90
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,438
The barrier won't budge unless
all five tags are pulled off

91
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,240
simultaneously.

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,642
It's a tall order.

93
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,146
That's only one tag.

94
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,348

four more out there.

95
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:35,956
-All right, then.

500 meters northeast of us.

on a tree trunk

meters south-southeast.

The third you'll don't find 650
meters northwest, on a cliff.

108
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,542
And the last one is in the
woods, less than 800 meters

That's four.

111

-If that's the case, each one
of them is pretty far apart.

112
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,385
How will we signal each other?

113
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,520
-I think I can handle that.

114
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,723
We should just be
in range for these.

115
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,058
They're wireless radios.

116
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,527
-Whoa, that's amazing.

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,162
-Good thinking.

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:49,662
-Yes.

119
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,601
-Ha!

120
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,602
OK.

121
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,203
So we'll stay in
constant communication,

122
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,305
and follow Neji's
directions to the tags.

123
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,846
-Well, shouldn't we get
this show on the road?

124

We got company
outside to deal with.

Hm.

we'll be leaving, too.

Tell him.

in and barks first.

characteristics other

154
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,224
than barking, hmm?

155

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,657
Right.

162
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:50,109
-OK, let's find these
tags, and get rid of them.

163
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,511
Team Guy is the
faster team, so we'll

be the ones to
handle this mission.

northwest into the woods.

00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,290
-Yes, you got it.

168
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,160
GUY: The northeast boulder
is all yours, Neji.

169
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:10,763
-I can handle that.

170
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,798
-Tenten, you'll get
the south-southeast.

171
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:13,732
-Right.

172
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,033
No problem.

173
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,536
-And I'll take care of the
one on the northwest cliff.

174
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,438
That's the one in the
trickiest location,

175
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,141
and should be the
hardest to eliminate.

176
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,776
KAKASHI: What's the frequency?

177
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,711
-174.

178
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,478
-Copy that.

179
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,818
-Testing, do you read me?

-Lee, your microphone's
up too loud.

Sorry, guys.

are good to go.

-All right.

00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:10,556
Team Guy.

Hmm!

Hmm!

the power of youth!

-Atta!

-Scatter!

00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,200
-Oh man.

216
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,668
That was so cool.

217
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,203
Hey, we should do it, too.

218
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,071
I would rather die.

219
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,539
-Me too.

220
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,576
-Not a chance.

221
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,679
-Well, guess it's about
time for me to shove off.

222
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,781
There's no real reason
I should stick around.

223
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:44,983
I'd just be getting in the way.

224
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,151
-Thanks, Pakkun.

225
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:46,985
Good work.

226
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,853
-All right, then.

227
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:48,987
See you guys later.

228
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:03,702
-The rest is up to you two.

229
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:04,603
-Not a problem.

230
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,043
-I'll be waiting
for your report.

231
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,966
-Now let's recap the mission.

232
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,836
The members of Team Guy are to
find their tags, and stand by.

233
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,205
After all four have
reached their positions,

234
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:42,507
we'll remove the scrolls
together on my signal.

235
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,608
Got that?

236
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,977
-Got it.

237
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,679
GUY: Team Kakashi will take
out theirs at the same moment.

238
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:52,017
And just like that, will
break the five seal barrier.

239
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,686
-And the moment
the barrier's gone,

240
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,955
Sakura will destroy the
boulder at the entrance.

241
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,197
That will be our signal to
charge inside, and rescue

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:05,697
Gaara.

243
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,401
-(THINKING) Gaara!

244
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,714
-What's taking them.

245
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,216
Hmm.

246
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,652
I wish they would just
hurry up and get in here.

247
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,153
Hmm.

248
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:36,695
Sasori, what's the
matter, my man?

249
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:39,998
I thought you didn't
like to be kept waiting?

250
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,733
Hm.

251
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,301
-Yes.

252
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,703
I hate it.

253
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:54,279
-(THINKING) Sasori, it's absurd.

254
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:59,117
I never imagined a day
like this could come.

255
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,352
-This is Neji.

256
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,319
Ready, and in position.

257
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,925
GUY: I found my tag as well.

258
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,693
I'm almost to it.

259
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,366
-Got mine too.

260
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,068
LEE (ON RADIO): N-Neji?

261
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,070
-I understand, Lee.

00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:18,570
Byakugan!

263
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,481
It's just south of you.

264
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,416
A little further.

265
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:31,917
There.

266
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,585
Look up.

267
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,154
-OK, I have it.

268
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,125
Lee to Guy Sensei, in position.

269
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:43,462
-Well, Kakashi,
you guys all set?

270
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,362
-Ready when you are.

271
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,469
We'll make our assault
using the button hook entry.

272
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,007
-Sounds like a plan to me.

273
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,475
-Yeah.

274
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,415
-All right, everyone.

275
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,585
Get ready to remove the
tags on the count of three.

276
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,622
On my mark, one, two, three!

277
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,862
-Now, Sakura!

278

-Finally.

Well then, which one of you
would be the jinchuriki?

-You!

You bastards!

294
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:10,575
I'll kill the both of you!

295
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,946
-The one who bursts
in, and starts barking.

296
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,816
That would be him, then.

297
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,086
-Sasori, my man, I
think you're correct.

298
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,586

take a normal scroll you

301
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,352
can find anywhere.

302
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,554
And when I count to three,
a huge shuriken appears.

-Hey, you can't steal
somebody's abilities.

304

NARUTO: Pipe down.

305
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,159
I'm practicing
for a talent show.

306
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:09,493
SAKURA: What did you say?

307
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,262
LADY CHIYO: Enough with
this ridiculous bickering.

308
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,163
Listen.

309
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,031
I'll show you both
my best skill.

310
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,667
Now watch these wonderful
kunai knives in midair.

311
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,170
SAKURA: Oh, whoa, the
kunai knives are floating.

312
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,038
LADY CHIYO: I can
teach you for 300 ryo.

313
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:23,941
NARUTO: I can't do it without
the puppet master Jutsu anyway.

314
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,243
Next time, traps activate.

-What is it?

319
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,429
-The guy you're teamed
up with, Itachi,

320
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,031
what can you tell me about him?

321
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,899
-Well, let me see.

322
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,736
Itachi was born into
the Uchiha clan.

323
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,038
He's good with fire style Jutsu.

324
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:58,542
But his scariest technique by
far is the Mangekyo Sheringan.

325
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,044
-Oh, what's that?

326
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:03,247
-The ultimate visual Jutsu,
combining powerful hypnosis

327
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,715
and penetrating sight.

328
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,717
It allows him to
use advanced Jutsu

329
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,953
like Amaterasu and Tsyukuyomi.

330
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:13,224
-Sounds like he's got himself
a pretty artistic Jutsu.

331
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,993
-Now I've got a
question for you.

332
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,429
Can you pick out which
Sheringan is Itachi's?

333
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,203
The answer is A.

00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,471
-Pretty handsome guy.

335
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,374
And he seems quite
popular, unlike you.

336
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,409
-Hmm?

337
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,077
Something the matter?

338
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,546
-I'm just a freakshow, aren't I?

339
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,614
-Yikes.

340
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:39,150
That bothered you
more than I thought.
