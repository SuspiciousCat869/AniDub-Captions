1
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:13,075
-It's not fair, sensei.

2
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:16,059
The Rasengan was supposed to
be my own secret technique,

3
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:18,071
but you're doing it
better than I can.

4
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:20,214
After all I've done,
putting in all that time

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,028
with an old geezer and his
crazy ideas of training.

6
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:25,060
-Listen.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,241
We're just getting to
the main point here.

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,302
-Yeah, look at that.

9
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:31,217
You could do it with one
hand, like it was nothing.

10
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,242
I can barely spin it into shape
using two of my shadow clones.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,055
I'm starting to think
this is too much trouble.

12
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:39,216
I mean, what's the point?

13
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:41,179
Maybe If I try this.

14
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,331
-I think we'll just wait for
him to calm down a little.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,232
-Naruto, I didn't
do the Rasengan

16
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:03,145
just because I
wanted to show off.

17
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:04,096
-Huh.

18
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,317
Well, you could have fooled me.

19
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:08,331
-As I said, the Rasengan is
just an example of change

20
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,343
in chakra form,
taken to an extreme.

21
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,375
-Wh-- change in chakra form?

22
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,258
-What we're shooting
for is a jutsu

23
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:17,111
that combines change
in chakra form

24
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,093
with change in chakra nature.

25
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:23,188
For example, the Chidori.

26
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,201
-There you go,
showing off again.

27
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,184
[sigh]

28
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:31,258
This jutsu requires more of me
than just changing my chakra

29
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:33,210
nature to lightning.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,312
I have to change my
chakra form, as well,

31
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:39,367
so that I can discharge it, and
set its range and power level.

32
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:40,358
-Listen up.

33
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,122
If you can add a
change in chakra form,

34
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:45,224
on top of the change
in chakra nature,

35
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:48,358
you'll increase your attack
strength exponentially.

36
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:51,141
-But shinobi who can
achieve both these things

37
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:54,415
simultaneously are
a rare breed indeed.

38
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:57,178
-Pat yourself on the
back why don't you?

39
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:59,411
-Thanks to our exercises,
you've just mastered a change

40
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,383
in your chakra nature to wind.

41
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:05,358
And you already have a
change in chakra form jutsu.

42
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,309
[gasp]

43
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,390
-Rasengan.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,261
-That's right.

45
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,217
Hold on a second.

46
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:15,340
Does that mean-- are
you saying I'm already

47
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,212
able to do both of them?

48
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,303
-Well, yes.

49
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:19,425
Basically.

50
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:21,377
[laughter]

51
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,169
-All right.

52
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,360
So at this rate,
I'll be churning out

53
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,423
new jutsu in no time.

54
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,374
Yes!

55
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,405
Why didn't you say so before?

56
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,341
Guess this whole thing is
going to be a piece of cake

57
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,412
after all.

58
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,473
[chuckle]

59
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,466
-If that really were
the case, I wouldn't

60
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:39,268
have had to develop the Chidori.

61
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:50,201
I was never able to combine
the Ransengan's change in form

62
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,213
with the change in chakra
nature to lightning.

63
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,210
-Combining a change in nature
with the change in form

64
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,253
takes incredible skill.

65
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,245
Or I should say, it
takes a great deal

66
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,338
of natural skill and intuition.

67
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:07,511
-And I'm not the only
one who failed at it.

68
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,405
Even my teacher, the one
who invented this jutsu,

69
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:13,358
failed as well.

70
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,300
-What?

71
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,462
-That's right.

72
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,425
Even the fourth hokage
couldn't master it.

73
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:28,246
The fourth hokage developed and
honed the change in chakra form

74
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:29,417
to its highest degree.

75
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,339
The result being the Ransengan.

76
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,400
Just mastering a change in
form has an A-rank level

77
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,421
of difficulty.

78
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:44,285
But I can still
manage to copy it.

79
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:48,319
The problem comes,
however, in the next step.

80
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,292
From the moment he
invented the Ransengan,

81
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,374
it was always the fourth
hokage's intention

82
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:56,359
to eventually add his own
change in nature to it.

83
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,291
-Hold on.

84
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,394
Are you saying
that the Ransengan

85
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,576
is an incomplete jutsu?

86
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,500
-It is true, in a way.

87
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,384
-The jutsu we're aiming for has
an S-rank level of difficulty.

88
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:13,469
Possibly even beyond that.

89
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,465
For all we know, it might
even be unachievable.

90
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:22,370
So, from here on, there's
nothing you can be taught.

91
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,393
You have to discover
it yourself.

92
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:29,338
Now, do you understand why I'm
telling you all this, Naruto?

93
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,466
-It's because I truly
believe that you

94
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,600
are the only shinobi who can
surpass the fourth hokage.

95
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,619
-Well, enough talk for now.

96
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,523
We'll rest a little more
before we start again.

97
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,457
-You handled him perfectly.

98
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:06,532
You are quite the sweet
talker , aren't you?

99
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,383
-No.

100
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,529
No.

101
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,381
I believe he can do it.

102
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,666
-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

A message from Team Asuma.

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,801
[music playing]

107
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,732
-It seems that the two
akatsuki on their way

108
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:05,783
to a collection office.

109
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,711
-The closest collection
office I can think of

110
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:16,766
is-- we're nearly there.

111
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,659
INO (VOICEOVER):
At any moment, we

112
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,602
could be fighting the akatsuki.

113
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,614
-Hey, don't worry about it, Ino.

114
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:24,876
There's nothing to
fear as long as we

115
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:27,669
do just what Asuma
sensei taught us.

116
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:33,876
Pretty impressive, huh?

117
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:35,699
I didn't just make it up.

118
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,643
It's something Shikamaru told me
once when we were on a mission.

119
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,453
-Oh, Choji.

120
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,682
-Seriously, it's not
like we're on our own.

121
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,744
Shikamaru's out on
their trail, too.

122
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:58,746
-Hey, Asuma sensei.

123
00:08:58,756 --> 00:08:59,657
-Hmm?

124
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,778
-I was just wondering.

125
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,772
What kind of relationship did
you have with this Chiriku guy?

126
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,744
-What makes you ask that?

127
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,837
-It's been two days since
your last cigarette.

128
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,740
When a chain smoker like you
suddenly kicks the habit,

129
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,737
cold turkey, well, to me
that means something's up.

130
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,880
-Very observant.

131
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,783
If the likes of you can
read me that easily,

132
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,845
I must be getting soft.

133
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,908
When you've played enough
shogi with someone,

134
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:29,672
you learn how to read
them like a book.

135
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:30,884
In fact, I haven't
seen you like this

136
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,736
since the death of
the third hokage.

137
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,967
-As you may know,
Chiriku and I were once

138
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:46,803
part of the Guardian
Shinobi 12 together.

139
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:50,767
You see, in a way,
we were, well,

140
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:51,919
we were kind of
like you and Choji.

141
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,949
SHIKAMARU: Knowing
you, sensei, you

142
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,763
won't go without
a smoke for long.

143
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,865
ASUMA: Oh, you
don't think so, huh?

144
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:09,800
Well, yeah.

145
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,905
Perhaps that's been true
in the past, I guess.

146
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:17,919
Anyway, while I appreciate
your concern, Shikamaru,

147
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:21,964
I didn't quit because
of Chiriku's death.

148
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:24,006
Besides, these akatsuki
were strong enough

149
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,810
to defeat Chiriku.

150
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,912
Their abilities
must be formidable.

151
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,855
So don't let your guard down.

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,041
-OK.

153
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,945
Now each team of two will form
the Ransengan at the same time.

154
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,838
Try incorporating the Wind
change in chakra nature

155
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:51,919
into it.

156
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,062
I know it's easy for me
to say, but at this stage,

157
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:56,845
there's really nothing
more I can tell you.

158
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:00,009
This is something you'll have
to master on your own Naruto.

It takes so much focus just
to make the Ransengen to begin

with, then to have to add
a change in nature, too.
