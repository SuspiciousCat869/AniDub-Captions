149
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:31,340
{\an1}I could tie your hair up with
this if you want!

150
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:34,345
{\an1}Huh?! You wanna tie up my hair?!

Don't you?

161
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:22,720
{\an7}<i>You've got a good sense of</i>

162
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:29,663
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) I, um... Well, I</i>

163
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:33,435
{\an7}Her name is Ino Yamanaka, and
she's this totally incredible
person!

164
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:37,075
{\an7}She's cute, strong, fashionable,
and really kind, too!

00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,882
<i>Wow... I see...</i>

166
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,319
{\an1}You made a friend, Sakura?

(Crying)

168
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:51,563
{\an7}Well, if she's cute like you
say, then I would love to meet
her!

169
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,433
{\an8}<i>Oh, dear...</i>

170
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:56,203
{\an7}...why would you say someting
like that?!

171
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:59,042
{\an7}I'm really happy for you,
Sakura.

172
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:02,347
{\an7}You have to make sure that you
cherish your friends.

173
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,755
{\an7}Always remember, in this life,
friends are your most precious
assets.

174
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:09,758
Okay!

175
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,529
{\an1}Ino even gave me this ribbon in
my hair!

176
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:18,005
{\an1}<i>And it looks great on you! You</i>

<i>mother was when she was young.</i>

177
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,975
{\an7}Oh dear, don't embarass me! Did
you actually say that I'm cute?!

00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,981
{\an8}<i>(Laughing)</i>

179

184
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:45,146
{\an1}<i>You did all this by yourself?!</i>

185
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,516
{\an1}<i>I(Sakura) t's nothing, really!</i>

186

{\an1}<i>I mean... I'm not that</i>

187
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:55,929
Although...

188
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:57,799
{\an1}Do you see this cosmos flower?

189
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:04,242

{\an7}So the elememts of the
arrangement don't clash.

191
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,886
{\an7}Hold on. Let me try something,
okay?

192
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:18,563
{\an1}<i>Like... this... So.. what do you</i>

193
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,133
You know...

194
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,234
{\an1}...there's this boy...

195
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,673
{\an1}...and, well, I have a really
big crush on him...

196
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:29,080
{\an1}<i>Oh, yeah? I had no idea. So who</i>
<i>is this mystery boy?</i>

197
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:35,156
{\an1}And is this the whole reason why
you've been acting so much more
cheerful lately?

198
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,392
Okay! All done!

199
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:42,801
{\an1}No, not really. Or at least I
don't think so... But Sasuke is
just...

200
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:47,708
{\an1}Oh, okay. I see. So it's Sasuke,
huh?

201
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:52,850
{\an1}There's a rumor that... Sasuke
likes girls who have long hair.
And so I've been trying to--

202
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,689
{\an1}Sorry. You know what? I just
remembered something. I'll come
