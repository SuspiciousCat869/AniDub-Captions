You're the one that Lord

{\an1}I understand that you have
quite an unusual power.

151

{\an1}So, um... Where's Lord
Orochimaru?

152
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,983
{\an1}He's a very busy man.  So you've
been assigned to me instead.

153
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:54,687
{\an1}Anyway, let's go.
Come with me.

156
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:11,147
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru's conducting a

requires a lot of data.

now because he's gotten so weak.

160

{\an1}Also, I want to see
