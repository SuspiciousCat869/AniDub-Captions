{\an1}At the beginning, I had
nothing, but I built bonds.

7
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,143
{\an1}Like with Team 7.

8

Yaaah!

10
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:44,454
{\an1}So Ill have to throw
him off guard.

11
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:46,822
Wha?!

12
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,158
{\an1}He's after Naruto!

13

18
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:09,767
Huh?

19
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,336
{\an1}Why...Why did you...

21

Hrgh.

{\an1}<i>You look like</i>

{\an1}But why?! Why'd you save me?!

25
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,013
{\an1}I didnt ask for this!

26

{\an1}You know that I...

30
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,620
{\an1}I always hated
you, Naruto.

31

{\an1}You think youre better
than everyone else?

47

No, not everyone else,
just you!

want to owe me anything,

50
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,359
Then just become
stronger than me.

youre not hurt, are ya?

I wouldn't be surprised
if it snowed on me.

58

D'ohh!

59

Chidori!!

62
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,548
{\an1}I'll beat you into oblivion

I wanted to be
strong like you,
cool like you.

66
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,303
{\an1}I guess thats why I kept
chasing after you.

67
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,373
{\an1}No matter what happens,
I'm really glad that I
got to know you.

{\an1}Naruto...

69
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:51,312
{\an1}No matter what you
may say to me now,
I'm not changing.

70
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:58,681
{\an1}Im still going to kill each
and every person in the
Hidden Leaf, including you!

{\an1}<i>I'll get revenge for</i>
<i>the Uchiha Clan!</i>

But, is that really
the only way, Sasuke?

73
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:12,589
{\an1}Yes.

74
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:19,192
{\an1}Your only choices are to kill
me and become the hero who
saved the entire village,

75
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:23,660
{\an1}or get killed by me and
be known as a loser!

76
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:25,928
Sasuke...

77
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,663
{\an1}I just don't believe that.

78
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:34,366
{\an1}I'm not going to be a loser,

79
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,601
{\an1}but I'm not going to be the
hero who killed you, either!

80
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,469
{\an1}<i>Neither ones gonna happen!</i>

{\an1}[waterlogged gasp] You?!

84

{\an1}<i>Oh, I've been tagging along</i>
<i>for quite a while, now.</i>

<i>you didn't see me.</i>

87

{\an1}But it seems like you
were in a crisis, and
you needed some help.

[panting]

89

{\an7}<i>I should probably summon him.</i>
<i>It doesn't seem like Sasuke's</i>
<i>going to retreat.</i>

90
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,669
Naruto, I told you to
go back to the Village.

91
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:47,637
Its...

92
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,972
{\an1}...all clear to me now.

93
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:01,543
{\an1}I really should collect the
Rinnegan before the war begins.

94
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:02,778
Hmm?

95
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:08,781
{\an1}Sasuke. He's in a real bind.

96
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,349
What now?

97
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,119
{\an1}"Its all clear?" What do
you mean by that, Naruto?

98
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,157
[panting]

99
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,194
Ah!

100
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:42,765
What's going on, Sasuke?
I told you to
go home and rest.

101
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,267
Madara!

102

[panting]

103
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,573
The Nine-Tails huh?

104
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:06,744
{\an4}It seems that when you
two see each other,
you just cant suppress
the urge to fight!

105
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:12,180
{\an1}Ill arrange the proper time
and place for you to fight
and capture the Nine-Tails.

106
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,049
{\an1}<i>But for now, we retreat.</i>

107
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,884
And Ill stay and
fight for you.

108
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:21,751
After all,

109
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,321
We need to capture
the Nine-Tails
Jinchuriki anyway.

110
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,091
{\an8}<i>Madara and Zetsu.</i>
<i>They're sticking</i>
<i>close to Sasuke.</i>

111
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,759
{\an7}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>tough all by myself.</i>

112
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,194
What to do?

113
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:44,097
No, Zetsu. Capturing
Naruto is beyond you.

114
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,433
{\an1}The Nine-Tails is too tough for
a non-battle type like you.

115
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:54,601
{\an1}We'll let Sasuke get the
Nine-Tails. I will enjoy
watching that.

116
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:56,936
{\an1}Oh... Is that so?

117
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:01,206
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>Our bigger concern now is</i>
<i>Kisame. Go check on him.</i>

118

And rendezvous with
your Black half.

119
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,741
{\an1}Yes, yes, all right;
I understand.

120
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:08,875
Huh?

121
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,044
Naruto!

122
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,478
{\an1}I know. But don't worry;
I'm all right.

123
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:19,115
{\an1}There's just one thing I
want to make sure I say to
Sasuke before he leaves.

124
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,450
Let's go, Sasuke.

125
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,351
{\an1}Not yet.

126
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:35,390
Sasuke.
Do you remember?

127
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,360
{\an1}Do you remember what you said to
me long ago at the Final Valley?

128
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,861
The thing about
high-level shinobi?

129
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:52,631
{\an4}When two shinobi are powerful
enough, they are able to read
each others thoughts simply
by an exchange of fists,

130
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,233
{\an1}without ever uttering
a single word.

131
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,135
{\an1}Youve always been
naïve, Naruto.

132
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:03,536
Tell me...

133
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,905
{\an4}Do you know what I'm thinking
right now, at this very moment?

134
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,341
{\an1}Can you read my mind?!

135
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,042
{\an1}Trading blows just now...

136
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,144
{\an1}I learned a lot about you
and what youre thinking.

137
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:20,812
{\an1}It means we've become
high-level shinobi, Sasuke!

138
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:21,880
Both you,

139
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:23,482
<i>...and me.</i>

140
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,582
So, Sasuke...?

141
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,684
How about it?

142
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:33,320
{\an1}Can you tell me what it is
I'm thinking right now?

143
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:34,719
Can you...

144
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:36,653
Read my mind?

145
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:39,356
<i>And can you...</i>

146
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:40,756
..understand...

147
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,358
{\an1}That if you and I
fight each other,

148
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,626
{\an1}...we'll both die.

149
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:58,399
Sasuke.

150
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,801
{\an1}If you attack the Hidden Leaf,
I'll have no choice. I will
fight you, don't doubt that.

151
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,703
Until that day,
save your hatred.

152
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,971
Then you can throw
all of it right at me.

153
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:13,140
I'm the only one who can
handle all that hate.

154
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,940
Do you understand?

155
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:18,675
<i>I'm the only one who</i>
<i>can fulfill that duty!</i>

156
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,743
{\an1}So, Ill bear the
burden of your hatred,

157
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,912
And I'll die
with you!

158
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,517
{\an1}What is it with
you?! Huh?!

159
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,618
{\an1}Just what in the hell
do you want from me?

160
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,053
{\an1}<i>Why are you so</i>
<i>fixated on me?</i>

161
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,920
{\an1}Because you're my friend!

162
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,760
[Naruto]
Sasuke.

163
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,730
{\an4}From the moment we met,
I knew it would take a lot
of work if I was ever
going to understand you.

164
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:07,834
{\an1}Exchanging punches is the way
we can understand each other.
I know that!

165
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:10,903
{\an1}Like I said just now,

166
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,570
{\an1}<i>It means that both</i>
<i>of us have become</i>
<i>high-level shinobi!</i>

167
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:19,140
{\an7}<i>Once we really understand each</i>
<i>other, your hatred will go away.</i>

168
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,241
{\an7}<i>Just like mine when</i>
<i>I met Iruka Sensei.</i>

169
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:26,343
{\an1}I haven't given up on you!

170
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:27,577
Not yet.

171
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,447
{\an1}I will take you back to
the Hidden Leaf Village!

172
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,814
<i>I'll never</i>
<i>change my mind!</i>

173
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,049
{\an8}<i>Naruto... you...</i>

174
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:44,053
Heh, All right, I guess
that I'm done nagging
you for now, Sasuke!

175
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:50,390
{\an1}<i>Damn it, this is ridiculous!</i>
<i>I'm not any good with words;</i>
<i>I shouldn't try to lecture you!</i>

176
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:52,424
[chuckle]

177
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,093
{\an1}Well, I guess if the
worst does happen and
both of us end up dying,

178
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:02,129
{\an1}You wont be an Uchiha and
I wont be the Nine-Tails
Jinchuriki anymore.

179
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,729
{\an1}We'll be free of our burdens.

180
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,665
{\an1}<i>And we'll understand each</i>
<i>other in the afterlife!</i>

181
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,707
I'm not going to change.

182
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,009
{\an1}I don't want to understand you.

183
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,044
I won't die!

184
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:34,145
{\an1}You're the one
who's going to die.

185
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,913
{\an1}Then we'll die together, Sasuke.

186
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,419
Hmph.

187
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:55,089
{\an1}Fine by me. But at least
I'll take you down first.

188
00:16:56,457 --> 00:17:00,725
{\an1}No problem, since it's
clear that you still
don't respect me at all.

189
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:07,628
{\an1}Enough, Naruto. I'll handle
Sasuke. You have to pursue
your dream of becoming Hokage.

190
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:10,897
{\an1}I wont let Sasuke take
you down with him.

191
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,065
But I'm not worthy
of being Hokage,

192
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,533
if I can't even
save a friend.

193
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,434
Fine, Sasuke.

194
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:20,102
I'll fight you!

195
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,541
{\an7}<i>Naruto stands here</i>
<i>with clear resolve.</i>

196
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,042
{\an7}<i>So Ill bear the burden of your</i>
<i>hatred, and I'll die with you!</i>

197
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:44,014
{\an7}<i>While my courage and</i>
<i>determination do nothing</i>
<i>but continue to waver.</i>

198
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:50,317
{\an7}<i>I'm a shinobi, too. But I'm</i>
<i>always crying and relying</i>
<i>too much on Naruto.</i>

199
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,553
{\an7}<i>I came here thinking that</i>
<i>I was past all that.</i>

200
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:58,088
{\an7}<i>But still, I hesitate. I havent</i>
<i>really prepared myself at all!</i>

201
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:03,024
{\an7}<i>I cant do anything,</i>
<i>I can't say anything.</i>
<i>All I can do,</i>

202
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:04,992
{\an7}<i>...is to trust them!</i>

203
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:18,432
{\an1}[Kakashi]
All right. I'll leave
Sasuke to you, Naruto.

204
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,568
{\an1}However, Watch over
my body, Sakura.

205
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,436
{\an1}I'll get rid of
Madara right now!

206
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:27,570
Kamui!

207
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,671
{\an1}Don't bother, Kakashi.
That jutsu won't work on me.

208
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,373
Huh?

209
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,041
{\an1}Let's go, Sasuke.

210
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,075
Madara.

211
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,676
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>I want to talk to you later.</i>

212
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,253
I'll be waiting,
Sasuke.

213
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,560
What did you
want to discuss?

214
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,294
I want Itachis eyes.

215
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,564
{\an1}So, you're finally ready.

216
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:25,999
{\an1}<i>You've used the Susano'o</i>
<i>too much. Im aware that</i>
<i>your vision is almost gone.</i>

217
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,000
Ngh!

218
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,101
{\an1}<i>Its perfect timing.</i>

219
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,603
Transplant them
immediately.

220
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:35,205
{\an1}Such a sudden change.
What's brought this on?

221
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:41,041
{\an5}I will crush Naruto
with all I've got!
I'm going to eradicate
him completely!

222
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:42,875
And that's final!

223
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,513
{\an7}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Naruto. as always, thank you. </i>

224
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:59,684
{\an7}<i>Because of you, I still</i>
<i>don't have to give up my</i>
<i>dream that team 7 will laugh</i>
<i>together again one day.</i>

225
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,386
What?!

226
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,886
Huh?!

227
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:06,954
{\an1}Naruto!

228
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,290
It must have
been this wound.

229
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,559
{\an1}Aaagh! You mean
that... this is...

230
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,627
Uuggh...

231
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:21,962
Naruto?!

232
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,230
Naruto...

233
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,498
{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>It's because of the poisoned</i>
<i>kunai I used earlier?!</i>

234
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,500
{\an1}I'm afraid so.

235
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,536
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>You need to administer the</i>
<i>antidote right away, Sakura!</i>

236
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,938
<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>I'm taking you to</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf.</i>

237
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,473
{\an1}Please behave yourself.

238
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:48,741
{\an1}I wouldn't try anything
at this point, anyway.

239
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:52,043
Oh, boy.
I still feel
really sick.

240
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:53,545
Uh, are you all right?

241
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,447
Are you gonna throw up?
Hold on.

242
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:02,782
{\an7}<i>Thats him, huh?</i>
<i>That's Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

243
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:06,784
Are you ready?

244
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,586
Just do it.

245
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:14,489
<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Itachi...</i>

246
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,726
{\an1}<i>I will destroy the Hidden Leaf!</i>

247
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,141
{\an1}[Killer B]
Yo! It's been a while,
Omoi, Karui!

248
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:01,109
{\an1}Ya been getting by cheerfully,
carefully, merrily?

249
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:03,844
{\an1}[Omoi]
Of course not! Not since you
disappeared from the village!

250
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:07,079
{\an1}[Karui]
Hey, he was alive,
so it's all good now.

251
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,480
[Omoi]
Whats that, Lord Bee?

252
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,815
{\an1}A prize from my fight with
one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist.

253
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,650
{\an1}<i>Its taken a liking to me.</i>

254

{\an4}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Next time on</i>
<i>Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Infiltrator.</i>

<i>Wow, thats one of the Seven</i>
