[music playing]

2
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,834
-There's another
paper bomb over here.

3
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,006
-This will blow the
second it's peeled off.

4
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,807
We're just going to
have to detonate it.

5
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,009
-All right, then.

6
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,777
-We've got a paper bomb.

7
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,812
Drop what you're doing,
and find cover now.

8
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,122
-Ready?

9
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,622
-Mm.

10
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,797
-Now is not the time to be
talking about a new Kazekage.

11
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,732
-I'm just seizing
the initiative.

12
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,002
We have to be prepared for the
worst case scenario, don't we?

13
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,471
MALE SPEAKER: All that matters
now is finding the Kazekage,

14
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,739
and getting him back.

15
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,541
MALE SPEAKER: It's
obvious that our priority

16
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,443
is the safety of this village.

17
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,412
And our forces are spread
thin enough as it is.

18
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,047
MALE SPEAKER: Are
you out of your mind?

19
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,519
-Oh, excuse me.

20
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,791
Reporting, sir.

21
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,026
Enemy traps have been discovered
in the rubble blocking

22
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,127
the gate.

23
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,263
We are in the process
of detonating them.

24
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,597
No casualties.

25
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,599
But the explosions have caused
a portion of the entrance

26
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,834
to collapse.

27
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,438
Repairs will take half a
day longer than anticipated.

28
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,005
-All right.

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,073
Understood.

30
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,041
I want you to see to
it that every able body

31
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,910
we have is dispatched
immediately.

32
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,410
-Yes, sir.

33
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,850
-[sigh]

34
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,493
-Come on!

35
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,062
-[giggling]

36
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,199
LORD BAKI: (THINKING) Thanks to
Gaara, the sand village made it

37
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:57,404
through with hardly a scratch,
a blessing to be sure.

38
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,773
But it came at far
too dear a price.

39
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,710
-Reporting in.

40
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,479
We've located and
verified the bodies

41
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,981
of all the aerial watchmen, sir.

42
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,183
It's almost certain the
enemy infiltrated the village

43
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,752
from above.

44
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,019
MALE SPEAKER: Excuse me, sir.

45
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,354
-Yes, what is it?

46
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,356
-We've just gotten word
from the pursuit corps.

47
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,592
Kankuro was discovered
about half a day's journey

48
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,127
from the village.

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,362
He's unconscious,
and in bad shape.

50
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,268
-(THINKING) Kankuro.

51
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,137
MALE SPEAKER: Some of
the unit splintered off

52
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,606
to bring him back,
along with his puppets.

53
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,775
They're on route now.

54
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,843
LORD BAKI: And what
of the Kazekage?

55
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,212
MALE SPEAKER: The rest of the
squad are still in pursuit.

56
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,313
We should hear soon.

57
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,359
-Sasori, my man, you're late.

58
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,260
-Mm.

59
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,461
-What gives.

60
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,563
I thought you didn't like
to keep people waiting.

61
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,597
-I don't.

62
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,602
But time flies when
you're having fun.

63
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,704
-What the heck does that mean?

64
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,541
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
don't get so touchy.

65
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,110
You accomplished your
mission, didn't you?

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,445
You secured the one tail.

67
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,781
Once we've wrapped
things up with him,

68
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,118
it'll be on to my target.

69
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,052
-Yeah.

70
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,288
But Sasori, the
one you're after--

71
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,223
-True.

72
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,458
I still don't know where he is.

73
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,995
It would be easier if he'd just
to come to me, wouldn't it?

74
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,567
-Well, yeah, I suppose it would.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,469
What kind of Jinchuriki
is he, again?

76
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,471
-Oh well.

77
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:44,110
Even if we can't find him,
nobody's going to complain.

78
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,580
As long as I catch another one.

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,455
-We're coming.

80
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,390
Just hang in there, Gaara.

81
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,526
-Naruto, I know
you're in a hurry.

82
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,062
But quick breaking formation.

83
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,163
-I know, but--

84
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,764
-Don't lose your cool.

85
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:09,636
Master Jiraiya taught you
better than that, didn't he?

86
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,637
-Oh boy.

87
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,041
Temari.

88
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,718
MALE SPEAKER: Get him
into the operating room.

89
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:32,459
-[labored breathing]

90
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,028
-What is this, poison?

91
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,298
-Prepare an antidote now.

92
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,798
-Gaara.

93
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,002
Gaara.

94
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:55,715
-Gaara,, you mean
he's been-- (THINKING)

95
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,217
I knew something was wrong.

96
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,056
-We're two and a half
days out from the sand.

97
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,357
We should hurry.

98
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:04,858
-Right.

99
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,899
MALE SPEAKER: His wounds
aren't that serious.

100
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,167
The problem is--

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,469
-I know, the poison.

102
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,570
-Yes, sir.

103
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,139
It's one we've
never seen before.

104
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,642
We've no clue how to
develop an antidote.

105
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:27,213
-First Gaara, and
now Kankuro as well.

106
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,269
-Naruto is the prize
the Akatsuki are after.

107
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:54,207
And make no mistake,
we will have him.

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,076
-Don't get the wrong idea.

109
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,211
It's not you they want.

110
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,347
It's what's inside of you.

111
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,483
There's no doubt in my mind
it's the nine-tailed fox they're

112
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,651
after.

113
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,486
They might even be
thinking of somehow seizing

114
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,188
control of that
power, and trying

115
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,422
to bend it to their will.

116
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,760
-Naruto, will you
come on already?

117
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,562
Stop getting ahead of us.

118
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,963
-I can't take this anymore.

119
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,436
I know why they're
after Gaara and me.

120
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,473
It's not like it's a
mystery, or anything.

121
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,208
You know, too,
don't you, Sakura?

122
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,182
There's no point hiding it.

123
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,218
The spirit of the
nine-tailed fox

124
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,953
is sealed away inside of me.

125
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,196
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey, look.

126
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,132
It's that kid.

127
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,067
Let's get out of here.

128
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,213
-Gaara and I are the same.

129
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,649
We both have monsters
locked up inside of us.

130
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,653
That's what these
bastards are after.

131
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,459
And that's the
worst part about it.

132
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,261
To them, we're just monsters.

133
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,631
All those bastards see
is the means to an end.

134
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,203
-A demon, huh?

135
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,806
My demon is as real as yours is.

136
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,741
I was born a monster.

137
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:42,682
-Everything about us
was exactly the same.

138
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:49,823
And he had to fend for himself
a lot longer than I ever did.

139
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,292
-(THINKING) Naruto.

140
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,794
-To them, I was a
relic of the past

141
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,764
that they wished
would disappear.

142
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,767
What then was left for
me in this existence?

143
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,236
Why go on living any further?

144
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,706
For a long time, I couldn't
find an answer to that.

145
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,210
But in order to live,
you need a purpose.

146
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,713
To exist for no reason,
it's the same as being dead.

147
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,356
-And now he's the target
of the Akatsuki, one more

148
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,325
thing we have in common.

149
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:30,530
Why should his life be so
full of misery all the time?

150
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,999
Why is it always him?

151
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,201
That's why I've got to hurry.

152
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,704
I don't have a second to waste.

153
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,472
This time will be different.

154
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,374
I'm going to be
there to save him!

155
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,926
-(THINKING) Naruto, Uzumaki.

156
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:09,435
I thank you.

157
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,835
LORD BAKI: He's regained
consciousness, you say?

158
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,436
-That's right.

159
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,637
He has.

160
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,406
But he's just barely able
to respond to us, sir.

161
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,241
-His condition has
worsened since yesterday.

162
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,517
-[moaning] Baki?

163
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,719
Is that you?

164
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,453
-Kankuro.

165
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,423
-It was, it was him.

166
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,424
[groaning]

167
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,592
-Please, don't try to speak.

168
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,526
You need your strength.

169
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,864
-The, the red sand.

170
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,841
-[gasp] I see.

171
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,510
So he's wrapped
up in all of this.

172
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,511
-Lord Baki?

173
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,053
-Oh, Lord Baki.

174
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,488
-Contact the pursuit corps now.

175
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,724
They're to turn
back immediately.

176
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
-Actually, we haven't
received any word from them

177
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,263
since they found Kankuro.

178
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:50,703
-I guess we're too late we have
no choice but to go to them.

179
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,538
-Sir, what is it?

180
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,940
-Nothing.

181
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,642
I'm going out for a bit.

182
00:12:55,675 --> 00:13:01,748
-But, but-- sir,
the higher ups are

183
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,950
expecting a briefing
in the morning.

184
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,453
-You think you have time to
waste on reports right now?

185
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,823
We need action, not bureaucracy.

186
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,258
-Yes sir.

187
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,861
-(THINKING) We lose
Gaara for one a day,

188
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,962
and this is what happens.

189
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,772
I need the counsel of the
honored siblings, though

190
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,841
whether or not they'll come
to our aid is the question.

191
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,488
-You know, those food pellets
are only for emergencies.

192
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,390
And a girl at your
age should especially

193
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:50,797
be careful with the high
fat-- is she mad at me?

194
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,299
-You ever heard of sexual
harassment, old man?

195
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,869
-Naruto.

196
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,971
-Yeah?

197
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,141
-So tell, you've met
him before, haven't you?

198
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,077
-Huh?

199
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,779
SAKURA: Itachi Uchiha.

200
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,883
And he's, he's after
you now, isn't he?

201
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,353
You know, it's not like
I just spent my time

202
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,621
training these past
two and a half years.

203
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,291
I stole in Lady Tsunade's
library, and snuck

204
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,893
out of the village
as much as I could.

205
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,796
And now the one thing
that bothered me more

206
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,366
than anything else
finally makes sense.

207
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,668
-What I have is not a dream.

208
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,738
Because I will
make it a reality.

209
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:37,543
I'm going to restore my clan,
and destroy a certain someone.

210
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,649
I'm the only one who
can destroy that person.

211
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,554
I am an avenger.

212
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,691
That means I must be
stronger than my prey.

213
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,792
I need this training.

214
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,362
There's no time for setbacks.

215
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,332
-The person that
Sasuke wanted to kill,

216
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,767
it was his older
brother, Itachi,

217
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,403
wasn't it, a member
of the Akatsuki?

218
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,178
-Itachi Uchiha.

219
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,182
-Itachi Uchiha?

220
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,685
-I hope you're ready to die.

221
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,755
It's just as you said, brother.

222
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,826
I fostered my hatred
for you all this time.

223
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,964
I've lived my life for
one single purpose--

224
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,101
to see you die.

225
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:35,735
It ends here.

226
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,846
-You are definitely his brother.

227
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,682
If anything, your eyes are
even keener than Itachi's.

228
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:57,156
Very soon, Sasuke, you'll seek
me out and desire my power.

229
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,428
-That's the whole
reason he left.

230
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,232
He saw Orochimaru as
a way to obtain power.

231
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,268
But all that worthless viper
cares about is Sasuke's body.

232
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,005
And we only have six
months left to stop him.

233
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,143
-(THINKING) Sakura
knows about that, too.

234
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:22,348
-But Orochimaru used to be a
member of the Akatsuki himself.

235
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:26,986
All I'm trying to say
is, we can't give up.

236
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,554
The closer we get
to the Akatsuki,

237
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,224
the closer we are to finding
information about Orochimaru.

238
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,132
So the closer we get to them,
the closer we are to Sasuke.

239
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,640
(THINKING) And after
that, Itachi Uchiha.

240
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,011
He's tormented Sasuke for too
long, and now Naruto as well.

241
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,550
This time, it's my
turn to save them.

242
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,159
-[gasp]

243
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,098
It seems someone is here.

244
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,370
Hey, sis, you awake?

245
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,083
Hey now, can you hear me?

246
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,426
Bah!

247
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,767
You dead?

248
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,187
Ah!

249
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,456
-Fell for that one, didn't you?

250
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,158
-I was just playing possum.

251
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,661
[laughing]

252
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,165
-Cut it out, sis.

253
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,103
That was way too real, honestly.

254
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:57,603
Hmm?

255
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:13,619
-Honored siblings,
I have come here

256
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,655
to request your assistance.

257
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,522
We need you.

258
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,829
-Dusty ancient texts
should be bundled together

259
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,832
and stowed away on a high shelf.

260
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,036
Oh, what could we
possibly do now?

261
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,339
-An organization called the
Akatsuki has the Shukaku.

262
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,609
Failing to act only
invites disaster.

263
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,978
-This is your generation now.

264
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,847
You will just have to
deal with it on your own.

265
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,250
-You two have maintained
powerful channels

266
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,086
across the five great
nations, including

267
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,522
special routes
through allied lands.

268
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,290
There's only so
much intelligence

269
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,193
we can gather on our own.

270
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,997
--[sigh] We've been
retired for ages now.

271
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,168
We left behind our attachments
to this world long ago.

272
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,904
Although I guess it
would be nice to see

273
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,773
my grandson's face
one more time.

274
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,042
-This code work out
in your favor then?

275
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,677
-Hmm?

276
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,379
-It just so happens
your grandson

277
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,114
is a member of the Akatsuke.

278

get busy living.

MALE SPEAKER: Or get busy dying.

Jutsu, nine phantom dragons.

[music playing]

301
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,495
SAKURA: The summoning Jutsu
is a space-time Ninjitsu

302
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,930
that allows you to
call on creatures

303

you've made pacts
with, using a scroll.

Naruto, why don't
you give us a rundown

305
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,972
of all the summoning
creatures we've seen.

NARUTO: Let's see.

307
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,641
There's Chief Toad, right?

308
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,511
Tsunade slug Katsuyu
and Orochimaru's Manda.

Oh yeah, and Pakkun too.

310
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,918
SAKURA: Don't forget Temari's
Kamatari and the Third Hokage's

00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:06,819
Enma.

And in a slightly
different vein,

313
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,825
there's Tayuya's rage ogres
and Ukon and Sakon's Raashomon.

NARUTO: Oh, hey.

Come to think of it, Gai-sensei
had that ninja tortoise,

him the one time.

SAKURA: The thing
I've always wondered

is where these creatures
