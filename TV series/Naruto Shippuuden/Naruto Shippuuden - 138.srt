00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,240
[heavy breathing]

3
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:45,006
ITACHI: In the main
hall of Nagato's Shrine,

4
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,820
underneath the seventh
tatami mat from the far right

5
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:52,720
is the clan's secret
gathering place.

6
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:54,053
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I see now.

7
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,520
So that's what it all means.

8
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:25,553
FUGAKU: Now then, that's my boy.

9
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:29,553
-When were alone, the only one
he talks about is you, Sasuke.

10
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:32,186
-I just wish I knew
what kinds of things

11
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,453
he said to her about me.

12
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,620
ITACHI: If you wish to kill me
one day in hate and revenge.

13
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,486
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Brother, no matter

14
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,820
what darkness may await me,
if it means killing you,

15
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:04,086
I will meet it head on.

16
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,920
And whatever happens,
I will get that power.

17
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,653
-I fed my hatred
and gained power,

18
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:25,420
and now I'm here to
settle this, Itachi.

19
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,520
You will die right here.

20
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:28,986
You'll fall by my hand.

21
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,720
[theme music]

22
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,833
-Now, Itachi, you asked for
it, so here is it at last.

23
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,533
I'll make your death a reality.

24
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:41,133
-Jutsu that can't be evaded,
just like the Amaterasu?

25
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,000
What is it?

26
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:46,433
What kind of jutsu could it be?

27
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,933
[thunder]

28
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
BLACK ZETSU: That's it.

29
00:05:56,633 --> 00:06:00,233
That's what Sasuke's fire
style earlier was for.

30
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,633
WHITE ZETSU: What do you mean?

31
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,000
BLACK ZETSU:
Sasuke's real target

32
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,533
was never Itachi to begin with.

33
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,833
That's not what the fire
style attack was for.

34
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,500
WHITE ZETSU: I
still don't get it.

35
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:09,766
What does that mean?

36
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,466
BLACK ZETSU: He shot his
fire style jutsu into the sky

37
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,766
to cause the ambient
temperature of the atmosphere

38
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,866
to rise rapidly and create
an ascending air current.

39
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,800
WHITE ZETSU: A what?

40
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,166
Ascending air current?

41
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,533
BLACK ZETSU: To form
a cumulo nimbus.

42
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,066
In other words, to
create a thunder cloud.

43
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,366
WHITE ZETSU: I don't understand.

44
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,266
What does that have to--

45
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,400
BLACK ZETSU: He doesn't
have to use his own chakra.

46
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,500
Instead, he intends
to take advantage

47
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,833
of the enormous energy
in the atmosphere

48
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,533
to create a lightning
style jutsu.

49
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,500
WHITE ZETSU: Which one?

50
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,066
BLACK ZETSU:
Whichever it is, it'll

51
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,800
be on a totally different scale
from what anyone can create

52
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,700
using change and
nature chakra alone.

53
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,833
I see.

54
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:57,433
Sasuke deliberately
lured Itachi outside,

55
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,966
so he could use the heat
generated by the Amaterasu.

56
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,166
-This jutsu guides the
lightning down from the heavens.

57
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,933
All I have to do is merely
direct it's power right at you.

58
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,800
BLACK ZETSU: Just as I thought.

59
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,766
That's why this jutsu
can't be evaded.

60
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,033
-Why not?

61
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,000
BLACK ZETSU: Ligtning flashes
in 1/1000 of a second.

62
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,433
It's faster than sound.

63
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:20,800
-This jutsu is called Kirin.

64
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,266
-What's that?

65
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,266
BLACK ZETSU: Sasuke has
tamed the lightning.

66
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,566
-Come.

67
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:44,733
You'll be gone with
the thunder clap.

68
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,633
BLACK ZETSU: Such power.

69
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,900
WHITE ZETSU: So did Itachi die?

70
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
-It's done.

71
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
It's finally over.

72
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,510
ITACHI: Is this the death
you had imagined for me then?

73
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:33,297
-Damn you!

74
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,910
-That's--

75
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,077
-If I hadn't had this,
I'd have been dead.

76
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,544
-What's that?

77
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:55,710
-You really have gotten
stronger, Sasuke.

78
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,777
Now, it's my turn.

79
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,410
I'm going to reveal to you my
final trump card, the Susanoo.

80
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,390
I'm going to reveal to my
final trump card, the Susanoo.

81
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,590
-The Susanoo.

82
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,624
-Yes, the one other jutsu.

83
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:24,624
Once the Tsukuyomi and the
Amaterasu were awakened,

84
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,990
it also took root in
these eyes of mine.

85
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:31,924
Sasuke, is that it
for your jutsu then?

86
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,890
If you have anything
else up your sleeve,

87
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,957
now's your last
chance to play it.

88
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,857
The real battle's
just beginning.

89
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,524
-The sky is clearing.

90
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,057
BLACK ZETSU: Seems
that last jutsu

91
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,857
was limited to only one shot.

92
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,524
-What's that?

93
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:09,524
-What's the matter?

94
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:12,190
You use up all your chakra
and run out of options?

95
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:12,657
-What?

96
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,757
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
I can give it to you.

97
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,057
I can lend you the
power that you need.

98
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,524
-Damn it!

99
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,024
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
You need me.

100
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,157
Don't you, dear Sasuke?

101
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,590
I thought that you wanted
to take revenge on Itachi?

102
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,524
Now, release me.

103
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:38,490
Release my power and you can
fulfill your dream at last.

104
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:04,257
-That feels like Orochimaru's
eight headed serpent jutsu.

105
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,557
-What is that?

106
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,190
BLACK ZETSU: This is
all because Sasuke

107
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,790
tried to squeeze out more
power despite not having

108
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,690
any more chakra left.

109
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:16,290
Orochimaru's chakra, which
Sasuke absorbed and suppressed

110
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,190
has shoved its way
to the surface.

111
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:15,190
-And now, it finally emerges.

112
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:30,890
-Wait, is that-- Well,
father was always

113
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:34,024
regurgitating something
out of his mouth like that.

114
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,890
BLACK ZETSU: Slithering
around like the snake he is.

115
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:38,324
-This is it.

116
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:41,157
This is what I've
been waiting for.

117
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,357
Thanks to you, the
repressive chakra is gone.

118
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,090
And now, at last,
I have the chance

119
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,490
to take over this
child's body for good.

120
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:58,557
And so-- [laughing]
Did you truly

121
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,590
believe that a puny
attack like that

122
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,990
could take down the likes of me?

123
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,224
Ah.

124
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:07,990
-Well, Sasuke, what
will you do next then?

125
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,957
-This sword, it can't be.

126
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,224
The Totsuka blade.

127
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:16,424
Itachi, it was hidden
in you all along.

128
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,424
-What's with that sword?

129
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,424
BLACK ZETSU: The
Totsuka Blade, also

130
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:22,557
know as the Sakegari Blade.

131
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,457
It's a sword of Sealing.

132
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,757
It is said to trap
and seal away those

133
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,824
who it pierces in a
genjutsu world of drunken

134
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,790
stupor for all eternity.

135
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:35,757
The blade itself is
imbued with sealing jutsu

136
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,724
and is a variant of
the Kusanagi Blade.

137
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,690
Orochimaru has long
searched for that sword.

138
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,690
WHITE ZETSU: It's
power is immense.

139
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,657
-This is it, Sasuke.

140
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:00,890
-So what's with Itachi's jutsu?

141
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,724
BLACK ZETSU: That
jutsu he calls Susanoo,

142
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,657
it seems to be awfully risky.

143
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,924
WHITE ZETSU: But Sasuke can no
longer maintain his Sharingan,

144
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:21,324
and he's also been stripped
of Orochimaru's chakra.

145
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:25,857
Don't you think Itachi's
already won this?

146
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,324
-And now, your eyes are mine.

147
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,657
I'll take my time
retrieving them.

148
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,157
-Ah!

149
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,590
-Whoa, what the hell?

150
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:44,157
BLACK ZETSU: Something's
wrong with him.

151
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,124
[coughing]

152
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,257
-Damn it.

153
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,690
-That Susanoo jutsu
of his, it's simply

154
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:01,924
repelling every single
one of Sasuke's attacks.

155
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:03,524
BLACK ZETSU: There's
no mistaking it.

156
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,457
It's another spirit weapon.

157
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,257
It's called the Yata
Mirror, and it's

158
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,990
said to deflect all things.

159
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:11,890
With that and the Totsuka
Blade for attacking,

160
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:15,457
Itachi's invincible.

161
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,390
-They're my eyes.

162
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:18,357
They're mine.

163
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:24,557
-Ahhh!

164
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,190
[groaning]

165
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:04,824
[heavy breathing]

166
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,057
WHITE ZETSU: Itachi collapsed.

167
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:34,224
No way.

168
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,190
Is Itachi really dead?

169
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:49,624
BLACK ZETSU: It's
Sasuke's victory.

170
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:51,824
-There's something
I still don't get.

171
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,224
BLACK ZETSU: Like what?

172
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:56,057
WHITE ZETSU: I know that
Itachi is stronger than this.

173
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,990
He was moving quite strangely.

174
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:01,457
Even you said that something
seemed off about him.

175
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,557
BLACK ZETSU: That's true.

176
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,524
He couldn't evade
or counterattacks

177
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:07,057
that he should have
been able to handle,

178
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,557
and he was coughing up blood.

179
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,090
Perhaps he sustained
some serious damage,

180
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:13,824
even before the battle.

181
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,390
WHITE ZETSU: Could
it have been caused

182
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,757
by using the Sharingan too much?

183
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,024
BLACK ZETSU: Not sure.

184
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:21,290
I don't think we can
draw any conclusions.

185
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,657
WHITE ZETSU: He was close to
getting Sasuke's eyes too.

186
00:21:29,167 --> 00:23:00,134
[theme music]

187
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,234
NARUTO: Damn it.

188
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,700
What is this guy?

189
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,500
All he's doing is
try to stall us.

190
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,234
Why can't I hit him
with my rasengan?

191
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,834
No, that's not it.

192
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,100
I did him it.

193
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:15,467
I know it, but-- damn it,
we can't waste anymore time.

194
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,100
I have to get past this guy.

195
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,300
I have to get to Sasuke.

196
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:23,434
Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
"The Mystery of Tobi."

197
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,900
Be sure to tune in.

198
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,534
You won't want to miss it.
