1
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,330
Man...

2
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:19,573
I can't believe this!
It's my first day off in
forever. How did I end up
getting sent on an errand?

3
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:21,342
Huh?

4
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:28,624
What was that,
lightning?

5
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,546
No way! That's Sakura!

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,486
[screaming]

7
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,232
Are you okay?

8
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,774
Sakura! Talk to
me! Sakura!

9
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:56,346
Hang on! I'll get
you down from there!

10
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:43,460
"Road to Sakura"

11
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,038
<i>Well,... from what I can</i>
<i>see, it's nothing</i>
<i>serious.</i>

12
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:52,011
Bones are fine, internal
organs okay...

13
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:56,820
Considering the height
that you fell from,
you're tough,... even for
a student of mine.

14
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,356
However...

15
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:02,632
Hey. Do you know who I
am?

16
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,703
Uh, well--

17
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:08,376
She's okay physically,
but psychologically...

18
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,515
What's wrong with her,
Lady Tsunade?

19
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:14,221
It appears to me that she
has some kind of
amnesia...

20
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,092
Yeah, I thought that
might be it.

21
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,298
But this condition is
only going to be
temporary, isn't it?

22
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,402
It's really hard to say.

23
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:26,045
I've treated all sorts of
patients, but I've never
seen symptoms exactly
like these before.

24
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,151
Are you saying that she
might stay like this
forever, then?

25
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:32,659
Oh, don't worry. She's
only sixteen years old.

26
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,263
I mean, she still has her
entire life ahead of her!

27
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:36,365
(clears throat)

28
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,806
Listen, I'll do some
research on amnesia.

29
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,211
For now, we'll just need
to keep an eye on her.

30
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:45,350
Sakura, what exactly are
you doing?

31
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:48,189
So uh, have these things
always been this big?!

32
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:53,734
I mean, they seem almost
unnatural. Did they get
bigger recently or
something like that?

33
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,575
I was blessed with these
by Heaven, I'll have you
know!

34
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,579
[grunting]

35
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,115
[crying]

36
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,656
No, Lady Tsunade, please!
Not her head! You mustn't
hit her in the head!

37
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,194
Sometimes a shock fixes
this kind of thing.

38
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:11,402
Sakura isn't herself
right now. Try to go easy
on her, all right?

39
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:14,743
Now, Sakura... Do you
feel okay?

40
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,747
You're flat as a board.

41
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,719
[gasping and growling]

42
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:22,324
I'm completely normal! I
have nothing to be
ashamed--

43
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,961
<i>Hey! Not the head!</i>

44
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:26,667
<i>Shizune, please! Take it</i>
<i>easy, all right?!</i>

45
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:31,844
You really shouldn't be
acting so reckless and
fearless, you know.

46
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:34,583
Because of you, I got
caught in the crossfire.

47
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,089
But you seriously don't
remember anything at all
now?

48
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:42,264
Well, I suppose that this
place looks vaguely
familiar to me...

49
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:46,773
I mean, I guess I sort of
know that this is the
village where I used to
live.

50
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:50,648
But beyond that,
everything just starts
getting all foggy for
me.

51
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,317
Uh--

52
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,327
Look, why don't I take
you home? You can relax
there and rest up for a
while.

53
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:07,849
Wouldn't you know it?
Nobody's home! Good
grief!

54
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:11,824
But I can't very well
just leave you here, not
when you're in this
condition.

55
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:14,729
You're not pulling my
leg, are you? This is
really my home?

56
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:20,541
Sure is! You've lived
right here your entire
life, ever since you were
born. It's where you grew up!

57
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,846
Since I was born?
Really...?

58
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,699
All right... we'll have
to ask you-know-who for
help.

59
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,482
It looks like he's not
home, either! Sure, when
a friend really needs him,
he's nowhere to be found!

60
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,621
Ino, where are we now?

61
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,825
It's the home where one
of your teammates lives!

62
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:50,467
You've been on the same
squad together forever,
so I thought that coming
here might help you

63
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,603
remember something.

64
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,807
What's this person like,
anyway?

65
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,711
Well, let's see...

66
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:59,586
He's blonde and kinda
dopey-looking, he wears
orange clothes all the
time, he's completely

67
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,690
scatterbrained, and he
also loves ramen a lot.

68
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:02,491
Wait, ramen?

69
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,563
What? Did you remember?

70
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,403
This guy's name... Is it
Char Siu?

71
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:12,177
Wakame? No wait... Corn?

72
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:15,050
Hold on, lemme think...

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,687
Ah! Nitamago!

74
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,262
No, not quite, but you're
really close. It's
Naruto. Does that help?

75
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:26,673
No, sorry. For a second
there I thought I
remembered something.

76
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:29,311
That's okay. It won't
come back all at once.

77
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:34,556
But there's someone else
that you've known for a
long time. His name is
Sasuke.

78
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,092
It's Sasuke...?

79
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,231
He's actually out of the
Leaf Village right now,
but...

80
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,807
He's a totally cool guy
with black hair, and he's
really handsome, and on
top of that, he's-

81
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,210
He's a playboy?

82
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,412
Hm?

83
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,552
Oh, boy, I really have no
idea why I said that!

84
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:52,391
just had this image pop
right into my mind all of
a sudden!

85
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:57,835
If she doesn't even
remember Sasuke, this is
more serious than I
thought!

86
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:03,781
Sakura, I am going to
find some way to make you
better, I promise you I will.
Now, come on!

87
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:12,632
What? Really? This is the
first time I've ever seen
someone with amnesia!

88
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,301
Did she forget me, too?

89
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:19,445
Are you kidding me?
You're probably the first
one that she forgot!

90
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,723
This is horrible! The
bittersweet days of our
youth together, all gone
from your memories! I do

91
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,793
not know if I can stand
it!

92
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,530
How cruel!

93
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,335
Were we... dating or
something?

94
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,645
It's probably best if you
just ignore him. That's
simply the way he is, you
know?

95
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:40,120
What's the prognosis,
anyway? I mean, is she
going to get better?

96
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,426
Lady Tsunade just said
that she'd have to do
more research.

97
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,731
But worst case, Sakura
might stay this way.

98
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,369
Oh, no! That can't be!
It isn't right!

99
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:53,212
All right, then! This is
when we, as her friends,
are gonna have to step up
and help her out!

100
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:57,154
Now... is there anything
at all that you can
remember, even if
it's small?

101
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,191
It just might give us
a starting place to
help you.

102
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:03,567
It's really weird. It's
like I remember all of
you guys, but everything
about you's

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,905
just a little bit
different than I recall.

104
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,240
What does that mean?

105
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:10,748
I don't have a clue,
except that she seems
totally confused.

106
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,620
Poor Sakura. All of this
is so sad...

107
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,423
Okay, here's what
we'll do.

108
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:19,264
What if all of us
changed ourselves to
match up with Sakura's
memories?

109
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:24,074
Um... I know we all
agreed to this, but...

110
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:25,945
Meow!

111
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,449
I'm the Hidden Leaf
Village's top canine
handler!

112
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:32,792
I can't stand being
demoted to a cat
handler, even for
a friend!

113
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,194
[whimpering]

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,506
[screaming]

115
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,081
I never thought I'd face
such psychological
torture.

116
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:49,626
Hang in there, Shino.
We're all in the same
boat here.

117
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,534
But remember, we're doing
this to help Sakura.

118
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,973
Oh, Lady Hinata, you poor
unfortunate girl.

119
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,109
But tell me...

120
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,648
Why have you and I been
separated from everyone
else?

121
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:03,486
And why are we tied up
like this to boot?!

122
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,889
I do not know.

123
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:07,662
Apparently the both
of us, but especially
you, Neji,

124
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:10,233
give Sakura the chills
if we are too close to her.

125
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:14,308
What have I ever done?!
This is absolutely
outrageous!

126
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,711
Huh?!

127
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:20,386
I'm sorry about all
of this, but Sakura
asked us to do it.

128
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,890
How awful...

129
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:27,033
Now let me see here....
What were these two like?

130
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,943
Hey, Ino. Do you really
think that this ridiculous
stunt is going to help her
regain her memory?

131
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:34,549
Yeah, everyone looks
pretty weird and
uncomfortable.

132
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,356
Maybe, but if this helps
her get her memory back,
I say it's worth it.

133
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,028
Just be a good sport
and go along with it.

134
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:41,963
Hm!

135
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,700
Choji, wear this!

136
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:47,575
But this is- What's going
on here?!

137
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:52,819
All right, Shikamaru.
I'm really sorry to ask
this, but would you act
kind of like an idiot?

138
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:56,192
Huh?! Why would you
want me to do that?!

139
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,296
And smile, if you can!

140
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,532
Come on, Shikamaru!

141
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,870
[gasping]

142
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:07,682
Weeee! Woo hooo! Wee!
Yahooo... yippee.

143
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,326
I don't get it.

144
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:17,467
Sometimes I feel like my
memory is just about to
clear up, but then it all
goes away.

145
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:20,206
At least you're trying
hard. That's all you can
really do.

146
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,214
But this entire thing
just feels so gross, you
know.

147
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,855
Like, why did I suddenly
show up, falling out of
the sky like that?

148
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,734
And I... I can vaguely
remember everyone in the
village, but all the
details are a little off.

149
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,307
I still don't remember
this house at all!

150
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,781
It's as though I came
here for the very first
time today.

151
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:43,452
[grunting]

152
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,789
What is it?

153
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,093
<i>Ah! If it</i>
<i>isn't Ino!</i>

154
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:52,805
Auntie, Uncle! I'm glad
you're home. Where have
you two been?

155
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,548
They were having a big
sale across the bridge,
so of course we ended up
buying way too much.

156
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:02,558
And now we're bringing
home all of the spoils!
They were heavy, and it
was a long trip, but we

157
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,729
can't let the spoils
spoil, can we?

158
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:06,967
Get it? Hilarious!
[laughing]

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,706
Listen, something really
bad happened.

160
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,244
What is it? What
happened? Was there
a battle?

161
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:15,116
I'd rather take a bubble
bath than be caught in a
bloodbath!

162
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,055
I think we've all had
enough jokes for one day.

163
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,328
Look, you're practically
scaring Ino away.

164
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:25,003
Well, whatever else is
going on, your parents
are still as intense as
ever.

165
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:29,378
But now that they're
back, you can rest easy.
I'm sure they'll take
good care of you.

166
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,981
What's going on?

167
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,223
Sakura...?

168
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,840
What in the---
why are you crying?!

169
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:48,182
I don't know... The
moment I saw them...

170
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:49,151
I'm sorry...!

171
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,823
Hey! Where're you going?!
Don't just run off!

172
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,328
Huh. So what do you
suppose is going on with
those two?

173
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:58,503
You don't think... that
my jokes really were too
much for her, do you...?!

174
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,507
I get it, so that's
what it is!

175
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,509
Right.

176
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:02,812
Huh?

177
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,426
Hey, Sakura, wait up,
would you?!

178
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,266
Sakura, c'mon! Stop!

179
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,173
[panting]

180
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:23,085
Listen, I don't know what
happened back there that
made you cry, but why'd
you run away like that?

181
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,795
Did you hear me?

182
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:33,072
I don't know what
happened, but I have this
uncomfortable, painful
feeling in my chest.

183
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:36,011
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

184
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:40,453
It's okay, but we can't
leave things like this.
Let's go back.

185
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:45,463
Until things calm down,
I'll stay with you if
you'd like.

186
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,000
Ino...

187
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,469
[gasping]

188
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:50,340
No...

189
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,143
My pendant is missing!

190
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:53,780
Huh? Your pendant?

191
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:01,095
Come to think of it, you
were wearing some jewelry
I'd never seen you with
before.

192
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:05,169
Oh, no...! I've never
taken it off before, and
now it's gone!

193
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:08,075
It's something that I
just can't lose!

194
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,313
Sakura?

195
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:11,148
Oh!

196
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,687
We finally found the two
of you!

197
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,390
Auntie! Uncle!

198
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:20,099
This is just too much! I
can't believe you ran all
the way here at top speed.

199
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,070
[sighing]

200
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,209
Sakura, are you by any
chance looking for
something?

201
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:29,686
Well, losing things is an
age-old problem... Just
like old age!

202
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:32,190
[laughing]

203
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,492
<i>Huh?</i>

204
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:36,666
It's not like you to pass
up shutting your Dad's
bad jokes down!

205
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,139
Apparently, she lost
something that's very
important to her.

206
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:41,743
Oh. I see.

207
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:46,085
But listen, Sakura, this
thing that you lost...
Is this it?

208
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,324
[gasping]

209
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:52,464
You must have dropped it
in front of the house
earlier.

210
00:13:55,771 --> 00:14:01,649
I was really surprised to
see it, since it's exactly
like the one I have.

211
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,119
[gasping]

212
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:21,188
Reporting in! Our third
line of defense...

213
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,424
... it's--

214
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,127
Yes, I see.

215
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:57,427
<i>Sakura!</i>

216
00:14:58,262 --> 00:14:59,899
[chuckling]

217
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,402
Thank you again.

218
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:05,577
Don't mention it. It's
the least I can do after
your parents--

219
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,551
Here.

220
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,694
Buying the exact same
necklace... like father
like daughter.

221
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,468
But from here on out, I'd
be careful not to
drop it, okay?

222
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,516
So that's what's
happened.

223
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:45,891
Now, we chased after you.
Isn't there anything that
you'd like to say to us
after going through all

224
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:47,393
that trouble?

225
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:52,303
Yeah, but, Uncle and
Auntie, the thing is...
Sakura isn't...

226
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:55,309
What's this for?!

227
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,351
Thank you both!

228
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:02,223
Well, it's not
something to get
all teary about!

229
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:05,329
I didn't know that nuts
grew on cherry trees.

230
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,568
It's 'cause...

231
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:10,072
I'm just so happy!

232
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,578
I love you both so much.

233
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,457
<i>Be sure to come home by</i>
<i>suppertime!</i>

234
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,600
Okay, I have no
idea what just
happened,

235
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,140
but I'm assuming that it
means you've remembered
everything?

236
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,787
Yes, everything.

237
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,962
Then tell me... What
happened? Why'd you fall
from way up there?

238
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:41,134
Well, earlier today...

239
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,509
... I was dispatched as a
messenger by Lady Hokage.

240
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:53,092
Okay, it should be just
ahead.

241
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:55,263
Huh?

242
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,972
[screaming]

243
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:04,247
I don't know what it was,
but some powerful force
reeled me in.

244
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,151
And when I came
to, I was here.

245
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:10,493
I'm don't think that I'm
the Sakura that you know.

246
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm not actually from
this world.

247
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,506
Hold on, what are you
talking about, this world?

248
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,745
Oh, boy. I guess your
memory must still be
affected.

249
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,816
Ino!

250
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,358
Don't worry, Sakura. I'll
stay with you for the
long haul. I'll even
study up on amnesia!

251
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:28,530
[gasping]

252
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,341
Sakura! You're glowing!

253
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,052
Ino.

254
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:43,359
Thank you for being my
friend here, as well.

255
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:46,633
Huh? I don't get it!
What's going on?!

256
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,605
Hey, Sakura!

257
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,682
Uh-- she just...
faded away!

258
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,259
What just happened? Was
it a Summoning?

259
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:03,198
But I don't see any jutsu
formulas anywhere.

260
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:10,212
I don't think that I'm
the Sakura that you
know...

261
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:12,985
No way! It's
impossible.

262
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:17,561
That couldn't really be
what happened... Because
if it's true, then...

263
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,333
Where did MY Sakura go?!

in the theater of
operations.

<i>The battlefields are</i>

It appears that we
don't have any audio,

to Samui?

279
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:32,811

go back to the desert
front, then?

the Fourth Kazekage

To be honest, it's hard
to see a connection
between them.

Yes, all of them do come

292
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:19,638
Let's go to Tajiki,
who's there. Tajiki?

293
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:22,644
It doesn't look like
we'll be able to get a
hold of him right now...

294
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:28,122
So onto the main issue in
this Fourth Great Ninja
War. The Jinchuriki of
the Eight and Nine Tails,

295
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,992
Lord Killer Bee and
Naruto.

296
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:34,969
In order to hide from
Madara Uchiha... they've
been isolated on Turtle
Island.

297
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:41,014
<i>Seizing this opportunity,</i>
<i>Naruto is currently undergoing</i>
<i>training to learn the Tailed</i>
<i>Beast Bomb.</i>

298
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:44,688
[yelling]

299
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:48,362
Don't send it my way,
I'll just send it back
to you, hey!

300
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:50,166
So you say, but it's not
your day!

301
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:53,172
Learn balance while we
play. And count it, okay?

302
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:56,612
Ah! One to two, the
square root of three?

303
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:00,419
Fool ya fool! For a fool
you're quite the right
triangle.

304
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,925
I'm trying my best, you
know! Can't you see?

305
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,762
Ahhhhh!

306
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,099
Huh... what kind of
training is that...?

307
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,907
Let's go talk to Naruto
and see what we can find
out directly from him!
Naru--!

308
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:14,548
Stop right there! Naruto
doesn't even know that
the war has broken out
yet!

309
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,420
You're right.
Sorry about that.

310
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,758
I think we should just
leave it at that for
tonight.

311
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,230
Then we'll see you
again next time!

312
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:23,766
All right! We're out!

313
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,869
Thanks, everyone!

314
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,572
Did I do ok?

315
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:04,802
Why stay with the
shinobi? You are
staunchly samurai.

316
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:08,977
You serve shinobi, how can
you still call yourselves
samurai?

317
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,653
<i>We do not serve the</i>
<i>shinobi. The one master</i>
<i>that we follow has never</i>
<i>changed since the olden</i>

318
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:17,426
<i>days, and that master...</i>
<i>is called peace!</i>

319
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,203
Next time on Naruto
Shippuden: Mifune vs.
Hanzo.

320
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:26,144
<i>We pledge ourselves to</i>
<i>peace, and then act</i>
<i>upon that conviction!</i>
