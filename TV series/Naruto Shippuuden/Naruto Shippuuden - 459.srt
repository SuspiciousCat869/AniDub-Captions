{\an1}Even Susano'o is useless.

{\an1}Let's get Obito down while
we have the chance.

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,478
{\an1}For a second, I forgot that
you're able to use that

162
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,889
{\an1}We've both benefitted
from Six Paths' power.

163
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:46,196
{\an1}But if we're not able to
seal her away, all of it
will be meaningless.

mother...

175

{\an1}Why did Six Paths Super Gramps
seal away his own mom?

176
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,884
{\an1}I thought that he sealed
away Ten Tails...

182

I recorded everything that
happened while Mother was gone.

183
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,515
{\an1}And molded it as well.

00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:57,188
{\an1}The tale of shinobi... is the
tale of restoring Mother.

{\an1}It's what?! What does
that mean?! What are you
even talking about?!

186
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:08,334
{\an1}That you know Mother's name...
means you must have met
Hagoromo.

187
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:13,408
{\an1}I knew that it was possible,
depending on the reincarnates'
power.

188
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:19,080
{\an1}And to receive the power to
seal away Mother as well.

189
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:22,452

seal Ten Tails!

{\an1}Let me tell you her tale while
I absorb all of your chakra.

193
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:42,944
{\an1}<i>Like I just said, Mother was</i>
<i>sealed away previously by her</i>
<i>own children.</i>

194
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:48,952
{\an1}<i>It was said to have been...</i>
<i>a most powerful seal.</i>

195
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:56,092
{\an1}<i>The jutsu that transformed Ten</i>
<i>Tails into a Catastrophic</i>
<i>Planetary Devastation core...</i>

196
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,163
{\an1}<i>and turned it into the moon.</i>

197
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:03,903
{\an1}<i>But just before the seal took</i>
<i>hold, she gave birth to me,</i>

198
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:08,075
{\an1}<i>in order that she could</i>
<i>one day be restored.</i>

199
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:12,145
{\an1}I'll show you all of it.

200
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,287
{\an1}I don't have any candy to give
you, but the  puppet show is
about to begin.
