1

-Without a doubt, he's matured.

2
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,319
But he's still
not strong enough.

3
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,267
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
It hurts, but I

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,736
know it's just a genjutsu.

5
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,437
I gotta fight through it.

6
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:45,979

-Is that-- Is that Sasuke?

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,888
-It's been far too long, Naruto.

10
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,178
I should've finished you off
the last time we saw each other.

11

-Why?

13
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,200
Why, Naruto?

14
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,737
When Sasuke left, why didn't
you bring him back to me?

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,072
I was wrong to believe in you.

16
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:58,685
-You couldn't even protect
your closest friends.

17

I expected more from you,
but you're a failure.

-You're such a disappointment.

26

00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,499
-Such an easy life.

28
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,967
So lucky.

29

-Now, at long last,
I'll finish you!

30

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

31
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,144
Damn it!

32
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,146
Damn it.

33
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,981
This isn't happening,
but I can't--

34
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,887
NARUTO: Let me
get this straight.

35
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,156
I mean, I get the basics of
what you're talking about,

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,324
the part where you temporarily
stop your chakra flow

37
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,294
and direct the extra power at
the enemy to disrupt his flow.

38
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,629
That make sense.

39
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,398
But what if you do that
and it still doesn't work?

40
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,500
What can I do when that happens?

41
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,103
If I just can't
break the genjutsu?

42
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:23,603
-Hm.

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,643
In that case, I guess
you just give up.

44
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,011
-Huh?

45
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,980
-Sometimes, you have to accept
that you're plum out of luck

46
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,649
and throw in the towel.

47
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,085
You never know what'll
happen with genjutsu.

48
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,655
-You gotta be kidding me!

49
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,524
Then I guess there wasn't any
point to the whole me falling

50
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,060
into the river and
getting drenched lesson.

51
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,931
-Of course, if you've got your
comrades along to back you up,

52
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,999
there's still a chance
you could pull through it.

53
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,246
What I mean is, if you somehow
got an ally to actually touch

54
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,849
you, they could funnel some of
their chakra into your body.

55
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,388
The sudden surge of energy might
disrupt the dangerous chakra

56
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,824
flowing inside of you.

57
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,826
And then, you could
break the genjutsu.

58
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,435
-You liar.

59
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,403
You broke your promise to me.

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,372
-Such a disappointment.

Sa-- Sakura Please.

00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,945
I need your chakra.

-Wh-- What happened to me?

-You were caught in a genjutsu,
but you're gonna be fine.

We all funneled our chakra
into you and broke the hold.

-What do you mean,
his shadow clones?

Why, he's used no such thing
the entire time we've been here.

-Yeah, all of a sudden,
you kind of freaked out

00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,518
and started shooting off your
Rasengan at absolutely nothing.

85

Don't you remember any of that?

You're saying I was
already in the genjutsu?

88
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,502
-I'm afraid he's using more
than just a visual jutsu.

89
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,976
-I think it's about
time for the main event.

90
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,377
Better get it together, Naruto.

gonna get the drop on him

with Kakashi-sensei's
Lightning Blade as a diversion.

113

with Kakashi-sensei.

118

On top of that, I
need a powerful jutsu

00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,901
-I'm on it!

168
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,340
-Huh?

169
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,075
Improve my Rasengan?

170
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,844
-That's what I'm saying.

171
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,978
-Come on.

172
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,214
I'm practically an
expert with the Rasengan.

173
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,483
What I really want to
learn are some new jutsu.

174
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,586
What do you say?

175
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,588
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

176
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,156
Do you honestly
think the Rasengan

177
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,460
you use now is good enough?

178
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,029
Think back to when you
fought with Orochimaru's four

179
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:03,796
eyed friend.

180
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,964
Remember what happened then?

181
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,481
-I don't know what
jutsu you learned,

182
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,416
but you'll need to be
more subtle than that

183
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,519
if you want to hit me.

184
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,287
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): It's no use.

185
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,524
I'm not gonna be able
to hit a moving target.

186
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,426
JIRAIYA: And then what happened?

187
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,293
What did you do next?

188
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,802
-OK.

189
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,606
Let's see you
dodge me this time.

190
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,106
Rasengan!

191
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,111
JIRAIYA: Are you just
gonna let your hand get

192
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,714
cut like that every time
you face a tough enemy?

193
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,549
Is that your plan?

194
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,851
-This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

195
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,653
That's why I need a new jutsu!

196
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,754
-Naruto.

197
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,990
I can't believe I'm
hearing this from you.

198
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,760
Don't you remember, or are you
telling me you forgot already?

199
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,896
The Rasengan is a precious gift.

200
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,931
A jutsu passed down
from the Fourth Hokage.

201
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,104
-Oh, I, uh-- No,
I didn't forget!

202
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,673
-I'll let it slide.

203
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,810
The Fourth Hokage is responsible
for creating the Rasengan Now

204
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,613
the challenge for you will be
to figure out how to perfect it

205
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,016
and make it unique.

206
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,019
It'll be hard, but I bet
you can improve the Rasengan

207
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,588
and make it your
own original jutsu.

208
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,690
-Huh?

209
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,893
-You're saying I could
develop my own original jutsu?

210
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,662
-That's exactly right.

211
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,932
If you can harness the power of
that massive chakra of yours,

212
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,502
it would make your strike super
focused and more destructive.

213
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,105
A power that can't be done
without your particular chakra.

214
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,442
Your Rasengan would be
a one of a kind jutsu.

215
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,443
-Yeah.

216
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,446
My very own, original Rasengan

217
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,082
-In order to increase the
power of the Rasengan,

218
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,485
you'll first need to master how
to infuse more of your chakra.

219
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,453
I won't lie to you.

220
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,788
The training will be tough.

221
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,290
But if you can
withstand it, you'll

222
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:16,395
emerge with by far the strongest
weapon in your arsenal.

223
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,265
We'll call it--

224
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,266
-Giant Rasengan!

225
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,240
-Incredible.

226
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,742
-My word.

227
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,543
What power.

228
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,331
-What the-- What's
up with that smirk?

229
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,141
-It's strange.

230
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,678
I got the feeling I'd fought
him somewhere before, but--

231
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,280
-So, you do not remember
ever meeting this man?

232
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,216
-That's weird, 'cause
from what he was saying,

233
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,517
it seemed like he
knew everything

234
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,219
about you, Guy-sensei.

235
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,720
-Something's going on here.

236
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,596
-His-- His face.

237
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,742
-Wha-- What on Earth?

238
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:40,579
-When we were fighting, I
could feel something was off.

239
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,947
-I don't get it.

240
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,416
What the heck just happened?

241
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:48,220
-It has to be some kinda jutsu.

242
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,655
-But that man.

243
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,124
LEE: Who is that?

244
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,993
Sensei, what does this mean?

245
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,327
-I don't know.

246
00:19:55,361 --> 00:20:00,199
But there's one thing
that I am sure of.

247
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,669
There is no way
I've ever met him.

248
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,613
-Lady Chiyo, do you
know who this person is?

249
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,582
-I do.

250
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,920
His name is Yura, and he's a
Jonin from our own village.

251
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,430

MAN: Seeking the
truth always involves

253
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,023
putting your life in jeopardy,
and this particular mystery

254
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,026
sent us into the desert, where
we overcame the blazing sun,

255
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,461
deadly sandstorms, and
poisonous scorpions.

256
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,597
But it was all worth it to
cut through the darkness

257
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,898
and get the story.

258
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,868
The secret of an enigmatic
statue will now be revealed.

259
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,872
Answers at last, the intrigue
of the shinobi, uncharted lands,

260
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,874
and the mystery of
the giant statue!

261
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:26,011
-That's just a statute
of the previous Kazekage.

262
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:26,979
NARUTO: Next time.

00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,814

NARUTO: And now, Notable
People in the Leaf Village.

266
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,965
In this feature, you get to meet
famous people from our village.

267
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,766
Today, we'll be introducing--

268
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,301
-Sorry I'm late!

269
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,137
I'm the one and only
Jiraiya, the sexy beast

270
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,206
who strikes fear in
the hearts of men!

271
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,407
-What's the deal, Pervy Sage?

272
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,710
You're totally upstaging me!

273
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,345
-Don't be just a
stick in the mud, kid.

274
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,347
Just get on with my
introduction, will you?

275
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,181
NARUTO: Fine.

276
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,315
Um.

277
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,417
He's one of the Leaf's
three legendary Sannin.

278
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,685
JIRAIYA: That's right.

279
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,587
NARUTO: A powerhouse who
trained with the Third Hokage

280
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,955
and taught the Fourth Hokage.

281
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,123
JIRAIYA: Go on.

282
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,192
NARUTO: And the author of
a bunch of boring books

283
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,827
Kakashi-sensei's always reading.

284
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,028
-Hmph.

285
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,063
Like a kid could understand
how great my books are.

286
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:21,500
NARUTO: Not to mention,
drinks, ladies, money.

287
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,269
These three things are
forbidden to shinobi,

288
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,670
but this Pervy
Sage doesn't care!

289
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,805
JIRAIYA: Hey, that's no
way to talk to your master.

290
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,408
I taught you the
Rasengan, after all.

291
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,542
NARUTO: Ha!

292
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,578
If you want my respect,
then how about paying me

293
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,413
back all the money you owe me?

294
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,181
What the-- He's gone!

295
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,750
Aw man.

296
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,718
Where'd he go?
