1
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,865
-Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

2
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:31,725
Damn.

3
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,785
-Look, don't be so impatient.

4
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,735
You're doing well here.

5
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,735
At this point, it's
only a matter of time.

6
00:00:57,745 --> 00:00:58,855
Trust me.

7
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,725
-Well, if it's only
a matter of time,

8
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,825
then we should be training
every chance that we can get,

9
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:03,865
shouldn't we?

10
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:09,675
-Hm, I know that you can
take a licking, but uh--

11
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:10,965
-Huh?

12
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:15,775
[wheezing]

13
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:20,705
-I'm good to go
whenever you're ready.

14
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:21,865
Let's do it.

15
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,835
[coughing]

16
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:27,785
-You could be really creepy,
you know that, right?

17
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,725
[theme music]

18
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,675
-You carry him for a while.

19
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:23,815
-Are you kidding me?

20
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,905
You're the one who keeps
going on about money.

21
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,925
You can carry him
there yourself.

22
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,965
He's your precious
bounty, isn't he?

23
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,755
What's the matter with you?

24
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,795
Why the hell are you
looking at me like that?

25
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:43,715
-I swear, one of these
days, I'm going to kill you.

26
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,775
-Oh please, not
that again, Kakazu.

27
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:03,735
-Hmph.

28
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,865
-Look at that.

29
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,875
Guess he's doing all right.

30
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:39,685
He might not need my food
pills after all, huh?

31
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,955
SAI: Don't be so sure.

32
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,775
-Oh, Sai.

33
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:44,885
I didn't even see you.

34
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,725
How long have you been there?

35
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:47,805
-Before you got here.

36
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,675
You didn't notice?

37
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:50,755
-You're kidding.

38
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:52,715
I really had no idea.

39
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,815
I swear, it's like
you're invisible.

40
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,915
-Oh, well, uh, I'm sorry.

41
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:01,765
Like I was saying though, he's
certainly got his work cut out

42
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,865
for him.

43
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,695
From what I've observed so
far, Naruto hasn't much skill,

44
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,935
yet he has to sustain
absolute focus

45
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:12,685
while using Shadow Clones
nearly to his limit.

46
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,745
It really is amazing.

47
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,795
The degree of fatigue
must be extraordinarily

48
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,705
compared to that
of normal training.

49
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,685
-Yeah, you're right.

50
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:30,695
-That's-- that's what it
says in this book anyway.

51
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,745
-You don't have to
hide it, you know?

52
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,875
SAI: But weren't
you fed up with me

53
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:37,705
turning to books for everything?

54
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:38,795
I thought so.

55
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,745
[chuckle]

56
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,885
-Sorry, that's not what I meant.

57
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,875
It's totally fine.

58
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,965
You were only reading up
on it again because you

59
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,915
were worried about
a friend, right?

60
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:53,675
In the end, when all else fails,
that's what books are for.

61
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,543
Turns out you do have
a nice side, huh?

62
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:55,945
-Huh?

63
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:57,755
A nice side?

64
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,845
-Come on, we don't want
to interrupt his training.

65
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:04,695
Let's head back.

66
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:19,685
-Guess they shaped up into a
decent team during my absence.

67
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,835
Well, that's
certainly encouraging.

68
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,695
-Naruto.

69
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:48,755
-Hm?

70
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:50,915
-Concentrate on everything
you've learned so far,

71
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,965
and then break off the Shadow
Clone Justu, all right?

72
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,865
Time to tally up for the day.

73
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,835
-You got it.

74
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,775
-How about it?

75
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,785
Starting to sink in yet?

76
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,805
-Still not there yet.

77
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,895
Come on.

78
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:11,915
I'll just have to
train until I--

79
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:14,795
-You can't keep pushing
yourself this hard.

80
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:18,955
-What's that?

81
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,835
-Sakura brought it for you.

82
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,815
It's a basket of food
pills and a note.

83
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,835
-Eat some of these
and train hard.

84
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,885
They're my special food pills.

85
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:34,705
Cha.

86
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,613
Good old Sakura.

87
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,745
I bet her homemade
food pills will help.

88
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,845
This'll hit the spot.

89
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:48,935
[gagging]

90
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,905
Bleh!

91
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,675
Sakura, what did you
put in these things?

92
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,855
They're inedible.

93
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:59,855
OK, let's dive back in.

94
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,695
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

95
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:12,715
[music plays]

96
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:32,715
[music plays]

97
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:43,895
[music plays]

98
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:46,915
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I can't
believe Naruto's still at it.

99
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,815
Good thing he had my food
pills to keep him going.

100
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,965
[splashing]

101
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:01,893
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Wow.

102
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:09,775
KAKASHI: Naruto, why don't
you take a little break?

103
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,865
-If I don't give it
everything I've got,

104
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,705
I'm never going to be able
to catch up with Sasuke.

105
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,745
IRUKA: Well, if it isn't Sakura.

106
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:43,815
-Huh?

107
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,795
Oh, Iruka-sensei, hey.

108
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:50,715
-Boy, that Naruto sure is
something else, isn't he?

109
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,825
He really came through for the
village in its time of need.

110
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:54,795
-Thanks a lot.

111
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:55,675
What am I?

112
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,735
Chopped liver?

113
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,745
I'm only kidding.

114
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:00,915
-I'm sorry about that.

115
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,935
You are Lady Tsunade's
apprentice after all.

116
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:06,755
My students have all
turned out so well.

117
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:08,745
It makes me proud.

118
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,695
But that adorable
little knucklehead

119
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:11,955
has really grown up.

120
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,915
Even now, he's tackling
training no one else could even

121
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,905
dream of taking on.

122
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,755
Amazing, isn't it?

123
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,895
-Well, I had my act together
right from the beginning.

124
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,895
Guess I should have been
working on being more adorable.

125
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:25,965
-What gives?

126
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:29,865
You're in a mood
today, aren't you?

127
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,755
-He really has grown
strong though, hasn't he?

128
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,795
-He's changed all right.

129
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,805
Everyone's changing.

130
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:40,935
All of my former pupils
are finding their way now,

131
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:41,845
getting stronger.

132
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,685
-Hm?

133
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,675
what's that?

134
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:03,795
-I see.

135
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:06,855
They even got Chiriku.

136
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:10,695
-I was out on patrol
when the temple was hit.

137
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,925
By the time I got
back, they were all--

138
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:15,835
-It has to be the Akatsuki.

139
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,795
They're probably scouring
every inch of the Land of Fire,

140
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,695
hunting down all
of the Jinchuriki.

141
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:27,675
Finally, they've returned.

142
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,875
-And here they're going to stay.

143
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:31,895
We have 20 new platoons ready.

144
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:32,915
Tell them they're a go.

145
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:41,895
That's all I have to say.

146
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:52,785
If anyone has any
questions, now's the time.

147
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,945
Asuma.

148
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,825
-Chiriku is one of the
Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

149
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,695
They would have had
to get past him.

150
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:00,785
Was he not there or something?

151
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:09,825
-Lord Chiriku faced the two
Akatsuki all on his own.

152
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:10,875
They cut him down.

153
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,885
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): Chiriku, no.

154
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:26,925
It can't be.

155
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:39,965
-For the pride of the
Hidden Leaf Village,

156
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,935
and above all, the safety
of the Land of Fire,

157
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,685
we must not allow
them to roam free.

158
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,865
I want to learn what their
motives are, but be warned,

159
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,745
these enemies are formidable.

160
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,715
Do not allow them to
leave the Land of Fire.

161
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:02,725
If you cannot detain them,
they are to be slain.

162
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,715
That's it.

163
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,925
You have your orders.

164
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:05,775
Go!

165
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:18,965
INO (VOICEOVER): We
will never disgrace

166
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:20,955
the name of Team Asuma.

167
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,825
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): We'll do our
best, Shikamaru, Asuma-sensei.

168
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,785
-Now then.

169
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:35,815
-Right.

170
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,725
Let's start at the
Fire Temple, shall we?

171
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,925
ASUMA (VOICEOVER):
Somebody's gotta do it.

172
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:56,633
-Let's go.

173
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:20,795
-Asuma-sensei.

174
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:21,845
-Yeah, what's up?

175
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,875
-It sounded to me like
you knew that Chiriku guy

176
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,935
from the Fire Temple
pretty well, huh?

177
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:30,955
-That's right.

178
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:34,885
Didn't I ever tell you?

179
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:37,905
I fought with him as a brother.

180
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,855
Remember, I left
the Leaf when I was

181
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,765
younger to be a member of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

182
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:49,675
The temple's nearby.

183
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,043
Let's hurry.

184
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:45,915
-Such a beautiful moon tonight.

185
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:46,905
[clank]

186
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:47,755
-Huh?

187
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:12,795
-Yeah, you did it.

188
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,945
Way to go, Sakura.

189
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,945
I always knew you were awesome.

190
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:26,865
-Everyone's changing, Sakura.

191
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,835
-It's true, everyone is.

192
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,885
Naruto's embarked on
training no one else

193
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:41,675
could even think of doing,
all in pursuit of Sasuke.

194
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,675
-Ow ow ow.

195
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:52,875
-Hmph.

196
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:53,775
-Oh, Naruto.

197
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:05,805
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I can only
ever do little things for him.

198
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:06,965
YAMATO (VOICEOVER):
It doesn't matter

199
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,895
whether the things you do
for him are great or small.

200
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,905
What matters most is
how much you care,

201
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,755
really care about Naruto.

202
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:44,795
-A shooting star.

203
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:56,705
Sasuke.

204
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,845
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

205
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:34,945
Damn it.

206
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:44,925
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

207
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,755
But as long as I don't give in.

208
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:59,885
If I just keep going
without bothering to rest,

209
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:02,825
I'll get there.

210
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:03,705
-All right.

211
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,023
Here we go.

212
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,845
I did it!

213
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:13,695
-Huh?

214
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:15,835
Boy, this training method
really is something.

215
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,955
I can't believe he
succeeded so quickly.

216
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:23,945
-No, it's not just the training
method spurring him forward.

217
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,785
-Huh?

218
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:30,925
-His driving force is Sasuke.

219
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,755
-We did it!

220
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,765
We cut the waterfall!

221
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,755
Yeah!

222
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:36,755
We got it good.

223
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,895
-Phew.

224
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:43,695
-Well done.

225
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:46,705
Now we can start developing
your own signature jutsu.

226
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:51,725
-Yeah, sure, you got it.

227
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,815
-Naruto, you OK?

228
00:19:57,825 --> 00:20:00,855
I guess he overdid it a little.

229
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,965
-G-- gotta get--

230
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:04,675
-What?

231
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,805
What's that?

232
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:11,735
-Gotta get something to eat.

233
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,875
-Naruto, you never
cease to amaze.

234
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
[theme music]

235
00:21:57,675 --> 00:21:59,815
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Shizune,
have we tracked them down yet?

236
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,845
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Our
platoons are in the field

237
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:02,915
now, Milady.

238
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,955
They're searching everywhere
within 150 kilometers

239
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,745
of the Fire Temple.

240
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,885
But so far, no one
has encountered

241
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,735
any of the Akatsuki.

242
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:11,795
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Why not?

243
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:13,915
An ant couldn't slip through
the perimeter we set up.

244
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:14,945
Where the hell are they?

245
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,735
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Well--

246
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:18,775
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): And why
hasn't Team Asuma reported

247
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,725
in from the Fire Temple?

248
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,735
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- The Old Monk's Prayer.
