1
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,759
(painful screaming)

2
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:18,838
Spill it! How were
you able to recreate
Neji's chakra?!

3
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:23,480
Of course. I get it
now! You use the chakra
that you absorb from
someone, and then you

4
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:27,556
copy that person and
their chakra! Is that
right?

5
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:34,068
As the war rages on,
the enemy uses a new
tactic: White Zetsu
clones infiltrate the

6
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:39,880
Allied Forces. A
barrier protects each
camp's perimeter,
making infiltration

7
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:45,257
difficult. But it
seems there might be
a weakness in the
barrier. Team eight

8
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,461
has come to
investigate it.

9
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:03,093
You know, guys, I think
we might have just walked
into something really
dangerous, here.

10
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:07,201
Yeah, but at least
it's clear for now.
This is the spot
where the barrier's

11
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,307
weak. This is where
the Zetsu are entering.

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,115
And there's bound to
be a lot of them. So
be careful.

13
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:16,720
Byakugan!

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,795
Kiba!

15
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:22,599
Fang over fang!

16
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,201
(painful grunt)

17
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:28,343
(attack grunt)

18
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,182
Hidden Jutsu:
Beetle Sphere!

19
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:34,422
Kiba!

20
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,300
How many of them
are there?!

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:45,845
Don't let them touch
you. That's because if
they do, they'll absorb
our chakra!

22
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:50,253
Easier said than done.
How can we take them
down without touching
them?!

23
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:55,197
I just sent out a
messenger owl. So the
sealing corps should
arrive here in a little

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,134
while to seal up
this mine.

25
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,873
And what, we're
just supposed to
wait until then?!

26
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,041
Oh, come on! Things
are just going from
bad to worse!

27
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:20,013
Hinata! Kiba!
Shino!

28
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,517
They're finally
here!

29
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,986
The Sealing Corps?

30
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,527
We'll start sealing
this place immediately!
So please, exit this way!

31
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,908
Quick! Stop them!

32
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:38,383
Man, they sure are
persistent! All right!
Fang over fang!

33
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,567
Careful! There's
oil on the ground!

34
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,948
Those are Paper
Bombs used for
mining!

35
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,185
Not good! They're
gonna explode!

36
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,524
Akamaru,
Dynamic
Marking!

37
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,300
(heavy coughing)

38
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:06,045
Are you doing
okay, Akamaru?!

39
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,922
This is terrible...

40
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,357
<i>Is anyone there?!</i>

41
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,197
Shino!
Hinata!

42
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,067
I'm over here.

43
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,036
Huh?

44
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:25,217
Oh, Shino! Good,
you're okay!

45
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,285
<i>Yeah.</i>

46
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,354
Where's Hinata?

47
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,124
I don't know.

48
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:33,667
Yeah, I guess those
Paper Bombs caught us
all a bit by surprise.

49
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:38,611
(sigh)

50
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:40,815
We'd better go
look for her,
then.

51
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:44,388
Kiba, couldn't you
locate her by her
scent?

52
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:47,729
No, I can't. The
smell of smoke is
too strong.

53
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,006
Hinata! Where
are you?!

54
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:03,627
At least I'm not
sensing the enemy
anymore. I guess
that explosion took

55
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:08,771
care of those
white guys. So
something good
came out of it.

56
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:13,614
With a blast that
strong, the exit
might have been
sealed off.

57
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,616
Huh? Kiba!

58
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,851
Huh?!

59
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,589
Are you okay?

60
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,865
Nah, it's no
good. He's dead.

61
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,076
Who's there?!

62
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:30,581
Kiba! Shino!

63
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,787
Hinata! You're
all right!

64
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:37,895
The ground gave way,
and I fell down to a
lower level beneath us.

65
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,534
<i>Is that?!</i>

66
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:45,611
I know, it's really
unfortunate. Wasn't
there another guy from
the Sailing Corps, though?

67
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,615
Maybe we can get to
him in time.

68
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,322
Yes, there was. Let's
find him and get out
of this place.

69
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:52,424
<i>Right.</i>

70
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,863
No, we can't
leave yet.

71
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,134
Hm? And why not?!

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,944
<i>This shinobi didn't</i>
<i>die because of the</i>
<i>explosion. Rather, he</i>
<i>was fatally wounded</i>

73
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:03,112
by a kunai.

74
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,622
You're absolutely
certain that he was
killed after the
explosion?!

75
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:11,897
Yes, I am. At least
one of the enemy
has survived.

76
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,771
They can absorb a
victim's chakra and
transform into them.

77
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:21,115
In all this confusion,
he'll be able to slip
right back in among
our forces and strike

78
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:22,417
at us again.

79
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,156
Are you saying
that one of us
is a fake?!

80
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,260
It's not
impossible.

81
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:31,469
There's no way!
All of us are on
the same team, here!
We'd be able to see

82
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:32,972
through a fake,
right?

83
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:37,749
I wonder about that.
Hinata, why aren't you
using your Byakugan?

84
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:43,326
Well, because, the
Sealing Team's barrier
jutsu was incomplete
when it was activated,

85
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,631
and it disrupted
my Byakugan.

86
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,835
Oh, did it now?

87
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,574
Wait, do you suspect
that Hinata's the
impostor?

88
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:54,516
Kiba, is it really
true that your nose
isn't working?

89
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:56,553
You suspect me, too?!

90
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:01,095
What about you? How
do we know you're
the real Shino?!

91
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:04,368
Because they didn't
lay a hand on me in
our earlier skirmish.

92
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,644
So what? They could
have gotten your chakra
from any number of your
insects!

93
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:12,317
That's true. There's
no way that I can
disprove that.

94
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,488
However, I am
the real me.

95
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,560
Yeah, and I'm the
real me, too!

96
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,797
And I'm really me!

97
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,739
<i>This is a pointless</i>
<i>argument. That's</i>
<i>because none of us</i>
<i>can convince the</i>

98
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:25,143
<i>others that we are</i>
<i>truly ourselves.</i>

99
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:28,717
Guess you're right!
But if we can't trust
each other, then I
say we should just

100
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:35,163
all go our separate
ways! I'll find the
other Sealing Corps
guy on my own! Akamaru!

101
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:35,965
(sad whine)

102
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,267
Kiba!

103
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:52,932
<i>It seems that none</i>
<i>of us can trust the</i>
<i>others, and that</i>
<i>includes you and me.</i>

104
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:05,658
(painful grunts)

105
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:13,707
Oh, thank goodness!
Can you give me a
hand, please?

106
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,511
(frightened gasp)

107
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,280
(painful screaming)

108
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,377
What happened?

109
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:35,283
It's the second
Sealing Corps
member...

110
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,553
How terrible...

111
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,759
This proves that
there's an impostor
among us.

112
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,554
What are you
doing, Kiba?

113
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:57,995
Don't play dumb! He
was gripping this
scrap of fabric
in his hand!

114
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,701
From the scent, it
came off your cloak!

115
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,874
Admit it! You're
the impostor Shino!

116
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:04,843
(gasp)

117
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,153
<i>You're the one who</i>
<i>brought up fakes</i>
<i>in the first place!</i>
<i>I've had my doubts</i>

118
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:11,355
<i>about you all</i>
<i>along!</i>

119
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:16,967
That fabric got
ripped off in the
explosion. And
besides, if I were

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,808
the fake, why
would I introduce
the ideas of there
being impostors!

121
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:24,983
You probably figured
that if you brought it
up first, no one would
suspect you!

122
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,822
But, damn it, I'm
not gonna fall for
that trick!

123
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,324
Now!

124
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,604
<i>Hold it! If we let</i>
<i>the fake manipulate</i>
<i>us, we'll end up</i>
<i>killing each other!</i>

125
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:40,246
That's what the
enemy wants! We're
playing right into
their hands!

126
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,045
<i>There's one thing I</i>
<i>know for sure in this</i>
<i>situation. Only one</i>
<i>of us is a fake.</i>

127
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,757
<i>That's because if both</i>
<i>of them were impostors,</i>
<i>they could attack me</i>
<i>without hesitation.</i>

128
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,534
<i>Whichever of them it is,</i>
<i>they're waiting for me</i>
<i>and the other real one</i>
<i>to destroy each other.</i>

129
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,440
Then what do you
intend to do? Just
stay here until
who knows when?!

130
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:31,516
<i>I have only one</i>
<i>idea: Rock-Paper-</i>
<i>Scissors.</i>

131
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,618
Huh?

132
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,056
Are you serious?
Rock-Paper-Scissors,
now?

133
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,197
<i>Yes. The loser must</i>
<i>answer the questions</i>
<i>the other two pose.</i>

134
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,572
But why couldn't we
just take turns
answering each
others questions?

135
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,276
<i>No! Rock-Paper-</i>
<i>Scissors!</i>

136
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,351
I don't get why
we'd bother to do
that, but okay...

137
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:51,455
<i>Rock-Paper-Scissors!</i>

138
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,829
I won...

139
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,171
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

140
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,444
What are your
favorite things?

141
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,014
Hm?

142
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:07,153
Well, I guess I like
beef jerky and going
on walks with Akamaru.

143
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,794
All right.
Again.

144
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,832
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

145
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,272
<i>Rock-Paper-Scissors!</i>

146
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,608
Rock-Paper-...

147
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:20,714
Listen, do we really
have to do the Rock-
Paper-Scissors part?

148
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:24,321
Yes we do. It's
the most important
part of all.

149
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,095
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

150
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm the one who
lost that time.

151
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,538
<i>What are your</i>
<i>favorite things?</i>

152
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,744
I like a lot of
things, but I guess
I like sweets the
best.

153
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,113
Come on, tell
the truth!

154
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,786
What's wrong! I
did tell the truth!

155
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,591
What you actually
like the best is
Naruto, right?

156
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,094
(gasp)

157
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:47,500
What?! Is this really
the kind of thing you're
going to ask me?!

158
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,139
Ha ha ha! I'm just
kidding, Hinata!

159
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:50,941
(kiba laughing)

160
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,110
Again.

161
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,682
I was just joking
around! Lighten up
a little, would you?

162
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,753
Let's just continue.

163
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,189
Okay, okay.

164
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,193
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

165
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:04,067
<i>Rock-Paper-Scissors!</i>

166
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:09,478
That means you lost,
Shino, so here's my
question. And this is
something that only the

167
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:12,918
real Shino would
know the answer to!

168
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:18,062
The first time that
we went after Sasuke,
you were the only one
who was left behind.

169
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,868
How did you feel
about that?

170
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:25,577
I cannot answer
that question. Or
rather, I won't.

171
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:30,486
Come on, that isn't
fair! If you play like
that, then this entire
exercise is pointless!

172
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:34,294
If you want to know
the truth, then you're
going to have to take
me down.

173
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,430
Do what?!

174
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:39,404
There's real meaning
to be found in this.
You'll see...

175
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:44,716
<i>Rock-Paper-</i>
<i>Scissors! Go!</i>

176
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,619
I won again!

177
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:47,822
One more time.

178
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:49,859
Why do we have
to say it over
and over?

179
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:53,032
Because that is the
most critical part.

180
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,940
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

181
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,846
It's your
turn, Shino!

182
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,983
No, the game
is over now.

183
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:04,889
What?! You can't
just go changing
the rules!

184
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:10,433
<i>I've been thinking.</i>
<i>With Captain Yamato</i>
<i>held captive, it's</i>
<i>possible the enemy</i>

185
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,437
<i>has obtained</i>
<i>personal intel</i>
<i>on us.</i>

186
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,611
Do you really
believe they'd
go so far as
to do that?!

187
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:21,823
Yes, of course. That's
because a major part
of their whole strategy
involves impersonating us.

188
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:26,331
And so, it's crucial
that they know the
thoughts and habits
of each person that

189
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,102
they might copy.

190
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,108
Huh! Makes sense when
you put it that way.
Does that mean that
everything we've been

191
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,179
doing here is
meaningless, then?

192
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:36,786
Don't make me
repeat myself.
Playing Rock-
Paper-Scissors

193
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,422
<i>has a purpose.</i>

194
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:44,869
I don't trust either
of you, after all.
I'll take both of
you down!

195
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:46,906
(attacking grunts)

196
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,344
Hey! Whose side
are you on, here!

197
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,454
Damn it! All
right, fine!

198
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,325
Let's go,
Akamaru!

199
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,968
Agh! Fang Over Fang!

200
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:07,982
Don't you worry,
Kiba! I'll be back
you up! I'm sure
that he's the phony!

201
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:10,988
(attacking grunt)

202
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:13,359
Gentle Fist!

203
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,603
<i>I won't let</i>
<i>you get away!</i>

204
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:28,657
These flames will
keep you from using
your insects!

205
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,633
Here I come! Take
this: Fang Over Fang!

206
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,510
(painful screaming)

207
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,018
Kiba...

208
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:48,462
Yes! We did it!
Now we can get out
of this cave!

209
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,874
That's true. But
only for me...

210
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,978
Huh?! What?!

211
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,015
Haahhh!

212
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:01,221
Akamaru!

213
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,603
<i>Ta-dah!</i>

214
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:10,206
The star of the
show appears!

215
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,210
No way! You were
the fake all along?!

216
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:16,920
I was getting really
nervous that you'd start
asking touchy questions
during that game.

217
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:21,428
<i>But like your friend</i>
<i>said, the intel that we</i>
<i>got out of Yamato about</i>
<i>all of you has proved to</i>

218
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:27,508
<i>be invaluable. Because</i>
<i>of it, you guys have had</i>
<i>a falling out and saved</i>
<i>me a lot of trouble.</i>

219
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,144
Ugh!

220
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:32,050
<i>And with your mutt</i>
<i>down, even I can</i>
<i>beat you now!</i>

221
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,022
So the Shino I fought
was the real one?!

222
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,928
I'm so stupid!

223
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:41,268
<i>You're right!</i>
<i>You are stupid.</i>

224
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,140
That's because
you're the real
Kiba.

225
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:47,413
And now you have
shown your true
colors.

226
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,282
(gasp)

227
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,595
No way! You're
still alive?! But
how can that be?!

228
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,837
<i>Because of you, I</i>
<i>had to sacrifice</i>
<i>many of my precious</i>
<i>insects...</i>

229
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,312
Your insects? Then
the one I defeated
was an Insect Clone?!

230
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,016
Exactly.

231
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,155
How did you ever
figure out that
I was the fake?!

232
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:12,096
I didn't figure it
out. I didn't know
who was the fake.

233
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,440
But still, I thought
about it after we
first faced each
other. Even if there

234
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,077
was a fake among us.

235
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:25,389
If it was possible for
the impostor to remain
transformed, would we
truly be able to fight

236
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:28,530
against each other
in earnest?

237
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:30,099
(painful grunt)

238
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:33,840
Gentle Fist!

239
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:34,809
Ahhh!

240
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,411
Then let's
finish him!

241
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,317
(painful screaming)

242
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:47,300
If we trust our
comrades, can we
really bring ourselves
to take them down?

243
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,141
Then I started
thinking about
something even
more ridiculous.

244
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:57,153
If I was going to be
defeated by someone
like that, then maybe
it was for the best.

245
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:58,924
And then, it
became clear.

246
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:03,967
I'd make it appear
that the real me had
been taken down. I was
certain that you'd

247
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,271
reveal yourself
after that happened.

248
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:08,877
That's why we played
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

249
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,379
Rock-Paper-Scissors?

250
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:13,520
So they were
actually hand
signals.

251
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:17,060
But, why do we have
to say it over and
over?

252
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:21,034
Why? Because that is
the most critical part.

253
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:25,209
After he said that,
I started to figure
it out.

254
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,984
Earlier, the message
that you gave me was...

255
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,321
...Follow my
instructions.

256
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:35,429
And then,
after that...

257
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:38,837
If you want to know
the truth, then
you're gonna have
to take me down.

258
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,713
I wasn't entirely sure
what you meant to do,
but when you came at me
they way that you did,

259
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,751
I simply reacted
and then...

260
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,688
<i>It worked out.</i>

261
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:51,094
And all thanks to
you taking down
my Insect Clone.

262
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:54,134
You revealed
yourself.

263
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:59,010
And since you knew
my hand signals,
that meant you were
the real Kiba.

264
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:05,222
So you played a dirty
little trick on me,
huh? Fine, I'll just
take both of you down!

265
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:11,268
It's useless. And
that's because you are
completely at the mercy
of my jutsu already!

266
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,074
I'll avenge your
two victims!

267
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:17,146
Hidden Jutsu!
Beetle Tornado!

268
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,186
(painful screaming)

269
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,966
Thanks, Shino. You
did a great job
with that guy.

270
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:32,644
I must say, though, I
had serious misgivings
about fighting a comrade
with my full strength.

271
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:36,051
But you had no qualms
about using your Fang
Over Fang against me.

272
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:40,761
You're the one who
told me to do that!
And besides, you came
at me first, or did

273
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,598
you forget that part?!

274
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:46,706
I didn't know which of
you two was actually the
impostor, so I had to pick
one of you to attack.

275
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:49,244
Of course, there's
no way I'd attack
a girl.

276
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:51,549
Hnh! Quit trying to
act all chivalrous!

277
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:55,356
Wait, hold on a
minute! We brought
down the impostor...

278
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,861
But where's the
real Hinata?

279
00:19:58,495 --> 00:19:59,431
(gasp)

280
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:08,850
Are you all
right, Hinata?

281
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:14,227
I'm fine, Kiba.
Akamaru, hi!

282
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,768
Oh, and Shino, too!

283
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,542
Always the last one...

284
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:28,155
(relieved sigh)

285
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,025
What happened
anyway?

286
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,163
Eh, nothing
much, really.

287
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:36,371
However, during this
incident, the most
closely guarded secret
of the Allied Shinobi

288
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,710
Forces was almost
leaked to the enemy.

289
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:41,181
What closely guarded
secret is that?

290
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,653
That you're in
love with Naruto.

291
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:44,722
(gasp)

292
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,726
What?! But
how did...?!

293
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,101
It slipped out when
Kiba was teasing you,
and then that Zetsu-

294
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:55,677
Why are you telling
her that?! Shut up,
idiot! It seems that
in order to impersonate

295
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,852
all of us better,
those White Zetsu
guys got a lot of
personal intel from

296
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,321
Captain Yamato!

297
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:08,435
Wait, does that mean
they know that secret?
The one that only
Captain Yamato knows?

298
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,511
Including the secret
from that time when I...

299
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,416
Even a secret
like this?

300
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:22,798
That's it! Then
we've got to destroy
all of them! Each
and every one!

301
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah!

302
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:02,463
Sasuke?! How are
you alive?!

303
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:04,902
<i>Tell me where</i>
<i>Naruto is.</i>

304
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:08,776
I don't know! But
you need to pay
attention to me
right now! Hmph!

305
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,014
<i>My business is</i>
<i>with Naruto.</i>

306
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:15,322
Damn it, not that
crap again! You
don't give a damn
about me, do you?!

307
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:16,424
<i>No.</i>

308
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,934
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Aesthetics</i>
<i>of an Artist.</i>

309
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,642
I'll wipe that smug
expression right
off your face!
