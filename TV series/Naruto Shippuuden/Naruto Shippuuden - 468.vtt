00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:13.200 position:35% line:77% align:start
(Hagoromo)
I'll now announce the name of
the successor to Ninshu.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
The one who'll take
over Ninshu is...

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
My youngest son, Ashura!

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:27.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
Lord Hagoromo!

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, father?!  I'm nowhere near
Elder Brother's Ninshu skill!

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not even close!

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have made my decision.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.868 position:10% line:77% align:start
Father, please, just tell me
what it is that I've done to
make you dissatisfied with me...

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:46.467 position:10% line:71% align:start
I've received word that the
village which I'd put you in
charge of is now near
destruction.

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasp] It's what!?

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:49.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
But, how could--!?

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
You... did you
use force to...?

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:56.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
No. Do I look like
a fool to you?

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:57.868 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Explain to me what you did.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just did the same thing
that Ashura did.

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.734 position:7% line:77% align:start
I gave the villagers the water
that they needed, and I dealt
with the Divine Tree.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
The only difference was that I
handled it on my own, father!

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that affected the
outcome drastically.

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:21.567 position:7% line:77% align:start
After you left, the villagers
fought over water rights and
ended up destroying themselves.

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:26.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Happiness obtained the easy
way never lasts long.

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:32.767 position:7% line:77% align:start
But Ashura labored alongside
the people to open up a path
to their future.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:38.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
Happiness that is hard-earned is
much more difficult to destroy.

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:43.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
Indra, you possess a wonderful
power known as the Sharingan.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ashura's grown and matured, but
he still lacks in power.

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:53.667 position:10% line:77% align:start
Please, lend him your power
moving forward and support the
growth of Ninshu alongside him.

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grimace]

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:13.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
Brother...

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:25.434 position:47% line:89% align:start

âª

00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:10.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why? Why didn't my
father choose me?

00:04:10.567 --> 00:04:13.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah exactly! The one who has
power rules the world!

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mean, that's
just common sense!

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you possess enough power to
decide everything, Master Indra!

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:21.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
I say you appeal to Lord
Hagoromo again.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:23.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
And we'll support you!

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:27.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you, the both of you.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:31.801 position:7% line:77% align:start
Of course! There's no need for
thanks. We just want to support
you.

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right. we'll do anything.

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:37.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:40.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
[crashing sound]

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:46.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
[happy villager chatter]

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:48.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
Man, I've never
seen such a feast!

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:52.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Today we celebrate the successor
of Ninshu being chosen!

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:55.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everyone, eat up and enjoy
to your heart's content!

00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:57.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you guys! Let's eat!

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:03.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
[happy laughter]

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:06.901 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:10.801 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, I'm beginning to think
that we might have come here at
a bad time.

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:14.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nah, don't worry about it.

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:20.133 position:13% line:77% align:start
To be honest, I'm actually
feeling relieved that Ashura
was the one who was picked.

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:22.000 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ashura's big brother is smart,

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:27.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
and he's a genius when
it comes to Ninshu.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
But there's a
coldness about him.

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:35.133 position:13% line:77% align:start
If he'd been named as the
successor, I think that we'd all
end up just being scared of him.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:41.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, Ashura understands
people's pain.

00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:46.300 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yeah, he can be a bit dense...
but this recent journey of ours
really matured him.

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.834 position:5% line:77% align:start
Enough to make you fall in love
with him and follow him all the
way here, right?

00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?!

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're blushing, you know!

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Idiot!

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:56.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:02.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, where
is Ashura, anyway?

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:18.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ashura...

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:21.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
Something troubling you?

00:06:21.868 --> 00:06:23.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:27.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
Indra is different than
he once was.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:29.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's because
of the Sharingan.

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Sharingan?

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:36.334 position:5% line:77% align:start
I've observed Indra's Sharingan,
and its power overwhelms
everyone.

00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:40.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
It happened even before
Indra realized.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:45.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's how incredibly powerful
Indra's Sharingan is.

00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:54.133 position:5% line:77% align:start
But it's also that power that's
stopped Indra from being able to
understand how others feel.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:57.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
And ultimately, it has closed
off his heart.

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:01.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you are different.

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
You understand the human heart.

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:08.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why you enhanced
Ninshu with love.

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:14.234 position:5% line:77% align:start
And in turn, that nurtured trust
among people, creating bonds and
friendship.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
Friendship?

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:21.934 position:10% line:77% align:start
A bond is something that can
only be created after sharing
hardships together.

00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:25.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
It overflows with
love and compassion.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:29.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
As long as such bonds exist,
Ninshu won't be used for evil.

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:36.133 position:10% line:77% align:start
However, power without bonds
will bring great calamity upon
the world.

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:45.634 position:10% line:77% align:start
Ashura. I ask that you join
forces with your brother and
spread the bond of Ninshu.

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:48.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Father, I.

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:52.467 position:27% line:77% align:start
Yes, Father, I
From this moment onward, I
entrust my power to you.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ashura!

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:01.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, where could
he have run off?

00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:06.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
[explosion]
[gasp]

00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:10.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:12.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
What is that?

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:27.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:31.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
[panicked screams]

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:32.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
What is that!?

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:41.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, no! Kanna! Are
you all right?

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:42.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:42.868 --> 00:08:44.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
What just happened?

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:53.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasp] Elder Brother?!

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:02.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Indra, Just what is
the meaning of this?

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:06.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell me why! Why didn't you
choose me as your successor?

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:12.334 position:10% line:77% align:start
It isn't power that controls
Ninshu, but love.  That is what
I've decided.

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:14.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's love?

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:16.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
But there's no need for love.

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:21.734 position:7% line:77% align:start
During my journey&amp; just like
Ashura did, I sought out the
villager's pain.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:26.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
But ultimately, the villagers
ended up relying on my power.

00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:31.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
The weak revered me as their
king and wanted that power.

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:38.033 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ashura was lacking. That's why
he found it necessary to rely on
the cooperation of others.

00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:40.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
But I'm different!

00:09:40.834 --> 00:09:43.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't need the help
of the weak.

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:48.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can use my own power to
establish total order!

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:51.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll create a world completely
without conflict!

00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:55.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's just what my mother,
Kaguya, wanted to do.

00:09:55.667 --> 00:10:00.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Those who possess power must
never forget the human heart.

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:05.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
People may not be able to
progress as swiftly as you.

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:10.734 position:5% line:77% align:start
And if they aren't able to walk
at the same pace, from their
standpoint...

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:15.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
...they can only fear power
that has no bond.

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:17.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then I'll just force
them to obey.

00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:20.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please stop this, Elder Brother!

00:10:20.634 --> 00:10:22.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
You would've given your
life to protect me once!

00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:24.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's how kind
you were back then!

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:28.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ashura, I am no longer that man.

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:32.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't return to being him!

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:33.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
Indra...

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:36.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
Your eyes!

00:10:37.968 --> 00:10:41.734 position:7% line:77% align:start
Of course! There's no need for
thanks. We just want to support
you.

(Hagoromo) Soon after, I heard
rumors that Indra had
established a sect of Ninjutsu
that idolized power.

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:56.267 position:7% line:77% align:start

misfortune that the Sharingan
brings about on a stone tablet.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.033 position:5% line:77% align:start
But Zetsu took advantage of it,
so that effort seems to have
been a total waste.

00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:12.400 position:5% line:77% align:start
Ashura. It seems that my time in
this world with you is coming to
an end now.

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:22.767 position:5% line:77% align:start

guide this world as well as I
would've liked.

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
That simply isn't true!

00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:29.167 position:5% line:77% align:start
After all, we were able to pass
on your will to many people
through Ninshu, father!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
And yet I leave behind some
who won't accept it...

00:18:34.534 --> 00:18:37.767 position:21% line:83% align:start

me last night.

There's no need for me
to do that anymore.

00:19:00.234 --> 00:19:06.467 position:16% line:77% align:start
I came here, to end the
future of this hell that's
disguised as Ninshu.

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:11.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
You've always feared the power
my grandmother possessed.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:16.801 position:16% line:77% align:start
But instead of trying to
understand that enormous power,
you merely ran from it...

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:20.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
...using ideas such as "love"
and "bonds" as a shield.

00:19:20.133 --> 00:19:28.200 position:21% line:71% align:start
Your selfish, naÃ¯ve
misconceptions will mar
the future of Ninshu with wars
and disasters.

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:32.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Until I'm able to destroy Ashura
and all of his brethren...

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:36.501 position:16% line:77% align:start
...and wipe your failed
ideas of Ninshu from the
face of this world,...

00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:39.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
I won't stop fighting.

00:19:39.634 --> 00:19:44.968 position:16% line:77% align:start
Till then, my soul will
reincarnate and fight,
however long it takes!

Father, please be at peace.

00:19:55.834 --> 00:20:00.701 position:10% line:77% align:start
If Elder Brother's soul will
reincarnate over and over, then
mine shall, as well,

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:03.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
for however long it may take.

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:12.033 position:10% line:77% align:start

And as Indra had warned, the
battle between them waged on.

00:20:25.634 --> 00:20:29.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
It continued over and
over again...

...never ending.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:37.701 position:5% line:77% align:start

many comrades and kin on both
sides.

00:20:37.734 --> 00:20:41.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hate begat hate, and it reached
a point of no return.

The fighting continued even
after Ashura and Indra had died,

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:50.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
passed on to the numerous
reincarnates of their souls.

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:55.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
To you, Senju Hashirama, and
to Madara Uchiha.

00:20:55.601 --> 00:21:01.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
And now, to Naruto Uzumaki
and Sasuke Uchiha.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.701 position:5% line:77% align:start
All of you must do everything in
your power to save Naruto and
Sasuke.

00:21:06.734 --> 00:21:13.901 position:5% line:77% align:start
I have implicit faith that those
two will find the true solution
to this fate of shinobi...
