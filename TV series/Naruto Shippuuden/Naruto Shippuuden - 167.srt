00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,246
{\an1}And that made me happy!

166
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,413
{\an1}But then-- [gasping]

167
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:07,979
{\an1}--the Akatsuki came
after my friends and me.

168
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,114
{\an1}Damn it, I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore!

{\an1}have been hard for you, Naruto.

171
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,481
I'm sorry.

172
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,747
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time on "Naruto Shippuden"--

173
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,814
"Fourth Hokage."

174
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:23,881
{\an1}FOURTH HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, how old are you now?
