00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,963
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): If I
only focus on the Rasengan,

4
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,604
I mess up the change
in chakra nature.

5
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:18,564
But if I concentrate
too much on that,

6
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,584
my Rasengan doesn't
turn out right.

7
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:32,514
I'm pathetic.

8
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:34,634
-It's because I truly
believe that you

9
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:38,564
are the only shinobi who can
surpass the Fourth Hokage.

10
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,454
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Kakashi-sensei

11
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,454
had such high hopes for me.

12
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:49,614
But it turns out I'm
a complete failure.

13
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,524
-What should we do?

14
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:57,604
You think we should
stop the training?

15
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,614
-Hm.

16
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:03,524
Well, if that's
what he wants to do.

17
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:05,524
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I-- I--

18
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,574
-Dammit!

19
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:01,444
I don't have anymore
time to waste!

20
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:02,444
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

21
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:29,624
Huh?

22
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,504
Be careful, you guys!

23
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,614
We got another one turning
into the Nine Tails!

24
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:53,564
[screaming]

25
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:59,434
-Captain Yamato!

26
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:00,474
Help us!

27
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,594
-Tenzo, here it comes!

28
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:26,634
You OK?

29
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:37,644
It's been one full
day since we started

30
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,444
trying to add the wind change
in nature to the Rasengan,

31
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:44,514
and you're using 200
shadow clones now.

32
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,474
You've just achieved
what the average ninja

33
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:49,434
would take 4,800 hours to do.

34
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:51,504
But I guess that's still
not enough for you.

35
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:53,504
-This training's impossible.

36
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,634
I can't wrap my around the
chakra control technique,

37
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,634
and it feels like 200
shadow clones is my limit.

38
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:00,594
No way.

39
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:05,474
I'm never going to
be able to master it.

40
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:08,524
It takes all my concentration
to form the basic Rasengan

41
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:10,424
in the first place.

42
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:16,474
Adding a change in nature to
that-- it's just too much.

43
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,644
-You're unusually negative.

44
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:20,634
That's not like you.

45
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:23,534
You don't sound like the
Naruto Uzumaki I know.

46
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,524
-Oh, Said.

47
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,504
-You'll catch cold.

48
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:36,444
So, how's Naruto's training?

49
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,604
SAKURA: Learning to add
a change in chakra nature

50
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:45,614
to the Rasengan is
harder than he thought.

51
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,544
Mastering difficult
skills has never

52
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,564
been Naruto's strong suit.

53
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,514
-Well, that's why
Kakashi-sensei is

54
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,634
having him learn the technique
through action, right?

55
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:54,614
-Yeah.

56
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,584
Training only Naruto can do.

57
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,524
They can double the
amount of training

58
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:05,584
he gets by using two
clones, and he's using 200.

59
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:09,584
-Still, incorporating a change
in chakra nature into a jutsu

60
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:13,584
by itself is a difficult
enough hurdle to get over.

61
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,534
To say nothing of the fact
that the Rasengan was a jutsu

62
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,544
invented by the Fourth Hokage.

63
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,594
To try and add
something to it now,

64
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:24,484
especially for someone like
Naruto, may be impossible.

65
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,584
-You have a point.

66
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:37,554
Naruto is an idiot.

67
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,544
He's a clumsy, tactless fool.

68
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:42,514
For him to perfect something
as intricate as a modification

69
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:48,454
of the Rasengan-- you know
as well as I he can't do it.

70
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,524
And yet Kakashi-sensei
and Captain Yamato

71
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,634
have been sticking it out
with him all this time.

72
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,634
Meanwhile, the village
is forming platoons

73
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,604
to fend off the Akatsuki.

74
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,554
This is a total
waste of manpower.

75
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,524
I don't know what
the Hokage expects

76
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:05,624
from a no talent like Naruto.

77
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,474
-Say another word, and
I'll knock you out.

78
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:21,534
And exactly what do you
know about Naruto, anyway?

79
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,434
Sure, Naruto's not
the brightest guy.

80
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:26,644
He's clumsy, he goofs off,
and he's a bird brain.

81
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,514
But no one will surprise
you more than him.

82
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,484
He's saved our butts more
times than I can even count.

83
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,584
Every time someone expects him
to fail, he proves them wrong.

84
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:39,584
That's who Naruto Uzumaki is.

85
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:44,464
And if you're his teammate,
you'll remember that!

86
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:46,434
What the-- you're smiling?

87
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,454
I'll pummel you!

88
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,494
-There's no need for that.

89
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,554
But, you know,
sometimes the knowledge

90
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,514
found in books can
be fairly useful.

91
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,524
SAKURA: The Understanding
People's Feelings Series.

92
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:03,634
When Words Can Mean The
Opposite Of How You Feel?

93
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,414
Sai?

94
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:06,414
You mean you--

95
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:08,454
- I understand just
how completely you

96
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,414
believe in Naruto.

97
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:13,454
And I also know that you
will never betray his trust.

98
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,454
-Hey, hang on.

99
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,534
You tricked me, Sai?

100
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:20,614
-It would be a shame if Naruto
had to eat all those awful mud

101
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:22,614
balls of yours and didn't
get any results out

102
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:24,434
of his training.

103
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,574
Don't you agree?

104
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,604
-What do you mean by mud balls?

105
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,614
I just value their
effectiveness over taste!

106
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,494
You know, before you go reading
the true feelings of others,

107
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:36,424
maybe you should figure out
how to talk about your own!

108
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:37,514
-Don't worry, Sakura.

109
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:40,454
Naruto will pull it off.

110
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:41,444
-Oh, Sai.

111
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,524
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

112
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,414
Hang in there.

113
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:49,494
-I don't know.

114
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:52,484
I have no reason to think
it's going to work this time.

115
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:53,634
-You have to do it, anyway.

116
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:56,504
-Yeah, well, that's
easy for you to say.

117
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,584
Why don't you tell me this?

118
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:00,644
Could you look to the left and
the right at the same time?

119
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:02,504
-Hm?

120
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:03,574
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): He's right.

121
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,494
That is impossible.

122
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,464
-Oh, I see.

123
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:12,524
If you're asking me--
yeah, I guess it's doable.

124
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:12,644
-Huh?

125
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,634
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

126
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:24,554
I'm looking to the right
while looking to the left.

127
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:26,584
This is what you mean, right?

128
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,434
-I get it!

129
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,504
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
What does he get?

130
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,604
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

131
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:55,594
[groaning]

132
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,544
-You went to the trouble of
calling us back here just

133
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:08,414
to seal the Two Tails?

134
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:10,424
-It will take three days.

135
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,594
Prepare yourselves.

136
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,484
-Three days?

137
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:15,484
Oh, man.

138
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:17,554
It's raining where we are.

139
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:18,544
-Hidan.

140
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,504
Shut up.

141
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,644
-But I was this close to
slaughtering those Leaf morons.

142
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,534
I was just about to
prove to those heathens

143
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:30,514
the might of the way of Jashin.

144
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,424
-The Leaf aren't heathens.

145
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:38,544
They venerate their ancestors,
and follow the Will of Fire.

146
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,634
In fact, one could
say their motives

147
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:43,604
for fighting are just
as valid as yours.

148
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,464
-Huh?

149
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:46,514
How dare you.

150
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,464
Are you trying to insult me?

151
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,464
Huh?

152
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,554
-No.

153
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:54,614
I did not intend to ridicule
the reasons why you do battle.

154
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:58,584
After all, you and I
are birds of a feather.

155
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:02,524
It doesn't matter what
you use to justify war.

156
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:08,504
Religion, philosophy,
resources, land, revenge, love.

157
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,614
Even a whim.

158
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:13,434
No matter how
trivial the motive,

159
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,504
they're all worthy
causes for war.

160
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,414
There will always be war.

161
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:20,574
The reason can be found later.

162
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,534
Human instinct seeks conflict.

163
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:28,424
-Aw, nobody wants to hear
your long winded lecture.

164
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,614
Listen, I've got my own
way of doing things.

165
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,464
I have my own set of goals.

166
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:36,564
I don't intend to devote my
all to this organization.

167
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:38,414
All right?

168
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,454
-So long as you're
affiliated with the Akatsuki,

169
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:44,494
you will contribute
to its goals.

170
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:47,504
Once they have been
achieved, your own wishes

171
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:50,474
will be swiftly
granted, as well.

172
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:51,464
-Ha.

173
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,584
You can act all
cool if you want,

174
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:55,584
but it won't change the
fact that the only thing

175
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:58,604
the Akatsuki wants
is to make money.

176
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,544
You're the same as Kakuzu.

177
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,624
And fighting for money is
the motivation I hate most.

178
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,474
-You're right.

179
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,584
Our immediate ambition in indeed
financial, but the Akatsuki's

180
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,424
truth goal lies
elsewhere, and it

181
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,534
is one that will ultimately
cost a great deal of money

182
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,574
to fulfill.

183
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:20,524
-After Tobi, I'm the second
newest member of the team,

184
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,574
so I haven't heard anything
about this true goal from you.

185
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:27,504
You just plan stuff
behind my back.

186
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:30,424
-Are you sulking?

187
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,594
I suppose it's about
time I told you.

188
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,574
-Hm?

189
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,634
-The Akatsuki's
ultimate objective

190
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,594
will be accomplished in stages.

191
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:44,634
There are three steps in
total, the first being money.

192
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:47,604
The second is to use
that money to assemble

193
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:52,594
the first mercenary shinobi
army the world has seen.

194
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:55,554
-Come on, that's just like
what the shinobi villages

195
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:56,584
are already doing.

196
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:59,564
You complete a mission,
and you get a payment.

197
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:02,564
What, you want to become the
ruler of some tiny village that

198
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,414
doesn't have a
nation to support it?

199
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,554
Is that what we're
all doing here?

200
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,454
How stupid.

201
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:12,504
-A village supported
by a host nation?

202
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,444
You have it backwards.

203
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,484
-What?

204
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,444
-I'll explain it to
you sequentially.

205
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:23,454
For a nation that possesses
a powerful ninja village,

206
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:26,644
shinobi business plays a key
role in their profit structure.

207
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:29,614
Such villages earn
great revenues

208
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,554
participating in
conflicts both within

209
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:33,614
and beyond their
nation's borders.

210
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,454
They support that
nation's economy,

211
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,514
not the other way around.

212
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:40,534
In other words, in
order for that nation

213
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:44,554
to have steady revenue, war
becomes a necessary evil.

214
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:48,484
However, the current era has
seen only smaller conflicts.

215
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:52,534
There are no more great
wars, like in the past.

216
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:55,414
The villages have
downsized to save money,

217
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:58,464
and many shinobi
have lost their jobs.

218
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,634
Shinobi exist to fight.

219
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:02,454
They risk their lives for
the sake of their land,

220
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:04,614
and yet this is how
they're rewarded.

221
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:06,634
The five great nations
are still fine.

222
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:10,514
Those lands, and their ninja
villages are vast and trusted.

223
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:14,504
They're stable, receiving plenty
of missions from other lands.

224
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,624
But not so for the
smaller nations.

225
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,444
It takes an enormous
amount of money

226
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,514
to maintain a ninja village.

227
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,484
Those costs remain the same
in times of war or peace.

228
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:29,614
That being said, if a village
downsizes too drastically,

229
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:33,584
it won't be able to protect
itself from a sudden conflict.

230
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,534
That's where we
Akatsuki come in.

231
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:38,474
We will not align
ourselves to any nation,

232
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,584
and only mobilize the
necessary number of shinobi

233
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,634
at the appropriate time.

234
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:46,604
An organization that will accept
money for contracts of war

235
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,554
from both small nations
and ninja villages alike.

236
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:53,434
At first, we'll take on
all sorts of conflicts

237
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:57,434
for little profit, exclusively
cornering the entire war

238
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:58,494
market.

239
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:01,564
Then we will use the tailed
beasts to cause new wars

240
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:06,514
altogether, and eventually
we'll gain a complete monopoly.

241
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:11,454
We will control all war.

242
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:13,494
In the wake of this,
the ninja villages

243
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,554
of the five great
nations will collapse,

244
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:20,424
have no choice but
to use the Akatsuki.

245
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,534
Then, and only then
will we achieve

246
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:26,534
our true goal, which
lies just ahead.

247
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:34,574
It's the third and final step.

248
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:46,494
World domination.

249
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,425
-I see.

250
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,585
-Uh, ma'am?

251
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:15,605
What about Kurenai?

252
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:27,545
-Notify everyone else
regarding the funeral services.

253
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:28,645
I will inform Kurenai--

254
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:29,705
SHIKAMARU: No.

255
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:32,745
I'll do it.

256
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,635
I'd like to tell her myself.

257
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:37,645
I have a message for
her from Captain Asuma.

258
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,625
-All right!

259
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,545
Yeah, I think I'm finally
getting the hang of this thing!

260
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,725
-I see.

261
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:04,635
So that's what your
bright idea was, huh?

262
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:07,665
It took two of you to produce
the original Rasengan.

263
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,675
One to control the
chakra emission,

264
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:12,585
the other to control
the change in form.

265
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,555
Well done.

266
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:15,595
-Right!

267
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,705
I realized I was gonna
need a second set of hands

268
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,595
if I was never going to handle
the wind change in chakra

269
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:21,635
nature.

270
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,625
If I can't look left and
right at the same time

271
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,675
all by myself--

272
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:26,755
-Then I just needed
to create more clones.

273
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,535
They can look left
and right for me,

274
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,565
and then I can divide
up the responsibility.

275
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,685
-So, my shadow clone earlier
give you a hint, did it?

276
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,635
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Of course, only Naruto

277
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:41,565
has both the chakra and the
skill with shadow clones

278
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:44,535
for a method like that to work.

279
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,745
I couldn't accomplish that.

280
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:49,615
I bet even the Fourth
Hokage couldn't.

281
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,695
But him--

282
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:53,725
-Just what I'd expect from
a ninja like you, Naruto.

283
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:55,735
You're full of surprises.

284
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:58,695
I'm not sure how
to say this, but I

285
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,645
think I've really started to
take a liking to you, kiddo.

286
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,565
-Don't say gross stuff like
that out of the blue, Sensei!

287
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,575
The jutsu I worked on
all day got messed up

288
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,595
'cause you freaked me out!

289
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:14,735
-Uh, I didn't mean it like that.

290
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,665
-Hey, whoa, you stay away!

291
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:20,735
-There aren't words
to express how I feel.

292
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:21,675
-No!

293
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,665
-Oh, for crying out loud.

294
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:24,725
What are those two doing?

295
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,555
-Come on.

296
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,525
Kakashi!

297
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,535
-I have a message.

298
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:29,625
-Just hold on.

299
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,605
Huh?

300
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:31,675
-Hm?

301
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,665
Wha-- what's going on?

302
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,635
-Kakashi.

303
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:45,695
We need to call off the
training and return immediately.

304
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,665
-Wha--

305
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:48,615
-What's happened?

306
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:23,997
-Asuma Sarutobi--

307
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:24,585
has been killed.

308
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:32,695

NARUTO: You OK, Konohamaru?

311
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:08,326
KONOHAMARU: Uncle Asuma-- why?

312
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,406
KAKASHI: Asuma.

313

INO: Choji, do you know
where Shikamaru is?

314
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,456
It looks like he isn't here yet.

315
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,366
CHOJI: His mom said
that he had already

316
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,446
left when I went by his house.

did he run off to?

00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:25,296
At an important time like this.

320
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:28,266
SHIKAMARU: Next time, Team 10.
