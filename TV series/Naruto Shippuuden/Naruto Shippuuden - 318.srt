1
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,674
{\an1}Man, that sure was
a relief!

2
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,514
{\an7}<i>You certainly took long</i>
<i>enough. Naruto's gotten</i>
<i>way ahead of us now!</i>

3
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:31,683
{\an7}Look, I couldn't hold it
in any longer. Don't go
losing your composure!

4
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:36,421
{\an7}But now i'm feeling good
and dandy. My rhymes are
sweet like cotton candy!

5
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,789
{\an7}So don't worry, be happy!

6
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,858
{\an7}<i>Instead of wasting time</i>
<i>on your silly rap, let's</i>
<i>catch up to Naruto!</i>

7
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,593
{\an1}Lord Bee!

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,327
{\an1}<i>[grunt]</i>

9
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,695
{\an1}I've finally caught
up with you!

10
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,696
{\an1}Yo! What's on your
mind, Brother Motoi?

11
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,599
{\an1}Lord Raikage ordered
me to come here.

12
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,700
{\an1}I'm supposed to assist you
in any way I can.

13
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:56,002
{\an1}Great! Thank you,
Brother Motoi.

14
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:58,571
{\an1}Hey, how come your
hand is all wet, Bee?

15
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:01,406
{\an1}Not to be gruff, but
don't sweat the
small stuff.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,940
{\an1}By the way,
where is Naruto?

17
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:05,744
{\an1}Well, I was off a-pissin'
and he went a-missin'.

18
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,977
{\an1}He's beyond our
reach at this
juncture.

19
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,613
{\an1}Man, it's hard being
a young kid's teacher.

20
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,783
{\an1}I see. So he
went on ahead.

21
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:14,550
{\an1}Wait, pissing?!

22
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,252
{\an1}Hold up! Master
Bee, wait for me!

23
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,858
{\an1}That's the Eight Tails!

24
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,991
{\an1}He's really come this
far already?

25
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:29,295
{\an1}I guess that we'd
better try to delay him.

26
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:32,865
{\an1}[hum of approval]

27
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,902
{\an1}It seems Bee and
Naruto are getting
closer.

28
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:44,039
{\an1}I was told to leave
Naruto alone. However,
not Eight Tails.

29
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:48,443
{\an1}I can't wait to conduct
Lord Orochimaru's tests
on him!

30
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:57,817
{\an1}Bee, I'm going to
prepare the perfect
reanimation for you.

31
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,786
{\an1}This will be so much fun.

32
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,321
{\an1}Lord Bee, seriously, why
was your hand wet?

33
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:05,990
{\an1}Now come on! Don't
make a big deal out
of nothing, Brother.

34
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:07,291
{\an1}That's the thing, it
wasn't nothing!

35
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,392
{\an1}<i>[startled gasps]</i>

36
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:13,395
{\an1}<i>[loud shouting]</i>

37
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,831
{\an1}Damn it! It's
the enemy!

38
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,766
{\an7}What was that
all about?

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,334
{\an1}<i>[gasp]</i>

40
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:32,744
{\an1}No way, could
that be...?

41
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,845
{\an1}Huh?!

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,348
{\an1}<i>Wait, he's...</i>

43
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:42,285
{\an1}You're the Eight Tails'
former Jinchuriki...

44
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:43,920
{\an1}Fukai!

45
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,955
{\an1}It certainly has
been a while, Bee.

46
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,590
{\an1}And you are...Motoi, right?

47
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:51,259
{\an1}Yes, but why
are you here?

48
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:55,195
{\an1}Because someone used
the Reanimation Jutsu
on me.

49
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,397
{\an1}Listen, Fukai...

50
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:03,601
{\an1}That day thirty years
ago, I mean the day
that you died...

51
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:09,706
{\an4}...We tried to stop
the Eight Tails' rampage,
and eight shinobi lost
their lives.

52
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,949
{\an1}Among them, was
my father.

53
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:27,253
{\an1}I see. I'm
very sorry.

54
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,989
{\an1}But I know apologies
won't bring him back.

55
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:33,859
{\an1}He's definitely Fukai.
But why?

56
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:38,896
{\an7}No matter how hard I try,
I can't remember much
about that rampage back then.

57
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,567
{\an1}Bee, this chakra that
I'm sensing from you...

58
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,969
{\an1}Ah, so you did
become a Jinchuriki.

59
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:04,950
{\an1}<i>[snoring]</i>

60
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:10,286
{\an4}He'll probably be
next, the Jinchuriki
of the Eight
Tails after me.

61
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,590
{\an7}Have you heard for sure
if that's going to be
the elders' decision?

62
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:17,259
{\an1}No. No one's
said anything.

63
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,661
{\an1}Both my old man and
my uncle failed.

64
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,564
{\an1}And I'm not
compatible either.

65
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:27,367
{\an1}Listen, as your
cousin I think-

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,704
{\an4}Oh, come on. You've
kept the Eight Tails
under control up until
this point, so.

67
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,338
{\an1}Just, listen to me!

68
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:41,011
{\an7}Only a Jinchuriki would
understand. Even your close
friends look at you differently
after the process.

69
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:44,880
{\an7}Well...They might
believe that they're
treating you the same...

70
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,850
{\an1}But still they
aren't, not really.

71
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:51,653
{\an1}You can never look back,
only toward the future.

72
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,788
{\an1}But that future is filled
with darkness and loneliness.

73
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:59,726
{\an4}Have you achieved
compatibility, if you've
walked through life with
the shadow of your death?

74
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,263
{\an7}It fills your whole mind
day in and day out until you
become so consumed you don't
know who or what you are.

75
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,866
{\an7}It feels like someone
made a hole in your heart.

76
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:13,903
{\an7}And the Tailed Beast
constantly waits to pounce
on that weakened heart,
and run a muck.

77
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,773
{\an7}And you live with
the constant fear of death.

78
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,009
{\an7}You'd soon rather just die.

79
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:22,477
{\an1}But, still...

80
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,581
{\an1}You have a knack for
ninjutsu as well as skill,
ancestry, virtue-everything!

81
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:33,953
{\an4}True. That's the exact
reasoning that they used when
they chose me to become
the Eight Tails Jinchuriki

82
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:40,357
{\an4}But...To be honest,
none of those things
are necessary to be
a Jinchuriki.

83
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:42,893
{\an1}Oh? So what is, then?

84
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,930
{\an1}Having something
that can fill that
hole in your heart.

85
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,634
{\an1}And, what is it?
That something?

86
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,270
{\an7}It can be anything.
You'll know it when
you find it.

87
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,739
{\an7}Because it will keep
you strong.

88
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,341
{\an7}So, make sure
that Bee finds it.

89
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:10,280
{\an7}Bee! I can't control
my own body anymore.

90
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,181
{\an1}So run!

91
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:16,886
{\an4}But check it, if the Eight
Tails isn't inside you
anymore, then you can't fight
like you did before.

92
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,820
{\an1}You're wrong!

93
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,354
{\an1}<i>[shocked reaction]</i>

94
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,957
{\an7}Alright now, Fukai. Why don't
you show the two of them
that you mean business?

95
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:26,259
{\an1}Bee! Motoi! Get away!

96
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:30,596
{\an7}No way! He has a
Tailed Beast Cloak!

97
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,465
{\an7}His chakra...It's
unmistakably mine!

98
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:34,700
{\an7}When did he...?!

99
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,902
{\an7}What's going on here?!

100
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,638
{\an7}But how?! Eight Tails'
Chakra in a Reanimation...?

101
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,742
{\an7}You're witnessing one
of my finest secret
weapons.

102
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:50,445
{\an7}Lord Orochimaru's
laboratory was full of
interesting things like this.

103
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,552
{\an1}Of all the places,,,

104
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,220
{\an1}I have something
very precious hidden
away in here.

105
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:10,828
{\an1}Is that...?

106
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,863
{\an1}The horn from Eight Tails.

107
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,764
{\an1}Eight Tails?!

108
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:21,569
{\an4}Once I obtained some of the
Eight Tails' cells, I was
finally able to grow this
after many years.

109
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,571
{\an1}When were you able
to produce this?!

110
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:26,372
{\an1}Long before you were born.

111
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,409
{\an1}What I had to go
through to obtain this!

112
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:34,747
{\an1}But now that I have it, all
sorts of experiments become
possible for me.

113
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,314
{\an1}<i>[low growling]</i>

114
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,382
{\an1}That Kabuto!

115
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,619
{\an4}If he can revive something
like this with the Reanimation
Jutsu, why would he bother
capturing the Eight Tails?

116
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,855
{\an1}He could've just sealed
this chakra inside the
Gedo Statue!

117
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:48,924
{\an1}Dodge this, Bee!
<i>[growling]</i>

118
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:56,730
{\an1}Damn it! Bee,
get away!

119
00:07:56,764 --> 00:08:02,667
{\an1}<i>[painful cries]</i>
No! He's caught us in
his attack, too!

120
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,982
{\an1}<i>[growling]</i>

121
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,451
{\an1}Nice, Samehada. All right!
Now that's some appetite!

122
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,619
{\an1}He ate the chakra
of the Tailed Beast Bomb?!

123
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,722
{\an1}<i>Now it's my turn to</i>
<i>make an appearance!</i>

124
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:31,423
{\an1}You're going to take him
on in Eight Tails State?!

125
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:34,526
{\an1}<i>[battle cry]</i>

126
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,929
{\an1}Lariat!

00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,637
{\an1}<i>[grunt]</i>

128
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,305
{\an7}All this force from
just that one collision!

129
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,559
{\an1}Why do you still
possess my chakra?!

130
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:46,729
{\an1}When you died, I
extracted myself
from you entirely!

131
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:52,533
{\an1}It's been a while, Eight
Tails. To think we would
reunite in this situation...

132
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:57,804
{\an1}I'm disappointed, too.
I had very high hopes
for you.

133
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,773
{\an1}The both of us were
completely fooled
back then.

134
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,608
{\an1}By whom?

135
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:07,178
{\an7}Thirty years ago...

136
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,716
{\an1}<i>[startled breath]</i>

137
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,618
{\an1}Oh, Ay.

138
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,689
{\an1}You should be more
careful how you
approach me.

139
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,624
{\an1}What's the matter?
Trouble sleeping?

140

immense hole in
my heart.

143
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:37,502
{\an4}So you still haven't
found the something

it, then?

my heart is dead.

{\an1}I wander the
desert alone.

147

leave here, I'll never
find it.

{\an1}Is there anything that
I can do for you?
