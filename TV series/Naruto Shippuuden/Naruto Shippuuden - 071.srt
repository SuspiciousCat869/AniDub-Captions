1
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,583
-No way, you keep out of this.

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,354
I'll save Sora all by myself.

3
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,295
[theme music]

4
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:56,590
--[laughing] Seems like Sora
has intimidated the real

5
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,458
Jinchuriki.

6
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,762
-Restore him back to normal.

7
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,733
-It's too late now.

8
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,938
Soon the Nine Tails
will break free

9
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,842
and the Leaf will be destroyed.

10
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:07,178
-I'll stop it.

11
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,413
-You can try.

12
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,453
As for me, I wash my
hands of the mater.

13
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:12,723
-Oh, no you don't.

14
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:18,233
-Sora!

15
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,544
I got rid of him.

16
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,116
I told the Nine
Tails to get lost.

17
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,755
And I did it by
borrowing your strength.

18
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,702
Now listen, you can do it too
if I loan you some of mine.

19
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,973
So come on and get it!

20
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:57,579
-Sora, snap out of it.

21
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,016
Wake up already.

22
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:12,577
-Naruto.

23
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,019
You OK?

24
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:21,595
Hang on, Naruto.

25
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,099
Let me heal you.

26
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,236
-Damn it.

27
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,405
She doesn't have time
to be healing him now.

28
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,811
Sakura, look out!

29
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:30,813
-Everyone run!

30
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:51,923
-Is everyone OK?

31
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:52,557
-Yeah.

32
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,327
-We are all right.

33
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,632
But then, what about
Sakura and Naruto?

34
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,713
[growling]

35
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,902
-Naruto.

36
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,441
-Sakura, you OK?

37
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,211
-Yeah.

38
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,113
-That's good.

39
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,983
-Never mind about me now.

40
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:23,453
Please let me heal you.

41
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:24,455
-I'll be fine.

42
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,526
After all, aren't
you the one who's

43
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,265
always talking about what
amazing recuperative powers

44
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,102
I've got.

45
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,540
Sora is our main concern now.

46
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,742
I've got to get him back.

47
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,951
No matter what, you have
to heal him first, OK?

48
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:39,451
-Naruto.

49
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:43,326
All right.

50
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,246
-Sora.

51
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,524
-Naruto!

52
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,095
-I'm all right.

53
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,504
Sakura, go on, join the others.

54
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:11,483
This is between Sora and me.

55
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:11,984
-Right.

56
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:17,495
Ahhh!

57
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,634
-Any luck?

58
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,370
I couldn't get it to heal
with my medical ninjutsu.

59
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:46,688
-As I thought, it's the same
as when you were hurt, Sakura.

60
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,525
Wounds from the
Nine tails chakra

61
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,627
just take longer to heal.

62
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:58,478
That pain, like sharp needles,
will remain for a little while.

63
00:06:58,511 --> 00:06:59,613
-I'll be OK.

64
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,083
-So what then?

65
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,986
Does this mean Naruto
is the only one who

66
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,125
can ever control that guy?

67
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,761
-That seems to be the case.

68
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,033
-No way.

69
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:09,533
-Naruto.

70
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:20,655
-If only-- if only I'd
finished the job back then,

71
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,961
this wouldn't have
happened to Sora.

72
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,296
-Really?

73
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,234
I would think you'd
be glad that wasn't

74
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,006
you who killed his father.

75
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,144
-Not this time.

76
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:34,316
That won't be the
case this time.

77
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,087
-The Hokage's orders again?

78
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,588
-No!

79
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,567
I can't forgive you.

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,506
For what you've done to your
son, you'll get no mercy.

81
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,612
-All of this father
and son nonsense.

82
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,817
You fool, there'll
be no need for that

83
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,021
in the new Land of Fire.

84
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,191
-Yes there will.

85
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,927
There will always
be a need for that.

86
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:03,843
-I will change this land,
this world, everything.

87
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,348
But to do that, there
needs to be one king.

88
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:06,850
-Wrong!

89
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,895
-You're the one who's wrong.

90
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,566
Terribly wrong.

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,370
-Ninja art super beast scroll.

92
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,856
-What the hell?

93
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,533
-So tell me?

94
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:33,202
The hospital let you
out for a stroll?

95
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,584
-I had trouble sleeping
what with all the commotion

96
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:42,254
in the village.

97
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,492
-Isn't that a shame?

98
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:52,441
Now then, you and I can have
a nice leisurely chat, Kazuma.

99
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:54,211
-Ha, save your breath.

100
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,585
We have nothing more
to say to each other.

101
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:58,086
-Sora!

102
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,010
Stop doing that.

103
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,549
It hurts.

104
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,185
Come on, Sora.

105
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,187
Try and remember.

106
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:22,001
Remember when we
first met each other?

107
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:32,021
Remember how you and I got
into it with each other?

108
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,557
Remember the time
in the cave when

109
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:34,760
you came and helped me out?

110
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,744
[crying]

111
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:52,997
-Sora.

112
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,435
Sora.

113
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,905
Sora.

114
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:57,405
Sora.

115
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:02,650
Sora!

116
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,766
Come on.

117
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,315
Both of us have been
mistaken from the beginning.

118
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:22,957
We were both wrong about
what a king really is.

119
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,961
-There was no mistake.

120
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,464
I made no mistake!

121
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,680
[moaning] But if
I die, what will

122
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:53,185
happen to the Land of Fire?

123
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,326
-Nothing at all will happen.

124
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:02,871
-That would be funny.

125
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,542
-I don't remember my
dad's face very well.

126
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,650
But still, I'll never forget
that spotted sash he wore.

127
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:30,260
To me, my father is that
dazzling white light itself.

128
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:32,798
Now, when I think back on
him, that's always what I see.

129
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:35,771
-Kasuma.

130
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:39,579
Your reasons were--

131
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,517
-Listen to me.

132
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,287
Sora.

133
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,923
Who is that?

134
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:04,562
-Sora!

135
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,831
-Oh, it's only Naruto.

136
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,535
-Calm down, OK.

137
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,140
Why don't we knock it off?

138
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,411
It's me that you keep
hitting, you idiot?

139
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:15,117
-Why does he always
have to be so damn loud?

140
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,757
-Are you all right, Sora?

141
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,062
-Naruto, why did
you-- you little

142
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,935
idiot, when are you
going to stop butting in?

143
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,274
-As long as I'm here, I
guess I'll give you a hand.

144
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,512
-Always meddling.

145
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:32,251
-OK, Sora, what's
this all about?

146
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,224
What's going on between
you and Asuma Sensei?

147
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:35,992
-Nothing.

148
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,496
Get off me, you jerk.

149
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,998
-The most annoying person ever.

150
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,249
-What it is now?

151
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:50,655
-What in the world
is going on up there?

152
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:58,104
-It must be-- Captain Yamato,
Sora looks different than

153
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,273
Naruto did when he--

154
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:00,809
-Yes, you're right.

155
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,114
It's only a theory,
but I suspect

156
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,554
Sora's body isn't strong enough
to hold the Nine Tails much

157
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,990
longer.

158
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:10,328
It's chakra has grown
far too powerful.

159
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,769
It's seeking to escape his body.

160
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:14,971
-But that means--

161
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,854
-Sora.

162
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,793
All that power.

163
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:29,199
That kind of power
won't do you any good.

164
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,471
That isn't real strength.

165
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,408
Let us be your strength.

166
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:37,717
Me, all of us in the Leaf, we've
got all the power you need.

167
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:45,566
-Naruto!

168
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,037
-Lady Tsunade.

169
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,453
-Shizune, we're going out.

170
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:12,921
-Right.

171
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,339
-What is it?

172
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:26,081
Is that the Nine Tails?

173
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,018
-What an incredible
amount of chakra.

174
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,471
-What now?

175
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:38,640
-What is it doing?

176
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,610
-Something's not
right, that's for sure.

177
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,253
-Captain Yamato?

178
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,691
-Although it freed
itself from Sora's body,

179
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,530
it apparently needs to find
another human vessel in order

180
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:51,699
to maintain its form.

181
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,702
-But then--

182
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:08,266
-Sora.

183
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,538
Sora, you OK?

184
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:14,412
Hey, can you hear me?

185
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,182
Come on.

186
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,520
Come on, wake up.

187
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:21,259
Wake up, Sora.

188
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:23,130
-What is it?

189
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:24,966
Who's there?

190
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:30,044
Is somebody-- is somebody
calling me again?

191
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:30,578
NARUTO: Sora!

192
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,354
--[cuckles] Don't you
ever shut up, Naruto?

193
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:40,999
-So you're finally awake.

194
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,742
-Naruto.

195
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,315
-Hey, are you ready
to go home or what?

196
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,319
-Are you joking?

197
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:52,890
I don't have a home anymore.

198
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,627
Where am I supposed to go?

199
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,431
-What are you talking about.

200
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,267
Here, of course,
the Leaf Village

201
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,072
is your home now, buddy.

202
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,409
-The Leaf?

203
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:05,181
You mean the same village
that I just tried to destroy?

204
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,084
-That's ancient history.

205
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:08,086
You're our friend.

206
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,160
Get that through your head.

207
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:11,928
That's right.

208
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,030
We're friends.

209
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,166
You got that?

210
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,074
Don't let anybody ever
tell you differently.

211
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,376
-I'm your friend?

212
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,078
-You bet.

213
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:29,730
-You OK?

214
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:30,867
-Sure, they're fine.

215
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,678
-Do you mind if I'm
a part of this too?

216
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:37,814
-No way, Sai.

217
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,383
Beat it.

218
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,018
-But I thought--

219
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,473
SAI (VOICEOVER): Now,
what was funny about that.

220
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:53,946
-Naruto, you're terrible.

221
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,915
-My friends.

222
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,631
-So you're really not going
back to the fire temple?

223
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,767
-No.

224
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,670
I think I want to see
a bit more of the world

225
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:24,809
and meet different
kinds of people,

226
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:28,482
and make, or try to make,
new friends like you have.

227
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,585
-Good plan.

228
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,756
-Be sure and come back
once in a while, K?

229
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,392
You know you'll
always be welcome here

230
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,227
in the Leaf Village.

231
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,296
Don't ever forget that.

232
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:39,304
-That's right any time.

233
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:39,939
-Thanks a lot.

234
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:48,590
So long.

235
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,777
Would you tell old
Asuma goodbye for me?

236
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,749
-Got it.

237
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:04,990
-Oh, and the next time you see
me, I'll have though of a name

238
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,693
you can use for the afterlife.

239
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,063
-Hey, wait a sec.

240
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:11,369
I found out that afterlife
means after your dead.

241
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,239
--[laughing] Took you
long enough, you idiot.

242
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:13,808
See ya.

243
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,388
-Really?

244
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:38,924
The climbing silver move?

245
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,762
Right off the bat like that?

246
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,198
Whoa, what's your hurry?

247
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,234
Let's take our time.

248
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,271
Why rush?

249
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:48,477
-To penetrate the enemy's
line, sometimes you

250
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:51,850
have to be willing
to risk a bold move.

251
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:55,491
-But I thought you always hated
risky moves like that, just

252
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,627
like me.

253
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,801
-To defend your king
from a superior opponent,

254
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:03,708
one must make some sacrifices.

255
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,616
-What's going on with you?

256
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,252
-Oh, nothing.

257
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,956
Nothing to speak of.

258
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,593
It's just that
I'm finally coming

259
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:15,833
to understand the true
importance of the king.

260
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:16,901
-Well, sure.

261
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,172
You lose the game if
your king is taken.

262
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,542
It's over.

263
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,615
-If I were picking pieces
to represent Leaf shinobi,

264
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,252
you know what?

265
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,758
I'd say you are most
like the knight.

266
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,927
-Why's that?

267
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,366
-It's not the most powerful
piece on the board,

268
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,937
but it can leap over
any of the others.

269
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:36,674
It's a unique ability.

270
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,050
It reminds me of how
flexible your mind is.

271
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,455
-OK, which one are you?

272
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,692
-Me, oh, I'm nothing.

273
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,194
I'm just--

274
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,602
-A sacrificial pawn, huh?

275
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,277
-Done.

276
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,581
Do you know which
one the king is?

277
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:57,784
-Huh?

278
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,890
Um, well, the Hokage, right?

279
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:04,898
-Yeah, that's what
I used to think too.

280
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,902
But that's not the case.

281
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:10,777
-Then, who is it?

282
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,948
-You'll know the answer
when the time comes.

283
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:40,203
HIDAN: Quick on your
feet, aren't you?

284
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,081
Hm, then again, my attack
speed is the slowest

285
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:48,787
and my aim is the worst
among all the Akatsuki.

286
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,329
-I see.

287
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,499
I knew you must be Akatsuki.

288
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,339
HIDAN: She's all yours.

289
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,454
-Still you're pretty
good, I'll grant you that.

290
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,894
-Careful, Hidan she's the
Two Tails Jinchuriki host.

291
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:12,368
Underestimate her
and she'll kill you.

292
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,637
-Oh honestly.

293
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,109
Come on, Kakuzu,
personally there's

294
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,115
nothing I'd like better
than to be killed.

295
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:30,137
[theme music]

296
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:00,185
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade,
we just received a report

297
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:02,123
from Kakashi who'd been
trying to make contact

298
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,392
with Master Jiraiya.

299
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,195
TSUNADE: Well, finally,
what does he say?

300
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:07,366
SHIZUNE: He's verified that
the same pair of shinobi

301
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,737
have carried out attacks
on seven different villages

302
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,508
in five neighboring lands.

303
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,643
TSUNADE: A pair, huh?

304
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:14,147
SHIZUNE: Yes, my lady,
and while there's

305
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,599
been no incursion into
the Land the Fire as yet,

306
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,269
Kakashi believes it's
only a matter of time.

307
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:20,403
-I see.

308
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,339
So they've shown their hand.

309
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:25,875
NARUTO: Next time, "The
Quietly Approaching Threat."
