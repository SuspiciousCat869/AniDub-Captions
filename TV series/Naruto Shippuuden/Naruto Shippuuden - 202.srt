00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,458
<i>Hey.</i>

2
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:19,730
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>We really should talk,</i>
<i>Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

3
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:20,763
Go to hell!

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,677
<i>A Rasengan right</i>
<i>off the bat, huh?</i>

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,683
{\an1}You do know that doesn't
work on me, right?

6
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:39,588
Huh?!

7
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,401
{\an1}Naruto, you just stay put.

8
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,444
{\an1}Should've figured.
Kakashi of the Sharingan.
You're quick.

9
00:00:57,778 --> 00:01:02,450
{\an1}We won't let you get your
hands on Naruto that easily,
Madara Uchiha.

10
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:06,155
{\an1}You did hear what I just said,
didn't you?

11
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:11,094
{\an1}There are no attacks that exist,
that work against Madara Uchiha.

12
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:16,101
{\an5}Even if you're
erasing yourself,
or this is just an
astral projection,

13
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,871
{\an1}You'll still have to manifest
physically to take Naruto.

14
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,243
Otherwise you can't
actually take him.

15
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:25,580
{\an1}I'll wait for that moment.

16
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,157
<i>[Yamato]</i>
<i>You're in my</i>
<i>territory now.</i>

17
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,863
[chuckle] Well, I
never imagined that
this would be easy.

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,866
I will admit I have
a plan in mind.

19
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,704
But at this moment,
I'm only here to talk.

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,906
{\an1}Talk?

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,676
That's right.

22
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,847
{\an1}I want to know what you did
that made Nagato betray me.

23
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,785
{\an1}Naruto, you've
sparked my interest.

24
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,154
I don't care about
what you want.

25
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,157
What are you planning
to do with Sasuke?!

26
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:01,726
Come on, tell me!

27
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:04,996
{\an1}Sasuke, huh?

28
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:13,140
{\an1}<i>Very well then,</i>
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

29
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:21,016
{\an4}About the man who's been
steeped to his very marrow
in the Shinobi World's
hatred and resentment.

30
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,220
{\an1}<i>The story of Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

31
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,828
{\an1}But Sasuke's story
cannot be told without
also telling Itachi's.

32
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:33,232
{\an1}So first, I'll tell you
the truth about Itachi.

33
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:43,111
Where is Sasuke now?!
Answer me!

34
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,116
{\an4}Well, since you
leave me no choice,
I'll give you a
little hint.

35
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:47,983
[crush]

36
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,754
Cee! Begin!

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,755
{\an1}Sir!

38
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,091
{\an1}You didn't have to kill him,
you know.

39
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:58,964
{\an4}If we'd restrained and
interrogated him, we might
have obtained useful Intel
on the Akatsuki!

40
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:05,039
{\an1}It wouldn't work; no one in
the Akatsuki has ever talked.
They're all completely devoted.

41
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,509
{\an1}Okisuke, Urakaku.

42
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:10,178
{\an1}Give the order to
find Sasuke at once.

43
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:13,182
{\an1}Issue a number two
battle-ready state alert.

44
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:13,983
{\an1}Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

45
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,286
{\an1}Lord Raikage!

46
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,156
{\an1}You! One-eyed Mist guy!

47
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,758
Huh?

48
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,694
Keep that eye trained
on the Hokage!

49
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:26,099
{\an1}Cee, and Darui! Come on!

50
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,641
{\an1}I'm sorry about the desk
and the wall there.

51
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,110
{\an1}Hey, Darui, quit yapping
and let's go already!

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,884
{\an1}That Raikage is truly violent.

53
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:43,855
{\an1}Even becoming the Kage hasn't
changed that unruly Cloud brat!

54
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,993
[radio] Number Two
battle-ready state
alert.

55
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,428
Search for the intruder,
Sasuke Uchiha.

56
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,732
Dispatch three squads
to the tower entrance.

57
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,467
Set up defensive line.

58
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:54,502
<i>[radio static]</i>

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,574
Move out!

60
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:01,878
This is...

61
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,015
{\an1}Karin, what's the matter?

62
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:08,887
{\an1}The Samurai's movements have
suddenly become erratic.
I think they're looking for us!

63
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,125
{\an1}[Suigetsu]
What?! But why?! We didn't do
anything to get their attention.

64
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:15,763
{\an1}I bet that it was Zetsu.

65
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,247
Huh??

66
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:33,451
{\an1}They're already gone.

67
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,020

[Karin]
It's no good.
There are too many!

70
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,235
We'll be found and
captured in no time.

71
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:35,073
{\an1}That bastard.
I'll get him for this.

72
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,754
{\an1}I see; so that's how they
use their chakra.

73
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:47,856

I can hold back.

{\an1}We could say the same to you!

He repelled them?!

78
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,957
{\an1}His blade work is
similar to ours!

79
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,728
Karin, stop monitoring
those guys.

80
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,031
Find out where
Danzo is!

81
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,000
{\an1}But what about
the samurai?

82
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,004
{\an1}Don't worry about that;
I'll deal with them.

is the guy who warned
me not to kill anyone!

88
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,281
What's this?

well. He's bound to
use Fire Style, then.

00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:07,294
{\an1}Karin will probably extinguish
her chakra and just lie low.
she can do things like that.

150
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,798
{\an1}<i>[Jugo]</i>
<i>That guy in the back is a</i>
<i>Sensory-Type ninja, huh?</i>

151
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,735
{\an1}We gotta take him down.

152
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:23,981
I'll do it.

153
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,724
It doesn't look like
he'll ever rise again.

154
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:36,364
{\an4}[Mifune]
Lord Ao, please confirm
whether the Hokage's Visual
Jutsu is still engaged.

155
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:41,505
{\an4}[Ao]
No. Right now, the flow in
his Chakra Network is quiet.
The jutsu's undone.

156
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,743
{\an4}[Danzo]
All of you just relax, it's not
a visual jutsu that I can use
that many times in a day.

157
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:51,550
{\an4}[Ao]
Be quiet! I shall decide that.
For you are a man who simply
can't be trusted.

158
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:55,855
{\an1}[Danzo]
I can't believe the Byakugan
fell into someone else's hands.

159
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,194
{\an4}[Danzo]
If a Hidden Leaf Hyuga
turned traitor, I would've
taken care of them at once.

160
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:11,476
{\an4}You're probably planning
to dispose of me now
that I know your secret.
Better think again!

161
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:13,478
{\an1}I'll fight you myself,
if need be.

162
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,684
{\an1}Especially since your Visual
Jutsu may be connected somehow

163
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:20,754
{\an1}with the one that manipulated
the Fourth Mizukage.

164
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:27,329
{\an5}[Mifune]
Lord Hokage,
all ninjutsu is
prohibited here.

165
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:30,032
{\an1}You have lost trust
and credibility.

166
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:35,439
{\an4}<i>A shame, since I may</i>
<i>have still chosen you,</i>
<i>had you not resorted</i>
<i>to such tactics.</i>

167
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:38,443
{\an1}[Danzo]
But "may have chosen"
wasn't good enough.

168
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:42,781
{\an1}I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes in order to
protect the shinobi world.

169
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:46,720
{\an1}It's imperative that our
whole world unite as one.

170
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:52,794
{\an4}Just as the First Hokage
Hashirama brought together
his clan and founded the
Hidden Leaf Village.

171
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:58,168
{\an1}Now we must merge all
the villages and create
one shinobi world.

172
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:02,173
{\an1}This shall never be
accomplished through
discussion and negotiation.

173
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:07,012
{\an1}But it takes time and patience
to actualize one's ideals.

174
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,519
Impatience makes one
shortsighted and
invites failure.

175
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,287
That's what
happened to you.

176
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:19,095
{\an4}[Danzo]
Taking the time to do it
morally and ethically will
result in no change.

177
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:23,133
{\an1}And the Akatsuki will
eventually destroy the
whole shinobi world.

178
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,638
{\an5}[Tsuchikage]
But your dream is
nothing more than
an impossibility!

179
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:32,878
{\an4}It may sound noble, but in
the end, you'll only breed
distrust, ill feelings,
hatred, and resentment.

180
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,185
{\an5}Why, Danzo!
We can't even
trust your words
at this point.

181
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:41,957
{\an1}It doesn't matter whether
you trust me or not.
Results are necessary.

182
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,373
{\an1}<i>[Gaara]</i>
<i>If we can't even</i>
<i>trust each other,</i>

183
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:59,780
{\an1}<i>If that's the state of our</i>
<i>world and of being human,</i>
<i>then we have no future.</i>

184
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:00,547
Eh?

185
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,751
What does
that mean?

186
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:06,121
{\an1}Without mutual trust
and understanding,

187
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:09,493
{\an1}All that will remain in this
world is fear and terror.

188
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,869
{\an1}I simply can't tolerate giving
up so easily, or any plan that
doesn't incorporate morality.

189
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:20,507
You pose such difficult
concepts so simply.

190
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,010
But you're a green brat
who knows nothing about
running a village.

191
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:25,044
{\an1}Tch!

192
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,916
But I'll tell you what.
Now's your chance to ask
anything you'd like!

193
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:34,758
{\an5}As your senior, I'll
answer any question
you have. Eh, Danzo?
[chuckle]

194
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,192
{\an1}Say again,
old man?!

195
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:40,030
Don't do it, Kankuro.
He's still Tsuchikage.
He's a village leader!

196
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:43,101
Hold on.
Did she say
STILL a leader?

197
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,170
{\an1}Ignore them.

198
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,775
{\an1}Then let me ask you this.

199
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,915
Sure! Go head,
no holds barred.
Ask away!

200
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:58,288
{\an1}When did all of you
forsake yourselves?

201
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:59,088
What?!

202
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:04,629
{\an7}<i>What a pure-hearted child.</i>

203
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,030
Heh!

204
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,167
{\an1}All right, Gaara,
what are we gonna do now?

205
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:15,743
{\an4}We once worked with the Hidden
Leaf on their mission to
retrieve Sasuke. But he's sunk
so low he's joined the Akatsuki.

206
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:20,181
{\an1}So, Sasuke Uchiha, huh?

207
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,854
{\an1}Hey! Don't leave
without your guards!

208
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,891
{\an1}Hey, Gramps, he scored
a point on you.

209
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,292
Oh, shut it!

210
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:32,164
Lord Tsuchikage,
What do we do?
Tell us.

211
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:33,867
Shall we join
the fight?

212
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,403
{\an1}You fool! And what happens
if my back pain gets worse?!

213
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:41,242
{\an1}But I want to see this
Sasuke who supposedly
took down Deidara.

214
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,211
Fine, do as you please!

215
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:48,251
{\an1}But if you get caught in the
Raikage's crossfire, you'll die.
Stay out of his way.

216
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,621
{\an1}All right!
What about you,
Akatsuchi?

217
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,394
{\an4}I have to keep an eye on Lord
Tsuchikage in case there's
trouble with his back.
So I'll stay here with him.

218
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,364
{\an1}Hm. Later, then.

219
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,240
{\an1}Lord Danzo, please, sir, allow
one of us to venture forth and
retrieve the Sharingan.

220
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,676

more surprising than his
appearance, You know?

unbelievable chakra!

gave in to his killer impulse
voluntarily this time.

230
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:56,538
{\an1}What do you think the odds
are that he still remembers
we're both on his side?
