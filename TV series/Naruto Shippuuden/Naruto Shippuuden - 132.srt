1
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,066
JIRAIYA: Three of them.

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,600
What's going on here?

3
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,033
How could there
be three Rinnegan?

4
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,433
Must be his jutsu.

5
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,700
There has to be some
kind of trick behind it.

6
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,966
-This would happen just as I
was about to prepare dinner.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
FUKASAKU: Ma, never
mind about that.

8
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,900
Just stay focused on the
opponent in front of us.

9
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,733
You got it?

10
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,900
-What did you just say to me?

11
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:46,333
-Well, I guess it's about
time for me to make my move.

12
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:51,533
From this moment onward, let
Sage jutsu prevail and triumph!

13
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:54,833
Look to the halos and
heavenly canopies!

14
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,666
Gallant, Jiraiya shall--

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,533
-Quit yakking in our
ears so loud, would ya?

16
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,766
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
All my posturing

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,233
keeps getting interrupted today.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,666
-Let's wrap this up quick.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,000
I have to get home.

20
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,200
I do have to whip up
some dinner, you know.

21
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,533
-Ma!

22
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,166
This guy's eyes are a much
bigger issue than any dinner.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,266
Now stay alert.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,600
This is the ultimate
visual jutsu.

25
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:22,800
-I don't care.

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,200
Don't you dare belittle
a housewife's dilemma

27
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,366
of what to cook day in and day
out, you ungrateful old coot!

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,066
-How dare you use that
tone of voice with me?

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,266
I was only trying to look
out for you, you know?

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,133
-And who ever asked
you to look out for me?

31
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,500
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Ugh, who are

32
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,200
the ones yakking
in whose ears now?

33
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:51,466
PAIN: Not bad.

34
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,133
-Now, can we put aside your
spousal differences for once

35
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,266
and get this battle
over with already?

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,833
-Hmph.

37
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,866
Fine.

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll cook up some
fried pain tonight.

39
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,900
Boy, bring the oil and
Pa, your wind style.

40
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,966
-Yes, ma'am!

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
Sage Art Bath of Boiling Oil!

42
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,700
-You think it worked?

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,533
-All the oil just vanished.

44
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,733
-They should have
been blasted by it.

45
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,366
-That one probably has
tricks up his sleeve, too.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,266
-How about all of us go
check it out in close combat?

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,966
-Let's go.

48
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,766
JIRAIYA: Massive Rasengan!

49
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,100
What?

50
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,566
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): He's
absorbing my whole jutsu.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
That must be what
he did earlier, too.

52
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,366
-There, behind you!

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,833
-Huh?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
FUKASAKU: We've taken his back.

55
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,633
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): What?

56
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,233
He blocked my Sage Mode
attack without even looking.

57
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,233
Sage art Kebari Senbon!

58
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,800
Not a single wasted movement.

59
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,200
I would have gotten him if
he had dodged that attack.

60
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,033
But instead, he blocked
it with a summoning

61
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,000
without ever turning around.

62
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:18,766
What's going on?

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,700
Blocking my attacks
not once, but twice

64
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,833
with no verbal signals or
even eye contact between them

65
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,033
at all.

66
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,333
Even if all three
are sensory types,

67
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,200
they still have to
see an attack coming

68
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,200
to be able to counter it.

69
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,233
Kebari Senbon is
my fastest jutsu

70
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,100
and has the widest attack range
of all the jutsu in my arsenal.

71
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,100
The only way to
defend against it

72
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:47,433
is with a shield like he just
did-- and without even looking.

73
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,800
Somehow he simply knew.

74
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,733
These guys are no
ordinary clones.

75
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,033
FUKASAKU: You said they have
a trick up their sleeves,

76
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,800
and you were right,
Jiraiya, boy.

77
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,600
SHIMA: What?

78
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,933
-Haven't you noticed it yet?

79
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,533
-No.

80
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,933
What is it?

81
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,900
-When we got behind these guys
earlier, you picked your target

82
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,600
and attacked him
from his blind spot.

83
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,300
Isn't that right?

84
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,366
But then, one of
the other guys--

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
he was staring right
at us the entire time.

86
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,533
-Yeah, I noticed that too.

87
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,233
But I didn't think
anything of it.

88
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,100
I saw absolutely no signs that
they were signalling each other

89
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:23,366
in any way, either verbally
or with eye contact.

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,466
-That's it!

91
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,533
It's their eyes.

92
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,700
All three of them have
the exact same eyes.

93
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:28,633
-Huh?

94
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,733
-What if their
trick is that they

95
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,666
can share whatever they
see with each other?

96
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,500
Each sees what the others see.

97
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,033
-So all three pairs of eyes
are sharing images, then.

98
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,100
That's what your hypothesis is?

99
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:39,833
-That's right.

100
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,800
That's what I suspect.

101
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,933
Still, what in
tarnation are they?

102
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:48,066
[music playing]

103
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,533
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
This is bad.

104
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,500
Under these circumstances, where
my ninjutsu is being nullified,

105
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,400
to face all three at
once is just too much.

106
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,900
At this rate, if I enter
battle, even in Sage Mode,

107
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,766
I'll be killed.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,700
I never imagined he
would be this strong.

109
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,466
-Fall back for
now, Jiraiya, boy.

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,966
-Right.

111
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,766
PAIN: He's escaped
into the pipes.

112
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,333
[music playing]

113
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,865
SHIMA: Why are we running away?

114
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,698
-We have to analyze
the Six Paths

115
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,398
and come up with a strategy.

116
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,598
We need some time to
put it all together.

117
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:30,565
Now, those three may all look
different, but each of them

118
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,665
has the same distinctive pupils.

119
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,498
In short, every
one of them seems

120
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,898
to possess the Six
Paths Rinnegan.

121
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:40,265
-But even if one of those
three guys really is Nagato,

122
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,898
I can't believe there are that
many people milling around

123
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,631
with a Rinnegan.

124
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:48,198
So what in the world
is going on here?

125
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,265
FUKASAKU: Whichever one
of those is the real Pain

126
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,231
isn't really the problem
that we have to face

127
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,531
here, Jiraiya, boy.

128
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,998
The real problem is that,
for better or worse,

129
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,698
three Rinnegan holders exist.

130
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,365
And we must fight them.

131
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:06,498
-Just who or what is Pain?

132
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,165
-Well, it's still not clear.

133
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,465
We don't know that yet.

134
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:11,465
But there is a wee
little bit that we

135
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,465
can figure out all on our own.

136
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:17,165
Their vision is linked and
they share images between them.

137
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:21,031
That's the ability that
those eyes possess.

138
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,165
-Yes, but what does all
of that mean exactly?

139
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,665
And how is that an
advantage in battle?

140
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,331
-Let me put it as
simply as I can.

141
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,198
In the same way that three
security cameras show

142
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:35,298
three different angles
of the same image,

143
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,598
those guys are able to see
three separate viewpoints, all

144
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,098
at the same time.

145
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:42,965
So if just one of them
can see their target,

146
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,698
than the other two can attack
or counter with the ideal move

147
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,965
and with perfect timing,
without even seeing their foe

148
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,265
or with their own eyes at all.

149
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:55,165
So they've got triple the
sight of everyone else.

150
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:57,031
And unlike the weakness
of the Byakugan,

151
00:09:57,065 --> 00:10:00,231
they can always keep guard
over each other's blind spots,

152
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:04,031
all without weaving any hand
signs or manipulating chakra.

153
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,998
-It does make for an
invincible combination.

154
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,265
-Well then, we'll have to
split them up and fight them

155
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,631
separately.

156
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:13,698
I'm absolutely positive I can
win facing them one on one.

157
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,865
But since the possess such
abilities, fighting as a team

158
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,698
would have to be their
base mode of attack.

159
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:23,098
I bet they do all they
can not to get split up.

160
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,631
Taijutsu isn't going
to work against them,

161
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,765
and any ninjutsu would be
just absorbed like before.

162
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,165
-If taijutsu and
ninjutsu won't work,

163
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,065
then the only other
option is genjutsu.

164
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,098
-Yes.

165
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,698
-It's too bad I'm
just a big dud when

166
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:37,898
it comes to using genjutsu.

167
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,465
But as I recall,
the two of you--

168
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:43,565
-Hmm.

169
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:45,265
Yes, you're right about
that, Jiraiya, boy.

170
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:46,865
If they're former
students of yours,

171
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,331
then they undoubtedly
know that you

172
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,531
don't use genjutsu very much.

173
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:53,065
But that might just give us
an opening that we can use.

174
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:55,265
-No way, I'm not gonna do it.

175
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:56,131
You understand me?

176
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:57,698
-What are you two talking about?

177
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:01,431
-Listen, Ma.

178
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:02,898
World peace could
very well be hanging

179
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,931
on the outcome of this
battle right here.

180
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,131
So this is no time
for you to be selfish.

181
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:10,531
-I don't care about the senile
old geezer's prophecies.

182
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,865
-The Great Lord Elder
told us to get along.

183
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,331
Or did you conveniently
forget that again?

184
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,798
-So I don't get it.

185
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,631
Why do you object
to this so much?

186
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,098
-I can't seem to do it with Pa.

187
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:22,931
Not at this plump, ripe old age.

188
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,298
It's embarrassing.

189
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,231
-Huh?

190
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,865
What, a duet?

191
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:27,898
FUKASAKU: Yes.

192
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,865
Our most powerful
genjutsu is a jutsu

193
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,898
where we confound an opponent's
sense of hearing with song.

194
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,965
JIRAIYA: With song, huh?

195
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,098
I see.

196
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,831
So that's why we retreated.

197
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,198
-That's correct.

198
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,498
This genjutsu is very powerful,
but its one major weaknesses

199
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:44,865
is that once we make a
sound, our whereabouts

200
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:46,631
are revealed to the enemy.

201
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,231
To make it work, we have
to combine the sounds

202
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:53,465
and create the melody that traps
the enemy inside the genjutsu.

203
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:57,398
And it takes a little time for
the whole thing to take effect.

204
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,931
If they figure out where
we are before they're

205
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,898
caught in the genjutsu
and attack us,

206
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,098
then we will surely lose.

207
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:08,198
But once they're caught under
our spell, victory is assured.

208
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:20,631
What is it, boy?

209
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:25,465
-If your lives are in
danger in this fight,

210
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:27,631
I want you to free
yourself from my shoulders.

211
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,365
-What?

212
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:28,865
No.

213
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:29,931
No way.

214

The fate of the
ninja world could

215
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:33,565
depend on this
battle, Jiraiya, boy.

216
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,898
-I have a plan in mind,
but it's a gamble.

217
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:40,565
A big one.

218
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:44,765
-Do tell.

219
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,186
JIRAIYA: Please begin.

PAIN: What is that?

222
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,653
That sound.

223
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,086
It's frogs croaking.

224
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,086
A genjutsu?

225
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,553
It's coming from in there.

226
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,920
PAIN (VOICEOVER):
A shadow clone.

227
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:03,420
JIRAIYA: Fire style
Giant Flame Bomb!

228
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,386
PAIN (VOICEOVER):
So that's your move.

229
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,486
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Good.

230
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,820
My gamble paid off.

231
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:13,286
That big guy went after
the jutsu to absorb it,

232
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,220
just like I thought.

233
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:22,886
The first one only
used summoning.

234
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,253
And both times my
jutsu was absorbed,

235
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:29,620
it was the big guy who did it.

236
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,186
So it's just as I
suspected-- each of them

237
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,453
only possesses a
single type of ability.

238
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:45,386
Right now, the big one's
eyes are focused on my jutsu.

239
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,186
That other one I
blinded earlier.

240
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:56,553
So now there's only one of
them still looking at me.

241
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:57,886
PAIN (VOICEOVER): This one, too.

242
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,686
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Got you.

243
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,453
PAIN (VOICEOVER): I can't move.

244
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:07,786
This is the dark swamp.

245
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:11,420
FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
Just a little more.

246
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,220
-Now we're finally one on one.

247
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,320
I'm not letting you summon.

248

PAIN: So you got us.

249
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,786
-You're trapped inside
a genjutsu paralysis

250
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,353
that binds your psyche.

251
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:52,620
Now none of your bodies,
even your main body,

252
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,253
will be able to move at all.

253
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,986
PAIN: Jiraiya, sensei.

254
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,320
I didn't expect a genjutsu like
this from you of all people.

Don't let your guard down, no
matter who your opponent is.

in your decision.

is protect those two

I will be forced to endure.

Instead of trying to rule
the world through pain,

263
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,120
I wish you'd moved past
it and used your power

to create peace
in a positive way.

That apprentice will

two I cannot say.

while there, I

You all right?

-Boy, that genjutsu song is
certainly hard on the throat,

I'll tell you that.

-And it's really difficult
keeping tempo with Pa, too.

That jutsu isn't easy in

both take a rest now.

JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Never going back

320
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,268
on your word, no
matter what, and never

321
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,302
giving up despite what the
odds may tell you to do.

322
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:12,702
Naruto, if that is your ninja
way, then as your mentor,

323
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,702
I have no business whining.

324
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,235
Because as everyone
knows, a student

325
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:20,335
inherits his ninja
way from his teacher.

326
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:23,335
Next time-- "The Tale
of Jiraiya the Gallant."

327
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:27,068
Tune in and catch all the
excitement, won't you?
