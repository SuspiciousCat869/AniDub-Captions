00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:05,306
{\an1}Are you tellin' me that
all the things we did
together in Squad Seven,

3
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,840
{\an1}<i>mean absolutely</i>
<i>nothing to you now!?</i>

4
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,078
No.

5
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,080
Not meaningless.

6
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:18,151
{\an1}One thing was worthwhile;
our friendship.

7
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,387
<i>We became best friends.</i>

8
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,556
{\an1}We're best friends?!

9
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,191
{\an1}Why're we fighting?!

10
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,925
I just told you.

11
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:32,331
Because we're friends,
there's more meaning
in destroying you.

12
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:33,098

14

{\an1}You finally awake?

15
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,443
A dream.

16
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:47,379
{\an1}Where am I?

17
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,048
{\an1}You lost consciousness.
You really had us all worried.

18
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:57,589
Kakashi Sensei
and Sai?

19
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:03,928
I see.

20
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,468
{\an1}Why?

21
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:16,674
{\an1}Why'd it turn out like this?

22
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,943
{\an1}Hey, Naruto.

23
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,412
{\an1}You should rest a
little longer.

24
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:23,580
Come on now.

25
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:34,023
{\an7}<i>Sasuke... you're...</i>

26
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:42,264
Hey, did you know that
everyone in the Uchiha
clan was killed?

27
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:43,732
Hmm?

28
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,670
{\an1}Yeah, I heard my
father talking about
it a while ago.

29
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,838
<i>Sasuke's the only</i>
<i>one who survived.</i>

30
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,143
{\an8}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>I was actually kinda</i>
<i>glad back then,</i>

31
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:59,447
{\an7}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>'Cause I wasn't the only</i>
<i>one who was alone anymore.</i>

32
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:03,484
{\an7}<i>But Sasuke was so good</i>
<i>at everything he did.</i>

33
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:06,654
{\an1}Well done, Sasuke.
excellent example!

34
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:09,290
- Yeah! Way to go!
- You're so cool!
- Wow!

35
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:12,327
Hah! Stuck-up
and a show-off!

36
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,861
{\an1}I could do that, too,
if I wanted to, you know!

37
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,130
{\an7}<i>He was so different than me.</i>

38
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,298
Go!

39
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,068
Nnng!

40
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,503
{\an7}<i>That's why I picked</i>
<i>him to be my rival.</i>

41
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,506
{\an7}<i>Because I wanted to</i>
<i>be just like him.</i>

42
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,850
{\an7}<i>Even though we were</i>
<i>both on Squad 7,</i>

43
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,020
{\an7}<i>Sasuke was always a</i>
<i>step ahead of me.</i>

44
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:50,029
{\an7}<i>The reason I trained so hard</i>
<i>was because I wanted to catch</i>
<i>up to him, even just a little.</i>

45
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:54,866
Heh.

46
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,776
{\an1}"Am I at my strongest?"
I just want the answer to that.

47
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:07,245
I can only find out
by fighting the
strongest, the best.

48
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,081
{\an1}<i>And the best of the</i>
<i>best are all here.</i>

49
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,150
Naruto.

50
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,017
{\an1}<i>You're one of the ones</i>
<i>I want to fight.</i>

51
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:15,653
Huh?

52
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:17,655
{\an7}<i>That made me happy.</i>

53
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,493
{\an7}<i>It was the first time Sasuke</i>
<i>acknowledged me as an equal.</i>

54
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:26,563
A'right, why don't you
introduce yourselves.
One at a time.

55
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:27,898
{\an8}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>But he...</i>

56
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:33,637
{\an1}My name's Sasuke Uchiha.
And I hate a lot of things.

57
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,239
{\an1}I don't really like anything.

58
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:40,611
{\an1}What I have is not a
dream, because I will
make it a reality.

59
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,083
{\an1}I'm going to restore my clan,
and destroy a certain someone.

60
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,088
[Itachi]
It's been a long time.

61
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,022
Sasuke.

62
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,892
Itachi.
It's you.

63
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:56,893
{\an8}<i>Sasuke!</i>

64
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,395
{\an1}Itachi.
You die!

65
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,264
{\an8}<i>This is who he was</i>
<i>talkin' about.</i>

66
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,900
{\an8}<i>The one he</i>
<i>wanted to kill.</i>

67
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,236
{\an1}It's like you said, brother.

68
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,773
{\an1}I've fostered my hatred
for you all this time.

69
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,643
{\an1}I've lived my life for
one single purpose.

70
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,482
To kill you!

71
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,586
It ends here!

72
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:28,824
{\an7}<i>Sasuke. You decided to</i>
<i>live only for revenge.</i>

73
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:35,262
{\an4}[Sai]
It's true that I was given
a classified mission to
find and eliminate Sasuke.

74
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:39,065
<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>But I'm through</i>
<i>following orders.</i>

75
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,569
{\an1}<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>From now on, I</i>
<i>think for myself.</i>

76
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,371
{\an1}And Naruto, you can
help me remember.

77
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,775
{\an1}<i>Bring back those old feelings.</i>

78
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,180
{\an1}I don't know much
about you, Sasuke,
but Naruto and Sakura,

79
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,750
{\an1}are willing to risk
everything, all for you.

80
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:04,089
{\an4}<i>They don't want to lose</i>
<i>their connection with you.</i>
<i>They would give anything</i>
<i>to protect those bonds!</i>

81
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:08,227
I might not
understand it clearly.

82
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,095
<i>But you, Sasuke.</i>

83
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,297
<i>You must understand it!</i>

84
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,667
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>You're right.</i>
<i>I did understand.</i>

85
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,804
{\an1}That's why I severed them!

86
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,640
{\an1}You see, I have a
different bond now.

87
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:26,244
{\an1}<i>Between my older</i>
<i>brother and me.</i>
<i>It's the bond of hatred.</i>

88
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,693
{\an7}<i>What about the bond,</i>
<i>between Sasuke and me?</i>

89
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,332
Let's just do this.

90
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:53,069
{\an1}But first wear your headband.
I'll wait for you.

91
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,038
I don't need that thing.

92
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,974
{\an1}Just do it! Now!

93
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,074
{\an1}There's no point!

94
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,578
'Cause you won't be
able to make a scratch
on my forehead!

95
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:02,812
So what?!

96
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,584
{\an1}You know puttin' your headband
on says we're fighting on
equal terms as Shinobi!

97
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:10,085
{\an1}[Sasuke]
There you go acting all
high and mighty again!

98
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:13,055
{\an1}You don't honestly believe
we're equals, do you?!

99
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,025
Heck yeah I do!

100
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:18,861
{\an1}All this time, I've never
once thought that I was
inferior to you in any way!

101
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:20,062
{\an1}You're an embarrassment!

102
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,433
{\an4}Next to me, you're
embarrassed about
how weak you are!
Isn't that right?!

103
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,301
Narutoooo!!

Lord Orochimaru has
already acquired the
Immortality Jutsu.

113

{\an1}He's immortal, but that
doesn't mean his body can
maintain itself forever.

114
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:08,041
{\an4}Before his flesh decays,
a strong, new body must
be made into a vessel for
his soul.

115
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:09,676
You mean,

116

{\an1}He'll use Sasuke's body!?

117

{\an1}That's right. He will.

{\an1}Why would you go
so far for me?

130

It's the first time,

131
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:13,169
That I've ever had

{\an1}I'll admit it.
You're definitely strong.

134
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:56,178
{\an1}It's because,

135
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:01,248
{\an1}You know the pain of solitude,
In just the same way that I do.

{\an1}<i>And...</i>

{\an1}It's that pain that
makes us stronger.

138
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:13,828
{\an4}Which means if I can
just break that bond,
I'll be able to achieve
even greater strength!

00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,975
I was... I was
dreaming about Sasuke.

148
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,946
{\an1}You're going to come back to
the village with me, Naruto.

149
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,216
{\an1}<i>That's a direct</i>
<i>order from Kakashi.</i>

150
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:48,884
{\an1}(cm mild determined reax as
stands)

151
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,222
Mmm?

152
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:00,729
{\an1}I'm sorry, Naruto.
Let Kakashi handle Sasuke.
Got it?

153
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,734
{\an1}Fine. Let me rest some more.

154
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,803
Then we can head
back to the Village.

155
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:14,776
{\an4}You really should eat
something, you know.
You need to keep up
your strength.

156
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,279
No, thanks.

157
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,346
I'm not hungry.

158
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:35,629
Sasuke said he was going
to sever his bond with
me and become stronger.

159
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,032
And that I could never
understand his feelings.

160
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:47,473
{\an1}Hey, you were friends
with Orochimaru way back,
right Pervy Sage?

161
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,945
{\an1}<i>Why did he desert the</i>
<i>village and decide to</i>
<i>destroy the Hidden Leaf?</i>

162
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:58,718
{\an1}Orochimaru went through a
profound change After both
his parents were killed.

163
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,387
{\an1}And that's when he became
obsessed with Forbidden Jutsu.

164
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,626
{\an1}<i>I don't know if he was trying</i>
<i>to resurrect his parents,</i>

165
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,762
{\an4}<i>or to wreak vengeance</i>
<i>on the village that</i>
<i>he held responsible</i>
<i>for their deaths.</i>

166
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,531
{\an1}<i>My parents weren't killed, so,</i>

167
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:21,640
{\an4}Like you, I was accused
of not being able to
understand anything about
him or his feelings.

168
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:26,278
{\an1}Perhaps he was right,
And I didn't understand a
thing about him after all.

169
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:32,549
However,

170
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:38,956
{\an1}Even I'm able to see that
there's entirely too much hate
in this Shinobi World of ours.

171
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,025
There's too much hate?

172
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,862
{\an4}[sigh] I've always
wanted to do
something about all
of this hatred.

173
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:48,265
{\an1}I'm just not quite
sure how to go about
it as of yet.

174
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,334
{\an1}But I truly believe,

175
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:56,439
{\an4}<i>that eventually the day</i>
<i>will come when all people</i>
<i>will understand one another</i>
<i>and live in harmony.</i>

176
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:04,280
{\an7}<i>To me, Pervy Sage was</i>
<i>irreplaceable.</i>

177
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,917
{\an7}<i>He was like... family.</i>

178
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:15,590
{\an8}<i>That's why...</i>

179
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,962
{\an1}I'm afraid Jiraiya-boy
has died in battle.

180
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,030
Huh...?!

181
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:25,534
{\an7}<i>When I heard that</i>
<i>Pervy Sage had died,</i>

182
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:32,274
{\an7}<i>For the very first time,</i>
<i>I really understood what</i>
<i>Sasuke was talking about.</i>

183
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,543
{\an7}<i>The pain of losing a bond.</i>

184
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,427
[snoring]

185
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,362
Huh?

186
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:57,231
{\an1}Naruto, C'mon, let's go.

187
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,100
{\an1}You ready?

188
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,303
{\an1}I really don't feel like
going outside right now.

189
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:05,138
{\an1}<i>Give me a little longer,</i>
<i>would you?</i>

190
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:11,510
{\an7}<i>Good. He still hasn't caught</i>
<i>on that I'm just a Shadow Clone.</i>

191
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:33,766
{\an1}So do you finally
comprehend pain now?

192
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:39,238
{\an1}Unless you come to know the
exact same pain you can't truly
comprehend someone else.

193
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:43,242
{\an4}And even if you
comprehend them,
you may not truly
understand them.

194
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,779
{\an1}That's the truth, Naruto.

195
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:52,650
{\an1}That is why it's useless for
you to chase after Sasuke.

196
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,618
People change.

197
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:58,022
{\an1}Sasuke is no longer the boy
that you knew long ago.

198
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,327
{\an1}Sasuke chose this
path all on his own.

199
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,397
{\an1}And the first thing is for
you to give up on Sasuke.

200
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,367
{\an1}<i>[Jiraya]</i>
<i>To be a shinobi, you need more</i>
<i>than strength and jutsu. </i>

201
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,602
{\an1}<i>You must become smarter.</i>

202
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:18,475
{\an1}The longer that you're a fool,
The harder it'll be for you to
live in this shinobi world.

203
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:24,181
{\an1}If being smarter means what
you say it does, I'll remain
a fool my entire life.

204
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:29,785
{\an7}<i>Well, Pervy Sage,</i>
<i>I guess I'm a big</i>
<i>fool after all.</i>

205
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:31,821
Ah!

206
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:33,355
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei's chakra.

207
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:34,723
This way!

208
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,493
{\an7}<i>Sakura, don't do</i>
<i>anything reckless.</i>

209
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,363
{\an1}I'm not sure.
This is just
conjecture,

210
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,865
{\an1}But I think Sakura,

211
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,937
{\an1}She's planning to
kill Sasuke herself.

212
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,513
{\an1}Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of
the Uchiha's hatred,

213
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:02,850
{\an1}and intends to strike
deep into the world
with that curse.

214
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:10,824
{\an4}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>That hate is his most</i>
<i>powerful weapon, his friend,</i>
<i>and the source of his power.</i>

215
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:15,195
{\an1}<i>That is Sasuke's Ninja Way!</i>

216
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,802
{\an1}You know what they say, Naruto?

217
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:29,876
{\an4}When two shinobi are powerful
enough, they are able to read
each other's thoughts simply
by an exchange of fists,

218
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,012
without ever uttering
a single word.

219
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,782
<i>You've always been</i>
<i>naïve, Naruto.</i>

220
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,386
{\an1}Tell me, do you
know my thoughts?

221
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,221
{\an1}What's on my mind?

222
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:54,032
{\an7}<i>Sasuke. Now I really understand</i>
<i>how you feel, what it's like to</i>
<i>have a close bond ripped away.</i>

223
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,107
{\an1}You just said you
consider Sasuke to be
like a brother to you.

224
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:08,879
{\an1}What if Sasuke were to attack
the Hidden Leaf Village?
What would you do then?

225
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:14,285
{\an1}Why would..? No, there's just
no way that Sasuke would ever
do something like that!

226
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:20,224
Sasuke is still a blank
canvas. He can easily
be dyed into any color.

227
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,726
If he resists,
would you be able
to stop him?

228
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,499
{\an1}Or even kill him if need be?

229
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:29,333
[gasp]

230
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,137
{\an1}Could you weigh Sasuke
against the Hidden Leaf
on a set of scales?

231
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:39,242
{\an1}I would defend the Village!
And I'd find a way to stop
Sasuke without killing him!

232
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:44,547
{\an1}You're such a child.
All your tales are
nothing but mere fantasies.

233
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:48,884
{\an1}Shinobi must be capable of
making very harsh decisions.

234
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:53,055
{\an1}We'll brand the Akatsuki
as wanted criminals.

235
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:57,392
{\an1}Once we do, not only I,
but the whole world
will hunt Sasuke down.

236
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,664
{\an1}<i>You bow your head for a</i>
<i>criminal and beg mercy to</i>
<i>keep your comrade safe.</i>

237
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:05,733
{\an1}<i>In the shinobi world,</i>
<i>that is not friendship!</i>

238
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,904
And If you've
truly resolved to
become a Kage,

239
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:14,576
{\an1}Then you're going to have
to so what needs to be
done as Sasuke's friend.

240
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:24,485
{\an7}<i>I don't even know what the right</i>
<i>thing to do is anymore. But...</i>

241
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:29,657
{\an1}You Hidden Leaf brat!
Think more deeply on what
it is you ought to do.

242
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,394
{\an1}The shinobi world is not so
indulgent as to suffer fools.

243
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,632
{\an1}I consider you a friend.

244
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:47,207
{\an1}In the past, friend
was just a word to me.
Nothing more, nothing less.

245
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:51,244
{\an1}But after meeting you,
I realized something.

246
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:55,415
<i>What's important is the</i>
<i>meaning of that word.</i>

247
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,984
{\an1}What does it mean to you?

248
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:06,158
{\an1}You must decide for yourself
what you can do for Sasuke.
Think hard on that.

249
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,563
{\an8}<i>Sasuke.</i>

250
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,365
{\an8}<i>If I see you,</i>

251
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,469
{\an7}<i>If we meet, I think</i>
<i>I'll know the answer.</i>

252
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,434
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Sakura, there's no need for</i>
<i>you to bear such a heavy burden.</i>

253
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,671
{\an1}<i>After all, it was my cowardice</i>
<i>that drove you all apart.</i>

254
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:13,012
{\an4}<i>Perhaps I was trying to</i>
<i>convince myself that once</i>
<i>again it could be like it was,</i>
<i>back in the old days.</i>

255
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,316
{\an1}<i>Next time on </i>
<i>Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>The Burden.</i>

256
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:21,554
{\an1}<i>I'm sorry I was such</i>
<i>a careless teacher.</i>
