getting close to him now.

CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Such
intensity to these flames.

3
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,861
-90 seconds to go.

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,695
-Yes.

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,463
-Time to die, witch!

6
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:03,964
-Huh?

7
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,277
Let's finish this, boy!

8
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,245
-You wish.

9
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,954
I figured as much.

10
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,923
You attached a chakra thread
during our last go around.

11
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,611
But that trick won't
work a second time.

12
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,613
Too bad for you, huh?

13
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,055
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
There's no time.

15
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:55,282
-What's wrong?

16
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,783
Don't wanna play?

17
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,025
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
The antidote will only

18
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,794
last for one more minute.

19
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,296
-All right, then.

20
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,034
-It's water.

21
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,101
Sakura, get back!

22
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:54,507
-How long do you
plan to dance around?

23
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,449
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
20 seconds left.

24
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:02,983
-Fine.

25
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:03,950
Be that way.

26
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:17,430

-Die.

30
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:37,851
-Lady Chiyo!

31
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,329
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): The
antidote is working.

32
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,864
If I can just endure the pain--

33
00:05:58,672 --> 00:05:59,739
SASORI (VOICEOVER): Useless.

34
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,279
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Five seconds left.

35
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,019
Four seconds.

36
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:11,987
-You little--

37
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:18,960
CHIYO (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

38
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:22,931
-Get over here!

39
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:26,534
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Three seconds.

40
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:27,035
Two.

41
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,501
-We were able to beat him just
before the antidote wore off.

42
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,744
We did it.

43
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:13,748
We really did it,
huh Lady Chiyo?

44
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:15,617
-Sakura.

45
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,751
Well done, child.

46
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,566
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
I don't like this.

47
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,002
The kid's cooled off.

48
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,403
What are they planning?

49
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:35,904
Hm.

50
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,279
-Hey Sensei.

51
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:45,880
You ready, or what?

52
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:48,383
-Hold your horses.

53
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,754
Remember, I don't have
as much chakra as you.

54
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:54,289
It's going to take time.

55
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,490
[rattling]

56
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,217
-What are you so happy about?

57
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,156
CHIYO: That's right.

58
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,837
The fight has only begun.

59
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,311
I forbade even myself
use of this jutsu.

60
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:31,786
I never imagined I
would use it again.

61
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,090
But against you, I must.

62
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:38,259
Let's finish this here and now.

63
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,489
-It's said the ability
of a puppet master

64
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:10,492
is measured by the number
of puppets they can use.

65
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:14,963
I'd expect no less
from you, grandmother.

66
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,499
-There's so many of them.

67
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,300
10 at one time?

68
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:22,337
-Granny Chiyo's secret
multiple digits.

69
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,007
I've heard tell of their glory.

70
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,811
You once destroyed an
entire fortress with it.

71
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:33,948
Secret White Move
Chikamatsu's Ten Puppets.

72
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:38,887
The first Puppet Master
Monzaemon's ten masterpieces.

73
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,555
An exquisite collection.

74
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,058
However.

75
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:02,477
[rattling]

76
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:15,957
-I used these to destroy
an entire nation.

77
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,336
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
He's grown so powerful.

78
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,674
-It's embarrassing, really.

79
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,444
How long does it
take to finish off

80
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:46,048
one little girl and an old bag?

81
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,418
I never thought I'd have to
resort to my best puppets.

82
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:02,230
Secret Red Move,
Performance of 100 Puppets.

83
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,165
It's showtime.

84
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,542
-Sakura.

85
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:17,312
That antidote of yours has
already worn off, dear.

86
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,847
Stay out of this.

87
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,454
Huh?

88
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,124
-It's not in me to give up.

89
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,525
Quitting's not an option.

90
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,937
-How silly of me.

91
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,673
You've inherited
Tsunade's strong will.

92
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:53,381
What's say we make this
the finale, though.

93
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,684
Are you ready, child?

94
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:56,618
-Yes.

95
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,387
-Hmph.

96
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:00,555
-Here they come.

97
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,398
Three Treasure Suction Crush!

98
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,819
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
There's too many of them.

99
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,522
I have to find a way to take
them all out in one shot.

100
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,134
-OK.

101
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,549
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
There's too many of them.

102
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,787
-You all right, Sakura?

103
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,755
-I'm OK.

104
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:47,489
-Good.

105
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,723
Stay sharp.

106
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,258
-Right.

107
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,726
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
We've definitely

108
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,229
thinned out Sasori's puppets.

109
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,731
But conversely,
it looks like he's

110
00:15:56,765 --> 00:16:00,669
focusing more intensely
on the ones that we made.

111
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:06,174
Only one antidote left, and if
either of us takes any damage,

112
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,176
we're going to be
in a lot of trouble.

113
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,184
-Lady Chiyo!

114
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:17,052
-Oh no!

115
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,730
-Are you all right
over there, Lady Chiyo?

116
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:31,466
-Don't you worry
about me, Sakura.

117
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:34,769
Right now, you just
focus on Sasori.

118
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,906
I'll keep the other
puppets in check.

119
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:38,406
-Right.

120
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,528
-Sakura.

121
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,763
Here, use this!

122
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:54,482
-Take this!

123
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:58,980
We did it.

124
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,387
-He can't move.

125
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:08,690
That sealing traps
every ounce of chakra

126
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,359
stored in a person's body.

127
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:15,330
Using his chakra threads
is impossible now.

128
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,900
It's over, Sasori.

129
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:19,901
-Lady Chiyo.

130
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:20,802
Quick.

131
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,070
Here's the antidote.

how pretty she was.

of nice qualities.

GAARA: True.

she'd go so soon.

Never.

With Team Guy's lone

a master of just about

00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:21,996
And now, to unveil my
new pervy ninjutsu!

168
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,097
-Ooh!

169
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,366
-Will you knock it off?

170
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:31,673
-Wow.

171
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:33,374
That might be a new record.

172
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,109
-Hmph.
