pretty impressive for
a building stuck out in
the middle of nowhere.

Well, I'm not sensing
any shinobi chakra in
the area nearby.

{\an1}No way. We're going
to the Hidden Leaf.

{\an1}"A raccoon dog, lived in a log,
high up on Senba Mountain.

by a hunter's shot,
And that raccoon dog was done."

15

{\an4}The creature was grilled,

{\an4}We've just gotten word that
some ninja on the national
Most Wanted Criminals list
have entered the Land of Fire.

33
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,270
{\an1}Your team is to learn what
their objective is and
track their movements.

34
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,773
{\an1}But there is one hitch.

35

{\an1}I take it that things
aren't going well?

No.

37
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:24,152
{\an4}Naruto has always been the one
trying to catch up to Sasuke.
He wants Sasuke's approval
more than anything.

38
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:30,359
{\an1}Sasuke, on the other hand,
has seen Naruto's abilities grow
and has come to feel inferior.

39
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:33,496
{\an1}Being rivals can be quite
difficult.

40
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:38,268
{\an1}It reminds me of the
relationship between
Jiraiya and Orochimaru.

41
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:42,740
{\an1}Well, all right.
I guess we should just
let them cool off a bit.

42
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:45,108
{\an1}Just you and Sasuke will
go on this mission, then.

What about
Naruto and Sakura?

44
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,950

them really my

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,698
{\an1}That's right;
they're the very ones!

63
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,166
{\an1}There's no way I'd
feel safe with them!

But Sasuke is away on
another mission.

67
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:48,713
{\an1}I don't care! Have them
go on that mission instead.
I want Sasuke now!

68
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,818

these two are full-fledged

00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,751
{\an1}Our mission is to track
the movements of some
wanted criminals.

147
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,586
{\an1}Don't let your guard down.

148
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,988
Got it.

149
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,559
{\an1}[Sasuke(Naruto)]
Are we getting close to
Shizume Village yet?

150
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,130
{\an1}I think it's just on the
other side of this forest.

151
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,631
{\an1}Good, almost there.

152
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,302
{\an1}You're the best, Sasuke...

153
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,506
{\an4}<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>You know, when she's</i>
<i>asleep, she's actually</i>
<i>really cute.</i>

154
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,145
{\an1}I mean I still don't get it, But
I guess Sasuke is her hero.

155
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,180
{\an1}Seems so.

156
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,127
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Hardly anybody's here.</i>

157
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:34,132
Yeah, it looks like
they've gone somewhere.

158
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,336
But the question is,
where, exactly?

159
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:42,141
Ah! Is this a plan for
a kidnapping?

160
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:44,811
{\an1}This says it will take place
near Shizume Village...

161
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:48,881
{\an1}<i>Seems the target is a girl</i>
<i>named Naho, who's related</i>
<i>to the Feudal Lord.</i>

162
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,885
{\an1}Ah! Wait, I know that girl!

163
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,757
Who are you guys?!

164
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,496
{\an1}Naho, I'm gonna have
to put you down.

165
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:04,699
Why? What's
going on now?

166
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,737
{\an1}Get lost. We have no
business with you two.

167
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,139
What do you mean?

168
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:14,076
{\an1}Target confirmed.
Hand over the girl
and we'll let you leave.

169
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,912
No way; I won't hand her
over to people like you!

170
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,949
{\an1}That's right, Sasuke,
you tell 'em!

171
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,985
{\an1}And if they won't listen
to you, then make
mincemeat out of 'em all!

172
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,920
{\an1}That's just what I'm gonna do!

173
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:27,591
Sakura, keep Naho safe!

174
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,961
{\an1}All right! Multi-Shadow
Clone Jutsu!

175
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,600
{\an1}Whoa! There's so many!

176
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,570
{\an1}Wow! Look at all those Sasukes!

177
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,172
{\an1}Right! Let's do this!

178
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,574
{\an1}Sasuke Punch! Ha!

179
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,811
{\an1}Sasuke, you are just so awesome!

180
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,846
Sasuke Kick!

181
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,181
How wonderful!

182
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,683
{\an1}Sasuke Chop, Chop, and Chop!

183
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,752
Mesmerizing!

184
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:53,421
Heh heh!

185
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,823
Haup!

186
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,291
Oof! Augh! Hoo!

187
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:58,659
Gimme a break.

188
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,831
{\an1}Earth Style! Mudslide Jutsu!

189
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:08,603
{\an1}[Sasuke Narutos
getting slammed]
Augh! Whoa! Wahh! Yahh!

190
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,173
Ah!!

191
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,276
{\an1}Don't worry,
I got this.
Let's go!

192
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,580
{\an1}U - zu - ma - ki!

193
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,982
Uh, I mean...

194
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,085
Lions Barrage!

195
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,923
He did it!

196
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,926
Huh?
Huh?

197
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,364
{\an1}A jutsu like that, Heh!
is useless against me!

198
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,200
{\an1}You don't know when to quit.

199
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,902
Sasuke, go beat
that guy up for me!

200
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,938
{\an1}Naho, Stay back!
It's dangerous!

201
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,117
{\an1}This time, I'll make sure
you don't get back up!

202
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:53,421
Take this!

203
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,189
Rasengan!

204
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:57,859
Hauuugghh!

205
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,462
[heavy breathing]

206
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:01,897
Aww yeah!

207
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,031
How's that?!

208
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:05,167
{\an1}Hey, Naho, Sakura, that was
pretty cool, wasn't it?

209
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:06,969
Huh?!

210
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,441
{\an1}Sasuke! Please help me!

211
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:12,675
{\an1}No! Naho!

212
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,347
{\an1}<i>Keep getting in our way,</i>
<i>and this girl will die.</i>

213
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,482
But, I got you!

214
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:22,987
{\an1}No, your attack failed.
That jutsu's strong but
it's incomplete.

215
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,489
Oh, yeah?

216
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,689
Augh!

217
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:32,398
{\an1}What?!

218
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:33,832
No! Sasuke!

219
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:39,071
{\an1}Wait a minute...
You're not Sasuke at all!

220
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:42,409
{\an1}Sasuke, please,
come and help me!

221
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,646
{\an1}Help, Sasuke!

222
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:51,653
{\an1}[Pakkun]
I followed the trail
the ninja left...

223
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:52,654
[sniff sniff]

224
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,289
{\an1}But the scent's mixed up here.

225
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:58,327
{\an1}They must have gotten into a
scuffle with Naruto and Sakura.

226
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,529
{\an1}We just missed them.

227
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,566
Why is Naruto even
involved in this?

228
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:08,904
{\an1}Naruto and Sakura are both
currently on a mission as
bodyguards for that girl, Naho.

229
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:09,772
What was that?!

230
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,145
{\an1}They're not here. So it must
mean they've been taken captive.
This is bad.

231
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,282
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu!

232
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,586
{\an1}We don't have much time.

233
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,890
{\an4}<i>Sasuke, I'm leaving</i>
<i>Pakkun with you.</i>
<i>We'll split up and</i>
<i>search for them.</i>

234
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,292
Right, understood.

235
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,767
{\an4}I don't get it.
We can ransom
the girl for money,
but not those ninja.

236
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,170
{\an1}shouldn't we just've
gotten rid of them?

237
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,807
{\an1}If we're up against ninja,
then having more hostages
couldn't hurt.

238
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,012
{\an5}You guys are gonna
regret doing this to us!
When I get loose, you're
all toast!

239
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,048
{\an1}A ninja who can't weave hand
signs isn't much of a threat.

240
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:50,751
{\an1}Rrgh! You just wait;
you'll see!

241
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:52,487
Aum!

242
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,222
{\an1}Hey! Cut that out!

243
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,860
{\an1}Even if I can't weave
signs, I'll stop you!

244
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,834
{\an1}Quick, Naho, run!

245
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:07,937
Aah!

246
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:12,776
[panicked cries]
Ah! Ahh! Yah!

247
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,678
Naho!

248
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,581
{\an1}You can't escape.

249
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,053
{\an1}Kids who try to run are naughty
and have to be punished.

250
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,423
{\an1}Sasuke, please help...

251
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:27,293
{\an1}I need you, Sasuke!!

252
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:31,163
{\an1}<i>[echoes]</i>
<i>Sasuke... Sasuke...</i>
<i>Sasuke... Sasuke...</i>

253
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:36,069
{\an1}Yell all that you want. It's no
use; no one's coming to help.

{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>

257

258
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:47,548
huh, You're not bad.

259
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:50,184
So you're the real
Sasuke, then,
is that right?

260
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,185
{\an1}The real one?

261
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,723
That brat over there
has been impersonating
you this whole time.

262
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:55,924
He did what?!

263
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,026
{\an1}I had to because you were late!

264
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,430
{\an1}Hey kid, we're here to help.

265
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:01,464
Pakkun!

266
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:07,371
Your friend actually
fought pretty well when
he was disguised as you.

267
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,005
{\an1}So how about the real thing?

268
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,242
{\an1}I'll show you right now.
Come on, let's go!

269
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:18,882
{\an8}<i>He's fast!</i>

270

Sasuke!

271
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,794
{\an1}Come on, bite through, already!

272
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,396
I'm doing my best,
you know!

273
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,477
{\an1}What's taking so long?!

274
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,977
I'm working on it!

275
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,018
You're pretty tough.

276
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:54,456
{\an1}And you're pretty lame;
an attack that weak
won't work on me.

277
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,558
{\an1}Well, then how about this one?

278
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,962
{\an1}Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!

279
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:03,533
Sasuke!

280
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,511
{\an1}<i>Heh heh heh heh.</i>

281
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,914
{\an1}This just won't do at all,
will it?

282
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:20,419
{\an1}I have to admit that I'll miss
the protection it gives me,
though.

283
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:30,196
{\an1}Ahh. My original skin is
much more comfortable
anyway. It's lighter.

284
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:33,534
{\an1}Unbelievable! He was
armored by Earth Style!

285
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:37,137
{\an1}So that's it! That's why my
Rasengan didn't work before!

286
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:40,941
{\an1}Now that you know the real me,
let's start over again,
shall we?

287
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,109
{\an8}<i>He's gone!</i>

288
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:48,116
{\an1}You didn't even try to dodge!
You're really not much of an
opponent, are you?

289
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:53,689
Sasuke!
Hold on, I'm coming!

290
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,392
{\an1}Back off!
This guy is all mine!

291
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,398
{\an1}Ooh, Sharingan.
So you're an Uchiha, then!

292
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,767
You know about the
Sharingan, do you?

293
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,271
{\an4}As shinobi for hire,
my people have worked
in many places for
various employers.

294
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:13,077
{\an1}In the last great war, members
of the Uchiha clan were among
the people we faced in battle.

295
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:14,880
{\an1}Oh, that's right!

296
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,650
{\an1}I do remember hearing that there
was one Uchiha named Itachi,

297
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:22,020
{\an1}who betrayed the Hidden
Leaf Village and slaughtered
his entire clan!

298
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:27,360
{\an1}<i>But it appears that there</i>
<i>was a survivor among the</i>
<i>Uchiha after all...</i>

299
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,997
{\an1}Or could it be that perhaps,
you simply weren't
worth killing?

300
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,470
Oh, don't worry;
you're not even
worth killing.

301
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,941
{\an1}You don't interest me
at the moment.

302
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:47,148
{\an1}Naruto is the prize that
the Akatsuki are after,
And we will have him.

303
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,051
Just shut up!

304
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:56,827
{\an1}Oh, my, it seems that I've
touched a nerve and upset you.

305
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,729
{\an1}That's exactly why...

306
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,162
Hyeaa!

307
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:01,965
{\an1}...you're a fool!

308
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,302
{\an1}Wha?!

309
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:10,173
Haauugghh!!

310
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,115
{\an1}Sasuke, don't you
think that's enough?

311
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,386
{\an1}Are you trying to tell me
what to do, now, Naruto?

312
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,321
Just stay out of it.

313
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,224
Stop, Sasuke...
You're scary.

314
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,191
Hmph.

315
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,862
{\an1}<i>Please,</i>
<i>spare me!</i>

316
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,863
Kakashi!

317
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,064
{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>Kakashi Sensei!</i>

318
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,370
{\an1}You can stop now. We still
have a lot of questions that
we need him to answer for us.

319
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:39,440
Hey!

320
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,410
{\an1}I'm going back
to the Village.

321
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,145
[sigh]

322
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,381
But why, Sasuke?!

323
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,283
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,853
He just, He's got a
lot on his mind now.

325
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,623
But he really
is a good guy,
I swear!

326
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,792
{\an1}Just try to forgive him, okay?

327
00:20:57,293 --> 00:20:58,028
{\an1}Mm.

328
00:20:58,062 --> 00:20:59,730
Yeah, that-a girl!

329
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:03,200
{\an1}And one day when he's back
to his old self, I'll take
you to visit him.

330
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:21,088
{\an7}<i>Sasuke... I promise I'll</i>
<i>bring you back home...</i>

<i>Did you say Danzo?!</i>
<i>He's the new Hokage?!</i>

{\an1}<i>[Naruto]</i>
<i>And he approved</i>
