1
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:51,560
Danzo Shimura

2
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,730
{\an1}I suppose this is the
extent of Sasuke's power.

3
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:36,174
You were too hasty.
My last eye is
still open.

4
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:41,313
Go to Itachi. You need
a lecture, for all the
good it'll do you.

5
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,948
I win, Sasuke.

6
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:51,257
{\an7}<i>What's going on?! I feel...</i>
<i>Wait, that's--!</i>

7
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,601
{\an5}You may think that
you've seen right
through my Izanagi,
but--

8
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:02,469
[gasp]

9
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,710
{\an7}<i>What?! What is this?!</i>

10
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,445
[wet cough]

11
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,816
{\an8}<i>Why won't the</i>
<i>Izanagi activate?</i>

12
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,318
[panting]

13
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:26,227
{\an1}Danzo, you were right,
Sasuke's genjutsu is nowhere
near as refined as Itachi's.

14
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,479
Why, you insolent boy!

15
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:55,057
{\an1}You're the one who's
going to see Itachi!

16
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:03,500
[panting]

17
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:08,138
{\an7}<i>Ah ha! Just as I thought!</i>
<i>This one's the real Danzo!</i>

18
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,709
Eeeaaggh!!

19
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,411
Augh... oof!

20
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:20,651
{\an4}It's a far cry from Itachi's
Tsukuyomi, in which he could
freely manipulate time
within a genjutsu.

21
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,192
{\an4}But even a weak little
genjutsu with no staying
power can be mighty,
depending on how it's used.

22
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:36,234
{\an1}With Izanagi, a Sharingan
is cast away once the
jutsu's been exhausted.

23
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:39,772
{\an1}One eye will keep the jutsu
active for 60 seconds.

24
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:41,373
However,

25
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,652
{\an1}<i>Sasuke's relentless</i>
<i>attacks might have</i>
<i>appeared to be suicidal,</i>

26
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:59,726
{\an1}<i>but they were intended to</i>
<i>completely shut down all of</i>
<i>Danzo's Sharingan, one by one.</i>

27
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:03,464
{\an1}<i>Sasuke knew exactly</i>
<i>what he was doing.</i>

28
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:14,575
{\an4}<i>Before Danzo and Sasuke</i>
<i>exchanged blows just then,</i>
<i>every Sharingan on Danzo's</i>
<i>right arm had already shut.</i>

29
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:20,981
{\an1}<i>Sasuke is an Uchiha.</i>
<i>And he possesses the</i>
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan.</i>

30
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:26,721
{\an1}<i>His powers of observation are</i>
<i>still greater than yours, Danzo.</i>

31
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:31,526
{\an1}<i>Faster than you could</i>
<i>realize, Sasuke had</i>
<i>placed a genjutsu on you,</i>

32
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,363
{\an1}<i>making it look like the</i>
<i>last eye on your right</i>
<i>arm was still open.</i>

33
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:40,469
{\an1}<i>You were concerned about the</i>
<i>inexact nature of how long</i>
<i>the Izanagi would last.</i>

34
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:44,006
{\an1}<i>So you kept checking</i>
<i>the Sharingan on</i>
<i>your right arm.</i>

35
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,242
{\an1}<i>Sasuke noticed that.</i>

36
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,116
{\an1}<i>He wanted to make you think the</i>
<i>Izanagi would last longer, and</i>
<i>it only took a subtle change.</i>

37
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:59,890
{\an1}<i>He'd already confirmed that he</i>
<i>could place you under genjutsu,</i>
<i>even if for just an instant.</i>

38
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,326
{\an1}<i>Sasuke seized his opportunity.</i>

39
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:10,267
{\an1}<i>Because you possess the</i>
<i>Sharingan, you underestimated</i>
<i>how to use it in battle. </i>

40
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:13,938
{\an1}<i>Your arrogance has</i>
<i>led to your defeat.</i>

41
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,408
[pained moans]

42
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,880
[panting]

43
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:25,216
{\an1}Now that's battling
with your eyes.

44
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,754
{\an1}Never mock the Uchiha!

45
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:36,061
{\an1}Danzo couldn't use Shisui's eye,
but still. Good job pressing
him as far as you did, Sasuke.

46
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,667
{\an1}<i>Looks like I'll be able to</i>
<i>take Shisui's eye soon.</i>

47
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,772
{\an1}<i>The Foundation should have</i>
<i>stayed hidden underground.</i>

48
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,046
Hrk!

49
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,615
I'm coming, Sasuke!

50
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:02,022
{\an1}You okay? Hurry!
Go on, bite down!

51
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,362
[shriek]
Aughhh!

52
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:15,971
{\an1}Bringing that woman along
was a wise decision.
She seems very useful.

53
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,941
{\an1}I see now why Sasuke chose
her to be part of his team.

54
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:26,381
[panting]

55
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,287
Nnnghh...
Augh...

56
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:40,830
{\an7}<i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>How could I lose to</i>
<i>such a brat?!</i>

57
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:44,935
{\an7}<i>I cannot go down here...</i>
<i>or die yet!</i>

58
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,840
Yaahhh!!

59
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:57,280
{\an7}<i>No! At this rate,</i>
<i>I'll be taken over by the</i>
<i>First Hokage's cells!</i>

60
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:08,926
{\an4}He's near death and is losing
the ability to control chakra.
Hashirama's power is certainly
not easy to manage.

61
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,564
[panting]

62
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,770
Unbelievable!
He's so
persistent!

63
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:33,385
{\an1}No. Not yet. This is where
we battle with our eyes.

64
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:37,356
{\an1}The visual prowess in his
right eye has returned.

65
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,994
{\an1}I see. So that was his plan.

66
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:44,931
{\an1}He was covering with the
Izanagi until Shisui's
eye recuperated.

67
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,643
{\an1}Shisui's visual prowess.
I see.

68
00:08:55,676 --> 00:09:00,648
{\an1}Danzo is debating whether
to use it for genjutsu, or
sacrifice it for the Izanagi.

69
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,289
{\an1}You used your visual
prowess too much.

70
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:10,224
[choking]
Help me, Sasuke!

71
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,293
{\an7}<i>Sasuke is no longer useful.</i>

72
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:16,397
{\an7}<i>As I thought, Madara's the</i>
<i>one I need to place under</i>
<i>genjutsu and manipulate.</i>

73
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,167
{\an7}<i>I can't waste time,</i>
<i>my wound is deep.</i>

74
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:25,707
{\an1}Now, Sasuke.
What will you do?

75
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:41,925
How ironic that you, who
extolled self-sacrifice,
would take a hostage.

76
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,294
{\an1}It's not that I consider
my life too precious.

77
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:49,465
{\an1}But for the Leaf and the
whole shinobi world.

78
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,536
{\an1}I simply cannot afford
to die here today.

79
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:56,006
{\an1}<i>No matter what the means,</i>
<i>I must survive.</i>

80
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,478
{\an1}<i>For I will be the one,</i>
<i>the reformer who will</i>
<i>change the shinobi world.</i>

81
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:04,983
{\an1}And this woman's just a
sacrifice to that cause.

82
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,485
Sasuke, help!
Do something!

83
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:12,490
Don't move, Karin.
Hold still.

84
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,201
(stabbed reax)

85
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:32,145
{\an7}<i>He hit a vital point...</i>
<i>right through the hostage!</i>

86
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:36,149
{\an1}He he he he he!
Now that's my boy.

87
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,752
One down.

88
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:41,387
{\an1}Soon the rest, big brother.

89
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:02,777
You didn't have enough
time for the Izanagi,
did you, Danzo.

90
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:07,115
{\an7}<i>Sasuke... Was I nothing to you?</i>

91
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:08,951
Was I just...?

92
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:14,790
{\an1}Karin, if you're slow
enough to be taken hostage,
then you're just a burden.

93
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,482
{\an1}[panting]

94
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:08,413

{\an1}Danzo.

96
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,528
{\an1}I'm taking Shisui's eye.

97
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,198
<i>[Inabi] [flashback]</i>
<i>Is Itachi in there?!</i>

98
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,334
{\an1}Come here.
We need to talk!

99
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,607
What's going on?
What're you all
doing here?

100
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:41,112
{\an1}There were two people
who didn't show up at
yesterday's assembly.

101
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,347
Wanna tell me why
you weren't there?

102
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:49,754
{\an4}<i>You're in the Anbu Black</i>
<i>Ops now, I know full well</i>
<i>you can be called away at</i>
<i>the drop of a hat.</i>

103
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,858
{\an5}And that's the case
your father was trying
to make when we asked
why you weren't there.

104
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:57,429
{\an4}But we're not him;
so you won't get any
special treatment
from us!

105
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:03,568
{\an1}I understand; guess I should
have been more careful. Will
that be all, gentlemen?

106
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:09,875
{\an4}Yeah, sure thing.
Oh, but you know what,
before we go, there's
just one other thing.

107
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:15,214
{\an4}Know anything about
Shisui Uchiha?
He killed himself in
Nakano River.

108
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:22,456
{\an8}<i>He was the one who</i>

Danzo, you all right?

111
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:47,148
{\an1}I'm fine! Why'd you
interfere, Hiruzen?!

112
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:52,487
{\an4}C'mon, don't be that way.
I just don't want to lose any
comrades in a situation
like this, y'know?

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,067
All right, then.

119
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,003
Let's go meet up with
the Second Hokage.

120
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,478
Tch.

121
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,188
<i>[Second Hokage]</i>
<i>We've been surrounded.</i>

122
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:28,725
{\an1}<i>There are...</i>
<i>Twenty enemy shinobi.</i>

123
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:35,600
{\an1}From their tracking abilities,
I'd say they're Cloud ninja.
The highly skilled Kinkaku Unit.

124
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:40,204
{\an1}We're only seven,
including you, Lord Second.
We're outnumbered.

125
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,740
{\an1}Homura! Stop being
such a coward!

126
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,878
{\an1}Alright, the enemy has
not yet pinpointed our
exact location.

127
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:50,549
{\an1}So we should wait and
ambush them, then break
through to escape.

128
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,584
No, that's not
gonna work.

129
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,521
{\an1}The only way it would is if
one of us draws their
attention and misdirects them.

130
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,256
{\an1}They'll act as a lure.

131
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,491
{\an1}It means certain death.

132
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,529
So who?

133
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:19,145
{\an7}<i>I am a shinobi. I'm resolved to</i>
<i>die like one on the battlefield.</i>

135
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,256

<i>make that sacrifice?</i>

136
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,833
{\an7}<i>Go ahead! Say it! That I'll...</i>

137
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:44,239
{\an7}<i>Augh, What's wrong?!</i>
<i>Why can't I say that</i>
<i>I'll do it?!</i>

138
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:46,608
I'll go do it.

139
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,277
Sarutobi...

140
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,912
{\an1}Hiruzen,
you sure?

141
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,181
{\an1}Hah, don't worry about me!

142
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,353
{\an5}I don't mean to brag,
but I know I have the
best chance out of all
of you to pull this off.

143
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:58,753
I'm not gonna die.

144
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,992
{\an7}<i>My trembling, It stopped!</i>

145
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:09,666
{\an7}<i>Damn it! I'm such a coward.</i>
<i>Somewhere deep inside my heart</i>
<i>right now,</i>

146
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:11,934
{\an8}<i>I'm relieved!</i>

147
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:19,276
{\an1}You look after the others,
Danzo, okay? I trust--

148
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:22,346
Shut up! I was going to
volunteer, you know!

149
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:26,450
{\an5}Don't try to steal
the limelight!
I'll be the lure!
Not you!

150
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,352
Danzo, I...

151
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:35,826
{\an4}My father and grandfather
died in battle as shinobi!
Self-sacrifice is a
shinobi's duty!

152
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,696
{\an1}I will go and play
the lure, of course.

153
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:43,534
{\an4}You're the ones who will carry
on the Will of Fire, who will
defend our village in the
future.

154
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,472
But you can't!
I mean, you're
the Hokage!

155
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:49,275
{\an1}There is no greater
shinobi in our village!

156
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:54,380
{\an1}Danzo, you are always vying with
Saru over one thing or another.

157
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:59,251
{\an1}But what's necessary
here is for you to work
together as comrades.

158
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,453
{\an1}Don't make this a
personal fight.

159
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:05,292
{\an1}<i>The fact is, you took too</i>
<i>long to reach a decision.</i>

160
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:10,630
{\an4}First you must take a
hard look at yourself
and come to understand
who you are objectively.

161
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,000
{\an1}Or else, at this rate, you'll
place all your comrades in
danger.

162
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:20,708
{\an1}<i>In any case, Danzo and Saru,</i>
<i>you need not be so eager at</i>
<i>your young age.</i>

163
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:26,747
{\an1}<i>Your day will come eventually.</i>
<i>And until it does, you should</i>
<i>endeavor to stay alive.</i>

164
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,685
Saru.

165
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:37,426
{\an1}Love and treasure the Village,
and protect all those who
believe in you.

166
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:42,096
{\an1}And nurture those ninja
to whom you can entrust
the next generation.

167
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,201
{\an1}Starting tomorrow,
you're Hokage!

168
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,644
Saru.

169
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,412
{\an1}Take care of the Leaf!

170
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:57,913
Yes sir!

171
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,854
{\an7}<i>Sarutobi! You're always</i>
<i>walking ahead of me!</i>

172
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:10,561
[panting]

173
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:17,501
{\an1}For the shinobi world
and the Leaf, I cannot let
you two continue to live!

174
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:20,839
Aah!

175
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,742
{\an1}It's a Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu!

176
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,477
{\an1}<i>[Madara]</i>
<i>Sasuke! Get away from Danzo!</i>

177
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,015
{\an8}<i>Hiruzen.</i>

178
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,252
{\an7}<i>It's my turn next.</i>

179
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:43,863
{\an1}<i>[Hiruzen, Third Hokage]</i>
<i>Where the tree leaves dance,</i>
<i>one shall find flames.</i>

180
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,866
{\an1}<i>The fire's shadow will</i>
<i>illuminate the village.</i>

181
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:52,638
{\an1}<i>And once again tree</i>
<i>leaves shall bud anew.</i>

182
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,609
{\an1}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>Just as you gave your life,</i>

183
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,113
{\an1}<i>to protect the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf Village,</i>

184
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,155
{\an7}<i>This time, I will, too.</i>

185
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,490
{\an7}<i>I will stop them.</i>

186
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:17,364
{\an8}<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>I never got to</i>
<i>be Hokage.</i>

187
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:21,369
{\an7}<i>No matter how far I ran,</i>

188
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,339
{\an8}<i>I could never</i>
<i>catch up to you.</i>

189
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,378
{\an7}<i>You were a tree leaf</i>
<i>upon which light shone.</i>

190
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:09,854
{\an7}<i>I was nothing but a foundation,</i>
<i>hidden in darkness. </i>

191
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,225
{\an7}<i>So what do you think of me? </i>

192
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,393
{\an8}<i>Eh, Hiruzen...?</i>

193
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,531
{\an7}<i>What was I to you?</i>

194
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,736
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>I wonder when I first</i>
<i>started liking Sasuke.</i>

195
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,275
{\an1}<i>I never gave a thought to</i>
<i>who he really was behind</i>
<i>that pensive face.</i>

196
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:12,717
{\an1}<i>Naruto, I let you bear the</i>
<i>burden all on your own. I'm so</i>
<i>sorry, but I'm also grateful.</i>

197
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,552
{\an1}<i>However, I've already decided!</i>

198
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:19,057
{\an1}<i>[Kakashi]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Sakura's Resolve.</i>

199
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:22,094
{\an1}<i>I hope I get there in time!</i>
