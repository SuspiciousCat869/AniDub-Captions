1
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,791
{\an1}Dead men shouldn't go
around screwing things up!

2
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:19,926
[attacking yell]

3
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:25,731
[grunting]

4
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:30,902
Huh?!

5
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:33,872
{\an1}Uchiha Reflection!

6
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:56,627
[gasp]

7
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:02,398
{\an1}I'll get the Eight and
Nine Tails. Obito, you

8
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:03,799
{\an1}take down those two down.

9
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:04,866
[gasp]

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,402
{\an1}You're not getting away!

11
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,310
{\an1}Obito, what happened to you?!

12
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,512
{\an1}Why'd you join him?!

13
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,622
Summoning Jutsu!

14
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,891
[roaring]

15
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,653
{\an1}You're late, Obito!

16
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:05,389
{\an1}You finally got here!
So, you're Obito, huh?

17
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:06,490
{\an1}We've been waiting!

18
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,059
Made it...

19
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,694
{\an1}Sure, but you're super late!

20
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,828
{\an1}Well, we're all done with
our self-introductions.

21
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,131
{\an1}Other than yours, that is.

22
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:16,399
[chuckle]

23
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:18,267
{\an1}I'm the future Hokage!

24
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,102
Obito Uchiha!

25
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,638
I'm gonna get my
trademark goggles as

26
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:25,206
{\an1}well as my Sharingan
carved into my Great

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,142
{\an1}Stone Face for all to see!

28
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:29,911
That way I'll be
able to glare down at

29
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,746
{\an1}all the other villages!

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,047
[sigh]

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,948
{\an1}I'll scare the hell out
of all of them with my

32
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:37,318
Sharingan stare!
And no one will

33
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,219
{\an1}dare attack our village!

34
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,655
{\an1}Put in that request after
you become Hokage and

35
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,791
{\an1}activate your Sharingan!

36
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,892
{\an1}Besides, they can't carve
the Sharingan if you're

37
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,060
wearing goggles!

38
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,429
{\an1}They can carve 'em in
front of my goggles!

39
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,930
{\an1}But then it'll look
like your eyeballs

40
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,265
are popping out!

41
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,466
[giggling]

42
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,335
[sad sigh]

43
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,569
Anyway...

44
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,638
{\an1}I'm glad someone on
the team shares my dream

45
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,205
of being Hokage!

46
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,307
I'm Minato. I'll
be your superior.

47
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,308
{\an1}It's nice to meet you!

48
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,409
Yeah it is!

49
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:08,913
Minato Sensei...

50
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,615
[roar]

51
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,050
All of this...

52
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:16,420
This world...

53
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,526
Doesn't matter
to me anymore!

54
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:49,417
[growl]

55
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,453
{\an1}I won't let that happen,
idiot! After all, I am the

56
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,288
{\an1}Fourth Hokage's son!

57
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:58,058
{\an1}There's no way I'm
gonna fall for your talk!

58
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:02,261
{\an1}I see. I was going easy on
you because you're the

59
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,997
{\an1}actual Jinchuriki,
not a clone.

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,600
{\an1}But I warn you, I can't
hold back with this

61
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:11,169
{\an1}Hashirama's Wooden
Dragon. He used it to hold

62
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,238
{\an1}down my Nine Tails.

63
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,344
<i>Madara really is</i>
<i>crazy powerful!</i>

64
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,179
{\an1}And that's exactly
what makes him such

65
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,281
{\an1}a worthy opponent.

66
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,416
[wet cough]

67
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:28,118
{\an1}Your tough guy act
is crazy solid...

68
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:31,422
{\an1}I'm not gonna hold back
against a zombie, either!

69
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,257
{\an1}Since you're dead anyway!

70
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,759
[roar]

71
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,597
[roar]

72
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,437
[roaring]

73
00:04:56,611 --> 00:05:00,047
{\an1}Obito! Why ally yourself
with someone like Madara?

74
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:05,920
{\an1}I've got nothing at
all to say to you.

75
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,354
{\an1}All that's left...

76
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,624
...is this, the
final battle!

77
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:04,928
Earth Style
Mud Wall!

78
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,401
[gasp]

79
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,204
[grunting]

80
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,609
But... why?!

81
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:23,045
{\an1}How about you keep
your mouth shut?

82
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,246
You're all talk!
You're scum!

83
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,673
{\an1}I believe that the
White Fang of the Hidden

84
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,508
{\an1}Leaf was a true hero.

85
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,879
{\an1}You're right, in the Ninja
World, those who break the

86
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,448
{\an1}rules and laws are
regarded as scum.

87
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:05,482
[gasp]

88
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:06,818
But...

89
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,720
Those who would
abandon even one of their

90
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:12,322
{\an1}friends are worse
than scum.

91
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,725
{\an1}The reason is because...

92
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,360
You...

93
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,795
...let Rin die.

94
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:34,976
{\an1}I am scum, for sure.

95
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,379
{\an1}Obito, you've always...

96
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,781
Kamui...

97
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,149
...been my hero.

98
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:45,452
So why?

99
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,857
Come on!
Damn it!

100
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,159
[roaring]

101
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,531
[gasp]

102
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,571
{\an1}That wooden thing is...

103
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,840
{\an1}It's absorbing Nine
Tails' chakra!

104
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,381
Come on!

105
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:30,392
{\an1}We share our eyes...
So you made it out, huh?

106
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:33,529
Obito, how'd you
end up like this?!

107
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,867
{\an1}Does it have to do with Rin?

108
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:54,182
{\an1}I will protect my comrade!

109
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,819
{\an1}Let's go save Rin right now!

110
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,090
Hey!

111
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,062
[groaning]

112
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,276
{\an1}I thought I said scum should
keep their mouths shut!

113
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,012
Now die!

114
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,249
{\an1}I... I couldn't keep
my promise to you.

115
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,253
You're right...

116
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:43,559
{\an1}I am trash. But you're a
hero of the Leaf. You don't

117
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,695
{\an1}have to become trash, too.

118
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:59,373
[chuckling]

119
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:02,743
{\an1}This is reality. Those
who bequeath and the

120
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:04,645
{\an1}bequeathed, both.

121
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,782
All shinobi who
survive in this cruel

122
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,817
{\an1}world become trash.

123
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,186
We are both
good examples...

124
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:13,787
...Kakashi.

125
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:16,756
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei...

126
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:20,059
Can't move...

127
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,537
{\an1}They're a distraction
for you too, right?

128
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,672
This world is
just about to end.

129
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,342
{\an1}In order to enjoy the little
time we've got left, we

130
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,279
{\an1}really should clear out this
battlefield a bit first.

131
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,685
{\an1}There is no one that can
escape the cycle that births

132
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,921
{\an1}the trash of this world.

133
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,291
{\an1}That's exactly why I intend
to remake the world!

134
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:04,200
{\an1}You guys annoy me so much,
I can't even think straight.

135
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:07,970
{\an1}So instead, let me teach you
a little something about me.

136
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,249
I'm not trash!

137
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,819
I don't plan on
becoming trash, either!

138
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:28,222
I will...

139
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:30,523
...stop you!

140
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,463
{\an1}I'll never let my comrades
die! No matter what happens!

141
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,434
[chuckle]

142
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,510
I will not allow
my comrades to die.

143
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,282
{\an1}I'm sorry, Naruto. I'm the
one who taught you Obito's

144
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:02,086
{\an1}words, and yet I was
about to waver again.

145
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:21,236
Hirudora!

146
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,737
Lightning Blade!

147
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,444
Guess it wasn't
just a bluff...

148
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,513
[chuckling]

149
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,587
{\an1}Obito, your once-strong
will is still alive today...

150
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,189
{\an1}...right next to me! The
only thing the current me

151
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,558
{\an1}can do is protect
the current Naruto!

152
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,248
{\an1}You'll protect the
"current" Naruto?

153
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,822
{\an1}Yeah, me too. The
same goes for me.

154
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,792
{\an1}They're both at their
limits! These Leaf shinobi,

155
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:24,427
{\an1}they all act so tough!

156
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,537
{\an1}The wood's constriction
is weakening!

00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,581
{\an1}Careful, Naruto! The enemy's
Wood Paralysis is identical

161
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:50,217
{\an1}to the First Hokage's!

162
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,253
{\an1}It can bind Tailed
Beast Power!

163
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,222
{\an1}Just like Captain
Yamato's technique.

164
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,199
{\an1}A Lightning Blade that
relies on the Sharingan...

165
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,634
{\an1}You've really honed and
mastered that left eye,

166
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:13,238
even awakening
the Mangekyo.

167
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:14,505
However...

168
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:17,341
{\an1}Can you return from the
other plane once more in

169
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,210
{\an1}your current state?

170
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,189
{\an1}Now return to the
trash heap, Kakashi!

171
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,591
{\an1}No! Kakashi Sensei...

172
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,929
{\an1}...is just like me!

173
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:51,706
{\an1}Looks like we're gonna
have to start worrying

174
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:55,009
{\an1}about Ten Tails. Let
them handle Obito.

175
00:15:57,378 --> 00:16:00,647
{\an1}Then we'll make our move! We
need to go after that thing!

176
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,453
{\an1}[chuckle] I can see
it so clearly now...

177
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,031
{\an1}All of the pain that's
etched into your face.

178
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,035
{\an1}You should save that
line for the one

179
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,670
{\an1}right next to you.

180
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,209
{\an1}<i>I gotta do something about</i>
<i>Kakashi Sensei, that's for</i>

181
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:33,378
{\an1}<i>sure. He's completely</i>
<i>drained from</i>

182
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,345
{\an1}<i>overusing the Sharingan. </i>

183
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:38,449
{\an1}<i>If he's pulled in</i>
<i>again, he's toast!</i>

184
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,884
Naruto, switch
places with me.

185
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,387
Huh?!

186
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,354
{\an1}Let me handle this.

187
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:46,722
But...

188
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,158
{\an1}Don't argue, just switch!

189
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,098
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi you brat,
give me your hand.

190
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,099
You're--!

191
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,835
Look, just stick
your hand out!

192
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,172
[gasp]

193
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:24,157
[screaming]

194
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,493
{\an1}Kurama, what the hell
did you just do?!

195
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,596
{\an1}Now you don't have any
distractions. I'm leaving

196
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,563
{\an1}the rest to you, Naruto.

197
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:32,998
What?!

198
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,236
All right, then!

199
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:48,945
[gasp]

200
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,751
{\an1}Now that we know how
your ability works,

201
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,952
{\an1}I can counter it.

202
00:17:58,188 --> 00:17:59,155
Here's another!

203
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,224
[groaning]

204
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:09,231
{\an1}Oh yeah, that's some pain
etched onto your face.

205
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:11,032
[groaning]

206
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,000
{\an1}What's going on?!

207
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,902
[grunting]

208
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:17,771
{\an1}Kakashi did that, over
there. See, the difference

209
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:20,241
{\an1}between you and me
is, I can give or

210
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:23,911
take chakra
voluntarily, at will.

211
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:27,214
{\an1}I'll show you the trick
to doing it later.

212
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:28,781
When did you
pass it to him?!

213
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:31,784
{\an1}When I grabbed Kakashi's
hand to throw him.

214
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:35,688
So, then!

215
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,990
Yup. Whenever he
wants to, he can use

216
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,659
{\an1}Kamui to come out.

217
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,361
Kakashi Sensei!

218
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,667
{\an1}Thank the Nine Tails for me.

219
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,534
Sure!

220
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,963
{\an1}Let's blast him to bits
before he revives!

221
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,498
{\an1}Put in all you've
got! All right!

222
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:31,806
{\an1}Yeah! Octopops and Eight-o,
it's all ready to go now!

223
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,608
Okay! Fire!

224
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,377
{\an1}This is it! This ends now!

225
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,302
{\an1}The Statue's chakra...

226
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,736
It's gone!

227
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,004
Yes!

228
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,907
{\an1}Ha, ha! We did it,
fool, ya fool!

229
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,609
All right!

230
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:50,943
It's over?

231
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:56,482
Yeah...

232
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,518
{\an1}This world is over.

233
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:07,993
{\an1}Very well, then...

234
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,229
{\an1}Shall we get started?

235
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,964
[growl]

236
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,904
[angry roar]

237
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,328
{\an1}<i>Here comes a big one. You</i>
<i>really think we can do this?</i>

238
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,398
{\an1}<i>First, we keep our distance</i>
<i>and see what move he makes.</i>

239
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,065
{\an1}<i>We'll counter it and</i>
<i>hit him with a big</i>

240
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,435
<i>blow as close</i>
<i>as we can get.</i>

241
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,670
{\an1}<i>Nine Tails, you're</i>
<i>acting like a Captain.</i>

242
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,005
{\an1}<i>Got a problem with that?</i>

243
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,707
<i>Nope. In fact I</i>
<i>feel kinda happy!</i>

244
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:19,112
{\an7}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Allied</i>
<i>Shinobi Forces Jutsu."</i>

245
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:23,082
{\an7}<i>Save that line for</i>
<i>after we've won!</i>
