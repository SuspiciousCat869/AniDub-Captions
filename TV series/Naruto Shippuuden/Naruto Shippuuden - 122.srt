[music playing]

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,900
-All right, listen closely.

4
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,666
Starting now, our
main objective is

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,133
to find Itachi and
take him into custody.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,300
ALL: Right.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,933
-The Atkatsuki is rounding
up the tailed beasts.

8
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,933
And we believe that they
already have the Three Tails.

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,300
According to the intel
obtained by Jiraiya,

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,533
it's already possible
that they have infiltrated

11
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:41,666
the Land of Fire and
are looking for Naruto.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,200
Remember, Itachi is originally
from the Hidden Leaf village.

13
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,433
Three years ago he came
back searching for Naruto.

14
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,700
-Then it makes
sense, he's probably

15
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,800
heading back to the Leaf
village this time as well.

16
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,066
-Then Sasuke should be close
by too, following Itachi.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
-Yeah, I'll find him.

18
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,566
I'll definitely find
the way to Sasuke.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
-We'd better just take it one
step at a time for now guys.

20
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,566
Here's the search protocol.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,266
We'll use this as
our center point

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,900
and search a five-kilometer
radius in all directions.

23
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,766
If we don't find anything,
we'll move the center point

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,900
and search the next
five-kilometer radius.

25
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,300
We'll keep repeating this
strategy until it works.

26
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,600
-Five kilometers?

27
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,366
If we spread out
that much we won't

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
be able to use our
wireless com units.

29
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,366
And if we're all
split up like that it

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,033
could be very dangerous.

31
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,900
Rules dictate a minimum of
two-man squads for patrols.

32
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,866
So if an enemy is encountered--

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,900
-Sakura, try not
to be so worried.

34
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:41,400
-Look.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,566
-Our voices are able to reach
much farther than any com unit.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,333
Also, our noses
can detect danger.

37
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,966
So we'll protect you.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,666
-It's Pakkun.

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,466
-All right, let me explain the
team rosters for our patrol.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,800
To be safe, I'm assigning
two ninja hounds

41
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,566
to each team member.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,033
-Two ninja hounds?

43
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,500
But they're--

44
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:15,000
-So please, play nice, OK?

45
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,300
-It's a pleasure
to meet you Sakura.

46
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,633
-Typical, you really are
such a loud-mouthed female.

47

[groans]

48
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,633

[barks]

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
-Ugh, you stink of bugs.

51
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,966
-And you stink like a dog.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,166
-Hello ninja hounds.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,566
-Well, then, I'm looking
forward to working with you.

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,466
-Yeah, in peace
and harmony, right?

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,033
-I wonder if I can become
friends with these dogs.

56
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,800
-What about me, huh?

57
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,066
-You're a Jinchuruki,
and thus, a target.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,733
To protect you from a
potential Atkatsuki attack

59
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,433
you'll be escorted by Yamato
and a sensory type, Hinata.

60
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,933
-And don't forget Big
Bark Bull as well.

61

[barks]

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,733
-Good to work with you, Naruto.

63
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,133
-Yeah.

64
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,966
-Being ninja hound users, Kiba
and I will each have one dog.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
-So we're all set
and ready to go.

66
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,300
-Listen, all of you.

67
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,633
Your highest priority is to
track Itachi and Sasuke's

68
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,733
sense.

69
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,733
But if you do encounter
either one of them,

70
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,433
simply verify their
location and return here,

71
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,200
to the central point.

72
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,200
Especially you Naruto.

73
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,933
Don't go running off.

74
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:22,700
-I know that.

75
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,100
Don't worry.

76
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,133
-All right, then let's go.

-Itachi Uchiha, huh?

I hope we can find him.

-Yes!

84
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,573
Oh Sasuke, I get to
stay all alone with you.

85
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:36,407
Isn't that right?

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,207
-No, just hurry up and head out.

Huh.

-So which one are we going
for, Sasuke or the Nine Tails?

one should we go for?

Hmm.

-Oh, uh, hey!

00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:18,740
Stop!

00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:19,240

Wait up!

-And just who the heck are you?

it's just a lacky.

-I think you better
go and check that out.

-Yes, Sir.

Uh, Kaku-- Kakukta-- Kakusa--
Kakushim-- something like that.

-Uh, It's Kakuzu.

-Yeah, that's it, thanks.

112
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,340
You're one of Kakuzu's henchmen,
some kind of bookkeeper

113
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,473
or something like
that, isn't that right?

me, I'm begging you.

Now keep talking.

-Akamaru, don't let those
other hounds out do you?

We'll be the first to
detect Sasuke and Itachi's

121
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,240
scents no matter what.

122
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,640

Don't give us silly nicknames
unless you want a good bite.

-Sasuke.

00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:01,340
-You know, if you don't wipe
that solemn look off your face

134
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,073
you'll just scare
off all the boys.

135
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,473
-What'd you say?

136
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,773
-The more you chase
the farther they run.

137
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,273
But you're the type
of girl who just

138
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,040
keeps charging
ahead, aren't you?

139
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,073
Why don't you try pulling
back for a change?

140
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:12,773
-What?

141
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:13,773
What a rude this to say.

142
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,507
Besides, it's not like that,
not with Sasuke and me.

143
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,773
-Hey, Biscuit, just lay
off the girl, would you?

144
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,140
-Huh.

145
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:28,707
-He should know how I feel.

146
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,940
Well, he needs to know
how everybody feels.

147
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,707
I-- we want him to come
home safe, all of us.

148
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,973
And that's all, you got that?

149
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:41,540
-We can't draw his attention.

150
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:44,340
So we'll just
sniff him out then.

151
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:49,007
-Did you get something?

152
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,073
-It's quite faint but I
detected Sasuke's scent.

153
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:52,573
-What?

154
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,073
Seriously?

155
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,465
-Anything?

156
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:10,498
-Well, I can't pinpoint it.

157
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,332
But it's getting stronger
with every step we take.

158
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:38,632
-Ah.

159
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,098
-Hey, what are you doing?

160
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,965
Guard yourself or he'll he
onto us before we find him.

161
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,298
Be very cautious.

162
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:56,165
He's close.

163
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:03,365
-Well, Sakura, can you sense
Sasuke close by at all?

164
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:26,865
It's no good.

165
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:28,565
The scent's receding now, fast.

166
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,398
-I've given it a
thorough once over,

167
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,932
but I don't sense
any worrisome Chakra.

168
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,198
Maybe I'll go back to Sasuke.

169
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,865
The others probably
aren't back yet.

170
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,165
So I'll have him all to myself.

171
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:09,798
-I found him Tobi.

172
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,698
-No kidding?

173
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,498
Wow, that was fast.

174
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,532
So which is it, the Nine Tails?

175
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:15,998
Or Sasuke?

176
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,898
-What a great opportunity.

177
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,765
We'll go and seize it together.

178
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,432
-So which is it?

179
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:23,798
-Huh, just come on.

180
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:24,298
-Right.

181
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:52,832
-Naruto, Hinata,
you know what to do?

182
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,232
-Yes, sir.

183
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:54,732
-Yeah.

184
00:13:00,298 --> 00:13:00,765
What?

185
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:01,298
It's you.

186
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,465
-Show yourself.

187
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,265
Who are you?

188
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,098
-So you sensed me
coming, did you?

189
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,632
-Kabuto Yakushi.

190
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:25,465
It's pretty brash of you
to voluntarily approach us

191
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:26,598
like this.

192
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,632
-I just wanted to have a
little chat with Naruto.

193
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,398
You won't escape.

194
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,732
-We're taking you in.

195
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,298
-Hey, Kabuto, I
bet you would know.

196
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,698
Where is Sasuke now?

197
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:38,665
[laughs]

198
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:41,698
-You're still all
about Sasuke, huh?

199
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:44,332
-They say that Sasuke
killed Orochimaru.

200
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,932
Is that true?

201
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:49,098
-Yeah, it's true all right.

202
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,598
[grunts]

203
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,965
-But more importantly,
I brought you present,

204
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,032
a little something I
thought you might like.

205
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,298
-I know those robes.

206
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,132
You're with--

207
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,965
-So, you're Sasuke, huh?

208
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:09,398
You really do look
just like Itachi.

209
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:09,898
Whoa!

210
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,398
Scary!

211
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,865
[grunts]

212
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,632
-What's that?

213
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,732
-Intelligence our
organization managed

214
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:33,865
to gather regarding
the Atkatsuki.

215
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:35,932
-So what about it?

216
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,298
-It's yours now.

217
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,632
You can have it all.

218
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,532
-Orochimaru's dead now.

219
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:43,998
So you're trying to negotiate
a deal with the Leaf Village,

220
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,265
is that it?

221
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,198
-No, I'm not so foolish as
to think that the Hidden

222
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,465
Leaf would be willing to
negotiate with the likes of me.

223
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:53,232
-Then explain.

224
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,398
The Atkatsuki aren't after you.

225
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,632
So why would you
help us against them?

226
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:02,232
-It's simply a gift for Naruto,
a token of my gratitude.

227
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:05,798
After all, the Atkatsuki
is pursuing you.

228
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,198
-Gratitude?

229
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:08,565
-Yes, that's right.

230
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:13,298
When Lord Orochimaru died I
lost sense of my identity again,

231
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,065
of who I was.

232
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:17,532
I never knew my
parents or homeland.

233
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,732
The enemy took me into their
custody when I was very little.

234
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:24,098
I was used as a spy since I
was a child, moving around

235
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,498
from country to country,
village to village.

236
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,498
For a long time, the idea
of home was alien to me

237
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:33,165
until I became Lord
Orochimaru's disciple.

238
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,732
And now it's gone again.

239
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,298
The pain of not
knowing who I am,

240
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:44,332
of being without an identity,
you understand it well,

241
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,365
don't you Naruto?

242
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,865
-I don't want to understand
anything that you'd say.

243
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,798
-Huh, are you sure?

244
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,498
Who are you really?

245
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:55,998
Are you Naruto Uzumaki?

246
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,532
Or the Nine-Tailed Fox?

247
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,898
I know you were shunned
and despised in the past.

248
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,932
You must have
questioned your identity

249
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:04,865
and who you were meant to be.

250
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,765
But you had faith
in your strength

251
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,265
and told yourself that
you were Naruto Uzumaki.

252
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:12,598
You forged your own identity.

253
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:15,165
In doing so, you
overcame the cold stares

254
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,665
meant for the Nine Tails.

255
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:18,665
-What is he doing?

256
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:20,632
What does he want with Naruto?

257
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,532
-I can't figure it out either.

258
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,465
-That's why you're confident.

259
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:27,465
That's why you have no doubts
at all about your identity

260
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:30,565
and why you found friends
who accept you so readily.

261
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,832
But my story's different.

262
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:35,265
Instead of reaching
beyond Lord Orochimaru,

263
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,498
I stubbornly kept clinging
tightly to his power.

264
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:42,565
Now I have a much better idea of
how you must have felt, Naruto.

265
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:45,198
You made me see.

266
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:48,965
And so I decided that I
would try to be like you.

267
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,632
That's why my
path's clear to me.

268
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,932
I'm going to use what
I was able to absorb

269
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:01,232
of Lord Orochimaru become
a better, stronger Kabuto

270
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:01,732
Yakushi.

271
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:11,365
I will find a new identity.

272
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,032
And you've given me
a clue as to how.

273
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:17,198
That's why I'm so
grateful to you Naruto.

274
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:20,865
Lord Orochimaru is
a symbol of renewal.

275
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,032
He will live inside
me as a reminder

276
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,598
of what I must overcome.

277
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:27,498
-You absorbed that guy?

278
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,998
-That's right.

279
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,198
I took a part of Lord
Orochimaru's corpse

280
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,998
after Sasuke defeated him.

281
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:38,265
And then I simply grafted that
piece right onto my own body.

282
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,532
And since then,
you won't believe

283
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,732
the life force it's given me.

284
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:47,032
Every day I can feel it steadily
consuming my entire body.

285
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,565
It's amazing.

286
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,498
-That's unbelievable.

287
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:56,332
-Wait a minute-- Byakugan.

288
00:17:56,365 --> 00:18:00,932
It's already taken over
one third of his body.

289
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,565
-I have to fight
desperately just

290
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,665
to avoid being completely
subsumed by it.

291
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:08,498
Every day I feel
my will to surpass

292
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,998
Lord Orochimaru
reaffirmed to me.

293
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:17,465
-So is that everything
you came here to say?

294
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,398
Huh.

295
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,632
Well, you can keep
on fighting him

296
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:27,098
in a jail cell in the
Hidden Leaf Village!

297
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,032
-Woodstyle.

298
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:36,198
-It's over.

299
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,098
We got you.

300
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,498
-He's behind you.

301
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,832
[laughter]

302
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,732
-Darn it!

303
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:48,532
-In time, I will be able to gain
complete control over all Lord

304
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,832
Orochimaru's powers
and abilities.

305
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,898
And when that happens I'll
fight you again Naruto.

306
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,798
But that's later.

307
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:58,298
My first priority
is to avenge him.

308
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,332
My priority is Sasuke.

309
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:01,165
-Hold up.

310
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:03,698
What are you going to do to him?

311
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:04,898
-Until next time.

312
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:24,765
-We did it.

313
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,765
We just took down Sasuke.

314
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,332
-Ha! nicely done Deidara.

315
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,965
Yeah, real nice.

316
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:46,165
-Quiet,

317
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:49,498
-I guess he's even stronger
than we thought, huh?

318
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:53,698
-Just imagine, Orochimaru being
killed by a brat like him.

319
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,832
I still can't believe it.

320
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,765
Hmm.

321
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,232
-Ha!

322
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,132
Just look at the way
he's glaring at us Tobi.

323
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:06,232
-Huh, raring to go, huh Deidara?

324
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:09,332
I guess you'll have to
apologize to Itachi later.

325

00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,159
-You're Atkatsuki.

327
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,759
So where's Itachi Uchiha?

328
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,926
-Huh?

329
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,559
-Tell me and I'll let you go.

330
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:09,326
-What should we do?

331
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,492
He's not kidding around.

332
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,259
-Sharingan, huh?

333
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:15,159
You're Itachu's kid
brother all right.

334
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,026
You were only able
to kill Orochimaru

335
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,792
thanks to your Uchiha blood.

336
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,959
Hmm, you're just
lucky to be born

337
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,059
into that family, nothing more.

338
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,259
-If you don't want
to tell me, fine.

339
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:28,926
I'll just wring the
information from you by force.

340
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,426
Next time, clash.

341
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,026
-Uh, once again, the date for
Lady Tsunade's debt repayment

342
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,659
is nearing.

-(WHINING) Oink.

344
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,759
Tonton, there's no choice.

345
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,526
We have to do that
thing we used to do.

346
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,192
-(WHINING) Oink.

347
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,392
-What's this?

348
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,826
-Oink.

349
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:55,726
-You'll catch a cold.

350
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,059
You shouldn't sleep out here.

351
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,259
TONTON: Oink, oink.

352

353
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:03,126
-Are you all right sir?

00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,492
-Oh, hi.

357
00:23:07,526 --> 00:23:10,126
Sirs, I would like to earn
some money if I could.

358
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,959
-Oink.

359
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:14,326
-Whoa, this one's a
winner for sure sir.

360
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,459
-I know, I know.

361
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,426
-This pig'll bring in
a million bucks easy.

362
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,359
-Tell you what sister, $500,000.

363
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:24,292
-Thank you, I'll take it.

364
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:26,259
I'm sorry!

365
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,259
-Oink, oink.

366
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,059
-Sir, the pig is gone!

367
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,559
-What a day this is
turning out to be!
