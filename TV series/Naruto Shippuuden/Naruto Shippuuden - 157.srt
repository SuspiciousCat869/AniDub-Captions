1
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:33,570
{\an1}-So, anything else?

2
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:34,570
{\an1}-That's about it.

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,506
{\an1}-Scouting complete, sir.

4
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,074
{\an1}Nothing suspicious as always.

5
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,210
{\an1}-It's another beautiful day.

6
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,279
-Hurry, granny!

7
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,245
Come on.

8
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,947
Hurry it up!

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
-Calm down now.

10
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,681
{\an1}There's no need to
be so hasty, dear.

11
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,155
{\an1}-A stick of these
dumplings after a mission,

12
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,123
now this is just
what I live for.

13
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,200
-Come on.

14
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,034
{\an1}Pick a card before we
all get old, would you?

15
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:39,269
HYUGA SOLDIER
(VOICEOVER): Byakugan.

16
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:39,770
-Hey.

17
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:40,704
No fair.

18
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:41,904
{\an1}What you think you're doing?

19
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,805
{\an1}You can't use Byakugan
during a game.

20
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:46,174
[laughter]

21
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:55,344
{\an1}-Well, I guess I'd better
go start on that next report

22
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:59,013
before it's due.

23
00:01:59,047 --> 00:01:59,513
Huh?

24
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,284
{\an1}SOLDIER (VOICEOVER):
Is he Akatsuki?

25
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,058
{\an1}SOLDIER (VOICEOVER): Right.

26
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,159
{\an1}I must report this
to Lady Hokage.

27
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,128
No way.

28
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,410
{\an1}-The time has come.

29
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,079
[theme music]

30
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,733
SHIKAMARU: Lord
Jiraiya sent back

31
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,334
{\an1}three sources of information.

32
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,702
-Yes.

33
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:56,437
{\an1}Namely a ninja from the Hidden
Rain, one of Pain's bodies,

34
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,472
{\an1}and this, a coded message.

35
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,640
{\an1}-Inoichi is in the
Intel Division.

36
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,175
{\an1}They're working on
the Hidden Rain ninja.

37
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,376
{\an1}I'm sure that he'll get
information out of him.

38
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,145
-And Shizune has
made the autopsy

39
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:13,445
{\an1}on the remains of Pain's
body her number one priority.

40
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,948
I'm sure she'll
learn something too.

41
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,548
{\an1}-Plus, we also have this message
that we decoded with the help

42
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:20,083
from Naruto.

43
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,417
{\an1}"The real one's not among them."

44
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,551
That's it.

45
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,886
{\an1}-So now we have to take
all of this information,

46
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,588
{\an1}and somehow figure out the
mystery behind this guy that's

47
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,289
called Pain.

48
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,822
The mystery of
someone strong enough

49
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,523
{\an1}to take down even Lord Jiraiya.

50
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:53,800
{\an1}-He's got a genjutsu block, huh?

51
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,239
All right, then.

52
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,939
{\an1}Let's take a peek
inside your mind.

53
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:13,344
{\an1}INOICHI (VOICEOVER): So
many genjutsu blocks.

54
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,644
{\an1}No wonder the truth
serum didn't work on him.

55
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,848
-How'd it go?

56
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,283
-It's no use.

57
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:28,018
{\an1}Someone has placed numerous
blocks inside of his mind.

58
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:31,953
{\an1}It's going to be difficult
to navigate past them.

59
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:35,822
{\an1}-I suspect that it's some
jutsu placed on him by Pain.

60
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,421
{\an1}Be careful, Inoichi.

61
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:40,091
{\an1}There may be other
dangers in there as well,

62
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:42,958
{\an1}like genjutsu traps.

63
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:43,659
-I know.

64
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:44,159
I'm on it.

65
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:05,436
{\an1}SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): These black
rods embedded in the flesh,

66
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,738
{\an1}could they be a special
feature of Pain's bodies?

67
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,847
{\an1}Why did they embed
these into themselves?

68
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,081
{\an1}I have to learn more about
this metal's properties

69
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:27,881
{\an1}before the autopsy.

70
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,984
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: "The real
one's not among them."

71
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:37,753
{\an1}Maybe he's telling us the
six Pains are all genjutsu.

72
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,389
A jutsu cast by
the female Akatsuki

73
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:42,956
member who was
there too, and she's

74
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:46,024
{\an1}the one who physically attacked
Lord Jiraiya from the shadows.

75
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:46,791
-No.

76
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,759
{\an1}I think that's a long shot.

77
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:53,694
{\an1}According to Lord Fukusaku,
when Lord Jiraiya was killed,

78
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:58,597
{\an1}he was stabbed with actual
weapons from all six Pains.

79
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,431
{\an1}Well, he supposedly
took down three of them,

80
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,599
{\an1}but they resurrected.

81
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:06,901
{\an1}Does sound like some
genjutsu illusion.

82
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:10,469
{\an1}-With the Akatsuki, common
sense doesn't mean anything.

83
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,570
{\an1}There have been others
who were immortal.

84
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:16,472
{\an1}-Frankly, in any case, what
we should really do right now

85
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,107
{\an1}is keep hypothesizing until
we get some kind of report

86
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,275
from the others.

87
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:22,442
-You're right.

88
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:25,378
{\an1}Let's get closer to solving
Pain's mystery at least

89
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:26,945
{\an1}a little before Naruto returns.

90
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,783
-All right.

91
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:42,585
{\an1}I'm off to procure us all some
fresh ingredients for dinner.

92
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,154
Toodle-oo.

93
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,922
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Not
more of that gross stuff.

94
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,290
Oh, man.

95
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:50,290
{\an1}-Sounds good, Ma.

96
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,490
Get some of that
stamina building stuff.

97
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,934
{\an1}You're are able to
manipulate Sage Jutsu chakra,

98
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:16,404
{\an1}and have mastered the basics of
Frog Kumite and the Sage Arts.

99
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:20,505
{\an1}Now I have one final thing
I need to discuss with you.

100
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,472
{\an1}-What's the deal?

101
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:23,940
{\an1}You're suddenly so serious.

102
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:25,375
{\an1}-With good reason.

103
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:29,609
{\an1}This is about the risks
involved in using the Sage Mode.

104
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:30,610
-The risks?

105
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:31,111
-Yes.

106
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,312
Exactly.

107
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,679
{\an1}Once you grasp the risks
that are involved with it,

108
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:38,082
{\an1}then you can exploit Sage
Mode to its fullest extent.

109
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,415
-Oh.

110
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,283
{\an1}So what are they?

111
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:44,385
{\an1}-Well, first, as you've probably
already managed to figure out,

112
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,087
{\an1}you can't maintain Sage Mode
for long periods of time.

113
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,687
{\an1}Five minutes at most.

114
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:54,489
{\an1}Also, to amass the nature energy
necessary to enter Sage Mode,

115
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:57,291
{\an1}you must follow the
principle of staying still,

116
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,592
{\an1}which means you can't use
it when you're already

117
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,159
{\an1}in the midst of battle.

118
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,761
{\an1}For if you stop moving,
you become an easy target

119
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:04,961
for your enemy.

120
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,628
-Ow!

121
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:07,162
-Oh, yeah.

122
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,797
I see.

123
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:12,165
{\an1}-So the only time you
can go into Sage Mode

124
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,433
{\an1}is when you've got plenty
of comrades around you

125
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,168
{\an1}that can free you up.

126
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:20,236
{\an1}That means if you ever
have to go into Sage Mode

127
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,838
{\an1}when you're all by
yourself, you have

128
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,406
{\an1}to withdraw from the
battle momentarily,

129
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,573
{\an1}in order to gather
nature energy.

130
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:28,506
-What?

131
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,175
{\an1}Then Sage Mode is
totally useless!

132
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,043
{\an1}So what was all this
training for then?

133
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,944
{\an1}-Don't be so glum, my boy.

134
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,412
{\an1}That is what I am
here for after all.

135
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,213
{\an1}To diminish that risk.

136
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:40,980
-Wait.

137
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,214
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

138
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:44,015
{\an1}-All that you and
I would have to do

139
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,016
{\an1}is merge our bodies together.

140
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,283
{\an1}Then it'll be fine.

141
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,917
[croaking]

142
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,021
-No!

143
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,955
{\an1}-When I say merge,
all it means is

144
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,655
{\an1}that I'll be lightly attached
to your shoulder or back.

145
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,259
-Oh.

146
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,658
That's all?

147
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:09,128
{\an1}But why is everything gonna be
fine if we do this merge thing?

148
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,595
{\an1}-To put it simply,
it means to split

149
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:13,930
the roles of
stillness and action.

150
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,065
{\an1}So when one of us
is moving, the other

151
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:19,133
{\an1}is staying still and
gathering nature energy.

152
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,934
{\an1}In Jiraiya boy's case, the
final form of his Sage Mode

153
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:26,669
{\an1}had Ma and me both
atop his shoulders.

154
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:27,170
-Oh.

155
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,004
OK.

156
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,805
I get it now.

157
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,607
{\an1}-Don't you give it a
moment's worry, Naruto boy.

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,307
-All right.

159
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,319
{\an1}-From here on we'll be
splitting into two teams.

160
00:11:58,353 --> 00:12:00,653
{\an1}I'll go over it again.

161
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,722
{\an1}Diversion is Shirado.

162
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,956
{\an1}Chikushodo, and Gakido.

163
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,392
{\an1}In the hunt-- Tendo,
Ningendo, and Jigokudo.

164
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:13,560
{\an1}Konan, you're with the hunt.

165
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:14,127
KONAN: I know.

166
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,533
{\an1}-A spherical barrier
that includes

167
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:26,834
{\an1}underground and aerial coverage
surrounds the entire Hidden

168
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,069
Leaf Village.

169
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:31,236
{\an1}-Anyone who enters
without permission

170
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,505
will be detected
immediately by the Leaf.

171
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,605
{\an1}-As planned, we will
launch Chikushodo

172
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,040
into the skies
above the village.

173
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:43,376
{\an1}We will confuse the enemy by not
giving them an accurate count.

174
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:47,111
We will wait for
Chikushodo's summoning.

175
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:51,413
{\an1}-I was told Itachi and
Kisame got inside easily.

176
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:54,482
{\an1}-Itachi was once part of
the Leaf's ANBU Black Ops.

177
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:58,117
{\an1}He knew the jutsu code to
get through the barrier.

178
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,185
{\an1}I have my own way
of doing things.

179
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,821
{\an1}Now the world shall
learn what pain is.

180
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,493
{\an1}-We've sensed an intruder.

181
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,359
-Huh?

182
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:17,693
{\an1}-There's just a single target.

183
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:22,662
{\an1}West Gate Sector 1-B.

184
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,130
{\an1}-Hurry, Granny, hurry!

185
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,098
-Oh yes, dear.

186
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:25,630
I'm coming.

187
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:38,838
{\an1}-Thanks for the food.

188
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:39,472
-Yeah.

189
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:40,071
{\an1}Thanks, you guys.

190
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:45,774
-Scatter.

191
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,914
-What's that?

192
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:02,383
[scream]

193
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:19,325
[choking scream]

194
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,059
{\an1}-Fire Style Fireball Jutsu!

195
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:27,796
{\an1}Fire Style has no effect.

196
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:38,401
{\an1}-Simultaneous attacks?

197
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:39,902
{\an1}What is going on here?

198
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,036
{\an1}I thought that there
was only one intruder.

199
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,605
{\an1}-I'll confirm with
Byakugan right away.

200
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:47,806
{\an1}-OK, but this is beyond
the barrier core.

201
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,007
{\an1}Contact the other troops,
and request backup.

202
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,509
Hurry!

203
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,708
-Right.

204
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,709
{\an1}I'll notify Lady Hokage.

205
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,482
{\an1}-No information on
the Nine-Tails, huh?

206
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:20,189
{\an1}-Where can I find
Naruto Uzumaki?

207
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:38,698
{\an1}-This one doesn't know either.

208
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,475
{\an1}-The chakra-meter
shot up suddenly,

209
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,675
{\an1}and the black rod
began warming up.

210
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,076
{\an1}And I thought that
was strange, but these

211
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,212
{\an1}are demodulators that respond
to high frequency chakra waves.

212
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,146
{\an1}-The rods are demodulators?

213
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,614
{\an1}And what does that mean?

214
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:09,981
{\an1}-They're chakra receivers.

215
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:14,384
{\an1}They're all receiving chakra
right now, this very moment.

216
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,751
{\an1}-They're receivers?

217
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,252
I don't get it.

218
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:20,620
{\an1}-The fact that these things
are all receivers-- listen.

219
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:22,087
{\an1}I don't have time to explain.

220
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,155
{\an1}I've gotta report
this to Lady Tsunade--

221
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:27,291
[quaking]

222
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:27,790
-What the?

223
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:39,397
{\an1}-What's happening?

224
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,230
-Let's move out.

225
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,847
-Found it.

226
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,158
-What was that?

227
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,263
This is bad.

228
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,598
{\an1}I'll go notify Intel.

229
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,067
{\an1}CHOJI (VOICEOVER): I
have to get to Pan.

230
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,438
-Father, listen.

231
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:01,405
The village!

232
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,378
-Quick, run!

233
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:13,877
-Honey.

234
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:29,819
-Yaa!

235
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,790
You OK?

236
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:40,758
-Uh-huh.

237
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,958
{\an1}-Thank you so very much.

238
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:42,460
Thank you.

239
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,663
{\an1}-The centipede's down.

240
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:49,529
{\an1}-That girl got it.

241
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:55,399
-Good.

242
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,600
We're in luck.

243
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:59,167
Looks like that
wound isn't too deep.

244
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,102
-Uh-- thank you.

245
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,503
-Sakura!

246
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,371
{\an1}Are you all right?

247
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,472
{\an1}-Iruka-sensei, what's going on?

248
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,006
What is this?

249
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,307
{\an1}-I don't know exactly.

250
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,309
{\an1}But someone is attacking
the Leaf Village.

251
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:15,610
{\an1}Don't worry though.

252
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:18,444
{\an1}I've contacted Lady
Tsunade, so the alarm

253
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:20,612
{\an1}should sound any minute now.

254
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,880
{\an1}-I can't believe they'd
attack us directly.

255
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:28,216
{\an1}But who'd ever do such a thing?

256
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:30,083
{\an1}-Let's go, Iruka.

257
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,784
-Right.

258
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:32,917
Go, Sakura.

259
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,620
{\an1}Get to the hospital now,
and tend to the wounded.

260
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,721
{\an1}It's already filling
up with the injured.

261
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:38,221
-Yes, sir.

262
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,892
{\an1}SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It can't be.

263
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:52,763
{\an1}-I'm so frightened, Ms.

264
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,796
{\an1}-It's gonna be all right.

265
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,864
{\an1}We have Lady Hokage on our side.

266
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,903
{\an1}-Barrier core reporting, ma'am.

267
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:10,871
{\an1}There was an intruder.

268
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,105
{\an1}It entered through our airspace.

269
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:17,141
{\an1}We sensed just one target, but
immediately after detection,

270
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,310
{\an1}several attacks were
confirmed across the city.

271

{\an1}-Analysis Core reporting.

{\an1}this much military
power unnoticed.

It must be--

{\an1}the intruder wore black

Akatsuki, they've finally come.

{\an1}-It makes me hope more than
absolutely anything that he

280
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,860
{\an1}is indeed the child of prophesy,
for Jiraiya boy has clearly

281
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,095
{\an1}bequeathed his all
to his student.

him like a mere child?

{\an1}and entrusted the Hidden
Leaf Village to you,
