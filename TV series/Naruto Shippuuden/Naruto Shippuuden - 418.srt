1
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,632
[gasp]

2
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,365
{\an1}There's someone else
where Sasuke is.

3
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,767
{\an1}You recognize the chakra?

4
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,135
No! But...

5
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,036
But what, Karin?

6
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:44,104
{\an1}This chakra... has a real
nasty feel to it!

7
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:48,273
{\an1}Then we're going to need
to hurry even more.

8
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,607
{\an1}After all, we have
absolutely no idea what this

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,441
{\an1}stranger might be planning
to do to Sasuke.

10
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,244
{\an1}Is this where his wind
seizes to blow?

11
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:05,212
[growl]

12
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,080
Wha-?!

13
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:12,414
{\an1}Karin! If you don't pace
yourself, you're going
to collapse!

14
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:17,482
{\an1}Alright! Let's head out to
join the others at youth

15
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:18,749
power max!

16
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,150
Lee! Tenten!

17
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,852
S-Sasuke!

18
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,387
Who's that guy?!

19
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,055
{\an1}Hey you! I don't know who
the hell you are, but what

20
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:17,323
{\an1}do you think you're
doing with Sasuke?

21
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,458
{\an1}Oh, I see, so that's
what's up...

22
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:24,491
Huh?

23
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:28,026
{\an1}Ah, so it was you, Kabuto.

24
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,362
{\an1}I sensed your group rushing
over here, too.

25
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,929
{\an1}It's really you, Lord
Orochimaru.

26
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,897
{\an1}Wait, that's Kabuto?!
His chakra's different!

27
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,265
{\an1}His apperance too!

28
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,732
{\an1}Well, he did take into
himself Sage Jutsu Chakra,

29
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,699
{\an1}as well as all sorts of
other people's chakra.

30
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:50,101
{\an1}I can't blame you for not
recognizing him, Karin.

31
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:54,801
{\an1}I wonder if his chakra feels
nasty because he still has

32
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,469
{\an1}some of my own chakra
inside of him?

33
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,004
Or perhaps it-

34
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,571
{\an1}Step away from Sasuke,
you nerdy creep!

35
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:06,273
{\an1}What have you come here to
do, Lord Orochimaru?

36
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,506
{\an1}And what about you?

37
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,440
{\an1}<i>What are you planning,</i>
<i>Orochimaru?</i>

38
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,309
{\an1}Look, Kabuto. You're not
planning on trying to absorb

39
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,943
Sasuke, are you?

40
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:21,144
{\an1}And would that make you
Kabuke or Sasuto?

41
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:32,814
{\an1}[gasp] So you're the one who
took down Sasuke?!

42
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,216
{\an1}You're gonna pay!

43
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:40,417
{\an1}Suigetsu, I have no desire
to do that anymore. Karin, I

44
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,752
{\an1}have no interest in trying
to steal Sasuke, either.

45
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:49,121
{\an1}<i>Sasuke's chakra! I can just</i>
<i>barely sense it! N- No way!</i>

46
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,655
Kabuto, you're
helping Sasuke?

47
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,023
{\an1}That's right. With my
Medical ninjutsu and my

48
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:58,257
{\an1}Hashirama cells I've
experimented on

49
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,858
{\an1}extensively, along with a
certain someone's

50
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:05,326
{\an1}suggestion, I just managed
to stop him from dying.

51
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,559
{\an1}And there we have it.

52
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:07,726
Oh!

53
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,427
{\an1}Hm? Well, well. If it isn't
the Hokage I respect most,

54
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,362
{\an1}Lord Second, Tobirama.

55
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,664
However, Kabuto.

56
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,331
{\an1}Your presence here must
mean that you were somehow

57
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,598
{\an1}able to escape the endless
loop set up by

58
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:26,499
{\an1}Itachi's Izanami,
isn't that right?

59
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:32,567
{\an1}That's right. I'd stopped
acknowledging myself and

60
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,036
{\an1}didn't know who I
was anymore.

61
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,371
{\an1}That allowed you to give me
easy answers and use me,

62
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,171
{\an1}making me lose even
more of myself.

63
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,477
{\an1}If you're not satisfied with
what you've had...

64
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,946
{\an1}Just find other things and
add them onto yourself from

65
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,380
here on out.

66
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,514
{\an1}[discomfort yell]

67
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:17,350
{\an1}It's still not enough, yet!

68
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:22,551
{\an1}This still isn't who I am!

69
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:27,220
{\an1}But through that jutsu,
Itachi helped me realize...

70
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,055
{\an1}That I am none other
than Kabuto.

71
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,356
{\an1}And where my home is.

72
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,992
{\an1}Hey, did he change
inside, too?

73
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:44,591
{\an1}Such is the power of
the Izanami.

74
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,361
{\an1}It's a jutsu that cannot be
undone unless you reexamine

75
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:52,062
{\an1}yourself and accept
who you really are.

76
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,330
Sasuke...

77
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,831
{\an1}I now wish, from the very
bottom of my heart, not to

78
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:01,864
lose my home.

79
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:06,267
{\an1}And Itachi, who wanted to
protect Sasuke even unto
death.

80
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,234
{\an1}His feelings have pierced my
heart quite strongly.

81
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:13,369
{\an1}Yeah, well, listen, it's great
for you to say that now!

82
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,437
{\an1}But you're still one of the
ringleaders who joined up

83
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,704
{\an1}with that fake Madara guy
and started this whole war!

84
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,273
{\an1}You're right, of course.

85
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,940
{\an1}Both Obito and I thought
that we'd lost our place in

86
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:32,108
{\an1}this world, and we dragged
everyone else into this.

87
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:38,043
{\an1}But, now I know who I am
and what I must do!

88
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:46,013
{\an1}You may be reinforcements,
but you're nothing

89
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,647
{\an1}more than pebbles.

90
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,748
{\an1}You won't make any
difference, now.

91
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,815
{\an1}That guy's Madara?!

92
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,350
Yes, that's him.

93
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,250
{\an1}Kakashi, are you all right?

94
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,218
{\an1}I am, thanks to Guy.

95
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:02,518
{\an1}No, not that part. I'm
talking about my Sage Art

96
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,618
{\an1}Rasengan hitting you earlier.

97
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,619
{\an1}That was okay, too.

98
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,654
{\an1}I teleported it with my Kamui
just as it was making contact.

99
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:12,855
Kamui!

100
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:17,757
{\an1}Good. I'm glad...

101
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,591
Wait, Sage Art?
You mean, Sage Jutsu?

102
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:24,026
{\an1}That's right. Only Sage Jutsu
works against him.

103
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,793
{\an1}Well, that and physical
attacks, such as Taijutsu.

104
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:32,628
{\an1}So at this point in time,
our only hope is the Fourth

105
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:36,297
{\an1}Hokage's Senjutsu and
your Taijutsu, Guy.

106
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:43,466
{\an1}If I recall correctly, Sage
Jutsu isn't your forte, Sensei.

107
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:47,600
{\an1}Yes. Honestly, I'm weak
in Sage Jutsu.

108
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,435
{\an1}It takes me too long to
infuse the chakra, and I'm

109
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,568
{\an1}not able to maintain
it for too long.

110
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,303
{\an1}And I haven't used it much
in real combat, either.

111
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,738
{\an1}Plus, I can't weave signs at
all, right now, so I don't

112
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,671
{\an1}think I can fight effectively.

113
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:12,908
{\an1}So, I guess that now it's
showtime for this wild Blue

114
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,143
Beast, huh?

115
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:19,510
{\an1}Eight Inner Gates!
Seventh Gate of Shock!

116
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,578
Open!

117
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,380
Blue vapor?

118
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:29,115
Guy!

119
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,615
{\an1}One gate short of the Eighth
Gate of Death, huh?

120
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:39,251
{\an1}He insults me, not bringing
out the Red Vapor.

121
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,286
{\an1}Don't let the black spheres
or rod touch you!

122
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,990
{\an1}I can't believe Guy's
mastered the Eight Inner Gates!

123
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,358
{\an1}Those aren't human
movements!

124
00:09:58,392 --> 00:09:59,492
Take this!

125
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,393
Hirudora!

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,367
{\an1}Gotta use the Flying Raijin
to throw myself into the

127
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,001
{\an1}Black Sphere's path!

128
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:31,635
{\an1}Kakashi! My kunai!

129
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:32,668
Right!

130
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,005
That's Rock Lee!

131
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:52,343
Guy Sensei! Are
you all right?

132
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:55,344
{\an1}Yeah, Thanks to you, Lee.

133
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:59,911
Where is Tenten?

134
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,279
{\an1}She told me to go ahead
because she wanted to check

135
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,745
something out.

136
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,114
{\an1}I finally catch up to you
and, you launch the Hirudora?!

137
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,481
{\an1}Are you all right, Guy?

138
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:13,716
{\an1}Yeah, only my right arm and
a few ribs are hurt.

139
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:17,484
{\an1}What are we going to do if
your Taijutsu, our last ray

140
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,718
{\an1}of hope, is no good?

141
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,854
He's too strong.

142
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,355
Wait, Kakashi...

143
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:33,089
{\an1}It's still too early to
count my taijutsu out!

144
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:34,223
But...

145
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:37,224
{\an1}Our youth hasn't faded!
Not yet, at least!

146
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,224
Don't lose hope!

147
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,727
Guy Sensei...

148
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:48,394
{\an1}It's true that not
everything we wish for will

149
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:49,961
come true.

150
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:54,997
{\an1}But, things that we ought to
do must always begin with a
wish.

151
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,297
{\an1}Just like my challenges
to you.

152
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:58,697
[shocked gasp]

153
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,899
{\an1}Fight me, Kakashi!

154
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:04,133
{\an1}And I assure you that
this is no bluff.

155
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,201
{\an1}Don't tell me you?!

156
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:11,635
{\an1}The Leaf's Wild Blue Beast
is no more. It's time for

157
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,103
{\an1}the Red Beast to emerge!

158
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,841
{\an1}No way! Not the final
Gate of Death!

159
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,109
[shocked gasp]

160
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:33,310
{\an1}Guy, you mustn't do it!
Please, just think it over!

161
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,078
{\an1}Not a single person here
wants you to do that!

162
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,944
{\an1}Not even you father would-

163
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:40,878
{\an1}I know. But I want to do it.

164
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:44,579
{\an1}Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei,
you think that right now is

165
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,548
{\an1}actually the time for that?!

166
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,981
{\an1}Now, don't look at
me like that, Lee.

167
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:52,916
{\an1}This time, you sit back
and enjoy the show!

168
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,317
{\an1}We're a lot alike,
you and I.

169
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,552
{\an1}I was a "loser" too, once.

170
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:04,920
{\an1}But I made myself the equal
of any ninja, even Kakashi.

171
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,221
{\an1}You say you wanna show the
world you can be a splendid

172
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,556
{\an1}ninja, even if you don't
have all the gifts that

173
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,290
{\an1}others are blessed with.

174
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,990
{\an1}That's your nindo, your
ninja way, right?

175
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,558
{\an1}Well, I think that's a fine
goal. Fine as I've ever

176
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,158
{\an1}heard, and one worth
sticking to.

177
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:23,193
{\an1}Don't let anything steer you
off the path you've drawn

178
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,827
{\an1}for yourself. Forge
ahead to the end!

179
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,862
{\an1}Become strong so I can just
sit back and enjoy the show!

180
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,630
Father...

181
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,567
No, no, no!

182
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,768
{\an1}No... No... No...

183
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:05,173
{\an1}Listen, son, search to your
heart's content!

184
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:09,775
{\an1}My name! It's not anywhere
on the Academy

185
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,609
{\an1}entrance list, Papa!

186
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,076
{\an1}You just keep on looking,
Guy! You've worked hard and

187
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,144
{\an1}did everything that you could!

188
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:19,112
{\an1}There's no way that all that
effort won't be rewarded!

189
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:21,612
{\an1}Those tears are probably
just making your vision

190
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:24,380
{\an1}blurry! I bet you see
your name soon!

191
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,115
Right, Papa!

192
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,382
{\an1}Might Guy... Might Guy...
Might Guy...

193
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,783
{\an1}That kid just won't give up,
will he?

194
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,284
{\an1}It's a very unsightly
way to behave...

195
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,052
Kakashi!

196
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,089
{\an1}Papa, I'm sorry...

197
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:53,591
I'm sorry!

198
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,391
{\an1}Don't give up! You hear?!

199
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:59,493
Don't look away!
You'll find it! You will!

200
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,198
{\an1}Hey, isn't that the kid who
was making such a big fuss

201
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:21,199
{\an1}about failing the test?

202
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:30,102
{\an1}For my papa who never gave
up on me, I will get in!

203
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,504
{\an1}What was all that stuff he
was talking about?

204
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,003
{\an1}"Self-rule" or something?

205
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,204
[laughter]

206
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,571
{\an1}Like you just decide
something, and it happens!

207
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,639
{\an1}I know all about him. He
can't perform ninjutsu or

208
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,473
genjutsu at all.

209
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,474
{\an1}The only thing that he
really has going for him is

210
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,609
{\an1}that he's pretty good
at physical stuff.

211
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:50,309
{\an1}That may be true, but even
so, he looks ready to drop.

212
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,879
{\an1}Don't quit! But, still... My
son, you're getting it all
wrong!

213
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:04,448
{\an1}Two hundred thirty-five
laps!

214
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,583
[laughter]

215
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,783
{\an1}What a joke! He's
not even half done!

216
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,254
Papa...

217
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,023
Guy!

218
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,323
Guy, you fool!

219
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:37,992
{\an1}I'm sorry, Papa...

220
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:40,659
{\an1}I'm five already, but I
can't even complete five

221
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,193
{\an1}hundred laps yet!

222
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:45,494
{\an1}No, stop that! Don't
apologize! That's not why

223
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,761
{\an1}I'm scolding you!

224
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:48,028
Huh?

225
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,729
{\an1}Never apologize for trying
hard! It's an insult to your

226
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:52,164
{\an1}determination, Guy!

227
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,597
Then, why did?

228
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:57,231
{\an1}Because you're not using
your self-rule in the right way!

229
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,698
{\an1}Five hundred laps will get
you accepted into the

230
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,634
{\an1}Academy?! That is
not a self-rule!

231
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,501
{\an1}That's only a wish! And
nothing more than that!

232
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,036
Listen...

233
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,970
{\an1}You impose a self-rule in
order to spur yourself onward!

234
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:18,305
{\an1}To help you overcome a
challenge or difficult
situation.

235
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,540
{\an1}But a self-rule applies to
yourself and only yourself.

236
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,740
Uh-huh.

237
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,108
{\an1}Because of that rule, you're
able to gather your strength

238
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:27,208
{\an1}and focus on your efforts...

239
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:30,276
{\an1}So, even if you fail, having
applied that rule in the

240
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,244
{\an1}first place keeps you extremely
disciplined and focused.

241
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:38,512
{\an1}And that is the way that a
self-rule truly works!

242
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,879
{\an1}I'm so sorry, Papa.

243
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:42,413
{\an1}However, no one can
find fault with your

244
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:45,814
{\an1}determination. Even if you
only make it half way,

245
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,315
{\an1}hard work is hard work.
And for that, you

246
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,049
{\an1}deserve a big, ol' hug!

247
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,816
Papa!

248
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,816
Guy!

249
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,552
{\an1}Looks like that father and
son are at it again...

250
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,519
{\an1}Isn't that abuse?

251
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:00,519
{\an1}And what's up with
those bodysuits?

252
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:01,986
{\an1}They're just so weird!

253
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,987
{\an1}Thank you for your support!

254
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:06,955
{\an1}Papa, I don't think
that was support.

255
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,222
{\an1}Well, encouragement, then!

256
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,357
{\an1}I guess that since I can't
do ninjutsu or genjutsu...

257
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,324
{\an1}...I failed the test.

258
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:19,092
{\an1}Listen, Guy! Your youth has only
just begun, do you hear me?!

259
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:22,427
{\an1}Never turn your back on
youth! Just like me!

260
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,461
{\an1}The fact that you aren't
able to use either ninjutsu

261
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,895
{\an1}or genjutsu actually pleases
me, as your Papa!

262
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,095
Huh?!

263
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,297
{\an1}Knowing your shortcomings
will highlight your strengths!

264
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,965
{\an1}Your Taijutsu's already
shining brilliantly in my eyes!

265
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:39,032
{\an1}I'm really, very happy now!

266
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:41,466
{\an1}I've discovered my son's
strengths when he's still at

267
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,167
{\an1}such a tender age!

268
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:48,835
{\an1}Papa, you're not just
saying that-?

269
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,637
{\an1}Your shortcomings can become
strengths! Being repetitious

270
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,270
is being kind!

271
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,371
{\an1}To be loud is to be lively!
Obstinacy's earnestness!

272
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,905
{\an1}Those who are selfish
are like cats!

273
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,739
{\an1}And hairy people?

274
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,207
Uh...

275
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,774
{\an1}They're like cats, as well!

276
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,375
{\an1}Long-torsoed people?

277
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,808
They're...

278
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,476
{\an1}...also like cats!

279
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,077
{\an1}Hey! Might Dai! What are you
doing, playing at training

280
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,644
{\an1}with your kid again?

281
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:17,811
{\an1}You work hard for an
"eternal genin!" [laughter]

282
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,213
{\an1}Sure thing! Thank you for
your support!

283
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,647
[laughter]

284
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,448
[angry growling]

285
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,317
{\an1}That guy's such a joke!

286
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,984
{\an1}Still trying to act young at
his age? [chuckle]

287
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,151
Ow!

288
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:37,285
{\an1}What's that for?!

289
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,220
{\an1}Hey, if it isn't Dai's brat!

290
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,220
{\an1}What do you think
you're doing?!

291
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:43,221
{\an1}Don't make fun of my Papa!

292
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,455
{\an1}Look, kid, I only
spoke the truth!

293
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,822
{\an1}Say stuff about my papa, and
I'll punch you- five times!

294
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,823
{\an1}That's my self-rule!

295
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:54,625
Huh?

296
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:58,059
{\an1}Your self-rule? I'd like to
see that, so I'll say this:

297
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,859
Your dad is a
good-for-nothing who can't

298
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:02,327
{\an1}do ninjutsu or genjutsu,
and can't even do

299
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,328
{\an1}taijutsu that well.

300
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:08,495
{\an1}Everyone says he's more of a
comedian than he is a genin!

301
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,196
[laughter]

302
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:14,665
{\an1}And he's a comedian whose
jokes about youth aren't funny.

303
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,432
{\an1}[angry growling] That's
two bad things!

304
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,333
{\an1}Which means ten punches!

305
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:22,300
{\an1}Why don't we punch you
twenty times instead!

306
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:30,337
{\an1}Damn it... Damn it...

307
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,071
[chuckle]

308
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,211
{\an1}I can't believe that you
couldn't return a single

309
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:56,479
{\an1}punch after what they said
about your father.

310
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:59,053
{\an1}<i>Guy, why'd you do</i>
<i>such a thing?!</i>

311
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,087
{\an1}<i>Papa, how can you stay so</i>
<i>positive and optimistic?</i>

312
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:04,455
{\an1}<i>When does one's youth really</i>
<i>come to an end?</i>

313
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:07,356
{\an1}<i>As long as you never turn</i>
<i>your back against youth,</i>

314
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,089
{\an1}<i>then it will never end.</i>

315
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,857
{\an1}<i>You're saying that youth</i>
<i>doesn't come to an end</i>

316
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,724
<i>when you die?</i>

317
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,492
<i>Oh! C'mon, Guy!</i>

318
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,859
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Papa's Youth"</i>

319
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,926
{\an1}<i>That is when youth reaches</i>
<i>its climax! And when it</i>

320
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,261
{\an1}<i>burns the brightest of all!</i>
