00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,084
{\an1}They'll be using the
Uchiha's Elite Unit.

151
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:40,188
{\an1}Sasuke wants to shadow and
learn from the more
experienced shinobi.

152
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,623
{\an1}He made a strong
appeal to join them.

153
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,526
Sasuke did that?

154
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:47,929
{\an1}But it's... This is
all way too sudden!

155
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,597
{\an1}We weren't even able to patch
things up between us yet.

156
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:55,537
{\an1}[groan] Come on, Naruto, do you
have to be a complete idiot?!

157
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:58,306
{\an1}I mean, you should be a little
happy for him, at least!

158
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,641
Yeah? And why
should I be, huh?

159
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:04,212
{\an1}Because he volunteered for this
mission in order to hone his
skills.

160
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:09,250
{\an1}I'm guessing that he probably
made up his mind to do so right
after getting into that fight

161
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,985
{\an1}with you, 'cause it made
him realize something.

162
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,254
Huh!? You
mean, he also--?

163
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:16,958
{\an1}Yeah, that's right.  Just like
you, he "doesn't want to lose."

164
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:20,428
{\an1}At the very least it means he's
aware of you and your skills.

165
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,797
{\an1}Oh, I see.  [giggle

166
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,033

<i>But it's not the time to relax!</i>

167
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,803
{\an1}<i>Sasuke will become</i>
<i>ridiculously strong...</i>

168
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:33,141
{\an1}...and then when he comes
back, he'll be able to
crush you and defeat you.

169
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,310
No!  Not good!

170
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:38,413
{\an1}I have to train, too!  I have to
start right now!  Hurry!

171
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,782
{\an1}All right, that's the spirit!

172
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:44,185
{\an1}And don't worry! I'll be sure
to root for you from distant
skies.

173
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,920
[happy laugh]

174
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:52,026
{\an1}Hey, wait, just hold on a
second, here, y'know!

175
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,262
{\an1}What was that distant skies
thing that you just said?!

176
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:57,765
{\an1}I mean, aren't you gonna stick
around a while and help me
train, Pervy Sage?!

177
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,335
{\an1}What can I tell ya? My
wounds are fully healed.

178
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,571
{\an1}So I have to set out in search
of Orochimaru before too long.

179
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:05,940
No way!

180
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,843
{\an1}[hearty laugh]

181
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,879
{\an1}Hey, now, don't get so
depressed, Naruto.

182
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:14,182
{\an1}I'll watch over your training
when I have a chance to.

183
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,051
{\an1}Come on! You're always so
busy! Never mind, Dad!

184
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,953
{\an1}[embarrassed chuckle]

185
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,423
{\an1}Hey, I have an idea! Why
don't you take me with you?

186
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,558
{\an1}Uh, what!?

187
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:25,627
{\an1}You want to go on the
journey along with him?

188
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,128
{\an1}Yeah!  It's the perfect idea!

189
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:30,698
{\an1}I'll be able to get lots of
training done out there
while we're on the road!

190
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,368
{\an1}Uh, well, I... Um,
Jiraiya Sensei?

191
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,838
{\an1}Well, I wouldn't mind it.

192
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,674
{\an1}But I wonder what Kushina would
have to say about this.

193
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:43,444
{\an1}She's really strict when it
comes to The Three Prohibitions
of the Shinobi...

194
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,147
{\an1}All right then, we're just gonna
have to convince her, won't we!

195
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,082
C'mon! Let's go!

196
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:50,251
<i>(Jiraiya)</i>
<i>Damn it, you're so</i>
<i>self-centered! </i>

197
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:57,458
{\an1}Um, uh, so then I guess Naruto
is leaving the team, too?

198
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,327
I'm so sorry.

199
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,897
{\an1}I'll start looking into where
you can transfer right away...

200
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,667
{\an1}No...

201
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:09,737
{\an1}For now, I actually wouldn't
mind being kept on standby.

202
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,372
Oh, but...

203
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:15,743
{\an1}So later, when Naruto returns,
we'll have our old team back
together.

204
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:19,682
{\an1}And maybe there's... even a
chance that Sasuke could
have a change of heart!

205
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:22,250
Of course.

206
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:27,755
{\an1}Besides... while the two of them
are away, there's something that
I want to do, as well.

207
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:30,693
{\an1}I think that it'll be
a good opportunity.

208
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:44,205
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, Please... I'd like
to learn that jutsu that you
mentioned before.

209
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:47,342
{\an7}<i>I can't be the only one on the</i>
<i>team who's lagging behind.</i>

210
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:57,051
{\an1}<i>I like that look on your face.</i>

211
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:00,689
{\an1}<i>Fine. But I'm warning you,</i>
<i>I won't go easy on you.</i>

212
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,291
{\an1}<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>Of course!</i>

213
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,598
{\an1}Are you sure about this?

214
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:13,134
{\an1}I brought you onboard because
Captain Fugaku asked me to.

215
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,170
{\an1}But everyone else in the unit is
ranked way above you.

216
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:19,974
{\an1}The days at the Feudal Lord's
office will likely be long and
hard.

217
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:21,843
{\an1}I'm looking forward to it.

218
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:25,880
{\an1}Setting aside my father and
brother, you're the most
skilled among the Uchiha.

219
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:29,050
{\an1}While my brother's on the
Hokage's detail...

220
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,120
{\an1}...I'd always assumed that you
would become the next captain.

221
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,989
{\an1}And that's why you
volunteered for this?

222
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:40,128
{\an1}I have a goal that I'm
determined to reach.
And to achieve it...

223
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:42,964
{\an1}All right... It's
fine by me.

224
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,465
Go!

225
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:51,005
{\an1}Hey, I've been thinking about
what you said before...

226
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,008
{\an1}It's just that, Orochimaru
is a bad guy, right?

227
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,512
{\an1}So why do you go out of your way
to try to find him, then?

228
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:01,617
{\an1}Despite what he's now become,
he was once my friend.

229
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,386
{\an1}<i>But one day, he went</i>
<i>off the path. I should have set</i>
<i>him right back on it then.</i>

230
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,791
{\an1}<i>But... I couldn't</i>
<i>stop him.</i>

231
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,926
Oh I see.

232
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,398
{\an1}And I can't help but think that
if only I hadn't let him go then

233
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,901
{\an1}He could still be here in
the village right now.

234
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:24,640
{\an1}And frankly, I don't want you to
have the same kind of regrets.

235
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,774
Huh...

236
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,377
{\an1}At the same time, I
haven't given up yet!

237
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,480
{\an1}I know that I'll bring
him back one day!

238
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,683
Heh! Alright!

239
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:42,558
{\an1}You really didn't have to come
down here to see me off...

240
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,392
{\an1}That just wouldn't do, y'know!

241
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:49,030
{\an1}Listen! You gotta observe the
Three Shinobi Prohibitions!

242
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:54,435
{\an1}Jiraiya Sensei is <i>way</i> too lax
about them, so don't you dare
imitate his bad habits, got it?!

243
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,405
{\an1}I'm sorry... She insisted on
seeing you two off and-

244
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,340
{\an1}That goes without saying,
y'know!

245
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:02,644
{\an1}What if Naruto picks up bad
habits while he's out with
Sensei gathering intel and he

246
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,913
{\an1}turns into a total
degenerate?!What then, huh!?

247
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:09,917
{\an1}I already worry enough about his
antics and recklessness as it
is, you know!

248
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,587
{\an1}Look, don't worry!

249
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,022
{\an1}If he gets in my way, I'll just
transport him away to Mount
Myoboku or someplace.

250
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,958
{\an1}What?  Mount Myoboku?

251
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:21,797
{\an1}[gag]

252
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,467

you, just hang in there.

00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:26,702

gonna make all of us back here

track to go straight to the top.

{\an1}Huh?! When did that happen?!

{\an1}Well, I'm not going
to lose to Naruto!

totally ready now!

268

{\an4}If that plan had just succeeded,
we could've been rid of the
jonin who support the Fourth
Hokage in one swoop!

271
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:26,327
{\an1}And increased our
political influence.

{\an1}Oh. You can't blame
it all on me.

273
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:34,503
{\an1}The plan failed because
of the shinobi that
Hizashi had assembled.

274
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:41,142
{\an1}Since you installed Hizashi to
head up the plan... some of the
blame lies with you.

275
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:42,478
{\an3}Hm...

276
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:45,414
{\an1}I did what I was supposed to do.

277
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,983
{\an1}I expect the contract
to be honored.

278
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,390
I understand.

279
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,626
{\an1}So what are your wishes
for the next vessel?

280
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:03,164
{\an1}Well, let's see... Itachi would
have been an ideal choice,
actually.

281
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,567
{\an1}But it was too late this time...

282
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:09,203
{\an1}The next time around, he'll
be past his prime.

283
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:12,341
{\an1}All right, I see...

284
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:15,176
{\an1}Then I'll have to choose
another suitable candidate...

285
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:18,680
{\an1}...one who possesses even
stronger qualities than Itachi

286
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,148
{\an1}and will reach his physical
peak in three years.

287
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:27,021
{\an1}Yes. I'm counting on you.
Someone young, beautiful,
and strong.

288
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:30,459
An ideal body...

289
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,498
{\an1}[attack cry]

290
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,902
[attack yell]

291
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,436
{\an1}Not yet! Wait!

292
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,843
{\an1}[grunt]

293
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:05,327
Chidori Stream!

294
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,304
{\an1}[panting breaths]

295
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:28,951
All right. Good!

296
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,187
{\an1}[happy sigh]

297
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,669
{\an1}You're going back to the Leaf
Village as soon as your
replacement arrives, huh?

298
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,605
{\an1}(Sasuke)
Yeah.

299
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,540
{\an1}I've learned
everything
I can here.

300
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:55,811
{\an1}Besides, I still have that
goal that I need to fulfill.

301
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:58,880
{\an1}I realize that it's none
of my business, but...

302
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,617
{\an1}Sometimes it's good to
have a goal to focus on.

303
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,689
{\an4}And yet at the same time,
getting too attached to a goal
can lead someone off the correct
path.

304
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:10,191
{\an1}I hope you'll try
to remember that.

305
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,629
I don't need you to
get involved in this.

306
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,197
Thanks for the
last three years.

307
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,506
{\an1}I want to make sure with my own
eyes.  But I guess I can't since
I'm stuck here.

308
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,944
{\an1}You're back. I read
through the report.

309
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,481
{\an1}Only the elite were
sent on that mission...

310
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:36,318
{\an1}But you've developed into a
shinobi second only to Shisui.

311
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,286
{\an1}It's not a big deal.

312
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,690
{\an1}Very soon now I'm going
to surpass Itachi!

313
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:45,093
{\an1}Hmf. Listen to you,
such confidence...

314
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,298
This is...

315
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:55,637
<i>(Fugaku)</i>
<i>A lieutenant's armband for</i>
<i>the Leaf Police Force.</i>

316
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,906
{\an1}It's very easy to
just run your mouth.

317
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:02,110
{\an1}But now here's your chance to
demonstrate your skills in a
real mission.

318
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:05,747
{\an1}I look forward to it!

319
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:14,456
{\an7}<i>I've returned to dispel the</i>
<i>humiliation of that day.</i>

320
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:19,728
{\an7}<i>And this time... I'll take you</i>

{\an8}<i>(Third Hokage)</i>
<i>The recent activities of the</i>

<i>(Minato)</i>
<i>I believe that this is</i>
<i>a form of protest.</i>

323
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,071
<i>(Minato)</i>
<i>They're annoyed because their</i>

324
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:13,042
{\an5}<i>(Minato)</i>
<i>They're losing patience.</i>

325

326
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:21,250
