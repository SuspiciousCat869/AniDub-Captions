1
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:24,382
{\an1}So at long last, you're
finally heading out.

2
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:27,485
There have been many
changes to our plans.

3
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:32,623
{\an1}<i>You say that as if I'm</i>
<i>the one to blame for</i>
<i>everything. </i>

4
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,395
But it was thanks to you
that we had to change our
strategy.

5
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,701
{\an4}Thanks to me, your
military might and range
of attacks increased. You
would do well to remember

6
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,902
{\an1}that in the future.

7
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:50,206
{\an1}Don't do anything outside
of what we've agreed upon
while I'm away.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,678
{\an7}We are comrades. So you
really do need to learn
to have a little more
trust in me.

9
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:01,117
{\an1}You're looking out for
your own interests. Don't
pretend otherwise.

10
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:05,921
{\an4}Aren't you even going to
bother telling me where
exactly you're headed off
to?

11
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:07,791
{\an1}The Hidden Rain Village.

12
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:13,897
{\an7}The Hidden Rain Village?
But they aren't even
directly involved in the
Great Ninja War.

13
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,397
{\an7}So, why go there?

14
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,368
{\an1}It doesn't concern you.

15
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,641
{\an1}Hey, wait up, Yahiko!

16
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:01,509
Yeah, wait for us!

17
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,812
{\an1}I'm gonna get there
first!

18
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,255
<i>[screaming]</i>

19
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:18,860
Mmm.

20
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,000
[gasping]

21
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,503
[trembling]

22
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:31,939
{\an1}It's a toad! A giant
toad!

23
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:36,811
How did something like
this ever get inside of
our hideout?

24
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:39,012
{\an1}What do we do now?

25
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:43,250
{\an1}You're so noisy! What
is all of this ruckus
about?

26
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:45,519
{\an1}Jiraiya Sensei?! Is that
you?!

27
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:48,822
What do you think? Does
it look good on me?

28
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,958
{\an1}Well, now that you
mention it... I guess it
kinda does!

29
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:56,863
[laughing]

30
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,799
{\an1}<i>What are you laughing at?</i>
<i>This isn't funny! </i>

31
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:57,047
{\an1}"The Angelic Herald of
Death"

32
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,191
{\an7}Are you trying to find
something?

33
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,693
Yes...

34
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,897
{\an1}Just tell me where you've
hidden Nagato's corpse.

35
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,165
{\an1}You're not going to find
him here.

36
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:18,792
{\an7}Seems like you're not
going to tell me where
you've hidden the Rinnegan.
I mean, hidden Nagato.

37
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:24,364
{\an7}I was sure that you would
show up here looking for
it, sooner or later. I've
been waiting for you.

38
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:26,834
{\an7}Now that you're here, I
will stop you.

39
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:36,877
{\an5}I won't go easy on you
just because we were comrades.
The Akatsuki does not abide
traitors. Understood?

40
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:43,617
{\an1}One question... Why would
such loyal members as you
and Nagato betray me?

41
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,287
You both approved of my
Project Tsuki no Me,
after all.

42
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:55,595
{\an7}If you lost to Naruto
Uzumaki, it would be one
thing. That couldn't be
helped.

43
00:06:55,795 --> 00:07:01,734
{\an7}<i>But Nagato sacrificed</i>
<i>himself... using the</i>
<i>Rinne Rebirth Jutsu for</i>
<i>Naruto. </i>

44
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:05,972
{\an7}That jutsu... was to be
used for my sake.

45
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:23,156
[cheering]

46
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,993
{\an1}<i>I never imagined that</i>
<i>someone as powerful as</i>
<i>Pain would be defeated. </i>

47
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:31,230
{\an1}<i>We've got to tell Tobi</i>
<i>about this. Let's go. </i>

48
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:37,803
{\an4}But even Zetsu wasn't
able to see what made
Nagato change his mind so
drastically.

49
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:49,446
{\an1}I've told you my story
just as you asked.

50
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:52,784
{\an1}<i>Now let's hear your</i>
<i>response. </i>

51
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:09,533
{\an4}I truly believe that
eventually the day will
come when all people will
understand one another.

52
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,906
{\an1}Even if I understand you
now...

53
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,876
{\an1}That doesn't change how
I feel.

54
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,413
{\an1}There's no way that I can
forgive you.

55
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,217
{\an1}I still hate you.

56
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,619
Then you want to settle
things with me...?

57
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,621
{\an1}I do.

58
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:36,593
{\an1}But Pervy Sage
believed in me and wanted
me to continue his quest.

59
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:42,732
{\an7}And for those reasons...
I choose to believe in
him, and to follow what
he taught me.

60
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,569
{\an7}So that's it; that's my
answer.

61
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:51,441
No! Never! How can I
believe in Jiraiya's
words after all of this?!

62
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:55,078
{\an7}There never will be such
a thing as true peace!
Not as long as we're

63
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:57,447
{\an7}forced to live in this
accursed world!

64
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,516
{\an7}Peace is impossible!
Impossible!

65
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,721
Well, then...

66
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:09,325
{\an4}I'm gonna to break that
curse one day. If there's
truly such a thing as
peace in this world,...

67
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,761
{\an1}then somehow, I'll find
it.

68
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:14,730
{\an1}And I'll never
give up!

69
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,366
[gasping]

70
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,601
{\an3}You...

71
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:21,937
But that's...

72
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,707
{\an1}Nagato? What's the
matter?

73
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,312
{\an1}Those words... it can't
be...

74
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:31,747
{\an1}That's right; you know
them.

75
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,884
{\an1}All of those words are
taken right out of this
book.

76
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,355
{\an1}<i>The very first novel that</i>
<i>Pervy Sage ever wrote. </i>

77
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,425
{\an1}He was seriously trying
to change the world with
his message.

78
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:50,399
{\an4}And in the back of it...
he wrote about a student
who helped provide him
with inspiration.

79
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,102
{\an1}It was you, Nagato.

80
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,543
{\an1}But...

81
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,886
{\an1}...the name of the hero
in this novel...

82
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,588
{\an1}His name is---

83
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,523
{\an1}His name's Naruto!

84
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:24,165
{\an4}Listen... My name is a
precious heirloom that
has been handed down to
me by my master!

85
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:28,436
{\an4}There's no way that I'm
just gonna give up and
dishonor my master's
gift!

86
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,240
{\an1}I will become Hokage!

87
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:37,043
{\an1}And I will bring peace to
the Hidden Rain. I will!

88
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,913
{\an1}I'm asking you to
believe in me!

89
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,685
<i>Why should I? </i>

90
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:49,889
{\an7}How can you stand there
and tell me that you will
never change your mind?

91
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:56,963
{\an4}Do you really think you
will never stray from
that ideal, no matter how
much pain befalls you?

92
00:10:56,997 --> 00:11:03,169
{\an1}You think you will always
believe in yourself?
Can you guarantee it? How

93
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:07,506
{\an7}can you possibly have
that much faith that life
won't change you?

94
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:14,713
{\an1}There's still pain
buried deep down inside
of me.

95
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:21,553
{\an7}And there's no telling
what kind of pain I may
face down the road...

96
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:26,658
{\an1}<i>But--</i>

97
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:31,730
{\an1}If I stop believing just
because things get
difficult... if the hero

98
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,867
{\an1}in this book were to
change who he is...

99
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,974
{\an4}Then... it would become a
whole different story. It
sure wouldn't be the story
our Master left behind.

100
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:44,876
{\an1}And it wouldn't be about
Naruto!

101
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:51,916
{\an1}The thing is... I can't
write books like our
Master did.

102
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:56,020
{\an1}And so... any sequel has
to come from the life I
live.

103
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,527
{\an4}That's why no matter how
much pain my own path
brings, I'll keep
walking.

104
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,561
{\an1}Because that's who
Naruto is!

105
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:13,371
{\an7}Naruto Uzumaki... You
truly believe he's worthy
of all this?

106
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:19,243
{\an1}He is the light. That's
why we all can carry
flowers of hope.

107
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:30,455
{\an1}You bare your fangs at
me, yet you wear that
cloak.

108
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:33,256
You still care for the
Akatsuki.

109
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:37,994
{\an1}Yahiko was the one who
founded the Akatsuki, not
you.

110
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:42,499
{\an1}The red clouds on these
cloaks symbolize the
unending wars that rained

111
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:45,102
{\an1}blood down upon the
Hidden Rain!

112
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:49,306
{\an1}<i>You merely jumped onto</i>
<i>our bandwagon for your</i>
<i>own purposes. These</i>

113
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,608
{\an1}<i>cloaks are our legacy,...</i>
<i>not yours.</i>

114
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:58,482
{\an7}And the Rinnegan is
something awakened by
Nagato, a shinobi of the
Hidden Rain Village.

115
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:01,050
{\an1}<i>Again, it doesn't belong</i>
<i>to you. </i>

116
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,855
{\an1}His eyes belong to this
nation. They are this
village's treasure!

117
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:16,265
{\an4}You're mistaken on two
points. Since you're
about to die, I shall
enlighten you.

118
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,505
{\an1}I encouraged and pushed
Yahiko to form the
Akatsuki.

119
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,173
{\an1}<i>And...</i>

120
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:27,842
{\an1}I was the one who gave
Nagato the Rinnegan.

121
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:28,843
[gasping]

122
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,449
{\an1}Perhaps it would be more
correct for me to ask for
it back.

123
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:38,953
{\an7}<i>But never mind... In my</i>
<i>opinion, you're just an</i>
<i>ignorant little girl who</i>
<i>knows nothing. </i>

124
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:43,291
{\an7}<i>Except now... you know</i>
<i>the location of Nagato's</i>
<i>Rinnegan. </i>

125
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:52,600
{\an4}Once I capture you, I'll
have my answer. Do not
underestimate the visual
prowess of the Uchiha!

126
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:07,182
{\an4}She's trying to overpower
me with numbers, hoping
to catch me when I
materialize.

127
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:12,786
{\an1}Very well. I know she's
got some plan up her
sleeve. Bring it on!

128
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,357
{\an1}There she is!

129
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:17,958
[struggling]

130
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,597
{\an1}<i>She mixed in Paper Bombs!</i>

131
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,268
{\an7}<i>I'll take you with me to</i>
<i>the afterlife. </i>

132
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,947
More members have been
killed in the Seventh
Ward.

133
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,917
{\an1}It's becoming a guerilla
war zone.

134
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,621
{\an1}We need to take measures
now.

135
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,724
{\an1}I'll go and scout it out
in the afternoon.

136
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:56,729
{\an1}No, Nagato, Rest awhile.
You shouldn't push
yourself so hard.

137
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,531
{\an1}But, I-

138
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,800
No buts. Just rest. I
will go.

139
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,113
{\an1}<i>Yahiko, please be</i>
<i>careful. </i>

140
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:19,385
{\an4}I don't need to have a
send-off. Just go and
tend to Nagato's wounds
instead.

141
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,889
{\an1}From now on, you should
save all your worrying
for him.

142
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,627
{\an1}He's the keystone of the
Akatsuki!

143
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,096
{\an1}<i>He's the man who will</i>
<i>change this nation and</i>
<i>this world! </i>

144
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,599
But the same can
be said of you!

145
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:39,804
{\an4}<i>Every one of us is here</i>
<i>because we respect and</i>
<i>admire you... Nagato</i>
<i>included! </i>

146
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,312
{\an7}But Nagato... is someone who
will be the bridge that
leads to peace.

147
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:52,484
{\an7}My role is to make that
happen. I am a pillar
that will support that
bridge.

148
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,520
Yahiko...

149
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:01,593
{\an1}As usual,... this land
continues to weep.

150
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,228
{\an1}It endures pain.

151
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,700
{\an1}I used to hate this land
that's crying all the
time.

152
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:14,405
{\an1}<i>But now, I want to save</i>
<i>it... It's what I want</i>
<i>with all my heart. </i>

153
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,974
Hmm.

154
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,011
{\an7}It's like the crybaby I
was. I can't ignore it.

155
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,747
Yahiko!

156
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,619
{\an1}Please, be careful...

157
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:35,426
{\an1}<i>It's Yahiko who'll be the</i>
<i>bridge to peace. That is,</i>
<i>his will itself will be.</i>

158
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,927
{\an1}<i>Nagato...</i>

159
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,963
{\an1}We believe in Yahiko with
all our heart!

160
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,599
{\an1}Let's go, everyone!

161
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:43,600
{\an1}Right!

162
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:52,041
{\an4}<i>I will be a pillar</i>
<i>that supports two</i>
<i>bridges. Yahiko and</i>
<i>Nagato! </i>

163
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:14,630
{\an4}I didn't take you
seriously enough. You are
a former member of the
Akatsuki, after all.

164
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,000
[panting]

165
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:26,475
{\an7}It seems that you planned
to blow the both of us up
when I pulled you in. But
you failed.

166
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:32,047
{\an7}<i>I was faster. I pulled</i>
<i>the explosion away.</i>
<i>Though I did get hit. </i>

167
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:36,985
{\an1}You were also saved. You
ought to thank me.

168
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,824
{\an1}So was that the last of
your secret schemes?

169
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,294
{\an7}Madara... I have a
question...

170
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,463
{\an1}What is it?

171
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:53,134
{\an1}Do you want me to tell
you why Nagato and I
decided to betray you?

172
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,871
{\an1}And why instead we put
our faith in Naruto?

173
00:17:56,303 --> 00:18:00,542
{\an1}Not really. Besides,
that's your problem.

174
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:05,946
{\an7}Naruto is just a naive
child chasing an immature
dream.

175
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:13,621
{\an7}I can see where Nagato
might be swayed by the
thought of true peace and
hope... But you, Konan?

176
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:16,357
{\an1}I realized something
after meeting Naruto...

177
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:24,765
{\an1}Him as well? You're
taking him, too?

178
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,771
{\an4}Yes. This Tendo Pain
was created ú from the
body of our dear friend
Yahiko.

179
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,841
{\an1}He's something that's
very precious to us both.

180
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,844
Yahiko? I guess I
understand, then...

181
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:49,823
{\an5}What are you going to do
now? I'd hate to think
that you're going back
to the Akatsuki.

182
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:55,862
{\an7}No, I'm leaving the
Akatsuki... Yahiko and
Nagato... meant
everything to me.

183
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,565
{\an1}<i>Yahiko's dream...</i>

184
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,800
{\an1}<i>And then Nagato's</i>
<i>dream...</i>

185
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:08,073
{\an4}<i>Both of their dreams have</i>
<i>been entrusted to you...</i>
<i>You now embody those</i>
<i>dreams. </i>

186
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:14,313
{\an1}Nagato chose to put his
faith in you. So now I
will do the same.

187
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:20,319
{\an7}And we of the Hidden Rain
Village, will all continue
to pursue our dreams
together with you.

188
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,559
[inhaling]

189
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:32,598
The name Naruto,... the
guts to never give up,...
and now... more pain.

190
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:40,204
{\an7}They're the things I've
inherited from my master
and from my sibling
student!

191
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:03,528
{\an4}This time, I wish that
you will be the blossom
of hope that will never
wilt away.

192
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,003
{\an1}You are darkness.

193
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:17,340
{\an1}And in a world without
light, all that flowers
do is wilt!

194
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,704
{\an1}They both fought and died
for their own beliefs.

195
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:33,373
{\an1}<i>Nagato will be the bridge</i>
<i>to peace. </i>

196
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:37,209
{\an1}<i>Yahiko's will</i>
<i>itself...is the bridge to</i>
<i>peace.. </i>

197
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:39,713
{\an1}Their will shall not be
extinguished!

198
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:43,550
{\an1}<i>If there's truly such a</i>
<i>thing as peace in this</i>
<i>world, I'll find it. </i>

199
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,386
{\an1}<i>Naruto Uzumaki will be</i>
<i>the one to carry on their</i>
<i>will! </i>

200
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,058
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Bridge to</i>
<i>Peace. </i>

201
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:54,094
{\an1}I shall be the pillar
that supports Naruto!

00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:15,648
I said "lead," not Lee!
