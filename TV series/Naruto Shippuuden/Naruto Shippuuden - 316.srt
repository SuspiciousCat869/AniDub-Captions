1
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,833
{\an7}<i>I didn't expect to lose</i>
<i>this many of my pawns.</i>

2
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:24,103
{\an1}<i>And retrieving unique</i>
<i>corpses turned out to</i>
<i>be a failure.</i>

3
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:29,107
{\an7}<i>So then, what's my</i>
<i>next move?</i>

4
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,910
{\an1}Reanimation Jutsu?
It's a summoning?

5
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:32,943
{\an1}Yes that's right.

6
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:36,045
{\an7}The Second Hokage is
who originally
developed it.

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,749
{\an7}But then he
sealed it away
as a Forbidden
Jutsu.

8
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,816
{\an1}Such a waste...

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,718
{\an7}So I set about
restoring it.

10
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,022
{\an7}You're taken with someone
else's jutsu, Lord Orochimaru?

11
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:49,589
{\an1}It's quite
remarkable.

12
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:51,991
{\an1}Naturally,
I've made a
few improvements.

13
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,393
{\an1}As you can see...

14
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:58,763
{\an1}There's still much more
room for refinement,
though.

15
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:01,933
{\an1}I need more personal
information material.

16
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:05,100
{\an1}Hm? Personal
information material?

17
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:06,970
{\an1}And what does
that mean?

18
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:11,706
{\an1}Why, flesh and
blood of course, ideally
from legendary shinobi.

19
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,776
{\an7}Now, I've collected
what materials I could.

20
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:18,611
{\an7}But from this point
on, I want you to
help me, Kabuto.

21
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,547
{\an7}I will find a way
to perfect this jutsu.

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:27,953
{\an1}I understand,
Lord Orochimaru.

23
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:33,523
{\an1}Maybe it's time for me
to stir things up a
bit on the battlefield.

24
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,104
{\an1}<i>[exhausted sigh]</i>

25
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:20,805
{\an1}Are those guys allies?

26
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:21,673
{\an1}They are!

27
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,775
{\an1}Hey!

28
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,643
{\an1}So, it's a Sealed
Reanimation huh?

29
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,643
{\an1}That's right.

30
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,112
{\an1}Inside's Toroi, the
Cloud's Magnet Style
user.

31
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,647
{\an1}I'm amazed that
you two guys
could seal him.

32
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,483
{\an1}Oh no, actually, Naruto
showed up and helped
us out big time!

33
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,087
{\an1}A renowned shinobi
controlled by the
Reanimation Jutsu.

34
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,454
{\an1}He must be
turning in his grave.

35
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,891
{\an4}A long time ago,
my dad went on a
mission with Toroi
and was killed.

36
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:47,092
{\an1}What? Seriously?

37
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,594
{\an1}I'm guessing that
burden was just too
much for my father.

38
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:57,399
Hey, look there.

39
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,934
{\an1}A Reanimated Ninja!

40
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,569
{\an1}There's still
another one left!

41
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,105
{\an1}We gotta seal him
fast!

42
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:14,412
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu.

43
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,480
{\an1}What is this?

44
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,515
{\an1}It's a huge ambush,
that's what it is!

45
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,550
{\an1}Contact HQ for
reinforcements!

46
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,585
{\an1}Right!

47
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:26,321
{\an7}To think I'd have to
resort to sending
you guys out on
the battlefield.

48
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:45,070
{\an1}Our orders, are to
retrieve the sealed
Reanimated Ninja.

49
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:49,073
{\an1}Hey, don't order me
around! I won't listen
to a Leaf Ninja!

50
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:50,373
{\an1}Enough bickering!

51
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:54,610
{\an7}We are no longer
part of this
transient world
of flesh and bone.

52
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:59,547
{\an4}It's annoying, but we're
being controlled, and
all of us have the
same orders to follow.

53
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,883
<i>[grunt]</i>
I'll give the
orders here!

54
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,384
All units, prepare
to attack!

55
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,518
Who are you?!

56
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:09,421
{\an1}The Red Cloud of Dust!
Daimaru of the Wind!

57
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,189
{\an1}<i>[startled gasp]</i>

58
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:11,923
{\an1}So, you've
heard of me
have you?

59
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,390
{\an1}No one has
heard of you.

60
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,026
{\an1}What?! That
can't be!

61
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,061
{\an1}You must've
died before me!

62
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:20,864
{\an1}But anyway, we're being
controlled. Nothing we
can do about that.

63
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:24,433
{\an4}Whether we're being
controlled or not,
let's just get this
over with.

64
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:27,368
{\an1}Honestly I really don't
want to die...again.

65
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,036
{\an1}Oh, stop your
complaining, would ya?!

66
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,772
{\an1}All units, attack!

67
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:35,674
{\an1}We have the
advantage of numbers!

68
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,742
{\an1}Incoming!

69
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:41,613
{\an1}Be on your guard!

70
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:46,517
{\an1}It's like an entire army!
The size of the Allied
Forces but Reanimated Ninja!

71
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,620
{\an7}If we fight them
face to face..then
we're all..sure to
die.

72
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,387
{\an1}All of you, attack!

73
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,325
{\an1}<i>[fighting efforts]</i>

74
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,593
{\an1}Quick, fall back!

75
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,095
{\an1}You all stay away!

76
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,562
{\an1}Ah, not good!

77
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,031
{\an1}<i>[startled yells]</i>

78
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,766
{\an1}All of them are...
so weak!

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,333
{\an1}Maybe they're
only genin!

80
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,902
{\an1}No, this is
no good!

81
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:14,038
{\an1}Who was it? Who said
that we had the
advantage here?!

82
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,106
{\an1}<i>[yelp]</i>

83
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,406
{\an1}Everyone attack!

84
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,607
{\an1}Sealing team, advance
as well!

85
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,642
{\an1}<i>[grunt]</i>

86
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,843
{\an1}We can do this!

87
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,610
{\an1}Seal them all!

88
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:26,614
{\an1}Wait, all of those
reanimations...don't
tell me.

89
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:32,919
{\an4}I've revived many, but
harvesting their
personal information
material was a real ordeal.

90
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:35,721
{\an7}It's essentially
just grave robbing.

91
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,623
{\an7}Sometimes they're so
rotted, you can't
even tell who it is.

92
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,626
{\an7}I had a lot of
failures along
the way.

93
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,563
{\an7}[fighting in the distance]
Are these the failures?

94
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,098
{\an1}All they have is
numbers! Attack as one!

95
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:53,534
{\an1}Musai? Is it you?
Is it really you?!

96
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,736
{\an1}You mean...You're
my father?!

97
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,838
{\an1}What?!

98
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,405
{\an1}That guy's
your dad?!

99
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,574
{\an1}Is he strong?!

100
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,043
{\an1}Hardly. You didn't
even get past Chunin
class, right?

101
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,610
{\an1}Why, you fool!

102
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:14,918
{\an1}Just lie and say
I was strong!

103
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,620
{\an1}There it is!

104
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:21,556
{\an1}<i>[gasp]</i>
They're coming
right this way!

{\an1}What?!

106
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,960
{\an1}You must be careful Musai,
because our orders are-

107
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,761
{\an1}To take back the
powerful pieces
that I've lost.

108
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:32,065
{\an7}That is what all
you pawns are for.

{\an1}<i>[agonizing screaming]</i>

00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:01,419
{\an1}This is...not the
right one, Kabuto.

112
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:03,889
{\an1}Yes, I agree,
Lord Orochimaru.

113
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,589
{\an1}Who are you guys?!

114
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,558
{\an1}Listen, out of
curiosity...

115
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:10,426
{\an1}You aren't the
Magnetic-Style User
Toroi, are you?

116
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,929
{\an1}What? Are you
kidding? No way!

117
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,898
{\an1}I can't even hold
a candle to a
shinobi like Toroi.

118
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:18,499
{\an1}What do we do
with him, Lord
Orochimaru?

119
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,467
{\an1}Hmm...

120
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,570
{\an1}Let's keep him for now,
he may come in handy.

121
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,839
{\an1}I'm sorry, but
I cannot disobey!

122
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,774
{\an1}As it strange as it
may sound, I'm
going to rescue Toroi!

123
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:36,546
{\an1}I will not allow
that. We'll
protect him!

124
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,316
{\an1}Over there!

125
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,851
That's the reanimated
force we got the
report about!

126
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,819
All of you, stay
focused and attack!

127
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:47,589
{\an1}Alright!
Reinforcements!

128
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,357
{\an1}Is that...No way!

129
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,057
{\an1}Huh?

130
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,558
{\an1}Hey big bro over
here, it's me!

131
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:53,960
{\an1}Over here!

132
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,695
{\an1}What?! You?!

133
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:58,463
{\an1}You've been
reanimated?!
But why?!

134
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,899
{\an1}Listen, how's
my family? My kids?

135
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,668
{\an1}They're all just fine,
they're doing well in
the village.

136
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,836
{\an1}Oh, that's good.
I'm glad they're okay.

137
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,571
{\an4}Your wife even got
remarried a while
back, and she's
really happy now.

138
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:11,007
{\an1}What?!
She did?!

139
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,775
{\an1}She got married
to someone else?!

140
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,609
{\an1}Well I guess
I can't blame her.

141
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:17,312
{\an1}I hate to do this
to kin, but I must
seal you.

142
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:20,647
{\an1}Are you...Over here!
Hey, it's me! It's me!

143
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:24,418
{\an1}Huh? What the hell?!
Why'd you get
reanimated?!

144
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,820
{\an5}I couldn't say it until
now, but I was wrong.
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me?

145
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,588
{\an1}Oh, listen
forget it.

146
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:33,057
{\an1}That entire mess is in
the past now.

147
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,426
{\an1}Besides, you're
dead anyway.

148
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,693
{\an1}You forgive me?!

149
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,861
{\an1}I forgave you
long ago!

fought alongside Toroi
until the very end, for
the village!

{\an1}Please make sure
that you tell
Lord Raikage!

156
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,307
{\an1}Sure, dad. I will.

quite a few of them.

them occupied.

{\an1}Platoon! You will
follow me now!

167

{\an1}I said not to
order me around!

168

tragic to be forced to
fight when there is

{\an1}Just who do you mean?

171
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,707
{\an1}Those four guys from
the Hidden Cloud.

172
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:42,310
{\an8}Even after all this
time they were able to
clear their consciences.

173
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:44,445
{\an1}Do you still harbor
any regrets?

174
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,547
{\an1}Of course! I did die when
I was very young. It'd
be strange not to.

175
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,783
{\an1}To tell you the
truth, I have
some too.

176
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,550
{\an1}And you, Monk?

177
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,853
{\an1}Death is the destiny
of every man.

178
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:55,954
{\an1}You're quite
enlightened.

179
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,690
{\an7}Perhaps, but not during
my lifetime. What
about you?

180
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:02,359
{\an7}I felt no lingering
attachments in life.

181
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:06,062
{\an7}Although now...since I'm dead,
I do feel some regrets.

182
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:10,965
{\an1}Regret is a completely
ridiculous topic
for you to talk about.

183
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:19,872
{\an7}Besides, I didn't reanimate
you merely to have
philosophical discussions.

184
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,907
{\an1}I've just returned.

185
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,208

{\an1}There's no mistake.
It's Gari, the Stone's

{\an1}Yes.

193
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,727
{\an7}Anyway, Orochimaru,
I'm ready.

194
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,729
{\an1}What are you
having me do today?

195
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:58,868
{\an1}Don't be so hasty.
Today's training
will be special.

{\an7}However...
But my story's
different.

198
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:12,480

Lord Orochimaru, I stubbornly

I would try to be like you.

clear to me.

00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,769
{\an1}It's so romantic!

287
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:16,505
{\an1}He only had the courage
'cause he's reanimated.

288
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,440
{\an7}Actually, I'm kinda
surprised that you
were reanimated.

289
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:22,542
{\an1}Hey, come on! I'm
Daimaru, the Red
Cloud of Dust!

290
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:25,678
{\an1}Like the forgettable
C-rank mission where
you lost your life.

291
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,880
{\an1}Your name is unknown.
You're not famous at all.

292
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:31,249
{\an1}Uh, Temari? Did
you hate me back then?

293
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,785
{\an1}Not at all, you were
a lot of fun.

294
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:39,722
{\an4}But best of all, you weren't
scared that I was the
Kazekage's daughter,
and Gaara's older sister.

295
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,924
{\an1}So you mean...
If I'd lived, you
would have dated me?

296
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,527
{\an1}Nope. No way
No way.

297
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,628
{\an1}Damn, you are just
brutally honest.

298
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,396
{\an1}But I like that
about you!

299
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,899
{\an7}There's someone that
Temari already likes,
you know.

300
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,466
{\an1}Yeah, she's in
demand.

301
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,966
{\an1}Ugh, I should
have known!

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,737
{\an1}What are you talking
about?! There's no one
that I like!

303
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,238
{\an1}Look, just get this
over with and seal me.

304
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:04,742
{\an1}You know, back when I
heard that you had died
I was very sad, Daimaru.

305
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,544
{\an1}Seeing you now must
be the hand of Fate.

306
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:09,244
{\an1}Did you cry over me?

307
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,213
{\an1}Did you? Hm?

308
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:14,615
{\an1}Nope. Sorry, I
didn't cry.

309
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,217
{\an1}Sealing team!
Make it snappy!

310
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,819
Right!

311
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,219
{\an1}Well, so long Temari.

312
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:27,659
{\an1}So long, Daimaru.

313
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:33,530
{\an1}Now then...

314
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:37,265
{\an1}Be careful. He was in
the Foundation as
Danzo's bodyguard.

315
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,768
{\an1}He's dangerous.

316
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:42,470
{\an1}As you know, we cannot
defy the orders we've
been given.

317
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:45,773
{\an1}So keep your distance.

318
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:50,577
{\an1}Blade Dance Jutsu!

319
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,945
{\an1}Was that a Clone Jutsu?

320
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:53,912
{\an1}Notify Headquarters
about him!

321
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,948
{\an1}We'll rendezvous with
the Main Company.

322
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,882
{\an1}Will do!

323
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,549
{\an1}Come on.

324
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:05,321
{\an1}I couldn't retrieve
the pawns I lost.

325
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:11,493
{\an1}But this one has
turned out to be
quite a find.

326
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:18,464
{\an7}Please hurry! You have to
seal me soon...Or you'll
all be destroyed!

327
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:59,308
{\an1}<i>Good job finding me.</i>

328
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,776
{\an1}<i>My insects led me.</i>

329
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,313
{\an7}<i>Judging by your appearance,</i>
<i>I can only assume that</i>
<i>you've been reanimated.</i>

330
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:07,548
{\an1}<i>Do you remember my</i>
<i>Venemousa Beetles?</i>

331
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:11,351
{\an1}<i>Hurry, call for </i>
<i>reinforcements. You</i>
<i>can't stop me alone.</i>

332
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:15,254
{\an1}<i>You're wrong. I'm</i>
<i>probably the only</i>
<i>one who can.</i>

333
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:19,924
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto </i>
<i>Shippuden: Shino vs. Torune!</i>

334
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:24,861
{\an7}<i>Let's settle this,</i>
<i>just the two of us.</i>
