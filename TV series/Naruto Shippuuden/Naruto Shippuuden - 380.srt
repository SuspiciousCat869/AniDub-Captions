1
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:03,997
{\an1}Minato, you intended for
your brat to clean up

2
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,835
{\an1}after your mess, right?

3
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:11,309
{\an1}That's why you sealed my
leftover half inside him, as

4
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:15,316
{\an1}if you were confident they'd
be able to work together.

5
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,322
Nine Tails...

6
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,427
{\an1}Then don't regret it now.

7
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,666
It's not your
fault Kushina died.

8
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,206
{\an1}And making your brat
a Jinchuriki wasn't

9
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,942
{\an1}a bad thing either.

10
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,449
{\an1}Because right now, he's the
one trying to change what

11
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:36,554
{\an1}this world has become.

12
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,460
He's not that
newborn baby anymore.

13
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,365
{\an1}In fact, tomorrow is...

14
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:45,769
Naruto...

15
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:50,244
{\an1}Listen up, I've got
something to tell you.

16
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,171
{\an1}[chuckle] Yes! I knew it!
It's just like I thought!

17
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,812
{\an1}I can't believe that
the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki

18
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:12,249
{\an1}has such a weakness!

19
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,254
{\an1}And with Ten Tails
inside me, I can't pass

20
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:16,789
{\an1}through things either!

21
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,695
How frustrating!

22
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,870
Sage moves will
work, you guys!

23
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,439
{\an1}What is this Sage Power?

24
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,042
{\an1}You know, toad attacks.

25
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:31,649
{\an1}Those are Sage Jutsu, and
they employ Nature Energy.

26
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,387
{\an1}Come to think of it, when I
tried to gauge Ten Tails'

27
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,823
power, it was
Nature Energy itself.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,030
So maybe you can
counter nature Energy

29
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,600
{\an1}with Nature Energy!

30
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,538
{\an1}I mean, not that I
really understand it all...

31
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,175
{\an1}I'm just glad that I
learned Sage Jutsu!

32
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,112
All right!

33
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,351
He'll get a frog
punch to the face!

34
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,565
{\an1}He instantly grasped how to
use the Flying Raijin with

35
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,370
me and has even
mastered Sage Power.

36
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:07,944
{\an1}I feel like I'm fighting
alongside Elder Brother!

37
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:20,500
It clearly
worked, but look...

38
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,238
{\an1}He's recovered already
and is guarding his back.

39
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:26,477
If we teleport
behind him carelessly,

40
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,679
{\an1}we might get erased.

41
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,063
I should start
preparing for the Tsukuyomi.

42
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:39,967
{\an1}So let's tidy things up.

43
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:42,671
[gasps]

44
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,036
There truly is
nothing that's worth

45
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,939
{\an1}saving in this reality.

46
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,283
This whole world
is already dead.

47
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,102
{\an1}This is super bad!

48
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,138
Four of them?!

49
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,173
{\an1}And all at once?!

50
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,911
{\an1}Even if we all made an
Earth Style Wall, it-

51
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,447
{\an1}it wouldn't work!

52
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,016
{\an1}There's too many of them!

53
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,787
What do we do?

54
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:31,890
Think!

55
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:34,628
{\an1}We'd need one person
to teleport each of

56
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,531
{\an1}those with Flying Raijin.

57
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,768
{\an1}The Fourth and I can
get two, but that

58
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,304
{\an1}leaves two others!

59
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,673
It's impossible!

60
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:44,111
{\an1}Where's Elder Brother?!

61
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,516
Madara!

62
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,885
{\an1}Just wait a moment!

63
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,188
That comrade of
yours is acting up!

64
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,192
{\an1}We are all Reanimations!

65
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,594
{\an1}There's no need to worry!

66
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,364
Keep fighting!

67
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,269
Do not give
up, everyone!

68
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,306
I am with you
through my clones!

69
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,010
We only need to
change the trajectories

70
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,411
{\an1}of those spheres!

71
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,448
{\an1}The other Hokage will
also take measures

72
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,585
and repel them
across the ocean!

73
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,989
{\an1}Put up an Earth Style Wall!

74
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:12,394
{\an1}I'll use Deep Forest
Emergence to launch and

75
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,163
{\an1}guide them toward the ocean!

76
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:15,666
I won't let you!

77
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,349
{\an1}Six Crimson Ray Formation!

78
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:35,834
A barrier!

79
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,836
Hey!

80
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,106
{\an1}Wait, don't tell me
that all of us...

81
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,648
{\an1}He's trapped us inside the
barrier and made it so we

82
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:46,418
can't expel the
Tailed Beast Bombs!

83
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:52,429
{\an1}This is the endgame.

84
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,101
{\an1}All we can do is teleport
them outside the barrier

85
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,803
{\an1}using Flying Raijin.

86
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:59,708
Lord Fourth, can
you handle two?

87
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:03,649
{\an1}Since we aren't able to mark
them, I can only take one.

88
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:05,719
But there is
one other way...

89
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,693
We could...

90
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:13,198
{\an1}You intend to teleport
the stalk itself outside?

91
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,136
{\an1}You think I'd allow that?

92
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,707
{\an1}You cannot save anyone now!

93
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,079
Dad...

94
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,917
{\an1}I don't know if this
will work or not,

95
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,954
{\an1}but I've got an idea.

96
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,327
So will you give
me a fist bump?

97
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,798
Hey, other half!

98
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,001
How've ya been?

99
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,873
{\an1}Would you mind sharing
some of your chakra with me?

100
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,609
[chuckle]

101
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,048
You know, to be
asked a favor from

102
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,452
{\an1}myself is a bit weird.

103
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:08,427
Naruto, face it,
Minato's useless.

104
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,501
{\an1}He wasn't even able to
protect your mother!

105
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,244
{\an1}Nor his subordinates.

106
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,921
You know what
tomorrow is, don't you?

107
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:31,400
It is the
anniversary of their deaths.

108
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,671
The day both
your parent's died.

109
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,502
{\an1}In this world, it's
over when you die.

110
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,737
You see...

111
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,241
Oh, right.

112
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:57,213
{\an1}Which means it's also
the day I was born!

113
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,268
So you see...

114
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,137
It's not over...

115
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,547
Because I exist
in this world!

116
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:24,792
{\an1}Our Naruto sure has
grown very strong, Kushina!

117
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,406
{\an1}Now, let's go, Dad!

118
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,942
All right!

119
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,482
{\an1}Thank goodness for the
chakra from you two!

120
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,720
{\an1}It's just as I thought!

121
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:03,827
{\an1}Yeah, well, the two of us
used to be one, after all.

122
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:05,663
Plus...

123
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,670
...those two are
father and son.

124
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,584
{\an1}He's planning to trap us
inside this barrier and blow

125
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,288
{\an1}us up along with it!

126
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,457
What can we do?

127
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,395
{\an1}The Hokage's barrier
didn't let Tailed Beast

128
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:24,963
{\an1}Bombs through, either.

129
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:40,424
{\an1}As far as I can tell,
this barrier's red.

130
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,562
{\an1}I think it's accurate to say
that this one's likely on

131
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:45,800
{\an1}par with the Hokage's.

132
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,938
{\an1}With our level of strength,
it's impossible for us to

133
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:51,376
{\an1}smash through it,
in which case...

134
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,387
Nah!

135
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,891
Nothing's
coming to mind, Dad!

136
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,731
{\an1}So what's your plan, Naruto?

137
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,570
Just give me
some time to focus.

138
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,853
{\an1}Let me explain what
Kurama and I came up with.

139
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,658
{\an1}And then you tell me if
it'll work or not, okay?

140
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,231
Yeah, all right.

141
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:24,900
{\an1}Go ahead and tell me!

142
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:32,547
{\an1}Have you had a chance to
meet him already, Kushina?

143
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,419
Our Naruto's
really grown up.

144
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,602
{\an1}I'm so sorry, Naruto.

145
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,275
{\an1}I'm sure it's been
a long, hard road for

146
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,776
{\an1}you up until now.

147
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:54,318
{\an1}The real hard part is
about to start now, Dad!

148
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,221
[gasp]

149
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:06,573
{\an1}Wait, this is Naruto's-!

150
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:11,214
So, then it
wasn't depleted?!

151
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,818
{\an1}I noticed it when I
was healing everyone.

152
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,256
It seems that it
had merely shrunk.

153
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:21,465
{\an1}It's actually bigger and
more powerful than before!

154
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,735
{\an1}Have ya noticed, Eight-o?

155
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,577
{\an1}I sense two Nine Tails,
one light and one dark, yo!

156
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:30,448
{\an1}This isn't just Nine Tails.

157
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,052
So then you're
thinking about

158
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,256
{\an1}protecting us all
from that attack with

159
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,825
{\an1}this chakra, Naruto?

160
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,175
{\an1}Jugo, what is it?

161
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,410
Sasuke.

162
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,280
{\an1}This is looking bad.

163
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,551
Let's get
outside this barrier.

164
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,921
Use the Snake
Reverse Summoning.

165
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,625
{\an1}That was my plan.

166
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,128
{\an1}I'm going to take you
and Naruto with me.

167
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,234
{\an1}I haven't given you two
any of my chakra yet.

168
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:03,271
{\an1}Get over here, will ya?

169
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,242
[chuckle]

170
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,380
{\an1}What is your chakra
going to accomplish?

171
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:09,849
There's no time!

172
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,251
Just hurry!

173
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,460
{\an1}Whoa, I can't believe
he shared his chakra

174
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,598
{\an1}with every other shinobi!

175
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,001
{\an1}He's got almost as
much chakra as I do!

176
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,873
Hold on!

177
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:26,277
This has Nine
Tails' Chakra mixed in!

178
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:29,082
{\an1}That won't help you
withstand the shock wave of

179
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:33,323
{\an1}four Ten Tails Tailed Beast
Bombs exploding together!

180
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,327
Be gone!

181
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,969
How could--?

182
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:47,418
{\an1}I guess this chakra has
protected us once again!

183
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:48,887
Not quite.

184
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,323
{\an1}Check it out, you guys.

185
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,426
Choji!

186
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,528
Look there!

187
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,602
All of us are
outside the barrier!

188
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,979
{\an1}Teleportation Jutsu!

189
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:05,716
{\an1}Damn that Naruto!

190
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:07,519
He's managed to
master that, too?!

191
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:10,692
But this isn't
only Naruto's chakra.

192
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:13,229
{\an1}He moved everyone
using the Fourth

193
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,600
Hokage's Flying
Raijin Jutsu!

194
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,802
[chuckle]

195
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,338
{\an1}Well done, Lord Fourth.

196
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,575
{\an1}By my count, this is the
second time that you have

197
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,946
{\an1}saved all of shinobi-kind.

198
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:30,425
{\an1}[gasps] But I've failed
more than that.

199
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,267
{\an1}So I must keep...

200
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,140
{\an1}...making amends.

201
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:43,347
What did you do?

202
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:45,785
{\an1}Oh, nothing much.

203
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,488
{\an1}Dad just teleported
every single person

204
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,190
{\an1}outside the barrier.

205
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,527
Everyone?!

206
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,095
{\an1}With that jutsu?!

207
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,868
{\an1}I simply can't teleport
anything that I myself, or

208
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,439
my chakra, isn't
touching directly.

209
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,008
But how did?!

210
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:06,454
{\an1}It's because I'd already
shared Kurama's chakra and

211
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,125
my chakra with
everyone earlier on.

212
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,663
{\an1}So if Dad and our
chakra and everyone

213
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:13,834
{\an1}were to, uhh, well...

214
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,070
{\an1}Were to indirectly...

215
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,271
That's right!

216
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:18,810
{\an1}If we were all in indirect
contact, it would work!

217
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:22,716
{\an1}So, I connected Dad's chakra
with Kurama's and mine.

218
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,586
{\an1}That's all there was to it!

219
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,525
He was using the
principle of Shadow Clones.

220
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,430
{\an1}Even if you split up and
disperse your chakra, if you

221
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,568
{\an1}keep even a little bit there
without putting it out

222
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,406
{\an1}when the original body
infuses chakra again to

223
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,411
{\an1}regain control, all the
individual chakra bits

224
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:41,615
{\an1}resonate and link together.

225
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,220
{\an1}In short, by joining his
chakra with the Fourth's,

226
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,291
{\an1}Naruto effectively linked
the Fourth to the rest of

227
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,296
{\an1}his chakra that was
residing in everyone else.

228
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,870
{\an1}Is that right, Naruto?

229
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:54,738
Huh?

230
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,173
{\an1}Is that what it was?

231
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,175
Never mind.

232
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,112
{\an1}Old Man Second, you
sure know a lot about

233
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,848
{\an1}my Shadow Clones!

234
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:03,119
{\an1}I came up with that jutsu!

235
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,822
{\an1}So it's my jutsu!

236
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,258
[chuckle]

237
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:11,299
{\an1}So will you give
me a fist bump?

238
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,437
Yeah!

239
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:32,536
{\an1}Yeah, let's try it!

240
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:35,743
{\an1}'Cause we can do anything
if we borrow Nine Tails', I

241
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,612
{\an1}mean, Kurama's power.

242
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:38,647
Right!

243
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:41,185
{\an1}Then let's all four
of us join forces now!

244
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,688
All four of us?

245
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,325
{\an1}You treat us like
we're human, too!

246
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,629
What kind of
childrearing led to this?!

247
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,700
[chuckling]

248
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,173
Naruto...

249
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,148
{\an1}I wish there were more time
to talk to the grown-up you!

250
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:01,386
{\an1}Yeah, me, too, but
guys don't need to talk!

251
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,090
{\an1}Plus, I already know!

252
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:08,733
I...

253
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,905
I already met
Mom's chakra, dad...

254
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,718
Kushina, I'm not
gonna last much longer.

255
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:23,625
{\an1}I'll start the Eight
Signed Seal, right now.

256
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:28,099
{\an1}I still want to put some
of my chakra in Naruto.

257
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,605
We won't see him
for quite a while.

258
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,408
{\an1}So let's tell him
what we want to say.

259
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,249
Naruto, don't be
a picky eater.

260
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,321
{\an1}Just eat a lot so you
grow up big and strong.

261
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,994
{\an1}And make sure that you
bathe every day and

262
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,462
{\an1}that you stay warm, too.

263
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,468
Also, don't stay
up too late.

264
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,471
{\an1}Make sure you get
plenty of sleep.

265
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,244
Don't forget, to
make friends as well.

266
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,680
You don't need a
ton of them, okay?

267
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,650
{\an1}Just a few is fine.

268
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,656
{\an1}As long as they're ones
that you can really trust.

269
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:04,830
{\an1}And your mom wasn't
very good at this.

270
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:08,703
{\an1}Make sure you study hard
and learn your ninjutsu.

271
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:12,844
{\an1}Always remember everyone is
good at some things and not

272
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:16,851
{\an1}so good at others, so even
if something doesn't go well

273
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,188
{\an1}don't get depressed, okay?

274
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:23,094
{\an1}When you're at the Academy
respect your teachers and

275
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,797
{\an1}the upperclassmen.

276
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,899
Oh!

277
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,137
{\an1}Now, this is important
regarding the Three

278
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,607
Prohibitions of
the shinobi.

279
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,780
{\an1}Be extra careful about
lending and borrowing money.

280
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,816
Take your pay.

281
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,020
{\an1}Put it in a savings account.

282
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:40,758
No alcohol, not
until you're of age!

283
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:45,300
{\an1}Too much sake is bad for
you, so practice moderation.

284
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:49,039
And another
prohibition is women.

285
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:51,677
{\an1}Remember, I am one.

286
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:53,848
So I don't know
too much about it...

287
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:58,155
{\an1}Keep in mind that this world
is made up of men and women.

288
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:01,794
{\an1}And so at some point,
you'll notice girls,

289
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,465
{\an1}and that's normal.

290
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:06,503
{\an1}Just be careful don't
fall for the bad ones.

291
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:09,541
{\an1}Just go out there and
find someone who's like me!

292
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,179
{\an1}Oh, uh, that reminds me.

293
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:14,617
{\an1}Speaking of the Three
Prohibitions, you should be

294
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,155
wary of Jiraiya
Sensei, ya know.

295
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,801
{\an1}Naruto, I'm sorry to say
there will be plenty of

296
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,606
hardships and
painful times ahead.

297
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,144
{\an1}Just be true to yourself.

298
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:32,882
{\an1}Make sure to have
dreams and the confidence

299
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,153
to make those
dreams come true!

300
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,891
Oh, Naruto.

301
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,264
There's so much,
oh so much more.

302
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,502
{\an1}There are so many
things I wish I had the

303
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,305
{\an1}time to pass on to you.

304
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:49,077
So much more I
want to tell you!

305
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,015
I wish I could
stay with you longer.

306
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,419
I love you!

307
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,523
{\an1}Minato, I'm sorry!

308
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,891
{\an1}I used up your time!

309
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,995
{\an1}No, it's all right.

310
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,836
{\an1}Naruto, my words to you.

311
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:07,174
{\an1}Well, I guess your
talkative mom...

312
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,412
Said it all...

313
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,619
{\an1}What you want to say
to me is the same as

314
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,722
{\an1}my talkative mom, right?

315
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:17,493
{\an1}See, I already know!

316
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,330
[chuckle]

317
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,503
<i>[gasp]</i>

318
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:01,472
{\an1}<i>Just what exactly is this?!</i>

319
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,042
{\an1}<i>It's the Divine Tree!</i>

320
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:05,246
{\an1}<i>It's Ten Tail's final form!</i>

321
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,551
{\an1}<i>Chakra first originated</i>
<i>with this Divine Tree!</i>

322
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:10,287
{\an1}<i>What're you saying?!</i>

323
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,593
{\an1}<i>We humans stole chakra from</i>
<i>the Divine Tree long ago.</i>

324
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:16,865
{\an1}<i>This thing is merely trying</i>
<i>to get it back, that's all.</i>

325
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,339
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The</i>
<i>Divine Tree."</i>

326
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:21,974
<i>Do you know how</i>
<i>and why shinobi</i>

327
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,646
{\an1}<i>came to be, Hashirama?</i>
