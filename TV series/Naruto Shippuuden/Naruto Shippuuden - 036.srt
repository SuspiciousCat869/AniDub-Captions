1
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,695
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Just like Sasuke, huh?

2
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:44,134
Well, there's sort of
a resemblance, I guess.

3
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:50,048
-Well, what is it?

4
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,322
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sorta
sounds like him too.

5
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,899
-If you keep on staring at
me like that, I will hit you.

6
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,336
-Where did that come from?

7
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:01,909
Where do you get off
saying things like that?

8
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,078
Listen, you!

9
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,582
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I take it back.

10
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:06,887
This guy's nothing like Sasuke.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,393
-I really have nothing
personal against you.

12
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:10,429
-Yeah?

13
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,397
Then why'd you say it?

14
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,767
-You don't understand.

15
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,741
I was only trying out a certain
personality type, that's all.

16
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,612
-A personality type?

17
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,250
-Hm?

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,924
If you were trying to do in,
then that means you meant it!

19
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,531
We don't need someone
like you on this team.

20
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:43,104
You really rub me the wrong way.

21
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:44,374
-That's enough.

22
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:47,280
That's no way to talk,
especially not in front of me,

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,220
your team captain, Naruto.

24
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:54,230
Mutual respect and trust are
essential elements of teamwork.

25
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,134
Wasn't it Kakashi
that taught you that?

26
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,485
You are part of the team
led by the great Kakashi.

27
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,432
Lose the attitude.

28
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,370
-He's not a part
of Team Kakashi.

29
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:12,673
Not now, not ever!

30
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:16,014
The fourth member of our
team is and always will

31
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:20,424
be Sasuke Uchiha.

32
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:28,677
This guy, he's just
a fill in for Sasuke.

33
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,414
That's all he is.

34
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,519
He will never be a real
member of our team!

35
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:38,733
-Well.

36
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,210
I'm glad.

37
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,148
I'm glad that
that's how you feel.

38
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:50,259
Sasuke is a traitor.

39
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:52,465
He betrayed the Leaf
and joined Orchimaru.

40
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:56,273
Yes, you're right.

41
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,078
I'm not him at all.

42
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,380
I'm not a traitorous cockroach.

43
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:06,130
I can't fill in for
someone like that.

44
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,001
-I've had it with you, Sai.

45
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,747
-Remember what's
important, Naruto.

46
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:14,349
It's teamwork.

47
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:18,859
Calm down.

48
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,163
Sai.

49
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,935
Naruto was out of line,
but it's just because he

50
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,606
doesn't know you
well enough yet.

51
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,691
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:35,932
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive him.

53
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,368
-But, Sakura.

54
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,550
-Glad we have one level
headed person on the team.

55
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,485
-Oh, don't worry.

56
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,223
He doesn't bather
me in the least.

57
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,359
-Good.

58
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,494
That's a relief.

59
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,981
[theme music]

60
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,702
SHIZUNE: I wonder if they're
getting along all right?

61
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:49,608
The new Team Kakashi, I mean.

62
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,014
-I'm sure they're doing fine.

63
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,188
After all, they're not a
bunch of rookies anymore.

64
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,527
They're full
fledged shinobi now.

65
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,999
-Yes, but Naruto and
the new one, Sai,

66
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,803
didn't seem to hit it off.

67
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,242
I just hope that doesn't lead
to any friction between them

68
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,679
down the road.

69
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:08,886
-And whose fault do you
think it will be if it does?

70
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,790
Whose bright idea
was it to stick

71
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:12,628
Naruto with someone
he can't stand?

72
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:13,998
That.

73
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:17,005
-I-- I never imagined that one
of Lord Danzo's men would end

74
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,174
up joining the team.

75
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,520
TSUNADE: I don't wanna
hear any excuses!

76
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,023
Just get on it!

77
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,327
-Oink.

78
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:30,436
-I wanna know what Danzo's
up to and who this Sai is.

79
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,841
Understand, Shizune?

80
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,848
-Yes, m'lady.

81
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:38,255
-As for Naruto and Sai,
I'm counting on Sakura

82
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,423
to handle it.

83
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:42,063
She should be able
to keep them in line.

84
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:42,664
-Yes.

85
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:45,337
About Sakura.

86
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,339
-What about her?

87
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,909
-Uh, nothing.

88
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:48,578
Nothing, m'lady.

89
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,802
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): The problem
is, as Lady Tsunade's student,

90
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:03,211
Sakura is becoming more and
more like her teacher every day.

91
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,918
I wonder if she's really the
best person to smooth out

92
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,223
any friction between
Naruto and Sai.

93
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,101
It might be like throwing
fuel on the fire.

94
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:40,766
-I don't care one bit
if you forgive me.

95
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,803
-You fooled me quite well.

96
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,208
That smile of your
looked so sincere.

97
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,294
-Sai.

98
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,634
You don't know a
thing about Sasuke.

99
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:13,341
I won't stand for you
talking as if you do.

100
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:22,562
Just keep badmouthing him and
next time, I won't hold back.

101
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,315
-Hm.

102
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:32,719
Fine then.

103
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:34,857
I'll keep my mouth
shut in front of you.

104
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:38,666
Well.

105
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,169
It would appear
I've just learned

106
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,010
another use for a fake smile.

107
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,883
I'll remember that.

108
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,387
-How can you just
sit there grinning

109
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,524
after she knocked
you into next week?

110
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,531
-The best way to defuse
a troublesome situation

111
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,300
is by smiling.

112
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:58,545
Even if it's only a fake smile.

113
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,871
It will fool more
people than you think.

114
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,547
At least, that's what
it said in the book.

115
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,317
However, it appears
I haven't quite

116
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:18,224
mastered the technique yet.

117
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,229
-OK, you jerk.

118
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:21,264
-Four Pillar Prison Jutsu.

119
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:35,898
I'm warning you.

120
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,670
I will toss you
all into this cage

121
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,175
if you insist on
fighting with each other.

122
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:41,779
Look, we don't have
much time if we're

123
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:45,354
going to make it to
the Tenchi Bridge.

124
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,461
With that being said, we
have just enough time, I

125
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:51,768
think, to sort this
out once and for all.

126
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,272
-But-- But isn't that--

127
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,021
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wood Style Ninjutsu.

128
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:04,431
A secret ninjutsu known
only to the First Hokage.

129
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,937
So how does Captain
Yamato know it?

130
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,695
Who is he?

131
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:21,838
-As the peacemaker here, I'm
offering you two choices.

132
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,678
Spend the rest of the day
crammed inside a wooden box,

133
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:27,819
reacquainting yourselves
with the meaning of teamwork,

134
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,356
or enjoy a night at
a comfortable inn

135
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,160
with a relaxing hot spring.

136
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,665
Which do you choose?

137
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,708
You don't really know
me very well either.

138
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:42,586
I prefer the kinder and gentler
approach, but believe me.

139
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:46,028
I'll use more draconian
methods when it's necessary.

140
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,892
-Ah.

141
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:16,698
Naked like this with no
secrets from each other.

142
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,904
There's nothing like it for
bringing people together,

143
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:19,739
is there?

144
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,953
There's nothing
like it, is there?

145
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,655
-Right.

146
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:27,758
There's nothing like it!

147
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,261
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That freaky look again.

148
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,798
Forget kinder and gentler.

149
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:34,005
He's definitely going
with the draconian method!

150
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,141
-What do you know?

151
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:36,979
Looks like you do have
some balls after all.

152
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:54,319
NARUTO: Mind your own business!

153
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:55,455
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto?

154
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,490
NARUTO: Damn it!

155
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,462
You're always balls
this, balls that!

156
00:11:58,495 --> 00:11:59,865
You're so annoying!

157
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,137
[giggling]

158
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,776
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Oh.

159
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:05,879
You and your big mouth.

160
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,721
Sometimes I wish I could just--

161
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,558
-Argh!

162
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,062
Great, now look at
what you've done.

163
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,467
They're all laughing
at me thanks to you.

164
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,207
-Well, at least you brought
little joy to Sakura's day.

165
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,479
Try to look at it like that.

166
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:21,816
-That's right, Sakura.

167
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,792
-Hm.

168
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,627
All righty then.

169
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:33,209
Well, I think I've soaked
enough for one day.

170
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:40,492
But before I go, let me
share an interesting story

171
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,330
with you, Naruto.

172
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,167
-Huh?

173
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,874
-Once, when Master
Jiraiya was young,

174
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,747
there was one incident that
nearly cost him his life.

175
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,253
He fractured six
ribs, both arms,

176
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,694
and suffered several
ruptured internal organs.

177
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,002
Supposedly, Lady
Tsunade did it to him.

178
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,405
Her strength is astonishing.

179
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,920
It all happened because he
did precisely what you're

180
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,092
contemplating right now.

181
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,072
I wonder how Sakura would react.

182
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:13,941
Looks like a great
change is in the wind.

183
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,318
[knocking]

184
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,022
Yes, come in.

185
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,157
-Excuse me, sir.

186
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:37,363
Sorry to bother you.

187
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:38,399
Are you ready?

188
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,904
Should we begin
preparing the meal?

189
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:42,141
-Yes, thank you.

190
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,011
-We'll start serving
as soon as it's ready.

191
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:06,229
-That felt good.

192
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,182
-Hey, Naruto.

193
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:21,732
Well, I'm getting out now too.

194
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:24,205
I really wouldn't stay in
there too long, if I were you.

195
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,708
You don't want to pass out.

196
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,875
A-haw!

197
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,378
A-haw!

198
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:41,879
Caw!

199
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:48,294
-You're kidding.

200
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:52,270
I've never seen such a spread.

201
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:55,343
-It's amazing.

202
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,817
Hey, uh, Captain Yamato?

203
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:00,021
-What is it, Naruto?

204
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:01,357
-What's the deal here?

205
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,663
Is all of this really for us?

206
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,331
-Yeah.

207
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,436
Go ahead and dig in.

208
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:07,838
-Yes!

209
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:09,409
Thanks a lot!

210
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,745
-Thank you so much!

211
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:16,091
NARUTO: I don't
know where to start.

212
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:23,275
Delicious.

213
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,826
-Mm.

214
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,228
Oh, that's tasty!

215
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,030
-If we get treated to a feast
like this on every mission,

216
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:50,470
then I say you can lead our
squad forever, Captain Yamato!

217
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,807
-I second that!

218
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,647
Let's hope Kakashi-sensei
doesn't get out of the hospital

219
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,051
too soon.

220
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,988
-Ah-- Ah-- Ah choo!

221
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:07,009
When do I get to eat something?

222
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,183
-You'll have to stick
to an IV for now.

223
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:15,228
Weak as you are, you don't even
have full use of your arms yet.

224
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,331
-I see.

225
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:18,335
-Once your arms and
legs are working again,

226
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,340
we'll get you on a
liquid diet, but it's

227
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,746
going to be a while before
you can eat anything solid.

228
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,628
-Food.

229
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,432
Real food.

230
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,103
NARUTO: Oh man.

231
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,874
I am stuffed.

232
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:35,642
Ah.

233
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,711
Oh yeah.

234
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:41,288
-Thank you for the meal.

235
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,158
-Yes indeed.

236
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,126
Thank you.

237
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:54,953
-Now then.

238
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,225
Normally I'd say this was
the perfect time for us

239
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:02,170
to discuss our mission now
that we're all fed and rested.

240
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:06,814
But since the reason we're here
is to improve our team morale,

241
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,853
we'll save the heavy
stuff for later.

242
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,823
-Now you're talking,
Captain Yamato.

243
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,993
Good idea!

244
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,095
-All right, then.

245
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:17,105
We'll discuss the mission
specifics tomorrow.

246
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:20,446
-So, we'll be staying at the
hot springs another day then?

247
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,281
-Whoa.

248
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,985
Let's not get carried away.

249
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,956
I'm not made out
of money, you know.

250
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,825
-What?

251
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,262
Wait a second.

252
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:29,634
Are you saying you paid for all
of this out of your own pocket?

253
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,337
-Mhmm.

254
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,474
-All right.

255
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,111
That's so cool!

256
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,986
OK, it's settled.

257
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,158
Captain Yamato is now
the official leader

258
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:41,461
of Team Kakashi.

259
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,165
SAKURA: I second the motion!

260
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,134
NARUTO: Woo hoo!

261
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:35,118
-Slept like a log.

262
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,888
Looks like another
beautiful day.

263
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:56,234
Huh?

264
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:13,341
Sai?

265
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,266
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What
is he doing over there?

266
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:32,150
[theme music]

267
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,324
SAKURA: Sai.

268
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,161
So you're an artist, huh?

269
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:04,163
SAI: What do you want?

270
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,433
SAKURA: Nothing.

271
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,137
I'm just surprised to see
you have a sensitive side

272
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,740
when you come off
as such a jerk.

273
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,010
SAI: So that's all you wanted?

274
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:11,480
To insult me again?

275
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:12,784
Punching me wasn't enough?

276
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,989
SAKURA: Hey, I just wanted
to see what you're drawing.

277
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:16,726
I was trying to be nice.

278
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,096
SAI: I see.

279
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,466
SAKURA: It's strange, though.

280
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,071
sitting out here, I thought you
must be drawing a landscape,

281
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:25,145
but it's some kind of
abstract, isn't it?

282
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,854
NARUTO: Next time, Untitled.

283
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:31,761
[theme music]

284
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:43,221
-The Leaf Ask Us Anything
Investigation Team.

285
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:46,796
-OK, our question for today
is, how is captain Yamato

286
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:49,568
able to use the
Wood Style ninjutsu.

287
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,605
Hang on.

288
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,442
This question was sent
in by you, Sakura.

289
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:55,282
-Well, aren't you curious?

290
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:59,826
-I don't know, what's so special
about that ninjutsu anyway?

291
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,632
-You knucklehead!

292
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,735
Listen.

293
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,038
The Wood Style ninjutsu
is not only special.

294
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:06,708
It's uniquely rare.

295
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,479
It has the power
to transform chakra

296
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,384
into a sort of life itself.

297
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:11,085
-NARUTO: Uh, OK.

298
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:12,154
Run that by me again.

299
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:12,756
SAKURA: Ugh.

300
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,259
Why waste my breath?

301
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,166
The main point is, the Wood
Style ninjutsu can only

302
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,569
be used by the First Hokage.

303
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,370
NARUTO: Ah.

304
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:21,409
I see.

305
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,482
Then, how come Captain
Yamato's using it?

306
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:25,752
Tell me that.

307
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,389
-That's the whole
point of my question.

308
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,164
Oh no.

309
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,066
Now we've run out of time!

310
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,335
Look what you've done,
Naruto, you idiot!

311
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,202
We're out of time!

312
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:34,203
-Hey, calm down, Sakura.

313
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:34,737
Calm down!

314
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,172
Don't worry.

315
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:39,775
We'll keep investigating 'til we
find the answer, so stay tuned!
