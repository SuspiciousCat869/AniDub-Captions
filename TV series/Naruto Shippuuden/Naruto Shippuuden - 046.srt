00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,458
-The person who injured Sakura?

00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,263
It was you, Naruto.

-You-- you really don't
remember any of it?

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,561
-So.

8
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,232
The bridge, then?

9
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:19,205
And the giant crater?

10
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,341
-Yes.

11
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:23,147
It was all you.

12
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:26,220
-And Sakura's wounds?

13
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,689
-That's right.

14
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:38,146
She lied to spare your feelings.

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,550
To protect you from the truth.

16
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:47,233
But understand, I'm to blame
for her injuries as well.

17
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,569
This is not all on you.

18
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:56,520
The thing is, there's a reason
I was assigned to Team Kakashi.

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,729
You see, I possess
a unique power.

20
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:06,141
The ability to suppress the
Nine-Tails power within you.

21
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,515
So you needn't worry too much.

22
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,385
You'll be fine.

23
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:15,528
Well, as long as I'm
at your side, anyway.

24
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,331
-Huh?

25
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:18,668
-Let's be honest.

26
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,739
I'm not even sure if it's
right to be telling you

27
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,442
any of this just yet, Naruto.

28
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:30,493
But there's a reason I did.

29
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,667
There's no question this power
will get you to Sasuke faster.

30
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,715
But the strength you gain from
depending on the Nine-Tails

31
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:44,190
isn't actually your own.

32
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:47,430
If you continue to
rely on its power,

33
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,270
not only will you
hurt yourself, Naruto,

34
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,176
but you'll be endangering
the lives of those around you

35
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,813
as well.

36
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:55,748
Just as you did today.

37
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,690
[gasp]

38
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:03,431
-But you knew about all
this already, didn't you?

39
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:06,405
And you let your impatience
get the better of you

40
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,908
and unleash the power anyway.

41
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:13,353
I'll have to suppress the
Nine-Tails power completely

42
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:15,524
now.

43
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:16,661
But listen.

44
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,765
If you think that's
going to make you weaker,

45
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,870
you're mistaken.

46
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,774
I've witnessed what you can do.

47
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,644
You're powerful
enough on your own.

48
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,633
I really think you've
got the wrong idea, here.

49
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:38,741
The source of your strength
isn't the Nine-Tails chakra.

50
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,848
It's your own, which holds
the formidable energy

51
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:43,452
of the Nine-Tails in check.

52
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:55,846
If you want to save Sasuke,
then do it using your own power.

53
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,687
If you wish to see Sasuke,
then look with your eyes,

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,794
not the Nine-Tails'.

55
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:07,805
If you want to protect Sakura,
forget about the fox spirit.

56
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:08,807
Use your strength.

57
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,335
-All right.

you think you could possibly

in stock shouldn't you?

-I do, but none
between 15 and 16.

I'm going to need another for
this scroll to be completed.

107

I mean, you must know how
much of a perfectionist

00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:00,871
I tend to be.

-Kabuto.

Your blood type is A, isn't it?

00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,356
-Actually, no.

112
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:10,859
It's AB.

113
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,031
-Really?

114
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,835
That's surprising.

115
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,705
-No, I don't think so.

116
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,377
Anyway, we should
probably get moving.

-Here.

120
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,462
Have a look at this diagram.

121
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:01,268
I think it lays out a pretty
good strategy for cornering

00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:04,309
your enemy, which we'll need.

123
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,916
Now, in actual missions, things
can change up pretty quickly

124
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,253
depending on the
number of enemies

125
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,522
and allies in the field.

126
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:11,490

127
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,508
-I don't get it.

00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,916
This book.

129
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,218
-Huh?

130
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,927
-And if things go in this
direction, we'll have to-- hey,

131
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,329
are you even listening to me?

132
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:30,799
-You guys, come here a minute.

133
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,068
-Hmm?

134
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:32,837
-Hurry.

135
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,940
You have to see this.

136
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,066
-What is it, Sakura?

137
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,068
Is something wrong?

138
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,105
-Look at this.

139
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,807
-Hey!

140
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,511
That's Psi's!

141
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,150
-It's the picture book we found.

142
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:56,923
The one that he drew, right?

143
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:57,925
What's it about, Sakura?

144
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:58,994
Can you tell?

145
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,497
It we figure that
out, we might be

146
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:03,336
able to learn
something about Psi.

147
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,439
-I know.

148
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:05,842
That's what I was thinking.

149
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:10,051
So I tried to read it, but--

150
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:11,120
-Well, what's it about?

151
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,890
What kind of story is it?

152
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:13,415
-Hmm.

153
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:19,294
Actually, I'm not all that sure.

154
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,563
-Huh?

155
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:22,234
Well, why not?

156
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,202
-Go on, Sakura.

157
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,748
-There aren't any words
or dialogue at all.

158
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:29,717
-Yeah, you're right.

159
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:34,628
-I don't know.

160
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,133
I mean, it seems like
it's about the two

161
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,502
boys on the front
and back cover.

162
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,181
Each of them has his
own story, starting

163
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:45,685
from either end of the book.

164
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,257
And then, if you read
them all the way through,

165
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,994
they eventually
meet in the center.

166
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:06,129
If you start on the side with
the black-haired boy on it,

167
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:07,699
all the pages are alike.

168
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:19,424
He's always on the right side.

169
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,763
-But the character
on the left changes

170
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,567
with every turn of the page.

171
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,702
See?

172
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:26,039
-Wait.

173
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,607
Sakura.

174
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,776
Go back, will you?

175
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,378
-Hm?

176
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,495
-I thought so.

177
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,433
Check out what he's wearing.

178
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,604
Now, go ahead and flip back
to the other page again.

179
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,207
He's got a different outfit on.

180
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,423
-You're right.

181
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,160
-And look at his weapon.

182
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:52,530
It's the same one
his opponent is

183
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,300
wielding on the previous page.

184
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,570
A sickle and chain.

185
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,687
[sigh]

186
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,594
-It seems like, like it's
the story of a young boy,

187
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:08,230
vanquishing his enemies.

188
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,533
-Looks like it.

189
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,874
And after each fight, I think he
claims their weapons and armor

190
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:13,576
for his own.

191
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,724
Every page, it just keeps going.

192
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,428
Oh-- wait a minute.

193
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,243
Yep.

194
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,513
The layout's in reverse.

195
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:32,383
But the boy with
the white hair has

196
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:34,654
been drawn in the
exact same way.

197
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:36,826
-So it's actually
a story about how

198
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,231
the boys mature with
each battle, then.

199
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:39,833
-Wait.

200
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,405
Hold on a second, though.

201
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,513
If they're both fighting
their way in from the cover,

202
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,284
what happens when they
meet in the middle?

203
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,552
-Yeah, I know.

204
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,422
That's the problem.

205
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:10,700
Look here.

206
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,715
-What's up with that?

207
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:18,717
I don't get it.

208
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,468
-Kind of freaky.

209
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:45,341
-I went through the whole thing,
and these pages at the center

210
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,844
are the only ones
that are incomplete.

211
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:56,900
-So, uh, anybody as
creeped out as I am?

212
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,872
-He said that he
hadn't finished it yet,

213
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,911
but why wouldn't the
face be drawn in?

214
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:08,726
[gasp]

215
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,429
-Look at that guy.

216
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:12,667
He kind of looks like Psi, huh?

217
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,502
Or am I crazy?

218
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,346
-You're right.

219
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,388
-Was he drawing himself?

220
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,328
-And then there's this
boy with the white hair.

221
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,931
Wonder who he is.

222
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,802
-Hmm.

223
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,606
[gulp]

224
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,579
-It's just, I haven't
finished it yet.

225
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,283
Anyway, I'm sorry.

226
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,855
I don't show it to other people.

227
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,996
It belongs to my older brother.

228
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,835
-It could be his brother.

229
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:44,637
Don't you think?

230
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,201
-Hmm?

231
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,016
-If you have a brother,
try and imagine

232
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,853
what it would feel
like to lose him.

233
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:55,992
Surely you should
be able to do that.

234
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,695
-Hmm?

235
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:58,931
Oh, yes, that.

236
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:05,512
Well, you see, my
brother is already dead.

237
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:06,815
-So.

238
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,652
These pages in the middle.

239
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,857
And the boys on the cover.

240
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,527
They're Psi and his brother.

241
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,058
-Shall we, then?

242
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:57,725
-Yes, sir.

243
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,165
-It's in there.

244
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,002
-His older brother.

245
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:35,741
Do you think?

246
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:36,710
-Could it be?

247
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,890
-Hmm?

248
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,795
-My clone's reporting in.

249
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,231
Looks like we've got a location.

250
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:50,106
[gasp]

251
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,108
-So, this is it.

252
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:53,614
Ready?

253
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:54,137
-Mm-hmm.

254
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,916
-(VOICEOVER) It's him.

255
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:23,464
-You're late.

[theme music - in japanese]

257
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,446
-What?

258
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,451
I'm sweating.

259
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:08,025
But I've always been
devoid of emotion.

260
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:12,434
And yet, with one look in
his eyes, the sense of dread

261
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:14,038
is palpable.

262
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,376
Like nothing I've ever known.

263
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,953
This is who Naruto has been
searching for all this time?

264
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:24,227
-Sasuke Uchiha.

-Notable People in
the Leaf Village.

268
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,607
Welcome to the first
of our two-part segment

269
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,777
on Sasuke Uchiha.

270
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:51,051
The epitome of cool,
Sasuke is a genius

271
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,123
who graduated at the
top of his class.

272
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:55,194
But his only
ambition was revenge

273
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,332
on the brother who
wiped out their clan.

274
00:22:57,366 --> 00:23:03,244
His polar opposite was Naruto,
and the two were often at odds.

275
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:05,016
-You are a complete loser!

276
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,618
-What the heck's your problem?

277
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,690
You should thank me for
coming in here to help you.

278
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:12,799
-At first, Naruto was no
match for Sasuke at all.

279
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:15,638
-You're not hurt, are you?

280
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:17,309
Scaredy-cat.

281
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:20,349
-But with his determination
and unpredictability,

282
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,286
he grew stronger.

283
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,455
-You're not hurt, are you?

284
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:25,426
You scaredy-cat.

285
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:26,762
-Until finally--

286
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:29,535
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

287
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,771
-Huh?

288
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:34,412
-And that's when the rivalry
between Naruto and Sasuke

289
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,713
truly began.

290
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,114
As for the rest of
their story, we'll

291
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:39,984
just have to wait
until next time.
