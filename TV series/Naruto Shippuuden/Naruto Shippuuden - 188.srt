{\an1}I guess that means the
both of you are big

and have now fallen under
a genjutsu.

{\an1}But my Lord--

174
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,229
{\an4}We chose this site
specifically because the
special magnetic field
that's created by the

175
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:39,133
{\an4}trees surrounding this
area greatly increases
the genjutsu power of the
Conch King.

179

{\an1}<i>Then it's just a matter</i>

184
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:19,210
{\an4}I'm sure they won't
find you guys here. Just
stay put until I come
back, all right?

185
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,346
But where are you going
to go, Tanishi?

186
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,317
{\an1}I can't let you go. You
could be killed if you go
back!

{\an1}I get it now. Finally.
You can't run away from
your problems.

188
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:33,125
But facing those
monsters...?! You're
acting like a fool!

189
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:34,494
{\an1}A fool?

190
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:40,033
{\an1}I'm a fool, and once I've
made up my mind, then I
never quit!

{\an1}That's right... I guess I
am a fool...

192
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:48,841
{\an4}If I ever give my word
and go back on it, then I
just wouldn't be true to
myself!

193
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:54,214
{\an7}I learned that from
the guy from the Hidden
Leaf... And I bet that
dad felt the same way, too!

194
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:58,687
{\an7}If we just do whatever
they tell us, then we'll
lose who we are.

195
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,755
Well said, Tanishi!

196
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:01,889
{\an1}Thanks, mom!

197
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:05,893
{\an1}I agree. You sure are

here?! Why didn't you
run away?!

00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:05,658
{\an5}I should let you know
that you're going to have
to take care of that big

you two escape from my

{\an1}<i>Easy! </i>

{\an4}It was never me; it was
just a shadow clone that
was under your genjutsu
from the beginning...

222
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:21,207
{\an1}Nice, Pervy Sage!

{\an1}You kidding?! I have
loads and loads of it!

225

Well then, let's begin
with the creature.

to work on that weird

already!

doesn't mean your

release a huge Rasengan,

00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:06,857

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,937
{\an1}Yeah, almost! But I still
need just a little more

290
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,574
{\an1}Are you goin'
batty or something?!

291
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,477
Now, come on. No need
to be so mean!

292
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,346
{\an1}Give your grandpa a hug!

293
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:11,350
{\an7}What do you think you're
doing? I mean, besides
being really creepy! Cut
it out!

294
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:12,351
Get off of me!

295
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,154
{\an1}Aw, don't be like that!

296
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:17,757
<i>Fine, then you can go</i>
<i>this way, and I'll take</i>
<i>another road, Pervy Sage!</i>

297
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,734
{\an1}<i>What? We're going to</i>
<i>catch another cat?! </i>

298
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:03,404
{\an1}<i>Not quite. You're</i>
<i>actually after Nekomata.</i>
<i>And your mission is not</i>

299
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:05,873
{\an1}<i>to capture him, but to</i>
<i>get a paw print from him.</i>

300
00:23:05,907 --> 00:23:10,846
{\an1}<i>Whatever it is, this is</i>
<i>just a D-rank mission, so</i>
<i>no thanks! Right, Sasuke?</i>

301
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,516
<i>You don't have to come</i>
<i>along if you don't want</i>
<i>to. This is an Uchiha-</i>

302
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,952
<i>No, wait; it's my</i>
<i>mission.</i>

303
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:21,657
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Sasuke's</i>
<i>Paw Encyclopedia.</i>

304
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,593
<i>I will complete this</i>
<i>mission, no matter what!</i>
