00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,758
Who'd have thought my
self-destructing clone would

3
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,261
prove useless as well?

00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,129
I think it's about
time I revealed

00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,430
my ultimate work of art.

6
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,672
Art is an explosion, ha!

7
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,589
-It worked.

8
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,490
Just in time.

9
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,103
-Then again, it did create
enough of a diversion for me

00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:10,671
to get away.

But all is not lost,
only up to the elbow.

15
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,268
I just have to find the
rest of it, and the ring.

member of the Akatsuki, huh?

-Me too.

87
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:21,598
But we must report back to
m'lady the Hokage right away.

-I see.

89
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,002
-Besides, if the Akatsuki
have managed to penetrate this

90
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,972
far into the sand, I'm worried
about the Leaf Village's

91
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,240
safety.

92
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:33,677
-I understand you want to
get back as soon as possible.

-Yes, exactly.

-Even so, in your condition?

-Don't worry.

96
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:41,885
I have comrades I can
rely on to get me there.

-He's right about that.

98
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,722
-By the way, we
already dispatched

99
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,191
the preliminary
report with Takemaru.

100
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,227
But there was no mention in it
of fates of the two Akatsuki

101

members.

102
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,564
Won't you want to
inform your village?

103
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,267
-I'll report that news
to the Hokage myself.

104
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,637
You see, there's something
else troubling me.

105

-Hmm?

106
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:28,665
-Lady Chiyo of the sand
was the only casualty.

The Kazekage has been returned
to his village safely.

108

Team Gai and Team Kakashi
have completed their missions,

109
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,139
and they're scheduled
to return to the Leaf

110

111
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:39,576

112
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:51,655
-M'lady, if I may?

113
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:52,956
-What is it?

114
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:55,959
-Despite the fact that this
mission was successful,

115
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,662
I was wondering if
Master Jiraiya wasn't

116
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:02,165
right to question the wisdom of
sending Naruto, a jinchuriki,

117
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,901
to face an enemy that we know
is on the hunt for the Tail

118

Beasts?

119
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,972
Even with a former ANBU
Black Ops member like Kakashi

120
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:12,709
along to protect him, wasn't it
taking an enormous risk sending

121
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:15,645
Naruto on such a mission?

122
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,550
-It's because Naruto is
what he is that I sent him.

123
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,819
The only one who can truly
understand a jinchuriki

124
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:26,723
is another jinchuriki.

125
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:31,094
Besides, Naruto's got
that mysterious power, one

126
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:34,030
that makes everyone he
meets want to bet on him.

127
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:44,574
-Is that?

128
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,209
-Lady Chiyo's resting place.

129
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,506
-She didn't want a
headstone on her grave.

130
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:23,713
But despite her
wishes, I thought

131
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:26,683
it was better to have one.

132
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:28,918
I felt sure that
people would want

133
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:33,490
s place to come to remember her.

134
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,191

very good at that stuff either,

So you want to see faster?

169
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:50,172
I'll show you faster.

170
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:50,772
Gangway!

171
00:17:56,678 --> 00:17:58,647
What's wrong, slow pokes?

172
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,915
Can't keep up with me?

173
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:00,916
Let's go!

174
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,790
-It looks even weirder
when they're in motion.

175
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:09,858
-Neji, forget it.

176
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,638
-Well, what do you know?

177
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:25,774
Looks like Deiter
has a goner, too.

178
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,909
Blew himself to bits
from the looks of it,

179
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,646
don't you think, Mister Zetsu?

180
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,149
There are probably body parts
scattered all over here.

181
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,951
-Get your hands
off that, you fool.

182
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:42,958
-Hey, he's alive.

183
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:48,964
-Where's the jinchuriki?

184
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:49,798
-Don't look at me.

185
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,800
I did my job.

186
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,968
-Dear, dear.

187
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,337
You must have had a
close shave, huh Deidara?

188
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,005
But you're in one piece.

189
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,275
Oops, sorry.

190
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,644
-Toby, even the
Buddha loses patience

191
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:03,979
when insulted a third time.

192
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,681
One more word, and
there'll be no doubt

193
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,949
about the cause of yours death.

194
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,419
-You're just going to
bomb me to death, right?

195
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:14,389
-That was the third one.

196
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:15,857
-Death by suffocation.

197
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,638
-I have made certain
that you will

198
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,940
be assigned to team Kakashi.

199
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,943
I've made arrangements.

200
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:38,347
Not only are you a close
to Naruto Uzumaki in age,

201
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,017
you are stronger than anyone of
your generation in the village.

202
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,953
Most important of
all, you possess

203
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,289
those incomparable
talents with a paintbrush.

204
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:53,695
From today until the
completion of your mission,

205
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:56,965
your name will be Sai.

206
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:58,367
-Sai.

207
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,201
Yes, I understand.

208
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:08,844
-And wipe that fake smile off
your face when you're with me.

209
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:09,911
-Forgive me.

210
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,813
If read that, in order
to win people over,

211
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:15,317
one must be able to smile.

212
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:19,921
I've been practicing, but,
creating facial expressions?

213
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:21,656
It's still quite
difficult for me.

[music playing]

219
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,856
-According to what
Sasori told me,

220
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,758
he had a spy in
Orochimaru's camp.

221
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,259
And he was to
rendezvous with him

222
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,228
at the Tenchi bridge
in the village hidden

223
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,763
in the grass in ten days.

224
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,898
-He could lead us to Orochimaru.

225
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:13,668
-Lady Tsunade, this
mission isn't over yet.

226
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:14,836
Let us finish it.

227
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,838
-And what makes you so
sure this information

228
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,706
he gave you isn't
bait for a trap?

229
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,208
-What if it is?

230
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:22,310
If it's a trap, then we fight.

231
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,413
We'll have to fight them
sooner or later anyway.

232
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:28,583
-Next time, "The New Target."

233
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:39,827
[music playing]

234
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:41,829
-To celebrate the
safe completion

235
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,166
of this multi-episode story arc,
I thought you deserved a party.

236
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,568
So everyone have fun!

237
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,270
-Thanks for all your
hard work, guys.

238
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,538
-Hey, thank you.

239
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,640
If you don't mind, what
are you thoughts now

240
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,275
that this story arc is over?

241
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:55,576
-What are my thoughts?

242
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,847
Well, um, I was hardly in it
after I get beaten by Sasori,

243
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:02,150
-How come I was kept
totally out of the action?

244
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:04,352
I didn't have a
single fight scene!

245
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:05,887
-Yeah, come to think
of it, you guys

246
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,556
were given all the
really juicy stuff.

247
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,690
-Well, it's not my fault.

248
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,426
That's not my department.

249
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,593
-Gaara.

250
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:15,696
How about putting in a
word or two on our behalf?

251
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:18,833
-Looks like I'm in
your debt again.

252
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,301
-It's nothing, don't mention it.

253
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,237
-Hey Naruto, next story arc?

254
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,173
We get double the
screen time you do.

255
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:26,741
-You better believe it.

256
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:27,775
-Huh?

257
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,544
I don't think you
guys are even in it.

258
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:30,478
-Huh?

259
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,280
-I heard you guys
are on a break.

260
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,750
You know, a hiatus
from the show.

261
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:36,918
[both together] Are you nuts?

262
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:40,288
Without us, this
show is nothing!
