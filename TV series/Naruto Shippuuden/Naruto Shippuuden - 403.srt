way that the more Shadow Clones
you try to make, the more chakra
you use up...

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,372
{\an1}Just how much chakra does Naruto
have?

Damn it...

00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,311
{\an1}It's no use. I'm just gonna have
to start with one and, then,
steadily increase the number.

Huh?

229
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:32,237
{\an1}We did it! We defeated those

of me!

00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:36,339
{\an1}No, Burami! Like I always say,
it's 'cause of our teamwork!

{\an1}Yeah! There's the tower! We did
it!

{\an1}What?! You?! How...?!

238
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:09,728
{\an1}We fooled you guys really good!
You didn't think we were dead,
did you?!

239
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,563
{\an1}Too bad for you, we're still
alive!

240
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:24,372
{\an1}I used the insects inside me to
make it seem like I was dead.

241
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:29,209
{\an1}And, Kiba and Hinata switched
places with Insect Clones.

{\an1}No way! We've been had!

243
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:37,214
{\an1}Yeah, but even so...How were you
guys able to track us?!

244
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,183
{\an1}And, why didn't you catch their
scent before now?!

245
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:43,685
{\an1}Our scent was contained. The
reason is...

246
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,689
{\an1}You used your insects to make
airtight suits?!

[chuckle]

248

[gasp]

250
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:58,662
{\an1}But, but, but, but...I made sure
that I'd erased our scent, too!

251
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,532
{\an1}I still don't get how they were
able to track us!

252
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:03,865
{\an1}We didn't follow your scent!

253
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:04,699
[gasp]

254
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,735
{\an1}The scent that I followed was
this one right here!

255
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,372
{\an1}You see, there's this guy named
Naruto...

{\an1}I've never heard of him! Who is
he?!

257
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,041
{\an1}I'm just saying he exists!

258
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:19,810
{\an1}Anyway,...he kept on popping
into my head.

{\an1}<i>I thought it was strange...But,</i>

{\an1}This scent reminded me of that
training,...

266
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:47,463
{\an1}...and it even brought back
memories I didn't want to think
about, like Naruto...!

267
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,965
{\an1}[chuckle] But in that memory, he
told me not to give up, no
matter what.

because...

303
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:05,591
{\an1}That's because Naruto reminded
us never to give up, is that it?
Come on!

304
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:06,659
{\an1}[sniffing]

305
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,794
{\an1}I'm the one who thought of
Naruto and tracked that guy with
this scent!

306
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,728
{\an1}<i>It was all 'cause of me!</i>

307
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:15,431
{\an1}Well,...I still think that
Naruto-

308
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:17,399
{\an1}No, you're wrong. It was me!

309
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:18,999
{\an1}[bark]

310
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,235
{\an1}Yeah! You did great too!

311
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:23,570
{\an1}[howl]

312
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,370
{\an1}<i>It is so convenient having you</i>
<i>around, Tenten!</i>

313
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:05,206
{\an1}<i>What's that mean?! I may have</i>
<i>convenient tools, but I am not a</i>
<i>convenient tool, okay?</i>

314
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,341
{\an1}<i>No, no , Tenten! You are</i>
<i>absolutely convenient!</i>

315
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,209
{\an1}<i>Seriously?!</i>

316
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:10,677
{\an1}<i>Hey, Tenten...</i>

317
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,877
{\an1}<i>Don't follow me!</i>

318
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:13,379
{\an1}<i>What just happened?!</i>

319
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,046
{\an1}<i>I've no idea...</i>

320
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:19,049
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"Tenten's Troubles."</i>

321
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:19,949
{\an1}[sigh] <i>Guess I just needed to</i>
<i>vent a bit...</i>
