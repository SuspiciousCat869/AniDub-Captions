1
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:16,307
{\an1}They say you take your
personality to the grave...
I've already died once.

2
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,176
{\an1}I plan to honor it.

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,379
{\an1}The estranged brothers come
together to stop me!

4
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,581
How exciting!

5
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:23,513
{\an1}Don't stare at me. Bookish
types like me like me aren't
used to being stared at.

6
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,214
{\an1}A genjutsu countermeasure.

7
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:33,320
{\an4}The way those snakes are
moving, they can sense
exactly what the two of us
are.

8
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:38,757
{\an4}Well, some snakes are able
to perceive body heat, and
they can smell the air by
using their tongues.

9
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,794
{\an1}It seems you've studied a
lot! You're like a snake
expert.

10
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:46,931
{\an1}Heh! Of course I did. I had
to take down Orochimaru.

11
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:51,269
{\an1}However, being a snake
expert will not help you
take me down.

12
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:55,971
{\an1}I chose this battlefield.
And Nature is my ally.

13
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,775
{\an7}<i>The snakes are bigger!</i>

14
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:04,112
{\an1}Watch for traps. The terrain
gives him an edge, Sasuke.

15
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,349
{\an1}Traps? Oh, no! That's
not what I meant!

16
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,716
Susano'o, huh?

17
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:38,874
{\an1}Too aggressive, Sasuke!
Remember, we can't kill him.

18
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,776
{\an1}It seems that he's acquired
Orochimaru's power.

19
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,646
He won't go down
as easy as that!

20
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:48,416
Sasuke!

21
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:49,916
{\an1}The hood, I know!

22
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,153
What's that?!

23
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:58,756
Why you!

24
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:09,032
{\an1}You're taking this
bookish thing a
little too far.

25
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:12,669
{\an1}First, you hide your face,
and now your entire body,
Kabuto?

26
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,911
You've shed your
skin to get away?

27
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:28,515
{\an1}All you have you took from
Orochimaru. You're still
nothing!

28
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,818
Sasuke... you
underestimate me.

29
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:38,756
{\an4}Well, then again, I was
listed lower than you on the
danger scale in the Bingo
Book...

30
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,293
{\an1}And of course, I'm nothing
compared to Lord Orochimaru.

31
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:46,796
{\an1}That's for sure. Especially
if this is what you consider
hiding.

32
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,032
{\an1}Sasuke! Be careful!

33
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,767
{\an1}There are pieces of his
chakra everywhere...

34
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,538
{\an1}There's no telling which of
them's the real thing.

35
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,311
{\an1}It's the ability to
transform one's flesh
into liquid.

36
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:10,416
{\an4}To detach and separate using
one's own life substance.
That's why it looks like
shedding.

37
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:16,087
{\an4}I've researched and applied
the Hozuki Clan's Flesh
Transforming ability to this
technique.

38
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:20,424
{\an1}You know who I mean,
right? Suigetsu.

39
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:25,428
{\an1}He can transform from human
to water and back to human
again.

40
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:30,265
{\an1}Plus, I have the amazing
ability to recuperate
quickly.

41
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,803
{\an4}I'll admit, it's a healing
technique that I studied
from the body of a woman
originally of the

42
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,673
Uzumaki Clan....

43
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:41,275
{\an1}Someone you're quite
familiar with... Karin.

44
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,843
{\an1}Karin's actually from the
Uzumaki Clan?

45
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,548
{\an1}A special trait of those
with Uzumaki blood is their
red hair.

46
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,384
And their life
force is as tenacious
as a cockroach's.

47
00:05:52,751 --> 00:06:00,023
{\an4}Now then, that leaves one
last member of your little
team. You're probably
thinking of him right now.

48
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,560
{\an1}Or perhaps you are
no longer comrades?

49
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:08,798
{\an1}At any rate, you have a
discerning eye to have
chosen those three.

50
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:14,502
{\an1}In the Shinobi World, those
without talent are nothing.

51
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:21,675
{\an4}But then those who lack
talent can just steal it
from those who do possess
it!

52
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,612
{\an1}Do you have Jugo's
abilities, too? You seem to...

53
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,481
{\an1}Did you receive a Curse
Mark from Orochimaru?!

54
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,782
No!

55
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,952
{\an1}That thing is just a
temporary boost.

56
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:38,489
{\an1}This power is something I
actually mastered myself...

57
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,758
...at Ryuchi Cave!

58
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,526
Ryuchi Cave?!

59
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,860
Can't be!

60
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:51,933
{\an4}Yes, that's right! I found
it! A place as legendary as
Mt. Myoboku and the
Shikkotsu Woods!

61
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:58,405
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru is not the
only one to have reached it!

62
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:04,577
{\an1}I trained under the White
Snake Sage and awakened this
ability!

63
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:09,547
{\an1}I was finally able to
surpass Lord Orochimaru!

64
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,083
I did it!

65
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,604
{\an1}Wait, Sasuke! Be patient!

66
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,278
Ah-ah-ah!

67
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,782
{\an1}He dodged it?! The
Susano'o arrow?!

68
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:58,555
{\an4}My sensory ability is far
better than it used to be.
Nature Energy is my ally
now, as I mentioned before.

69
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,623
{\an8}<i>Nature Energy?</i>

70
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,725
{\an7}<i>So he does have it.</i>

71
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:13,767
{\an4}Just listen; I'll explain...
The members of Jugo's Clan
have always had special
bodies that are able to

72
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,903
{\an1}absorb Nature Energy.

73
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:21,707
{\an4}That's the secret behind
those rampages. The ability
causes them to suddenly
become more

74
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,242
{\an1}powerful and wild.

75
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:32,415
{\an4}Lord Orochimaru wasn't
interested in Jugo's
rampages so much as in the
origin of his Clan's power.

76
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:42,023
{\an4}He finally tracked down the
source of the power. And its
wellspring was the Ryuchi
Cave.

77
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:47,829
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru immediately
tried to acquire that power.

78
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,667
{\an1}However, he didn't yet
possess a body that could
tolerate it.

79
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,435
That's why....

80
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:06,678
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru was not able
to become the perfect Sage...

81
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,280
{\an1}...not like the one I have now
become! [chuckle]

82
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,584
{\an1}I see... as I thought,
you're using Sage Mode!

83
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:20,088
{\an1}You're just like Orochimaru!
You're just a disgusting
snake!

84
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:24,024
{\an1}You ought to know
better, snake expert.

85
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,660
{\an1}I'm no longer a snake.

86
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:31,231
{\an1}My Sage power has allowed
me to shed that skin...

87
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:35,067
{\an1}And I'm now a dragon!

88
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:07,928
{\an4}Well, answer me! Would you
like all of these clones to
use Susano'o or wouldn't
you? It's your choice.

89
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,732
{\an1}None of you have any
answers at all, do you?

90
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,901
[growling]

91
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:18,236
{\an1}Then I'll have to provide
an answer for you.

92
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,342
Can't be!

93
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,878
Damn him...

94
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:37,385
They'll use it.

95
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,123
Damn them...

96
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,392
Each of us must
take on five...

97
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,726
{\an1}It's five to one...

98
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,628
Not quite. It's
twenty-five to five.

99
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,463
Lord Tsuchikage?

100
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:57,135
{\an4}We're not alone! We'll guard
each other's backs and
coordinate our attacks. We
are the Five Kage!

101
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:58,469
-Yes!
-Okay!
-That's right!

102
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,004
Let's go!

103
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,753
{\an1}It seems the Five Kage are
struggling against Madara.

104
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,855
{\an1}The chakra's unbelievable!

105
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,192
{\an1}He's not just a legendary
shinobi, he's also been
reanimated.

106
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,161
{\an1}He's immortal, which means
he has infinite chakra.

107
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:32,664
{\an1}It's no wonder they're
having a hard time against
him.

108
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:36,267
{\an1}We have to do something
about the user of this
Reanimation Jutsu.

109
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,569
{\an1}Any word from the
Investigative Unit?

110
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:43,138
{\an4}Nothing so far. They've been
searching every location
that's thought to be a
hideout.

111
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,342
{\an1}But they haven't found one
sign of Kabuto yet.

112
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,243
Sensory Unit?

113
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:53,348
{\an4}We're getting no response to
any of our attempts. So he's
probably put up some kind of
barrier.

114
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,148
{\an1}Shall I deploy more shinobi?

115
00:11:55,182 --> 00:12:00,454
{\an4}We've sent every man that's
available. Any more will
weaken our efforts at the
front.

116
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,566
[groan]

117
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:22,472
{\an1}Who would've imagined
Kabuto could do so much?

118
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:28,243
Sage Art: White
Extreme Attack!

119
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,859
{\an1}[painful screaming]

120
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:51,763
{\an7}<i>My ears... My bones! They</i>
<i>feel like they're being</i>
<i>pulverized!</i>

121
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,698
{\an7}<i>This jutsu uses light and</i>
<i>sound to knock out vision</i>
<i>and hearing...</i>

122
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:59,535
{\an7}<i>It causes the air to</i>
<i>oscillate, to paralyze the</i>
<i>senses, freezing you in</i>
<i>place...</i>

123
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:09,144
{\an7}<i>With my snake eyes, I can</i>
<i>shut my sight off and block</i>

124
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:11,712
{\an7}<i>simply flow with sound</i>
<i>and vibration!</i>

125
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:16,249
{\an7}<i>Thanks to my Sage powers,</i>

126
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,853
{\an7}<i>It's no use! I can't</i>

127
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:26,425
{\an7}<i>I need to go after Itachi...</i>
<i>I'll rewrite the Paper Seal</i>
<i>in his head and make him my</i>
<i>pawn again.</i>

128
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,127
{\an7}<i>Or even better...</i>

129
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:45,074
{\an1}Itachi... Somehow you always
seem to find me, don't you?

130
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,044
{\an1}Are you sensing my chakra?

131
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,448
{\an1}But... wait a minute, here.

132
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:58,584
{\an1}I'm impressed you were able
to pass through my barrier
and find this place.

133
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:04,355
{\an4}Back when you were still
controlling me, I was able
to pinpoint where your
chakra was coming from.

134
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,458
Yet another risk
of this jutsu.

135
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:12,528
{\an1}Hold on, I remember you said
something about "back when I
was still controlling you..."

136
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:17,667
{\an1}So now that I'm not doing
that any longer, you can't
sense my chakra, can you?

137
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,903
{\an1}Are you trying to fool me
with your lies again?

138
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:27,041
{\an1}I was never the one who
could do that. I couldn't
sense your chakra.

139
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:32,679
{\an4}Only Nagato was able to do
that, and he relayed the
information to me. I have no
such ability.

140
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:41,754
{\an1}Besides, I know what your
target is anyway. I do have
instincts, you know.

141
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,355
{\an1}I merely protect that which
I think you'll most want to
attack.

142
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:50,694
{\an4}If a man as cautious and
opportunistic as you wants
Sasuke... You'll go for him
first!

143
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:58,266
{\an4}Your best chance to capture
Sasuke is now, before either
of us figures out your
jutsu. And then

144
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,369
{\an1}after that, you can use my
brother to try to stop me.

145
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:10,710
{\an4}What sets you apart the most
from the rest of your Uchiha
Clan brethren is that you
have true Visual Prowess...

146
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,247
{\an1}You can peer right into
people's souls and read
them.

147
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,183
{\an1}And then use what you learn
against them in battle.

148
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:22,087
{\an1}That is why you are so good
at deceiving people.

149
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,422
{\an1}You died a genius!
A genius at lying!

150
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,562
{\an7}<i>Agh! He's on the ceiling!</i>

151
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:41,469
{\an4}You truly think that a
makeshift team of two people
who hate each other can
outwit my perception

152
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:42,937
{\an1}skills and stop me?

153
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:49,642
{\an4}And because your brother
lied so much, you really
know nothing about him and
you will never trust each other.

154
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:54,914
Sasuke...

155
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,049
{\an1}Do you remember the time
that you tagged along with
me on my mission?

156
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,086
The wild boar?

157
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:07,924
I'm heading out!

158
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,560
[gasp] It's you.

159
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:14,396
{\an1}Oh yeah, that, I remember.

160
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,498
A wild boar?

161
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,837
I'm heading out!

162
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,074
It's you!

163
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,612
{\an1}Word is you're going on a
boar hunt, Big Brother!

164
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:47,356
{\an1}I heard that it's incredibly
huge! As big as a monster!

165
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,659
{\an1}It's bad 'cause it's tearing
up the fields and ruining
them!

166
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:54,429
{\an1}That's why you're going on
the mission, to take it
down, aren't you?

167
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,165
{\an1}And you're doing it by
yourself, isn't that right?

168
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,034
{\an1}But don't worry, it'll be
okay, 'cause I'm gonna come
with you, too!

169
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:03,203
You know, right?

170
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,905
{\an1}That I'm a really
good archer?

171
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:09,909
{\an1}Well, you should know! We've
been hunting together a
bunch of times before.

172
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:17,715
Huh?

173
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:22,886
Sorry, Sasuke.

174
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:24,687
Some other time.

175
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:27,556
No!

176
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,157
Big Brother!

177
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,494
{\an1}Big Brother, wait!

178
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:37,430
[roaring]

179
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:47,472
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

180
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:49,341
{\an1}I'm surprised you caught up
with me.

181
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,043
{\an1}Yeah, well, I've been
training...

182
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,114
Climb up here.

183
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,185
That's it, huh?

184
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,687
Don't kill him.

185
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,487
What?

186
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,489
Just hurt him,
and he'll leave.

187
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:09,758
Let's go.

188
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,859
Yeah.

189
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,296
{\an1}Avoid vital spots.

190
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,367
I got it!

191
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:43,886
Right now!

192
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:01,633
{\an1}Watch out! He's going to
steal my blade and cut off
his own tail to escape!

193
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:17,113
{\an1}That's why he told you
not to be so impatient.

194
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,272
{\an1}Oh, yeah. That's right,
these things are new...

195
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:52,608
{\an1}I totally forgot that I have
these horns up here now. Oh,
well

196
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:13,159
[roaring]

197
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,362
[screaming]

198
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:39,415
Big Brother!

199
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:46,920
{\an1}You completely missed,
Sasuke.

200
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,822
{\an1}Sorry, Big Brother...

201
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:51,024
{\an1}It seems you need
to do more training.

202
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,261
{\an1}Let's go home, Sasuke.

203
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,998
{\an1}And I'll help you
train when we get back.

204
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,866
Okay!

205
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:10,139
{\an1}It looks like now you might
be able to kill that boar.

206
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,347
{\an1}Except instead of a giant
wild boar, I need to take
down that snake.

207
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:20,482
Yeah...

208
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:00,796
{\an1}<i>I can sympathize with</i>
<i>Itachi. I understand his</i>
<i>choice.</i>

209
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,067
{\an1}<i>Both Itachi and I worked for</i>
<i>the good of the Hidden Leaf,</i>
<i>but in return all that we</i>

210
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,802
{\an1}<i>got back was dishonor</i>
<i>and disgrace!</i>

211
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:10,705
{\an1}<i>What has the Leaf Village</i>
<i>ever done for us?</i>

212
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:15,342
{\an1}<i>No matter what darkness or</i>
<i>contradictions lie within</i>
<i>the village, I'm...</i>

213
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:19,580
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "To Each Their</i>
<i>Own Leaf."</i>

214
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,782
<i>I'm still Itachi</i>
<i>Uchiha of the Leaf!</i>
