1
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,844
-Well.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,137
-Don't worry.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,973
Yukimaru's power
should be just fine.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,726
The drug just needs
to be modified a bit.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,020
-When will that be completed?

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,314
-Oh, not much longer, I imagine.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,649
-Lovely.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,444
Then tell Guren and Yukimaru
I want them to go on ahead.

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,365
-I know I'm repeating myself,
but are you sure about her?

10
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,574
-Hmm.

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,660
We've got no choice
in the matter.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,828
She's the only one who
is capable of achieving

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,790
the task at hand.

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,669
When Guren and Yukimaru's powers
are joined together as one,

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,422
the seeds that I have sown
will finally bear fruit.

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:00:59,977
-Hmm.

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,567
-How long are you
planning to make me wait?

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,568
-Hmm.

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,528
Not a second longer, actually.

20
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,363
I've come with our
Lord's order for you.

21
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:11,905
-Really?

22
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,907
Is that true?

23
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:14,866
-(VOICEOVER) So naive.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,377
Yukimaru.

25
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,882
[giggling]

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,259
-Are we returning somewhere?

27
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,886
Is it someplace I can return to?

28
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,597
-Who is this little runt?

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,849
-You're taking this
child with you.

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,392
Hate to break it to you.

31
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,893
-What the heck do I look like?

32
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,312
A babysitter?

33
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,646
-Hmm.

34
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,898
Complaining already, huh?

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,277
Is your loyalty to Lord
Orochimaru so thin?

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,695
With that kind of
attitude, you'll

37
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,406
be lucky if the child
deigns to take you.

38
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,284
[sigh]

39
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,243
-Huh?

40
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:58,744
Ah!

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,042
Ah!

42
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,002
[gasp]

43
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,213
-Do you think it means something
that you're Orochimaru's lap

44
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,381
dog?

45
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,259
I can kill you the moment
the mood strikes me.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,346
-(VOICEOVER) So she can
crystallize anything she wants

47
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,598
to, seemingly unarmed.

48
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,267
But everything around
her can be her weapon.

49
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,853
So that's the Crystal Style.

50
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:29,316
No wonder she caught
Lord Orochimaru's eye.

51
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,276
Kill me and it's all over.

52
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,155
Your dreams of reanimation
will evaporate.

53
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,949
You wish to become one
with our Lord, don't you?

54
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,450
-Hmm.

55
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,208
-Pretty!

56
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,544
-Just what are you
playing at, Kabuto?

57
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,755
-Isn't it going to rain anymore?

58
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,756
-Huh.

59
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,258
You're a weird little
guy, aren't you?

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,469
[laughter] You'll make
a good pair, then.

61
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,470
[growl]

62
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,847
-Um-- I'll catch up
with you shortly.

63
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,141
You and Yukimaru go on ahead.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,059
[sigh]

65
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,477
-All right.

66
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,689
But I'm telling you, if he gets
wise with me, he'll regret it.

67
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,023
-Use caution.

68
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,693
We've detected a few people
out on the perimeter.

69
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,944
-Wait a minute.

70
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,862
How would you know
something like that?

71
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,614
-I didn't tell you, did I?

72
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,243
On the way to your hideout, I
took care of an ANBU Black Ops

73
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,121
member who happened to be
poking about in the area.

74
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,665
The Leaf village will
be on the move by now.

75
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,166
They'll just complicate things.

76
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,001
I suggest you avoid them.

77
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,295
-I think I'll be
the judge of that.

78
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,132
-If you fail in this
mission with Yukimaru,

79
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,010
all talk of reanimation
will be off the table.

80
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,928
Don't forget that.

81
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:54,317
[theme music - in japanese]

82
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,630
-(VOICEOVER) The
Hidden Leaf, huh?

83
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,340
[gasp] Impossible.

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,633
Could they have switched sides?

85
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,849
-Am I finally going home?

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,602
I really hope so.

87
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:57,899
But then, maybe there's no
place for me to return to.

88
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,026
-Because wherever someone
is still thinking of you,

89
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,654
that place is your home.

90
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,822
-There is a place.

91
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,031
I'm sure of it!

92
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,423
-Look at these.

93
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,509
A dog did this.

94
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,677
-Huh?

95
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,888
-A dog, huh?

96
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,889
(VOICEOVER) This is bad.

97
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,280
-They've grown so weak.

98
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,656
I can't feel any response.

99
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,060
Found one.

[scratching noise]

Good.

102
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,412
She has eggs.

103
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:40,293
If I can get them to hatch--

104
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,384
-Where's the sense in that?

105
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,970
You're telling me the
sons of the Chief Toad

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,388
can't use Water Style?

107
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,765
How does that work?

00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,432
-Liquid Bullets!

Style is out of this world!

-Oh, give it a rest, will you?

111
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,985
If we can't do it,
we can't do it.

112
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,736
You whine a lot, don't you?

00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,196
-Oh, yeah?

114
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,114
-Yeah.

115
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,407
All right.

You really get what
I'm saying here.

-Well, if you don't want
nothing to do with me,

I don't want nothing
to do with you.

over, because I quit.

Mmm.

00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
Mmmmm.

132
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,474
-All right.

133
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,560
I'll train with Gamatatsu.

134
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,144
Whatever.

135
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,145
Are you happy?

136
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,604
-Done and done.

137
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,399
Long as everybody's on
the same page, right?

138
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,069
-So, how do Water-Style
jutsu work, then?

-Uh, um--

00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,196
-Ah, jeez.

141
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,782
Well, I wasn't really expecting
the third degree here, uh-

-Hmm.

I got it!

145
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,872
If it's Water Style,
we should start

146
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,498
by drinking a bunch of it!

147
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,624
-That sounds good!

148
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,667
-Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,044
That's got to be it, huh?

150
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:04,544
-What?

151
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,014
[sigh]

152
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,405
-You really think there
are enemies out there?

153
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,782
-I'm sure of it.

154
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
They're up in the
mountains somewhere.

155
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,577
-So, who are they?

156
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,495
-I don't know.

157
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,913
But if they're
out here searching

158
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,584
for Orochimaru's hideout,
they're Leaf ninja or Akatsuki.

00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
-What should we do?

160
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,212
Go on the attack?

161
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,797
-I don't think so, Nurari.

162
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,590
Without Guren,
there's no guarantee

163
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,342
that we can pull it off.

164
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,593
-Guess I was wrong.

165
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,302
- Hmm?

166
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,261
About what?

167
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,931
-I figured you'd
make a go of it.

168
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,767
Use the confusion
to cut and run.

169
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,435
-What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,271
-This is your shot at
fleeing to the Leaf village,

171
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,482
offering up Orochimaru.

172
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,316
-Ha.

173
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,859
Now I follow you.

174
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,486
It never even occurred
to me, though.

175
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm in this for the long haul.

176
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,739
Hmm.

177
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,282
You thinking of
heading over there?

178
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,784
Turning yourself in?

179
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,036
-I'm here to stay, same as you.

180
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,872
-Why are you sticking
around with Guren, anyway?

181
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,624
It doesn't add up.

182
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,418
-My reasons are personal.

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,919
-Well.

184
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,637
-Man.

185
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,141
If I were traveling on my own,
I'd already be there by now.

186
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,983
-I don't want to go anymore.

187
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,610
My head is starting to ache.

188
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,906
I-- I don't think--
I should go back.

189
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,076
But I've nowhere
to return home to.

190
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,871
That person told me as long
as you have someone thinking

191
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,332
about you, you'll always
have a home to go back to.

192
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,210
Wherever that person
is, is where you belong.

193
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,301
Although I'm not really
sure how I would do that,

194
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,386
you know, get someone
to think about me.

195
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,512
-Ugh.

196
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,183
Quit babbling, will you,
and pick up the pace.

197
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,185
(VOICEOVER) What
is with this kid?

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,860
[quiet gasping]

199
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,876
-So, do you prefer the white
camellias over the red?

200
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,464
-Camellias!

201
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:54,964
-Camellias?

202
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,718
Like that one.

203
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:03,890
-Oh.

204
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,349
Yeah.

205
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,849
Right.

206
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,018
I forgot.

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,561
-Do you like camellias?

208
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,564
-Do I like them?

209
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,567
I don't care one
way or the other.

210
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,693
It's just a flower.

211
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,490
[quiet gasp]

212
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,992
[gasp]

213
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:23,993
-Hey.

214
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,994
What's the matter?

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,422
[gasping]

216
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,926

00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,984
(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

219
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,152
Can't bring him back to
Orochimaru's in this rain.

220
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,325
[whimpering]

221
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,827
-I'm freezing.

222
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,328
-Wha-- what's wrong?

223
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,162
Are you feeling cold?

224
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,084
Oh.

225
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:13,918
You're burning up.

226
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,148
-You wanted to see me?

227
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,566
-Yes, that's right.

228
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,360
I'd like you to head out
and aid Team Kakashi.

229
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,695
-Kakashi?

230
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,947
I heard it was nothing
more than a search mission.

231
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,699
Did something happen
out there, my lady?

232
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,534
-They had a bit
of a run-in, which

233
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,536
is where things get prickly.

234
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,789
Their foe used a jutsu
we've never seen.

235
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,458
-One we've never seen?

236
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,252
-The details are still
sketchy right now.

237
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,504
Kakashi managed to
get a sample back,

238
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,132
and I'm having it
analyzed as we speak.

239
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,092
-So who shall I take with me?

240
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,095
-Well, Sai can get
a bird's-eye view.

241
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,557
And you should take Sakura
in case anyone was injured.

242
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,935
Although Sakura is running an
errand for me at the moment.

243
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,146
I'm expecting her back by dawn.

244
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,857
As soon as she returns,
you're to head out.

245
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,983
-Understood.

246
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,277
My lady, what about Naruto?

247
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,237
If Orochimaru's
involved here, then--

248
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,364
-Now, listen.

249
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,949
Naruto is not to find
out about any of this.

250
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,541
-How'd it go?

251
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,834
Any leads?

252
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,836
-I wasn't able to find anything.

253
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,588
-Same here, unfortunately.

254
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,091
There's not much we can really
do in weather like this.

255
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,885
Makes it almost impossible
to pick up a scent.

256
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,719
[sigh]

257
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,514
-Not what I was hoping for.

258
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,431
-Oh!

259
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,808
Grr.

260
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,102
Even the bats are
taking shelter.

261
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,395
[gasp]

262
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,729
-The bats!

263
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,148
-I'll go out and take
one more look around.

264
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,066
-Wait a minute!

265
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,651
Don't go.

266
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,276
-Why?

267
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,653
What is it, Kiba?

268
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,406
-Well, I haven't been able to
stop thinking about that dog

269
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,615
whistle for some time now.

270
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,909
-The dog whistle that you heard?

271
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:10,451
-Yeah.

272
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,786
And it hit me.

273
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,664
There's another animal that
uses ultrasonic frequency.

274
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,792
Right there.

275
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,627
-Hmm.

276
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,045
Gotcha.

277
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,631
So the enemy is
manipulating a bat.

278
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,550
-But how do we know which one?

279
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,592
-I don't know.

280
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,261
It's kind of hard
to say right now,

281
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,971
but we better
proceed with caution,

282
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,099
or we'll be opening ourselves
up to the enemy's detection.

283
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,643
In fact, they may have
spotted us already.

284
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,188
-Once that crystal sample is
analyzed back at the village,

285
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,650
we'll have some idea
of what to do next.

286
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,319
Right now, our hope
lies in Shino's insects.

you hear me, kid?

289
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,847
Just hang in there.

290
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,399
-She's late.

291
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,026
What's keeping her?

292
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,319
-Yeah.

293
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,945
She ought to be back by now.

brought Rinji and Gozu with me.

out on the perimeter.

am I doing here?

[giggle]

334
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:11,293
-Let's go.

335
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:31,188
[theme music - in japanese]

336
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,695
-Are these the hatchlings
you were talking about?

337
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,905
-Great.

338
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,949
So now we can take on
that crystal jutsu, right?

339
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,244
-There's a good probability
they'll be resistant.

340
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,203
However--

341
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,413
-You don't have
enough for combat.

342
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,790
-Damn it.

343
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,167
I thought we'd finally come
up with a way to counter them.

344
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,168
-No.

345
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,795
It's too early to
give up just yet.

346
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,879
-Huh?

347
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,256
-You have a plan?

348
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,173
-Yes.

349
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,801
I just need a little time.

350
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,302
-Next time.

351
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,012
The Two Charms.
