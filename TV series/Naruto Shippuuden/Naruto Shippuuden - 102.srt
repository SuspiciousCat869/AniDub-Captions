NARUTO: Am I glad to
see you, Bushy Brow!

00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,480
‐That is right.

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,817
Now that I am here, you
all have nothing to fear.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,018
‐Hold on.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,285
You're not alone here, pal.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,155
Don't get ahead of yourself.

8

‐Huh.

00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,792
Well, it looks like you
can relax now, Sakura.

‐You talk a big game, as
always, but you're still

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,064
just a medical ninjutsu amateur.

12
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,298
‐Hey, what did you say?

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,234
For someone who's only
studied a little more than me,

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,902
you sure are cocky.

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,972
‐Well, at least you acknowledge
that I've been studying longer.

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,107
‐Not that it's made
any difference.

17
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,243

Nobody's had the

‐Oh, no you didn't.

SAKURA: Back off!

24
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,821
‐So their nicknames are
Billboard Brow and Ino Pig.

25
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:55,822

the basics of the situation,

35
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:15,048
but I'll need you to fill
in some of the details.

36

a new development.

‐We'll explain over there.

41
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,644
KAKASHI: We encountered
four shinobi

42
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,747
who can all move freely
inside a smokescreen.

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,715
Then there's the
big guy I fought

44
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:50,917
and a Crystal Style user.

45
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:53,253
‐We found them at
the lake, and we

46
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,822
suspect they were dealing
with the Three‐Tails.

47
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:56,890
‐Thank you.

48
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:59,560
We had gathered as
much from our intel.

49
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:02,969
Well then, we'd better get to
work on sealing it quickly.

50
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,905
If the enemy gets the
Three‐Tails' power,

51
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,540
we're all but finished.

52
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,809
‐Actually, there's
something else.

53
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:10,577
A new wrinkle in things.

54
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:11,978
‐Huh?

55
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,681
‐Naruto witnessed a child
while he was at the lake,

56
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:20,153
and he claims that the child has
control over the tailed beast.

57
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,187
‐Impossible.

58
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,625
A human who can
control a tailed beast?

59
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:27,127
‐What's more, Naruto later
encountered the child

60
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,029
alongside the
Crystal Style user.

61
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:30,831
SHIZUNE: What's
their relationship?

‐They're close.

63
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,468
Like Naruto said, the
Crystal Style user

64
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:38,104
is the place where
that child will return.

65
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,874
‐Just who exactly is this child?

66
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,977
I thought the Three‐Tails
didn't have a jinchuriki.

67
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,278
‐Well, not yet.

68
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,614
After all, this is Orochimaru.

69
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:52,085
His goal may be to make that
child into a jinchuriki.

70
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,320
‐This thing just keeps
getting worse, doesn't it?

RINJI: We knew we had
to deal with human foes,

75
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:47,280
but no one said anything
about a tailed beast.

‐Yeah, no kidding.

That thing caused a massive
flood just by appearing.

us to run away now.

you, we need to think

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,603
of a way we can make a
break for it, and quick.

If you're going to
make a report to Guren,

95
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,472
I guess I'll tag along with you.

I can't trust you.

‐That so?

Well, I can't change
how you think of me.

‐Just tell me, you
gonna betray Guren?

My next move depends
on your answer.

‐Gozu, despite
what you may think,

103
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,337
my loyalties are with Guren.

know that for sure?

but what do you
think I'm doing here?

108
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:23,890
I left my sick kid sister
behind in the village.

109
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,762
And in order to keep
her safe and healthy,

110
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,330
I need to have money.

111
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:35,235
So as you can see, if I don't
survive, she won't, either.

112
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,571
Then again, whether you
think you can trust me or not

113
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:38,905
is completely up to you.

Oh.

Hey, how would you like to

‐Guren?

121
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,653
She's merely a sacrificial
pawn to our powerful master.

you're doing to him?

‐‐[laughs] Just giving the
boy a little discipline.

If anything truly
bad happened to him,

134
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,284
I would suffer the most.

135
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:56,523
And I don't intend on making
Lord Orochimaru angry.

136
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:59,726
The boy wasn't even
able to talk properly.

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,536
I'm astounded at how
much you've taught him.

‐If you ever lay so much as
a finger on Yukimaru again,

I will show you no mercy.

‐Hmff.

with you, right, Guren?

You believe her?

At first she was totally
hung up on Lord Orochimaru.

And now it's the
same with this kid.

I just hope it doesn't
interfere with her mission.

But just in case, I want you
to continue watching the girl.

were the one reporting directly

00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,922
to Lord Orochimaru?

163
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,123
‐Hm?

164
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,325
What are you saying?

165
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,028
‐Just that I've done a
lot of undesirable tasks

166
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,896
under your command.

167
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,666
I posed as a convict
at that prison,

168
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,801
got all friendly with
those inmates to send you

169
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,870
information on the outside.

170
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:39,840
That was pretty dangerous work.

171
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:41,642
And even this current job.

172
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:44,210
The only reason they're
getting all of this data

173
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:46,346
is because I'm putting
my life on the line

174
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,815
to acquire it for you.

175
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,817
‐What are you getting at?

176
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,285
‐Come on, you're a smart guy.

177
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:53,687
It's simple.

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,322
I just want to be
valued a little more.

179
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,024
‐Looking for a deal, are you?

180
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,192
‐Not at all.

181
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,227
I don't want anything.

182
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:05,471
You may give me my orders, but
I don't work under you, Kabuto.

183
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,575
The only one I serve
is Lord Orochimaru.

184
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,743
‐Ahhh.

185
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,977
‐Yeah.

186
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,013
All I want is for
Lord Orochimaru

187
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,248
himself to recognize
my diligence.

188
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,221
Besides, in this
situation, I'm the only one

189
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,324
can get Kigiri, Kiho,
and Nurari to act.

190
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,795
I'd even venture to say that
I have more power than you.

191
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,032
What I mean is if something
awful were to happen to you

192
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,068
and a Leaf Ninja somehow
managed to kill you,

193
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,738
wouldn't you want me to
report it to Lord Orochimaru

194
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,540
right away?

195
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,041
‐All right, then.

196
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,076
I'll take you to him.

197
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,612
But I suggest you
limit your expectations

198
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,180
if you plan on
surviving the meeting.

199
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,756
‐Now listen, in a
little while, it's

200
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,290
going to get noisy out there.

201
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,026
Just be a good boy and stay put.

202
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,334
‐What about you?

203
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,504
‐I have to take
care of business.

204
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,205
Then I'll hurry back.

205
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,439
Don't worry.

206
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:08,408
All you need to think
about is resting your body.

207
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:10,611
‐But I'm fine, Guren.

208
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:11,945
I actually feel back to normal.

209
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:13,747
‐No, not yet.

210
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,682
You need to heal completely.

211
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,817
‐Hey, wait.

212
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,321
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

213
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:24,825
Could you fix this for me?

214
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:29,659
‐Oh, that‐‐

215
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,532
rather than fixing it,

216
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,900
why don't I make
you a better one?

217
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,401
‐But I‐‐

218
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,570
GUREN: What is it?

219
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,572
‐But I want to keep this one.

220
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:42,776
This is the first flower
you gave me, remember?

221
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:43,677
‐All right.

222
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,051
Here, it's all fixed up.

223
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:54,821
‐Thank you, Guren.

224
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,924
You're not gonna
go away, are you?

225
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:58,859
‐[gasp]

226
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:06,439
‐Where I want to be
is here with you.

227
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,082
GUREN (VOICEOVER):
This is stupid.

228
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:17,518
What is this?

229
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,621
What am I doing?

230
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,434
[loud cawing]

231
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,469
[wind howling]

232
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:41,041
‐Naruto.

233
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,646
‐Hey, Kakashi Sensei.

234
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,713
‐What's the matter?

235
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,115
Something on your mind?

236
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,717
‐It's just‐‐

237
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:51,918
SAKURA: That moron.

238
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,655
The strategy meeting was
supposed to have started.

239
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,823
What's his excuse
going to be this time?

240
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,626
‐(QUIETLY) When it comes to
Naruto, she is always upset.

241
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,634
Huh.

242
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,401
‐Huh?

243
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,569
‐What do you see, Sakura?

244
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,505
Did you finally find Naruto?

245
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:05,038
‐Shh.

246
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:11,011
NARUTO: That kid, what are
you going to do with him?

247
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,579
‐I find it interesting
that you're

248
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,081
so concerned with him, Naruto.

249
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:16,717
‐He's being used
and you know it.

250
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,251
He believes there's
someone out there

251
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:21,321
he can go back to,
someone he can trust.

252
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,455
But he's gonna be betrayed.

253
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:30,496
And when that moment comes,
he won't have anywhere

254
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,733
left to turn.

255
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,101
If wherever someone
thinks of you is a place

256
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:39,239
you can call home,
well, then I am not

257
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,908
going to stop
thinking about him.

258
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,109
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

259
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:47,914
He wasn't talking
about Sasuke after all.

260
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,416
‐Sure, it's important to
keep people in your thoughts,

261
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,252
but is it that simple?

262
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:56,690
Your feelings might conflict
with the other person's.

263
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,124
‐No, you're wrong.

264
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,292
It is that simple!

265
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:02,903
‐(SOFTLY) Naruto.

266
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,842
‐Everyone listen.

267
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,444
I'm going to go over Lady
Tsunade's plan of attack

268
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:14,515
and review the new
team formations.

269
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,316
First of all, the
search and rescue

270
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:19,886
mission to Orochimaru's secret
hideout is now complete.

271
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,989
Sakura, Hinata, and
Ino, from now on,

272
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:24,725
you'll be under my command.

273
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:25,225
‐Yes.

274
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:25,726
‐Yes.

275
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,127
‐Yes.

276
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,162
‐As for the rest of you, you'll
be forming a new unit that'll

277
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,598
be under the
direction of Kakashi.

278
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:32,966
‐All right.

279
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,335
Our team's new assignment is
to locate the Three‐Tail beast

280
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:38,238
and seal it by whatever
means necessary.

281
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:41,274
What's more, as that child
seems to be connected to this,

282
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,677
we must protect
him at all costs.

283
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,746
‐Huh?

284
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,715
‐It's not the Akatsuki alone
that covet the tailed beast.

285
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,984
If it becomes known that
a tailed beast exists

286
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,453
with no jinchuriki
the other nations

287
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,589
are bound to join
the hunt for it.

288
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:57,891
‐So that young boy
was brought here

289
00:14:57,924 --> 00:14:59,893
to be transformed
into a jinchuriki.

290
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:00,567
Is that correct?

291
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,735
‐Hm?

292
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,504
‐Sai!

293
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,771
‐Ohhh.

294
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,507
I guess I forgot
you're a jinchuriki.

295
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,746
‐You dummy.

296
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,649
You always say stuff
without thinking, don't you?

297
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:19,185
But still, I bet you're
right about that.

298
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,254
Sealing the Three‐Tails
and protecting

299
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,258
that kid, that's so he doesn't
end up just like Gaara and me,

300
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,627
isn't it?

301
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,028
Right, Shizune?

302
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,896
‐Yes, that's our intention.

303
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,465
But the plan is not to
capture the tailed beast.

304
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,234
If we manage to seal
the beast, we're

305
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,837
going to send it to
another dimension.

306
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,173
That's Lady Tsunade's‐‐
the Hokage's will.

307
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:40,907
‐All right!

308
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,609
What are we waiting for?

309
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,177
‐One thing.

310
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,480
The tailed beast has a huge
reservoir of chakra, right?

311
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,850
I don't see how we
can put a seal on it.

312
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,053
‐Yes, it will be
extremely difficult,

313
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,455
requiring amazing
amounts of chakra control

314
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,757
and concentration.

315
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,293
Sakura and Ino, you've
trained in medical ninjutsu.

316
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,669
Your experience
will be very useful.

317
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:04,070
As well, Hinata's.

318
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:07,007
‐Um, but I don't
have any training

319
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,142
in medical ninjitsu, ma'am.

320
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:12,445
‐Actually, I was speaking of
your ability to control chakra.

321
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:15,115
You may not be a medical
ninja, but your Byakugan

322
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,750
can see the flow of chakra.

323
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,920
That and your mastery of the
gentle fist will come in handy.

324
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,722
You'll be very important.

325
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:24,357
‐Yeah, Hinata, you're amazing!

326
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,728
‐No I'm not.

327
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,564
[whimpers]

328
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:36,369
Mm, I'll do my best.

329
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:39,873
‐Yeah, I guess the girls
might be a little better

330
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:43,009
at delicate chakra
control than us guys.

331
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:43,510
Mm‐hm.

332
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,013
Huh?

333
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,648
Hey!

334
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:48,815
What about Tenten?

335
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,316
How come you didn't pick her?

336
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,819
All the other girls are
on the sealing team.

337
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,589
‐Well, I guess it's 'cause my
chakra control is rough, right?

338
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,390
Rrrrrnngh!

339
00:16:57,423 --> 00:17:01,367
‐No, I‐‐ I didn't mean
it like that at all.

340
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,004
‐The rest of you will work
under Captain Yamato and myself

341
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,706
to provide protection.

342
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,941
I'm sure I don't need to
point this out to any of you,

343
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,944
but the people who are
after the Three‐Tails

344
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:13,947
won't wait around for us to
finish sealing the beast.

345
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,081
They'll hit hard.

346
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,784
The Crystal Style
user and the rest.

347
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:19,753
‐I say bring them on.

348
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:22,656
‐But how will our
team be structured?

349
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,927
‐Yeah, about that‐‐
I have an idea.

350
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,264
‐Well?

351
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,833
Come on, don't hold back.

352
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,134
Tell us already.

353
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,469
‐As I see it, the most
critical part of this battle

354
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:39,005
will be to stop the
Crystal Style user.

355
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,508
However, if all of us
fight her, the sealing team

356
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,710
will be left without
protection, which

357
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:46,547
is why I'm thinking of splitting
this team in two, with one

358
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,349
half concentrating on her.

359
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:51,117
Naruto, Sai, Shino.

360
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:51,618
‐Sir.

361
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,420
‐All right!

362
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:56,857
‐You three will operate
under my command

363
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,192
to confront the
Crystal Style user.

364
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:03,336
And all the others‐‐
Yamato, you know what to do.

365
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:03,870
‐Yes.

366
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,138
Understood.

367
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,641
OK, those of you whose
names weren't called before,

368
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:09,075
gather round.

369
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:11,111
TENTEN: He makes us sound
like we're the rejects.

370
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,145
LEE: Do not pout.

371
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,048
Where is your youthful
spirit and vigor?

372
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:15,816
‐Lee's right.

373
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:16,817
[Akamaru barks]

374
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:27,528
‐What were you doing?

375
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:28,161
‐Come on.

376
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,395
Isn't it obvious?

377
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,232
I was reporting back to
Kabuto about the movements

378
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,800
of the Leaf.

379
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,236
Actually, Kabuto
told me he was going

380
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:39,740
to return to Lord Orochimaru
at the hideout immediately.

381
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:42,042
‐That's strange timing.

382
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:46,212
‐Well, I guess he has
a lot on his mind.

383
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,414
‐Of course.

384
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:49,883
And Rinji?

385
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,184
‐Yeah?

386
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,588
‐What you said before,
I do trust you.

387
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:55,088
‐Ah?

388
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,205
RINJI (VOICEOVER):
Stopping the Three‐Tails

389
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:08,241
from being sealed and
destroying the Leaf‐‐

390
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:09,810
it's turning into a busy day.

391
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,818
GUREN (VOICEOVER): The
Hidden Leaf have come.

392
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,386
First we have to take
them down, and after that,

393
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,054
the Three‐Tails.

394
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,796
[gasp] No, I can't
worry about the boy.

395
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,232
Lord Orochimaru has
high hopes for me

396
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:37,203
and my only wish is to
be with Lord Orochimaru.

397
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,072
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
She follows Orochimaru,

398
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,207
and Orochimaru's a
guy who thinks only

399
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,476
of his own twisted ambitions.

400
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,947
He'd sacrifice anything and
anybody to get what he wants.

401
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,015
And as far as I'm concerned‐‐

402
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,116
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Damn it!

403
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,552
What's wrong with me?

404
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,186
RINJI: Look who's here.

405
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,120
What are you doing?

406
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,321
Thinking up strategy?

407
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:56,389
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Rinji.

408
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:57,858
Where's he come from?

409
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,060
‐Yeah, sort of.

410
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,703
GUREN (VOICEOVER): And
how long's he been there?

411
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,605
‐Hm.

412
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,472
Look, the mist is clearing.

413
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,322
‐Right.

414
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,456
It's time to move.

415
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:32,666
‐Everyone, have you all
memorized the plan of action?

416
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,001
And remember, if that
child is discovered

417
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,104
during our operation, we must
do anything to protect him.

418
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,809
OK then, let's begin.

419
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,579
Tenten, show us what you have.

420
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,081
‐Right away.

421
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,784
Lady Tsunade specially
prepared this giant scroll

422
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,119
for the moment when we
seal the Three‐Tails.

423
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,155
Naruto, here.

424
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,958
[grunts with effort] Yaahhh!

425
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,259
Whoaa!

426
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,068
Wait, we're really going to
use this humongous scroll?

427
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,469
‐Exactly.

428
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,871
After all, we'll
need to suppress

429
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:08,809
a massive amount
of chakra energy.

430
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,078
Kakashi, we're counting on you.

431
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,814
‐No problem.

432
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,316
Both teams, fall into formation.

433
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,384
ALL: Yes, sir!

434
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:21,487
‐Naruto, guess we're
going our separate ways.

435
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,856
Good luck out there.

436
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,658
‐Leave it to me!

437
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:25,959
I won't need luck!

438
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:32,962
[MUSIC ‐ DEV PARADE,
"BACCHIKOI!!!"]

439
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:03,469
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): We'll
maintain this chakra balance

440
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:06,172
and slowly expand the
diameter of the opening.

441
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:08,509
When the Three‐Tails
is below the barrier,

442
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,043
we'll get a reaction.

443
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:11,477
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wait a minute.

444
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:14,147
If the enemy attacks while we're
maintaining the chakra balance,

445
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,181
we won't have a chance.

446
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:16,750
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
That won't happen.

447
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:17,951
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Huh?

448
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:19,152
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): We
won't have to fight them.

449
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,254
Trust your comrades to
take care of the enemy.

450
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:24,891
We just need to focus
on our chakra control.

451
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:28,762
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time‐‐
