1
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:19,972
-There.

2
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:22,840
{\an1}The sealing of the Six
Tails is at last completed.

3
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:24,042
Phew.

4
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,378
{\an1}It certainly takes longer
with just five of us.

5
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:30,080
{\an1}-Now that it's done, there
are only two tailed beasts

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,048
remaining.

7
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,182
-Yes.

8
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,618
{\an1}I've sent Sasuke and his
team to go and retrieve

9
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,752
the Eight Tails.

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,188
{\an1}-But can he be trusted?

11
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,390
{\an1}-I can vouch for Sasuke myself.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,974
{\an1}-I know that you're out
here all by yourself.

13
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,575
{\an1}So why aren't you running?

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,543
-Whatever.

15
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:07,079
{\an1}I can be any number
from 1 to 1,000.

16
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,616
{\an1}Besides, why would
I want to run?

17
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:13,751
{\an1}If I capture you right now, then
I'll get to see Sasuke again.

18
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,821
{\an1}-Why are you so obsessed
with my brother?

19
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:20,424
{\an1}He's just a rogue ninja.

20
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,192
{\an1}It's true that we
may not be blood,

21
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:26,596
{\an1}but he's more of a brother to
me than you ever were to him.

22
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,908
{\an1}ITACHI: You're already
under my genjutsu.

23
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,515
{\an1}I'll say it again.

24
00:01:48,548 --> 00:01:49,616
{\an1}I just want to talk.

25
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,854
{\an1}I know that you've been
trying to take Sasuke back

26
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,989
{\an1}to the Hidden Leaf Village.

27
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:00,859
{\an1}However, what if it doesn't
go the way you want it to?

28
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:03,695
{\an1}-I'll do anything
to make it happen.

29
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,630
{\an1}-Even taking him by force?

30
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:08,799
{\an1}Sure, if you're lucky,
Sasuke will just obediently

31
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,567
{\an1}return with you to the village.

32
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:14,438
{\an1}But tell me, what if the
opposite were to happen?

33
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:18,074
{\an1}-What are you talking about?

34
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:20,976
{\an1}-You just said you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother

35
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,245
to you.

36
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:27,082
{\an1}What if Sasuke were to attack
the Hidden Leaf Village?

37
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,983
{\an1}What would you do then?

38
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,285
-Why would-- no,
there's just no way

39
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,455
{\an1}that Sasuke would ever
do something like that.

40
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,856
{\an1}-Sasuke is still a blank canvas.

41
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,093
He can easily be
dyed into any color.

42
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:45,598
{\an1}If he resists, would
you be able to stop him?

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,934
{\an1}Or even kill him, if need be?

44
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,103
{\an1}Could you weigh Sasuke
against the Hidden Leaf

45
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,905
{\an1}on a set of scales?

46
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:55,839
{\an1}-I would defend the
village, and I'd

47
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,276
{\an1}find a way to stop Sasuke
without killing him!

48
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,944
{\an1}-You're such a child.

49
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:04,147
{\an1}All your tales are nothing
but mere fantasies.

50
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,483
{\an1}Shinobi must be capable of
making very harsh decisions.

51
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:15,423
{\an1}-The first thing is for
you to give up on Sasuke.

52
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:19,260
{\an1}What happened was always
destined to happen, Naruto.

53
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:24,031
{\an1}Dismiss him from your
mind, and move on.

54
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:27,900
{\an1}To be a shinobi, you need
more strength and jutsu.

55
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:31,137
{\an1}You must acquire the judgement
to make the right decisions.

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,407
{\an1}You must become smarter.

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,175
{\an1}So the longer that
you remain a fool,

58
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,912
{\an1}the harder it is for you
to live in this world.

59
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:44,716
-Fine, then.

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,651
{\an1}If being smarter means
what you say it does,

61
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,756
{\an1}I'll remain a fool
my entire life.

62
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:55,058
{\an1}I'm going after him, and I'll
do it alone, if I have to.

63
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,327
{\an1}I'll create my own
incredible jutsu.

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,530
{\an1}Someone else once tried
to tell me the same thing.

65
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:04,433
{\an1}But for me, there is no choice.

66
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:08,002
{\an1}I gave my word, and
I'll never back down.

67
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,637
That will always
be my ninja way.

68
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,385
{\an1}ITACHI: I have shared
some of my power with you.

69
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,788
{\an1}Though I hope the day
when you will have to use

70
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:30,355
it never comes.

71
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,360
-What is this?

72
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:37,461
{\an1}What's going on here?

73
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,696
{\an1}I thought you said that
you weren't after me.

74
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,632
{\an1}Then why are you doing this?

75
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,999
-I'm going now.

76
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,737
{\an1}I have an important
matter to attend to.

77
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,339
-What did Itachi
mean by all of that?

78
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,009
Why did he--

79
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,177
{\an1}-Sasuke triumphed in the battle.

80
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,647
{\an1}Itachi Uchiha is now dead.

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,915
{\an1}Sasuke is down right now, too.

82
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,550
So what's next?

83
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,518
I think he's in
pretty bad shape.

84
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:11,290
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What
are you doing now, Sasuke?

85
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,191
{\an1}I hope you're OK.

86
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:27,939
{\an1}-Are you all right, Sasuke?

87
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,439
-Yeah.

88
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:30,540
Let's hurry.

89
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:32,074
{\an1}We're almost at the
rendezvous point.

90
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,886
{\an1}As promised, I've delivered
the Eight Tails to you.

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,788
-Excellent work.

92
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,255
{\an1}I knew you could do it.

93
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:55,963
{\an1}Where are you going?

94
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,866
{\an1}-First to tend to my wounds.

95
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,501
{\an1}Then to the Hidden Leaf.

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,612
{\an1}-Sasuke, I need to ask
you something important.

97
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,814
{\an1}After learning the truth
about Itachi's life,

98
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,415
{\an1}there is a chance that you
will carry out his wishes

99
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,751
{\an1}and protect the Hidden Leaf.

100
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,586
{\an1}So tell me the truth.

101
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,255
{\an1}What are your intentions?

102
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:28,790
{\an1}-Itachi's life shows
how he sacrificed

103
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:31,426
{\an1}himself to protect the village.

104
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,964
{\an1}But my grief at losing him
is deeper than any desire

105
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,499
{\an1}to follow his path.

106
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,735
Inconsolably so.

107
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,370
{\an1}The peace that Itachi
sacrificed himself for

108
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,338
{\an1}doesn't appeal to me.

109
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,608
{\an1}Now that I know the truth,
following in Itachi's footsteps

110
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:53,177
{\an1}to protect the Hidden Leaf
is the last thing I would do.

111
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,080
{\an1}Most of all, I will never
forgive the three elders

112
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,582
{\an1}of the Leaf Village.

113
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,617
{\an1}I believe everyone
in the Leaf who's

114
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:04,856
{\an1}enjoying the peace paid for with
Itachi's life is guilty, too.

115
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,925
{\an1}-I thought you were only
going to kill the elders?

116
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,158
-No.

117
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,360
{\an1}What I want is to slaughter
the entire Leaf Village.

118
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,963
{\an1}But only by myself.

119
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,698
{\an1}I was just lying in
front of the Taka.

120
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,833
{\an1}-Are you sure about that?

121
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:21,903
{\an1}You can truly ignore
Itachi's will, his sacrifice,

122
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:24,806
{\an1}as well as all of those
he strove to protect?

123
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,474
{\an1}Are you really serious?

124
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:29,476
{\an1}-Look, you told me so yourself.

125
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,746
{\an1}The reason why Itachi couldn't
bring himself to kill me

126
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,615
{\an1}was because my life was
more precious to him

127
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,818
{\an1}than the village itself was.

128
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:42,788
{\an1}I have similar feelings
that Itachi's life

129
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,924
is more precious
than the Hidden Leaf.

130
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,927
That's all.

131
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,695
{\an1}They shunned the Uchiha clan.

132
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,364
{\an1}They ordered my brother
to kill own parents.

133
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:56,299
{\an1}It wasn't just the elders who
chased Itachi to his death,

134
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,070
{\an1}but all those in the Hidden
Leaf who abide by the Senju.

135
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:02,504
{\an1}To me they are the
scum of the earth!

136
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,840
{\an1}They are all objects
of my vengeance!

137
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:12,280
{\an1}If you want to ridicule me as
a brat swayed by his emotions,

138
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,615
go ahead.

139
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:17,584
{\an1}To accept and adopt Itachi's
intention would be childish.

140
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:21,054
{\an1}The foolish sputtering of
those who don't know hatred.

141
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:25,524
{\an1}If anyone who criticizes my way
of life were to come forward,

142
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:29,929
{\an1}I'd turn around and kill every
single one of their loved ones,

143
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,463
so that they too
could grasp what

144
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:38,469
{\an1}it's like to experience
this hatred of mine.

145
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,877
{\an1}MADARA: When a man
learns to feel love,

146
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,146
{\an1}he must also bear the
risk of feeling hate.

147
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,419
-What?

148
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,122
{\an1}What do you mean,
Killer B's been taken?

149
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:02,556
{\an1}-Among the assailants is
someone from the Hidden Leaf.

150
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,924
An Uchiha.

151
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,061
{\an1}My partner is tailing
them right now.

152
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:10,463
{\an1}-Lord Raikage, what
are your orders for us?

153
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:11,865
-The Akatsuki.

154
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:16,002
{\an1}They won't get away with this!

155
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:18,071
{\an1}Just you wait, little brother.

156
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:20,372
This isn't done.

157
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:23,642
[theme music]

158
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:19,408
[knocking]

159
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:19,909
-Huh?

160
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:23,879
Oh.

161
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:24,980
It's you.

162
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,048
{\an1}Hey, Kakashi-sensei.

163
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:28,917
{\an1}-Lady Fifth has summoned you.

164
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,483
Let's go.

165
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,492
{\an1}-Chief Toad and Gamakichi?

166
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,560
What gives?

167
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,327
-Yo.

168
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,495
{\an1}What's up, Naruto?

169
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,496
{\an1}-What are you guys doing here?

170
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,198
What's going on?

171
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,066
{\an1}Did something happen?

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,068
{\an1}-Well, actually, uh--

173
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,137
{\an1}-Gamakichi, keep your trap shut.

174
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,505
Let the boss and
Tsunade handle it.

175
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,773
{\an1}They know what they're doing.

176
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,180
-That's weird.

177
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:03,980
{\an1}What's going on here?

178
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,781
-Don't worry.

179
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:05,282
Let's go.

180
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:17,158
-Hm?

181
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,707
{\an1}-So this is Jiraya
boy's student, is it?

182
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,607
-Yes.

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,576
{\an1}This is Naruto Uzumaki.

184
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:40,679
{\an1}The child of prophecy
you spoke of.

185
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,848
-What's with the
old geezer frog?

186
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:43,882
Who's he?

187
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:44,782
-Pipe down.

188
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,817
{\an1}Watch your mouth, Naruto.

189
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,719
{\an1}He is one of the two
great sages of Mt.

190
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,155
{\an1}Myoboku, Lord Fukasaku.

191
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,789
{\an1}He traveled all the
way here just so

192
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,457
{\an1}that he could speak with you.

193
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,492
{\an1}-Well, to be more accurate,
I'm a Great Sage Toad,

194
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,727
{\an1}but never mind that.

195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,263
{\an1}It doesn't matter.

196
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,496
Answer me this.

197
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,333
{\an1}Are you really Jiraiya boy's
student, or aren't you?

198
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,533
-Jiraiya boy?

199
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:06,969
A boy?

200
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,370
{\an1}Don't treat the pervy
sage like a kid.

201
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:12,240
{\an1}Who does this geezer
frog think he is, anyway?

202
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,042
{\an1}-I told you already,
watch your mouth!

203
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:19,045
{\an1}-Naruto, he's the one who taught
the Sage Jutsu to Lord Jiraiya.

204
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,379
{\an1}He's Jiraiya's master.

205
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:21,348
-Huh?

206
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,283
[laughter]

207
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,751
{\an1}-So you call him the Pervy Sage?

208
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:28,887
{\an1}I've never heard a more
fitting name for Jiraiya boy.

209
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,855
-What does this
geezer sage want?

210
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,925
{\an1}What did he come so far
to talk to me about?

211
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,161
{\an1}-I'm not exactly sure
where to begin this.

212
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,296
But let me see.

213
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,164
{\an1}I suppose the most
important thing

214
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:48,905
{\an1}is I'm afraid Jiraiya
boy has died in battle.

215
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:49,404
-Huh?

216
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:55,844
{\an1}What are you talking about?

217
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,386
{\an1}-I know that this
is very sudden,

218
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,820
{\an1}so I understand if
you don't believe me.

219
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,725
{\an1}For some time now, rumors
had been circulating

220
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,061
{\an1}that the leader of the
Akatsuki was operating out

221
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:17,596
of the Village
Hidden in the Rain,

222
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,665
{\an1}so Jiraiya boy went
there in person to verify

223
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:23,067
{\an1}whether these rumors were true.

224
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,871
{\an1}-The leader of the Akatsuki
was in the Hidden Rain Village?

225
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:30,640
{\an1}-As I recall, that village
is difficult to infiltrate.

226
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,442
{\an1}It's entirely closed off
from the outside world.

227
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,576
-Yes.

228
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,478
{\an1}But Master Jiraiya was
exceptionally skilled

229
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:39,480
{\an1}in infiltration and
espionage tactics.

230
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,015
-Yes.

231
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:40,515
Exactly.

232
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,823
{\an1}-This is what I've
thought through on my own,

233
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:53,160
{\an1}and that is that,
Jiraiya-sensei.

234
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,661
{\an1}FUKASAKU: Jiraiya
boy encountered Pain,

235
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,332
{\an1}the leader of the Akatsuki.

236
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,465
However--

237
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,834
{\an1}-We'll, your appearance
has changed quite a bit.

238
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,502
But those eyes--
so I guess you're

239
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,872
{\an1}the ones who became
Pain, Nagato.

240
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:11,242
{\an1}It appears you've strayed
from the path of goodness.

241
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,178
{\an1}What happened to you?

242
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:14,912
{\an1}-You don't need to know.

243
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,381
{\an1}After all, you are an outsider.

244
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:20,317
{\an1}-Pain was a former
student of Jiraiya boy's

245
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,652
{\an1}from many, many years ago.

246
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:23,553
{\an1}-He was his student?

247
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,754
{\an1}What do you mean by that?

248
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,956
{\an1}-I don't know the
particulars, but Jiraiya boy

249
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,325
{\an1}called him Nagato.

250
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:33,161
{\an1}-That goes way back to
a time during the chaos

251
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,063
{\an1}of the Third Great Ninja War.

252
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:37,698
{\an1}The Hidden Rani Village
had become a battlefield,

253
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:40,401
{\an1}and Jiraiya took some war
orphans under his wing.

254
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,774
Who would have
imagined those kids--

255
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:53,612
-But to defeat a
shinobi as powerful

256
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:58,116
{\an1}as Jiraiya-- how did this
Pain accomplish such a feat?

257
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,052
{\an1}-It was because Pain
possesses the Rinnegan.

258
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,489
{\an1}-What did you say?

259
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,491
-Rinnegan?

260
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:09,059
{\an1}-It's an ocular jutsu said
to have been possessed

261
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:12,628
{\an1}by the father of all shinobi,
the Sage of the Six Paths.

262
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:16,098
{\an1}But I believed that it was
nothing more than a legend.

263
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,667
{\an1}-The fabled occular
jutsu, the Rinnegan.

264
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,772
{\an1}Its power was supposedly beyond
anything you could imagine.

265
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,839
{\an1}But there's more.

266
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:28,443
{\an1}-There were six of
them with the Rinnegan?

267
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,878
{\an1}How can that even be possible?

268
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,845
-I don't know.

269
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,148
{\an1}Perhaps there's some
trick behind it.

270
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,849
{\an1}I believe that Jiraiya
boy discovered the secret

271
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:40,253
{\an1}behind the six of them in
that final terrible battle.

272
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,988
But--

273
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:43,588
-Jiraiya boy!

274
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,361
{\an1}-Even after he had his
throat crushed by Pain,

275
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,530
{\an1}and he knew the end
was near, Jiraiya boy

276
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:56,633
left a message
before collapsing.

277
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,201
{\an1}This is his message.

278
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,139
-It's a code.

279
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:14,015
{\an1}-I'm sure he did this to
prevent Pain from catching on.

280
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:18,752
{\an1}And that's everything I know
about Jiraiya boy's efforts.

281
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,855
{\an1}-I wonder what he was
trying to tell us?

282
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,857
{\an1}Maybe we can decode this.

283
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,891
Then, hopefully,
we'll understand.

284
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,660
-You let him go.

285
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:28,961
{\an1}Is that right, granny?

286
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:42,072
-That's right.

287
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:44,875
{\an1}Why would you ever let
him do something so risky?

288
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,977
{\an1}You knew Pervy Sage better
than anyone, granny!

289
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,646
{\an1}How could you send him
somewhere so dangerous alone?

290
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,614
{\an1}-Stop it, Naruto.

291
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:55,451
{\an1}You of all people ought to
know Lady Tsunade's feelings.

292
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,157
{\an1}-It's too dangerous.

293
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,959
{\an1}-I'm one of the Leaf's
legendary Sannin.

294
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,962
{\an1}You know what that means
just as well as I do.

295
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,796
{\an1}You were so beautiful back then.

296
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,466
{\an1}And now, you're a
50-something granny.

297
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,167
But it does pain
me to see how you

298
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,436
{\an1}hold all the memories
of your lost friends

299
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:19,339
{\an1}and loved ones inside
that ample bosom of yours.

300
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:22,307
{\an1}As you know, number will
only continue to rise.

301
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:34,452
{\an1}Well then, we'll simply have
to keep our emotions in check.

302
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:36,386
{\an1}The job that we must
give to ourselves

303
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,355
now is to set
examples, and to aid

304
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:40,490
{\an1}the next generation, Tsunade.

305
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:43,959
{\an1}And to achieve that,
I'd gladly risk my life.

306
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:47,762
{\an1}Wisdom is the one thing that
makes growling old worth it.

307
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:51,733
-Dammit.

308
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:55,836
-Naruto, wait.

309
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,372
{\an1}Where are you going?

310
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,074
{\an1}-If the Pervy Sage had
been the Fifth Hokage,

311
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,745
{\an1}he wouldn't have let granny
Tsunade take a risk like that.

312
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,279
Never.

313
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:13,251
-Naruto!

314
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,718
-Don't Sakura.

315
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,654
-Enough.

316
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,022
{\an1}Just let him be for now.

317
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,391
-But milady--

318
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,926
{\an1}-My apologies, Lord Fukasaku.

319
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,328
{\an1}I'll arrange for Naruto to--

320
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:24,994
-No need.

321
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:27,263
{\an1}That's quite all right.

322
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,698
{\an1}But about that child
of prophecy vision

323
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:33,670
{\an1}I mentioned earlier-- I can
see that this child truly

324
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:36,804
{\an1}loved and admired Jiraiya boy.

325
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,441
It makes me hope
more than anything

326
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:42,043
that he is the
child of prophecy.

327
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,516
{\an1}-First I'm going to
show you how it's done.

328
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,483
{\an1}Now, watch me carefully.

329
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:51,685
[scream]

330
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:52,985
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This is it.

331
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,457
Summoning Jutsu!

332
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:10,901
What?

333
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:11,468
No way!

334
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,203
I mean, come on!

335
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:14,770
Why do I have to
tag along with you

336
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:16,540
{\an1}while you do research
for another one

337
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:17,940
{\an1}of your pervy books?

338
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:18,941
-Look, kid.

339
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,943
This isn't just
another research trip.

340
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,844
{\an1}See, there's this
woman I have to find.

341
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,347
{\an1}A very remarkable woman.

342
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,081
{\an1}-Come on, come on, come on!

343
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,983
{\an1}Why'd ya choose me, huh?

344
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:30,652
{\an1}-Well, the truth is,
kid, a long time ago,

345
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,320
{\an1}the Fourth Hokage used
to be a disciple of mine,

346
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,956
{\an1}and you bear such a striking
resemblance to the Fourth

347
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,091
{\an1}that it's almost laughable.

348
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,567
{\an1}Not a minute will be wasted.

349
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:49,434
-Huh?

350
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:50,569
-All of our time
on the road will

351
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:52,970
{\an1}be devoted solely
to you, Naruto.

352
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,006
-But how come?

353
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,375
{\an1}-We've got to get you stronger.

354
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:58,376
Time to train!

355
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:35,608
[theme music]

356
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:45,617
[theme music]

357
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,946
{\an1}NARRATOR: The boy
wanders the village,

358
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:02,851
lost in despair,
immersed in anguish,

359
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,353
{\an1}reminiscing about
his late master.

360
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:09,322
{\an1}The end of his childhood
approaches quickly.

361
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,191
{\an1}When at last he lets
go of all of his grief,

362
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,927
{\an1}the boy will raise
himself up once again.

363
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,766
{\an1}Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
Following the Master's Shadow.

364
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,535
{\an1}-After all, we can't
stay brats forever.
