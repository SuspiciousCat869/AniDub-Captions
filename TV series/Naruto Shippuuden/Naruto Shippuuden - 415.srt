{\an4}<i>Forgive me...But doing so</i>

00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:08,389
{\an1}Good. Now bring it, and my left

6

{\an1}So the Fourth Hokage's Nine

{\an1}I need to ask you something,

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,567
Huh?

19
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,968
{\an1}Hold on. We need the Nine Tails
inside that thing.

20
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,036
{\an1}We can't afford to miss.

21
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:29,705
{\an1}We have to wait for the right
moment.

22
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:34,108
{\an1}Tell me now...What am I to you?

24
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,478
{\an1}You have to be kidding, right?

25
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:45,981
{\an1}What kind of a stupid question
is that? You have always been
only one thing to me.

26
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:48,349

You shall be...

29
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,923
Madara Uchiha.

30
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,227
{\an1}You see, Madara is defined as he
who rejects this world.

31
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,532
{\an4}<i>All who hold that thought in</i>

<i>achieving the Infinite</i>
<i>Tsukuyomi,...are Madara.</i>

32
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,667
That was...

33
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,511
{\an1}That was once my path, too.

34
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:38,513
{\an1}I left you in charge, everything
in your hands.

35
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,382
{\an1}And let you walk in my shoes,
while I slept the eternal sleep
waiting to return.

36
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:46,384
{\an1}<i>It's the exact path I guided you</i>
<i>toward.</i>

37
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:52,487
{\an1}You were supposed to live out
your life as Madara to achieve a
mutually agreed upon goal...

38
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:56,157
{\an1}<i>...as the savior who rescued</i>
<i>this world.</i>

39
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,826
{\an1}<i>This world laid out by the Sage</i>
<i>of the Six Paths...</i>

40
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,328
<i>...has failed.</i>

41
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,664
<i>Listen...</i>

42
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:13,334
{\an1}The chakra Six Paths dispersed
was meant to be a linking
power,...

43
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:18,637
{\an1}<i>...something that would connect</i>
<i>the mental energies between</i>
<i>people, </i>

44
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,305
{\an1}<i>so all could understand</i>
<i>each other's hearts</i>
<i>without words,...</i>

45
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,139
{\an1}<i>...and would lead to peace and</i>
<i>stability.</i>

46
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:31,144
{\an4}<i>The one who preached this as</i>
<i>Ninshu, the Shinobi Creed, and</i>
<i>sought to guide the people</i>
<i>forth, </i>

47
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,112
{\an1}<i>was the Sage of the Six Paths. </i>

48
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:34,647
<i>And yet...</i>

49
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:39,949
{\an1}<i>Before long, time after time,</i>
<i>people used chakra, not to</i>
<i>connect with others,...</i>

50
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:46,821
{\an1}<i>but, only to link the mental </i>
<i>and physical energies within</i>
<i>themselves.</i>

51
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:51,022
{\an1}<i>Through a method of infusing</i>
<i>one's own chakra and increasing</i>
<i>it manifold...</i>

52
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:55,958
{\an1}<i>...they changed chakra into</i>
<i>ninjutsu that could be used as</i>
<i>weapons in battle. </i>

53
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:03,797
{\an4}Whic, ironically, meant
reverting things back to the way
Six Paths' mother, Kaguya,
originally used chakra.

54
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,466
{\an1}Exactly what in the hell is he
talking about, anyway?!

55
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Gaara...

56
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,101
Yes, I know.

57
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:14,970
{\an1}The Sage's actions ended up
merely furthering the human
paradox.

58
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:23,609
{\an4}<i>And even of some bonds were</i>
<i>established...All they really</i>
<i>learned...was that true</i>
<i>understanding wasn't possible.</i>

59
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:29,946
{\an1}<i>Either way,...chakra only gave</i>
<i>rise to conflict...and false</i>
<i>hope.</i>

60
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:36,617
{\an1}<i>We know the reality all too</i>
<i>well...Even as we seek peace, we</i>
<i>seek war at the same time.</i>

61
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:42,953
{\an1}<i>And this reality...compels</i>
<i>infinite suffering via the power</i>
<i>known as chakra.</i>

62
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:49,759
{\an1}Power only leads to a desire for
conflict. And the lack of power
leads to losing everything.

63
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:54,427
{\an1}<i>But I shall create a new world</i>
<i>that will overcome that!</i>

64
00:06:55,595 --> 00:07:01,264
{\an1}<i>The Infinite Tsukuyomi will</i>
<i>produce a dream world without</i>
<i>any abominable chakra!</i>

65
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:06,668
{\an1}And I, as the person who
possesses the most powerful
chakra, will lead it!

66
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,671
{\an1}You are me! Madara himself! Not
Obito!

Ha!

160

{\an1}So what is it you're going to
show us today, Obito?

166
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,629
{\an1}I'll be doing Fire Style:
Fireball Jutsu!
