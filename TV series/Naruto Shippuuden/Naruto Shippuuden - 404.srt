00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:14,790
{\an1}Check out their headbands,
they're all from the Hidden Rain
Village...

2
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:18,060
{\an1}What matters is which scroll
they have, Heaven or Earth?

00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:22,932

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,639
{\an1}You guys gonna run off?!

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,608
{\an1}Be nice and give us your scroll!

7
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:40,847
Never.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,549
Ajjisai...

{\an1}Unsealing Jutsu! Confetti Storm!

11
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,625
[yelling]

12
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,439
They ran away?

13
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,474
{\an1}Of course they did! Our strength
must've scared them off!

14
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:14,244
{\an1}That's too bad. We almost had
their scroll!

15
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:16,912
[sighing]

16
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:04,940
{\an1}"Tenten's Troubles"

17
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,492
Lady Angel...

18
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:30,497
{\an1}Lady Angel, you said that
there's a special mission for
us. What is it?

19
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:36,235
{\an1}I want you to use the Chunin
Exams as an opportunity to
locate a Jinchuriki.

20
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,270
A Jinchuriki...?

21
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:40,872
Suiren, Fuyou...

22
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,478
{\an4}Use your Sensory Perception
skills to look for a shinobi who
harbors enormous amounts of
chakra.

23
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,113
{\an1}Is that what a Jinchuriki is?

24
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:54,618
{\an1}Even if you don't find a
Jinchuriki, you're to bring back
intel on the other villages...

25
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,053
{\an1}...and on any extraordinary
shinobi.

26
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,920
Understood!

27
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,922
{\an1}You'll go with these two,
Ajisai.

28
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,791
I understand.

29
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:06,528
{\an1}The Hidden Rain is currently in
the midst of a reformation.

30
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,598
{\an1}And the other villages must not
learn about it.

31
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:14,602
{\an1}They must continue to believe
that Hanzo of the Salamander
still rules the Hidden Rain.

32
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,237
Yes, ma'am!

33
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:24,778
{\an1}What is it, Ajisai?

34
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:29,281
{\an1}You can see so many stars in
other nations...

35
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,718
{\an1}The stars, huh...?

36
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,087
{\an1}So, this is what a starlit sky
is like...

37
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,757
{\an1}Oh! A shooting star!

38
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,359
{\an1}I've never seen one before!

39
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,796
{\an1}We'll be able to see them in the
Hidden Rain Village someday,
too...

40
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,537
[blowing]

41
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:56,572
{\an1}All right, let's do it...

42
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:59,308
{\an1}There are no other shinobi in
the area.

43
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,210
{\an1}Then, that means we can finally
relax and have a nice meal!

44
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,247
{\an1}How 'bout okonomiyaki?

45
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,848
What, really?

46
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,118
{\an1}Wow, who would've expected that
out in the desert?!

47
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:16,357
{\an1}Well, we have to make sure to
eat well if we wanna maintain
our strength.

48
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,891
{\an1}It is so convenient having you
around!

49
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,159
{\an1}What's that mean?!

50
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,195
{\an1}That...you are convenient!

51
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:28,333
{\an1}I'm sorry, excuse me? I may have
convenient tools, but I am not a
convenient tool, okay?

52
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,670
{\an1}No, no, Tenten! You are
absolutely convenient

53
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,405
Seriously?!

54
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,175
{\an1}You listen to me! I'm not
convenient.

55
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,444
{\an1}You're in charge of making
dinner, now!

56
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,079
{\an1}Uh...Hey, Tenten...

57
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,281
Don't follow me!

58
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,151
{\an1}What just happened?!

59
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:50,787
{\an1}I have no idea...

60
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:51,987
What now?!

61
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,489
{\an1}Don't look at me!

62
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,093
Huh?

63
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,367
{\an1}[sigh] Oh, damn it...

64
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,538
{\an1}Guess I just needed...to vent a
bit...

65
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,716
[yell]

66
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,618
{\an1}8 Trigrams: Air Palm!

67
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,822
{\an1}Third Gate of Life...

68
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:31,689

00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:46,502
[yelling]

70
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,089
{\an1}You've improved greatly, Tenten!

71
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,826
{\an1}Thanks so much, Guy Sensei!

72
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,160
{\an1}You've really perfected your
skills.

73
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,963
{\an1}But, to be completely honest, it
isn't good enough.

74
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,398
Hmm?

75
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:19,832
What's wrong?

76
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,969
{\an1}Mastering weapons for single
combat is fundamental for a
ninja, right?

77
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,738
{\an1}Fundamentals are important.

78
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,242
{\an1}I know that. But, now, the issue
is going beyond fundamentals...

79
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,613
{\an1}Neji has honed his Gentle Fist
and developed a new jutsu.

80
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,381
{\an1}So I've seen! He's brilliant!

81
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:43,219
{\an1}Lee only has fundamental
taijutsu skills, but he can open
the Eight Inner Gates, now.

82
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,855
{\an1}Oh...Those are the fruits of his
labor!

83
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,724
{\an1}Yeah, but...all I have is the
basics!

84
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,724
Huh?

85
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,393
{\an1}I wanna have a really awesome
skill, too!

86
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:57,064
{\an1}At the rate things are going,
all that I'll ever do is stand
behind them and support them.

87
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:01,568
{\an1}You know, Tenten,...a role such
as that is actually critical in
teamwork.

88
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:08,241
{\an4}You see, I know both Neji and
Lee are taijutsu users, and
because of that they're
close-contact fighters...

89
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:13,445
{\an4}Don't you get it, Tenten? We're
able to fight so aggresively
because we know that you have
our backs.

90
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:16,581
{\an1}And, we are incredibly grateful
that you're there for us.

91
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:21,585
{\an1}That's nice to know, but, rather
than just gratitude, I'd like to
have my own special ninjutsu!

92
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,054
{\an1}Isn't there something I can do,
Guy Sensei?

93
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:28,592
{\an1}Hmm...huh...hmm...

94
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,463
{\an1}How about the Sansetsukon?

95
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:35,899
{\an1}That isn't really different than
this!

96
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,432
{\an1}Wait, that's right, Tenten!

97
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:42,036
{\an1}Don't forget that you have a
skill that no one else on this
entire team possesses!

98
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,939
{\an1}So, you should work to hone it!

99
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,974
{\an1}A skill no one else has?

100
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,043
{\an1}You're really convenient to have
around.

101
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:53,346
{\an1}Please don't talk me like I'm
some kind of tool or something
like that, Sensei!

102
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:56,449
{\an1}Oh no, I didn't mean to make it
sound like that at all!

103
00:08:56,816 --> 00:09:01,555
{\an1}You know, I'd already given this
a lot of thought before I came
to talk to you...

104
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:04,925
Tenten!

105
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:08,126
{\an1}Okonomiyaki is ready!

106
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,094
{\an1}So, come and get it!

107
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,865
{\an1}How did they turn out, anyway?

108
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,134
{\an1}I have my doubts about them...

109
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:42,057
{\an1}Looks like it's another hot day.

110
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,258
{\an1}It's the opposite of the Hidden
Rain.

111
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,027
[grunt]

112
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:48,262
{\an1}Yeah, a little dampness would be
nice.

113
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,767
{\an1}I do see some green over there.

114
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,074
Byakugan!

115
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,344
{\an1}What do you see, Neji?

116
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,715
{\an1}That there's no one around here
at all.

117
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:16,988
{\an4}Well, let's just keep moving. As
we get closer to the finish
line, we're bound to run into
other teams.

118
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:20,857
{\an1}You are right. That is way
better than lying in wait.

119
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,728
{\an1}But if we wanted to, I see a
good spot for it ahead.

120
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,662
Where?

121
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,597
{\an1}Want to check it out?

122
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,910
{\an1}This place is creepy.

123
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,679
{\an1}I can see caves all around us.

124
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,648
{\an1}It seems we found a ruin.

125
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:48,915
A ruin?

126
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,119
{\an1}That's right. Of the Land of
Wind.

127
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,154
{\an1}Yep, as I thought...

128
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,397
{\an1}They're Hidden Leaf shinobi.

129
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,565
{\an1}They're different than
yesterday's bunch.

130
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,336
{\an1}That trio we saw yesterday was
entirely unimpressive.

131
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,171
{\an1}I wonder what these guys are
gonna be like?

132
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,109
{\an1}They're heading right for us.

133
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,244
{\an1}They have a Sensory-type, too.

134
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,413
{\an1}All right, we'll ambush them.

135
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:27,949
{\an1}They're lying in wait for us.

136
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,885
{\an1}What about getting the scroll
they have?

137
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:31,887
{\an1}Well! We'll fight them and grab
it!

138
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,856
{\an1}Looks like they plan to do the
same thing. They're coming!
Right now!

139
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,566
{\an1}Let's not waste each other's
time, here.

140
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,534
{\an1}I'll put it bluntly.

141
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,403
{\an1}We possess the Heaven scroll.

142
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:56,008
{\an1}So, if this is what you're
after, let's cut to the chase
and fight.

143
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,543
{\an1}Unsealing Jutsu: Shuriken!

144
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:00,611
That jutsu...!

145
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:01,146
Rotation!

146
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,316
[gasp]

00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:08,351
[yell]

148
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,655
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu, Gate of
Rainwater!

149
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,356
[grunting]

Why you...!

{\an1}You're not the only one who can
use Transportation Jutsu!

155
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,578
{\an1}They're quite good.

156
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,545
{\an1}That's true,...although...

157
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,216
{\an1}None of them possess large
amounts of chakra.

158
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,249
Ajisai...

159
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,419
{\an1}Unsealing Jutsu! Confetti Storm!

Byakugan!

Let's go!

164
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:19,648
{\an1}They're after us.

165
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:22,151
{\an1}They definitely have a
Sensory-type with them.

166
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,256
{\an1}Water Style! Hidden Drizzle

167
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:41,567
What's wrong?!

168
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:46,771
{\an1}There's so little moisture
around here that my Water Style

advantage of higher ground,
here...

171
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,547
{\an1}It's an impossible battle, but
we have to fight!

172
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,519
{\an1}Take this! Leaf Hurricane

173
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,025

00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:46,424

Ajisai!

[gasp]

188
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,630
{\an1}I can still sense their chakra
underground...But it's deep...

189
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,397
{\an1}All this rubble's in the way...

190
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,334
{\an1}We can't waste time fighting
senselessly.

191
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,604
{\an1}We're going to save our
teammate, now. Please, don't
interfere.

192
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,472
{\an1}The same goes for us.

193
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,442
{\an1}Good idea! Let us all call a
truce for now!

194
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,313
{\an1}After all, we're not at war.
It's just the Chunin Exams.

195
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:53,317
{\an1}The safety of our teammate is
more important than passing.

196
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:58,087
{\an1}We agree to your plan. But,
we'll conduct our own search and
rescue operation.

197
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,326
{\an1}This looks like a ruin from the
Land of Wind.

198
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:06,494
{\an1}I'm guessing Ajisai and the
other kunoichi fell into an
underground corridor.

199
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:12,733
{\an1}If it's a corridor, it has to
connect to somewhere. So, let's
find where.

200
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:19,005
{\an1}Should we just use brute force
and dig from above?

201
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,374
{\an1}There's a risk we could cause a
collapse, that way...

202
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,744
{\an1}We should search for a passage
into the ruins and follow it
underground.

203
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,563
[whimpering]

204
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:51,801
{\an1}What's the matter, Tenten? Just
burn with the passion of youth!

205
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:56,305
{\an1}Let all of your youthful energy
flow! And fill up with burning
chakra!

206
00:16:56,538 --> 00:17:01,676
{\an4}Yeah, but, Guy Sensei,...I
thought we were just going to be
doing some strength training out
here!

207
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,144
{\an1}You're naive, Tenten!

208
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:07,315
{\an1}Somewhere here, your physical
strength is going to reach its
limits.

209
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:10,184
{\an1}Then you'll fall and then you'll
die.

210
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:11,118
I'll die?!

211
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,954
{\an1}To stay alive, you must overcome
the limits of your physical
strength.

212
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:19,625
{\an1}Of course, in order to do
something like that, you must
have a strong will.

213
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:21,361
Yes, Sensei!

214
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:24,730
{\an1}Hi, there! Are you guys cliff
climbing, too?

215
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,065
Hang in there!

216
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,100
Kakashi?!

217
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,634
{\an1}Your arm, why is it behind your
back?!

218
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:35,740
{\an1}Oh, that? It's just a little
habit of mine.  Well, see you
later!

219
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:40,543
{\an1}"See you later?" No way! This is
a rivalry contest! And I'll
finish first!

220
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:42,413
[growl]

221
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,582
{\an1}Don't get so worked up, Guy!
This is only training.

222
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,918
{\an1}And what's wrong with a little
rivalry during training?!

223
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,855
{\an1}Hey, wait! Guy Sensei, please
come back!

224
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,057
{\an1}<i>Just go your own pace!</i>

225
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:56,225
Come on...!

{\an1}Damn it! Damn it!

00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,047
{\an1}Damn it all! Damn...

231
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:25,650
{\an1}Huh? Good job, Tenten. You made
it, huh?

232
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,952
{\an1}Did you overcome your limits?

233
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,989
{\an1}I'm not quite sure...But I feel
like I overcame something.

234
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:34,091
Water?

235
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:41,564
Here.

236
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,233
{\an1}You are convenient, after all!

237
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,436
{\an1}Can you please stop saying
that?!

238
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:48,937
{\an1}I just mean your jutsu's
convenient.

239
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:52,841
{\an1}[slurp and exhale]

240
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:57,945
{\an1}Storing items inside a scroll,
or using a scroll to pull out
items from far, far away...

241
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,848
{\an1}...using the Transportation
Technique, a type of Summoning
Jutsu.

242
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,150
{\an1}You have that skill or you
don't.

243
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,720
{\an1}So, wait, are you saying that
you think I have the skill for
it?

244
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:08,855
Seems so!

245
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:14,093
{\an4}And honing that skill is the
path to gaining the strength and
usefulness that you so wish to
have.

246
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:19,098
{\an1}You think I should hone my
skill? Won't that only increase
my physical strength?

247
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:20,898
{\an1}<i>Your mental strength, too!</i>

248
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:27,405
{\an4}I'm certain that you must be
aware that chakra is the
combination of physical energy
and mental energy, aren't you?

249
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,071
Yes, of course.

250
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:32,375
{\an1}<i>An individual can increase their</i>
<i>chakra by merely training.</i>

251
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,715
{\an4}<i>Simply put, if you're able to</i>
<i>increase your physical and</i>
<i>mental power, your chakra will</i>
<i>increase as well.</i>

252
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,253
{\an1}I'm sure increasing my chakra is
good for me, but what exactly
will happen?

253
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:51,092
{\an4}With the Summoning Jutsu, the
quantity or size of what is
summoned is directly
proportional to the caster's own

254
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:52,227
chakra. So...

255
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,229
{\an1}For example, you just summoned
<i>this</i> amount of water.

256
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:01,734
{\an4}By increasing your chakra, you
could summon enough water to
fill a bathtub, or a lake, or
even an ocean.

257
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,237
An ocean...

[chuckling]

260
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,184
{\an1}And, that is why we will
continue our training to
increase our chakra, Tenten.

261
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,018
Right!

262
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,990
{\an1}We just climbed up, so why do we
have to climb down, too?!

263
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:30,994
{\an1}This is also training! Just burn
with the passion of youth!

264
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:35,731
{\an1}Let all of your youthful energy
flow! And fill up with burning
chakra!

265
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:36,832
Come on!

{\an1}<i>Lee, did you find something?</i>

{\an1}<i>Not yet. I thought this was an</i>
