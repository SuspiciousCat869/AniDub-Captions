00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:59,117
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara)The</i>
<i>Rinnegan's allowing him to see</i>
<i>it.</i>

146
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:04,950
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) And</i>
<i>Naruto,...he can't see it...but</i>
<i>he can sense it...</i>

147
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,217
Naruto!

148
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:12,950
{\an1}It appears that our physical
attacks...have no effect on
this...other Madara.

149
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:14,117
<i>(Naruto) I know!</i>

150
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:22,418
{\an5}<i>(Six Paths</i>
<i>Madara) Normally,...one oughtn't</i>
<i>be able to sense it or see it</i>
<i>from this realm,</i>

151
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:27,751
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) ...the "me"</i>
<i>that exists in the invisible</i>
<i>realm of "Limbo".</i>

152
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,917
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) How'd they</i>
<i>both gain such power so</i>
<i>suddenly?</i>

153
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:41,251
{\an4}<i>(Six Paths Madara) That Sasuke</i>
<i>Uchiha...He awakened the</i>
<i>straight pattern Choku-Tomoe</i>
<i>Sharingan just like mine.</i>

154
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:54,084
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) Sasuke and I</i>
<i>may share some relationship that</i>
<i>goes beyond just bloodline.  </i>

155
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:59,885
{\an1}Then,...I think that left eye of
yours wiill suit me quite well!

156
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,552
[gasp]

157
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:18,385
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) So, that's</i>
<i>your left eye's ability as well,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

158
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,018
[gasp]

159
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:23,385
Well, then...

160
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,285
Go on, try it.

161
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,118
{\an1}That's not enough to kill you,
is it?

162
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:36,018
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) The Six Paths' Sage</i>
<i>Chakra can affect the shadow</i>
<i>Madara, too, huh?</i>

163
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:40,852
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) That wound on his right</i>
<i>arm...</i>

164
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:45,152
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) ...is from when he</i>
<i>blocked Naruto's attack earlier.</i>

165
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:56,619
{\an1}It seems your shadow returns to
your body after a fixed time.

166
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:01,985
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) Naruto, if and when his</i>
<i>shadow emerges again, you go</i>
<i>after it.</i>

167
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:05,685
{\an1}I'll take on the visible one.
However...

168
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,285
[chuckle]

169
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,552
{\an1}I always hated you ordering me
around...

170
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,419
{\an1}I guess some things never
change, huh?

171
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,419
{\an1}Let me finish what I was saying.

172
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,152
{\an1}Listen,...this is our one
chance.

173
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:22,319
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) He and his shadow will</i>
<i>likely stay together for a</i>
<i>little while longer.</i>

174
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,153
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) I don't care what is,</i>
<i>but get a Sage Power Jutsu read.</i>

175
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,787
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) Something that seals</i>
<i>movement.</i>

176
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:36,019
{\an1}<i>(Shukaku) Well, then, why</i>
<i>don'tcha use my chakra to build</i>
<i>your Sealing Jutsu?</i>

177
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:38,686
{\an1}Great, thanks! Um, uh...

178
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,853
{\an1}<i>(Shukaku) It's Shukaku!</i>

179
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:50,753
{\an4}<i>(Six Paths Madara) He's</i>
<i>postulating and estimating the</i>
<i>Limbo's duration, activation</i>
<i>interval,</i>

180
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:51,787
{\an1}<i>and how to counter it...</i>

181
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,820
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) He's got</i>
<i>sharp intuition, calm analyzing</i>
<i>and judgment skills,</i>

182
00:17:56,853 --> 00:18:00,753
{\an1}<i>and a Choku-Tomoe Sharingan</i>
<i>just like mine.</i>

183
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:05,219
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) If he had</i>
<i>only been born earlier than</i>
<i>Obito, he'd be my...</i>

184
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,086
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) No, there's</i>
<i>no point in reflecting on what</i>
<i>could've been.</i>

185
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,919
{\an4}<i>(Six Paths Madara) No matter</i>
<i>what's happened,...I must keep</i>
<i>in mind that these two aren't</i>
<i>ordinary shinobi.</i>

186
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,887
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) I need to get</i>
<i>my other eye back soon.</i>

187
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,887
{\an1}Now, Sage Art: Magnet Style
Rasengan!

188
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,052
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) And I have Six Paths</i>
<i>Power, too...</i>

189
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:29,919
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) Chidori!</i>

190
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:35,353
{\an1}Naruto, send your jutsu to me!
I'll handle the rest.

191
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:38,654
{\an1}It's still a bit annoying, but I
guess that there's no time to
argue!

192
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:40,220
Hm?

193
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,554
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) How'd I get</i>
<i>here?!</i>

194
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:11,821
{\an1}Naruto, the jutsu that the Sage
gave you...You know it, right?

195
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,920
{\an1}Yeah, this is the moment!

196
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:14,987
Huh?

197
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,220
What?!

198
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:17,421
He moved!

199
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,020
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) He substituted in his</i>
<i>shadow?</i>

200
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:25,521
Right there!

201
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,788
{\an1}Sasuke, I'll hold this one down.
You go after the real one!

202
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,987
[grunt]

203
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,320
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) It seems his</i>
<i>Rinnegan can't reach this far</i>
<i>away.</i>

204
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,654
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) I'm starting</i>
<i>to understand your left eye's</i>
<i>abilities,...Sasuke.</i>

205
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,220
{\an1}Sasuke, hurry! Madara's heading
toward...

206
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,789
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) ...Kakashi Sensei!</i>

207
00:19:59,121 --> 00:19:59,988
Huh?

208
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,321
[groan]

209
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,921
{\an1}Hurry up and destroy my
Rinnegan...

210
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,822
{\an1}I can't hold off Black Zetsu any
longer.

211
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:30,288
[gasping]

212
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,588
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) I'll admit,</i>
<i>Sasuke sure is quick.</i>

213
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,088
{\an1}<i>(Six Paths Madara) Kamui!</i>

214
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:53,088
[gasp]

215
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,755
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) Just his upper body,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

216
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:03,522
Do it, come on!

217
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:05,622
I know!

218
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:10,890
[gasp]

219
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:11,756
No.

220
00:22:57,257 --> 00:23:03,757
{\an4}<i>(Obito) The Rinnegan will fall</i>
<i>into Madara's hands. If he gets</i>
<i>both eyes, terrible things will</i>
<i>happen.</i>

221
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,757
{\an1}<i>(Sakura) What do you mean,</i>
<i>"terrible things?" How much</i>
<i>worse can all this get?</i>

222
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,624
{\an1}<i>(Obito) If both Rinnegan are</i>
<i>restored to their true owner... </i>

223
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,590
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "The Infinite Dream"</i>

224
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:16,657
{\an1}<i>(Obito)...I fear no one can</i>
<i>stand against him. </i>
