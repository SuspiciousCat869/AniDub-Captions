1
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,145
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): I
thought we dodged that.

2
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:20,946
-That's it.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,381
{\an1}I can't waste any more time.

4
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,984
I'll finish this
with my new jutsu.

5
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,221
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu.

6
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:29,589
-I see.

7
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:33,193
{\an1}So you've become a sage, and
you've mastered the same jutsu

8
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:35,195
{\an1}as Jiraiya-sensei.

9
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,130
-Jiraiya.

10
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:38,565
{\an1}You called him sensei?

11
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,533
-That's right.

12
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,836
I also learned
jutsu from Jiraiya.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,840
{\an1}He was once my master as well.

14
00:00:44,874 --> 00:00:47,344
{\an1}And that makes us
sibling students.

15
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:49,146
Sharing the same
sensei, we ought

16
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,848
to be able to
understand each other.

17
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,385
{\an1}Our master desired peace.

18
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:58,823
{\an1}-Just shut the hell up already!

19
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,958
-What a massive
amount of chakra.

20
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,795
{\an1}Did you teach him that, Pa?

21
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:04,063
-No.

22
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,299
{\an1}First time I'm seeing it too.

23
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,035
{\an1}He never did that
during our training.

24
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,238
{\an1}I wonder what Naruto
boy's planning to do now.

25
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,807
{\an1}-What's that jutsu?

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,509
{\an1}-What's happening?

27
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,778
-Naruto's chakra
is forming a-- I

28
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,581
{\an1}think it looks almost
like a shuriken.

29
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,984
{\an1}-Wind Style Rasenshuriken?

30
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,320
{\an1}Naruto, what are--

31
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:26,322
{\an1}NARUTO: Everything
you've done here,

32
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:32,196
{\an1}all this destruction, what
part of all that is peaceful.

33
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:35,500
{\an1}PAIN: You simply cannot see
the forest for the trees.

34
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,203
{\an1}You're not able to comprehend
the true meaning of peace

35
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:40,839
{\an1}or what I'm trying
to accomplish.

36
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:43,074
{\an1}Just let yourself be captured.

37
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:46,779
{\an1}Surrender, and your
death will lead to peace.

38
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,681
{\an1}-I already told you.

39
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:49,648
{\an1}Shut the hell up!

40
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,521
-He threw it!

41
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,728
-He did what?

42
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,698
{\an1}When did he learn to hurl
chakra with such high rotation

43
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:05,367
and density?

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,736
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): All my
secret training is paying off!

45
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:21,153
-Incredible.

46
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:21,652
It expanded.

47
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:32,732
{\an1}-Summoning Jutsu.

48
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,654
{\an1}-Well, it appears
that Deidara was

49
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:53,723
right-- this boy
does not listen.

50
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,071
-What was that?

51
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,140
{\an1}What's going on over there?

52
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,109
{\an1}Who could be fighting
against Pain?

53
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:10,977
-It's Naruto.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,477
-What?

55
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,412
Naruto?

56
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:14,648
{\an1}You mean he's back
in the village?

57
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,050
-Yes.

58
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,820
{\an1}He's mastered Sage Jutsu, and is
down there battling Pain alone.

59
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:20,689
{\an1}Are you kidding me?

60
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,729
{\an1}SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Damn this leg.

61
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:30,066
{\an1}-Please, just stay here.

62
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,569
{\an1}Naruto asked that no
one else interfere.

63
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,804
-Man, that guy's
so full of himself.

64
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,140
{\an1}They practically destroyed
the whole village.

65
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:39,142
{\an1}There's no way he can
take them on alone.

66
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:39,910
it's impossible.

67
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:40,411
-No.

68
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,247
It's no.

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,483
If Naruto has
mastered Sage Jutsu,

70
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,186
{\an1}then he's in a class
of his own now.

71
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,221
{\an1}That means staying
out of the way

72
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,924
{\an1}is the best teamwork
that we can offer him.

73
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,727
{\an1}You need to be patient
here, Shikamaru.

74
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,867
-Damn it.

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,370
[theme music]

76
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:53,366
{\an1}-Please, be careful.

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,238
{\an1}When you strike, it divides into
greater and greater numbers.

78
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,541
-So, why didn't
you tell me before?

79
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:01,108
-You see?

80
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:01,675
I'm ungraceful.

81
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:05,913
-All right.

82
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,016
{\an1}So how do we handle this?

83
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:10,653
{\an1}-We must ungracefully
endure it for now.

84
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,428
{\an1}-Sorry, Chief Toad.

85
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,648
-You're really
beginning to slow down.

86
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:38,985
{\an1}It seems that your Sage Jutsu
is rapidly starting to wane.

87
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,021
{\an1}Did you use up your
Sage Jutsu chakra

88
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,690
{\an1}with that last move of yours?

89
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:43,957
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

90
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,928
{\an1}Sage Mode's gonna run out.

91
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,996
{\an1}Before it does, I have to
bring down at least one

92
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,598
of these guys.

93
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,375
{\an1}-Ma, you know what to do.

94
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,446
{\an1}We're gonna have to sever
the Rinnegan's visual link.

95
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,980
-Right.

96
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:03,815
Gotcha, Pa.

97
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,189
-Bunta boy.

98
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,090
-Boss.

99
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,726
{\an1}-Now, listen to me.

100
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,195
{\an1}I'm going to hurl you
straight at Naruto boy,

101
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,463
{\an1}do you understand?

102
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:18,164
-What?

103
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,100
{\an1}You're going to hurl me?

104
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,936
But why, Boss?

105
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,104
{\an1}-I'll tell you, but
listen carefully,

106
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:27,008
{\an1}because we haven't
got much time.

107
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,009
{\an1}-Pa, are you ready?

108
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:35,518
{\an1}Sage Art Wind Style Sand Dust!

109
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,910
-Where are they?

110
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,385
{\an1}-Rasengan Barrage!

111
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,827
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): In his mouth?

112
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,124
{\an1}-You've exhausted
all your Sage Jutsu.

113
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:13,431
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Even in Sage Mode,

114
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:17,637
{\an1}I can only manage two
Rasenshuriken each.

115
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,940
{\an1}-Pa, the boy's no
longer in Sage Mode,

116
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,475
{\an1}so he's vulnerable right now.

117
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,110
-Yes.

118
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,310
{\an1}I'm aware of that.

119
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:25,647
{\an1}-It's going to be dangerous,
but merging with him

120
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,115
{\an1}is our only chance.

121
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,985
{\an1}-Except, we're not
able to do that.

122
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,419
{\an1}-Finally, here's my chance.

123
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,525
MA: What?

124
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,762
{\an1}You mean we can't merge with
him because of that Nine-Tails

125
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:39,996
inside of him?

126
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,332
{\an1}-Well, it certainly
seems that way.

127
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,102
-But then, what
are we going to do?

128
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,638
{\an1}-Naruto boy's come up with
his own unique solution

129
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,007
to this problem.

130
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,509
{\an1}That's what he's about to do.

131
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,318
{\an1}-You little scamp.

132
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,027
Why you!

133
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:06,961
Damn it.

134
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:11,599
-Come on.

135
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:16,372
{\an1}-Over here, Naruto boy.

136
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:16,939
Quick.

137
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:18,008
Give it to me.

138
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,009
I'll do it.

139
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:23,447
-Bring it!

140
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,788
{\an1}-Step back, kid, and let
me take care of this guy.

141
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,423
{\an1}-I'm going to enter Sage Mode.

142
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,459
-What?

143
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:34,593
{\an1}-Get back, Chief Toad.

144
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,296
I don't want my
Rasenshuriken to hit you.

145
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:37,797
Go!

146
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:45,172
{\an1}-Don't go acting all tough.

147
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,178
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can
replenish my sage chakra just

148
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:53,348
{\an1}two more times, which
means that I can only

149
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,785
{\an1}produce four more Rasenshuriken.

150
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:58,187
{\an1}I have to settle this
before I run out!

151
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,094
{\an1}-Let's go, Naruto boy.

152
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,929
{\an1}Now, Reverse-Summoning Jutsu!

153
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,458
{\an1}-I've summoned him.

154
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:31,860
{\an1}Now you can release the jutsu.

155
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,395
-What?

156
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,306
{\an1}-What is going on, Pa?

157
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,674
{\an1}-It's simple really.

158
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:16,545
{\an1}Naruto boy prepared
shadow clones beforehand.

159
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:19,481
{\an1}He had them build up
Sage Jutsu chakra,

160
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,751
{\an1}and then maintain
a holding pattern.

161
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,654
{\an1}All that's left is to
summon them from Mt.

162
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:26,690
{\an1}Myoboku using the scroll.

163
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,193
Once the clone's
summoned, Naruto

164
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:32,331
{\an1}undoes the shadow clone
and the Sage Jutsu chakra

165
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:34,900
{\an1}is fully restored
to the original.

166
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:35,399
-Oh.

167
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:36,134
I see.

168
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,137
{\an1}What a creative solution.

169
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,439
[gasp]

170
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:50,684
-It's over.

171
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:51,452
You're mine!

172
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,050
What?

173
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:18,784
No way.

174
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,033
Wait.

175
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,068
That's right.

176
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,102
{\an1}That's his ability.

177
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,104
{\an1}That one can absorb
any ninjutsu.

178
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:38,540
{\an1}But I thought we already
took care of him.

179
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,793
What is that?

180
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,662
{\an1}-That Pain is the key
player in all of this.

181
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,631
{\an1}-The one Geezer Sage
spoke of, right?

182
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,702
{\an1}So he's the one who can
bring the dead back to life?

183
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:03,536
-Yes.

184
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,706
{\an1}He's the one with that ability.

185
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,309
{\an1}That's why when they are
lined up in formation,

186
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:12,246
{\an1}that Pain took the
rearmost position.

187
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,849
{\an1}The most bothersome is
the Pain on the left.

188
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:21,191
He can repel all
jutsu and attacks,

189
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:23,259
and pull things
toward him as well.

190
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:32,703
{\an1}He hasn't shown his
power yet, which is odd.

191
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,008
{\an1}Perhaps for some reason he's
unable to use his ability now.

192
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,186
{\an1}-Well, whatever the case,
the first thing we have to do

193
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,955
{\an1}is get rid of that
guy in the back.

194
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,232
{\an1}And use smoke bombs, too.

195
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,033
All right.

196
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:09,414
-It's useless.

197
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,791
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What you absorbed

198
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,225
{\an1}was a Transformation Jutsu.

199
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:26,366
-Tricky bastard.

200
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,200
{\an1}You're the original?

201
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,041
{\an1}-There's no time to dodge this.

202
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:34,543
You're done.

203
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:47,424
{\an1}-It seems my power
has finally returned.

204
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,591
{\an1}-You've gotta be kidding me.

205
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,094
He repelled the
kid's Rasenshuriken.

206
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,198
-Just wait.

207
00:15:57,168 --> 00:16:01,006
{\an1}Sage Jutsu Rasengan Barrage!

208
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,507
-What?

209
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,220
{\an1}FUKUSAKU (VOICEOVER): Yes.

210
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,421
{\an1}-That's some nice work, kid.

211
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,004
-Two more left.

212
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,273
-Hold on.

213
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,909
{\an1}How exactly did he
do that anywhere?

214
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,247
{\an1}FUKUSAKU: Well, the first
Rasenshuriken was actually

215
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,417
{\an1}a Transformation Jutsu
performed on Naruto boy himself.

216
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:43,222
{\an1}Pain was unaware of that, and
tried to absorb the jutsu.

217
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:44,056
{\an1}GAMABUNTA: I get it.

218
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,225
{\an1}So that's Naruto appeared.

219
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,130
{\an1}FUKUSAKU: But that Pain can only
absorb ninjutsu, not physical

220
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:54,169
{\an1}attacks, so he took a direct
hit when Naruto tackled him.

221
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:54,668
-Oh.

222
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,937
I see.

223
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,507
{\an1}So that was the purpose behind
that three stage attack.

224
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:12,155
{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): Back then,
he'd already leapt into the air

225
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,524
{\an1}under the cover of the smoke.

226
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,342
Just in time.

227
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,417
-Almighty Push!

228
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:51,368
{\an1}-Are you all right, Naruto boy?

229
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:51,868
-Yeah.

230
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,825
-Damn it.

231
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,793
What was that
jutsu he just used.

232
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,597
{\an1}-It appears the central Pain's
attraction and repulsion

233
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:19,534
{\an1}power has returned again.

234
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:20,068
NARUTO: Yeah.

235
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,103
That one.

236
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,471
{\an1}KATSUYU: Which means
in all likelihood,

237
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:26,008
{\an1}our village was destroyed
by that Pain's jutsu.

238
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,078
{\an1}And the more power that he
uses, the longer the interval

239
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:33,350
{\an1}is before he can power back
up to use another jutsu.

240
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:36,388
{\an1}-That's why he couldn't use
that repelling jutsu until just

241
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,888
now, huh?

242
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:41,226
{\an1}So what do we do?

243
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:44,697
{\an1}I can't use ninjutsu
or taijutsu on them.

244
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,133
-Well, according
to Choji's intel,

245
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,770
{\an1}the minimum interval
between Pain's jutsu

246
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:52,306
{\an1}is only about five seconds.

247
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,909
{\an1}You'll have to target and
strike within that window.

248
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,513
{\an1}-Only five seconds?

249
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,383
{\an1}-Then perhaps our best hope
is to trap him with genjutsu.

250
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,418
-But how?

251
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,452
I'm no good.

252
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:05,988
I can't pull off
genjutsu to save my life.

253
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,357
{\an1}-We'll do it, Naruto boy.

254
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,856
-Yes.

255
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,558
Of course.

256
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:09,892
{\an1}Just like the last time.

257
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:12,262
-The last time?

258
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:13,798
{\an1}MA: That's right.

259
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,701
{\an1}During the battle between
Jiraiya boy and Pain

260
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,369
{\an1}it was going to be
our means of escape.

261
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,753
{\an1}-We've gotcha cornered.

262
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,021
{\an1}There's nowhere for you to run!

263
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:45,967
-Again.

264
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:46,736
Almighty Push.

265
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:52,709
-Chief Toad!

266
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,668
No way.

{\an1}PAIN (VOICEOVER): This is the
farthest that Pain has ever

269
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,658
been pushed.

270
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:02,593
{\an1}Now, don't worry.

{\an1}I'm losing power.

really liked that guy.

{\an1}I remember though.

282
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:41,472
