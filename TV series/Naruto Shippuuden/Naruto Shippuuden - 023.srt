1
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:18,540
-This is starting to get messy.

2
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:20,511
Guess I better
play my next hand.

3
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,854
-So my suspicions were true.

4
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,861
That's the Third's jutsu.

5
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,199
-Brings back memories, huh?

6
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,237
This jutsu is the
reason the Third

7
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,047
is held as the most powerful
ninja the Sand has ever known.

8
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm going to grind
you into dust.

9
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,423
-W-w-what is that?

10
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,229
-The most terrifying
weapon in the history

11
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:04,472
of the Sand Village,
the Iron Sand.

12
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:05,875
-Iron Sand?

13
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:07,245
-Mhm.

14
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,652
This is one of the original
jutsu of the Third Kazekage

15
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,022
himself.

16
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:16,264
Adapted from one used by the
former host of the Shukaku.

17
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:20,139
It can mold particles of Iron
Sand into any shape or weapon,

18
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:22,744
forming the perfect weapon
for every situation.

19
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:25,851
The Third had a special
physical constitution

20
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,922
that allowed him to
convert his infused chakra

21
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,428
into magnetic forces.

22
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,833
This puppet has
the same ability.

23
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,374
It's manipulating the sand by
making it's chakra magnetic.

24
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,244
-How can that be?

25
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,885
Even if it's made from the
body of the Third Kazekage,

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,690
this thing's still
just a puppet,

27
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:46,362
it's not like it's alive.

28
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,600
how can a puppet hold chakra?

29
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,003
-It can't.

30
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:53,377
That puppet is a human puppet,
built from a real body.

31
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,217
It is fundamentally different
from the mother and father

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,285
puppets of mine.

33
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,624
It was made from a real person.

34
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:03,298
Sasori is the only one who
can produce human puppets.

35
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,737
The puppet retains
whatever chakra the body

36
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:06,639
possessed in life.

37
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:12,251
The added benefit
being, the puppet

38
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:16,160
is able to use the same jutsu
it could when it was alive.

39
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:19,166
It's the great advantage
that human puppets

40
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,805
have over ordinary ones.

41
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,745
-There's more to it than that.

42
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:29,656
This puppet is my favorite
out of my whole collection.

43
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,034
-Sakura, get out of here
while you still can.

44
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,508
Leave it to me,
I'll handle this.

45
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,314
This is more than
we bargained for.

46
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:45,623
There is nothing else you
can do, not against that.

47
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,124
-But I--

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,506
-You're to slow.

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,163
You've made some changes, I see.

56
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:38,403
And a chakra shield at that.

57
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:42,345
A definite upgrade since
I last played with them.

crippled by the Iron Sand.

--[chuckle] You have to do
more than just block it.

62
00:04:57,273 --> 00:05:00,179
You have to dodge
this jutsu to survive.

63
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,749
Is that it?

64
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:03,553
Saving the girl is
all you could manage?

65
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:12,305
The Iron Sand has crept into
every crevice of the puppet.

66
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:15,111
As long as I have the
Third's magnetic power,

67
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,281
That puppet is worthless.

68
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:23,763
Let's see, yes, I think it's
time I attack both of you

69
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,567
at once.

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,172
Just to make sure
you're really dead,

71
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:30,077
I'll use my most lethal form.

72
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,320
You won't get away this time.

73
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:59,741
One puppet, two people,
can't protect both.

74
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:02,513
What do you say to
that, you witch?

75
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,085
[chuckle] Which of you will die?

We puppet masters are all alike.

something-- there has

to be something
that even I can do.

-I'll be alright.

162
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,327
It's true, I might
not be rigged up

163
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,605
with a bunch of fancy weapons
like some of these puppets,

164

but the unbending

has been drilled into me.

00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,386
-Huh?

167
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,259
CHIYO (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade, eh?

168
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:03,760
Hm.

169
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,974
CHIYO: You're right,
the Third Kazekage's

170
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:13,581
magnetic forces render puppets
made of iron and steel useless.

171
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,291
-Exactly.

172
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,031
Like my teacher, I can
fight with my bare hands.

173
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,235
-Not this again, you fool.

174
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:45,884
-[gasp]

175
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,782
-[scream]

176
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,171
-How dare you?

177
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:24,567
-That's just the beginning.

NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
Naruto Shippuden

180
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:02,210
gets more exciting
with each episode.

181
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,347
LEE (VOICEOVER): In
the next installment,

182
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,617
my beloved Sakura finds
herself in deep trouble.

183
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:07,421
As Sasori, the evil
puppet master--

184
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:08,558
[chime]

185
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:09,560
REPORTER (VOICEOVER): We
interrupt this program

186
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:10,930
to bring you a
breaking news bulletin.

187
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,635
A massive earthquake has been
reported in the Land of Rivers,

188
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,840
causing the collapse
of at least one cave.

189
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,777
Strong aftershocks
are still being felt,

190
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,149
so caution is advised to
all people in the area.

191
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,352
More later.

192
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,688
LEE (VOICEOVER): Hey, she
cut us of in the middle

193
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,358
of our preview of
the next episode.

194
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:25,728
NARRATOR (VOICEOVER):
What nerve.

195
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:29,336
Take it from the top, Lee.

197
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,938
-Today's topic is
medical ninjutsu.

198
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:48,544
So if your all
ready, let's begin.

199
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,949
Medical ninjutsu consists of
many different techniques,

200
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:53,955
each requiring specialized
knowledge and precise chakra

201
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,258
control.

202
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,296
They are jutsu designed for
treating poisoned wounds,

203
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,999
but there are also
jutsu designed

204
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,772
for inflicting damage in
combat, such as the chakra

205
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,311
scalpel, which attacks the
opponent's nervous system.

206
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:07,651
The ultimate medical ninjutsu
is Lady Tsunade's Mitotic

207
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:08,887
Regeneration jutsu.

208
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,959
Using this, almost
any injury can

209
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:13,330
be healed by the rapid
regeneration of cells,

210
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:15,535
but it requires a
great deal of chakra,

211
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:18,452
and actually shortens
the user's life.

212
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,754
-Now, here's a question.

213
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,591
Which of these is Lady
Tsunade's assistant Shizune?

214
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:27,328
[beeps]

215
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:31,832
-The correct answer
is, C. I know

216
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:34,568
I've got to keep training hard
if I want to be a first class

217
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:36,871
medical ninja, like
Shizune and my teacher.

218
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:37,738
Hiya!

219
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,541
Oops, sorry about that.
