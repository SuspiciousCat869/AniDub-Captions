1
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:13,166
You waste my chakra on
something so trivial?!

2
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,107
And what's got you talking
to me all of a sudden,
anyway? Usually you never

3
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:20,615
say anything to me at
all unless I make you!

4
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,688
What, are you lonely or
something and you want

5
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,827
somebody to keep you
company for a little while?

6
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,637
'Cause I'm kinda busy
now! Let's do this later!

7
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,580
Do you seriously believe
that you can end this war
all by yourself?

8
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,590
We'll talk after
the war. Later.

9
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:49,940
If your comrades are
killed, hatred will arise
from their deaths.

10
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:54,983
Are you planning to defeat
all of the enemy before that
happens?

11
00:02:55,017 --> 00:03:00,762
Then again, if you take down
the enemy, they'll bear you
hatred.

12
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:04,402
You really think you
can take all that
on by yourself?

13
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:08,243
If you do, then you're
completely deluded.

14
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:16,192
Stop treating me
like I'm stupid!

15
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,533
[angry roar]

16
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,774
You don't understand a
thing! You're so naÃ¯ve!

17
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:29,185
Do you honestly believe...
that you can take on and
erase everyone's hatred?!

18
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,527
The war has already started.

19
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,269
I bet there are a lot
of casualties by now.

20
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:43,213
And the resulting hatred
to match as well...

21
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,285
You've seen it first hand.

22
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,797
Your former teammate Sasuke
has been gripped by hatred
for a long time.

23
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,205
Have you ever really
been able to do anything
for him at all?

24
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:05,290
No matter who you're dealing
with, no one can erase or
fight that much hatred.

25
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:08,531
And you certainly can't
take it all on yourself.

26
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:09,966
Okay...

27
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,241
You finished?

28
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:16,547
What did you say?

29
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,922
Hey...

30
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,614
You're the one who
doesn't get it!

31
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:38,858
Who are you to be so
confident, when you couldn't
even save Sasuke?

32
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,970
Once you question your
beliefs, then it's all over.

33
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:50,380
I don't know how yet, but I
will find a way to save
Sasuke... And stop this war!

34
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,988
[growling]

35
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,960
Hah!

36
00:04:56,994 --> 00:05:01,637
So... the little brat thinks
it's all grown up, does it?

37
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,751
Hey... Ya know what,
Nine Tails...

38
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,523
[chuckle]

39
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,128
I believe... I'm gonna come
after all of that hate

40
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,900
that's inside of
you, too, someday!

41
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:20,608
You've made me miserable
my whole life.

42
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:24,516
But I know just how bad it
feels to be at the mercy of

43
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:27,421
your hatred and to
feel ruined by it.

44
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,427
[growling]
Are you stupid!?

45
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,174
I am the Nine Tails! I
can't and won't be changed
by some mere brat!

46
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,978
I am hatred!

47
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,652
That's fine by me.
'Cause I'm not a
little brat anymore.

48
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:45,090
And it's more
challenging this way.

49
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:45,825
Later!

50
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,972
Hmph! So arrogant...

51
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:13,514
Look, we Tailed Beasts
can't really trust you.

52
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,787
If you want me to-

53
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,924
Oh, it's okay.

54
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,934
I think I've got a pretty
good idea of what I need
to do, anyway. [chuckle]

55
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:29,345
Naruto...

56
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:34,656
I've watched you all these
years... seen all that
you've done...

57
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,595
You should already know...

58
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,670
It doesn't really matter
what you try to tell a
Tailed Beast...

59
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:47,548
Your true feelings won't
be transmitted to us.

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,604
Are you leaving, Sakura?

61
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,773
Yes.

62
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:02,845
Because the battle here is
beginning to wind down...

63
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,118
And by now we've tended
to all the critical cases.

64
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:14,101
The first and second units
have already gone on to
aid other companies.

65
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:18,176
Now we're gonna have to go,
too, so we can support
Naruto and Bee.

66
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,954
We'll have to leave the
rest of their care to you.

67
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:28,129
It's no problem at all. We
non-combatants can take
care of the wounded.

68
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:32,104
But I'm more worried
about Naruto and the
others at the front.

69
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:36,178
The battle up there is far
more intense than anything
we've experienced here.

70
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:38,483
Yes, I know...

71
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:41,455
But he always
lands on his feet...

72
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,961
Sakura, you ready?

73
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:44,796
Yes!

74
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,034
Be careful.

75
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,436
The rest is in your hands.

76
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,287
All right...

77
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,224
I know what to do now.

78
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:01,395
Well, I'd better
get going, then!

79
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,099
[growling]

80
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,341
Hurry! It seems Madara has
sniffed out your location.

81
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:11,783
Yo, it's time to unlock
the noose! I gotta get
Naruto loose!

82
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,958
So, there you are...

83
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:19,566
I will just pull you
in, Four Tails and all.

84
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,286
Not good!

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,290
Get out of there!
Open your trap!

86
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:33,894
Naruto! In a snap!

87
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,004
[angry growling]

88
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,616
I've got to get
out of here!

89
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:56,172
[grunting]

90
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,550
It won't budge at all! This
just isn't gonna work...

91
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,760
<i>I need to make him</i>
<i>spit me out...</i>

92
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:10,968
Vomit!

93
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,141
Overeating!

94
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,082
Multi Shadow
Clone Jutsu!

95
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,420
[groaning]

96
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,188
Hm?

97
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:24,294
Huh?

98
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:31,075
[painful grunts]

99
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:39,926
Didn't expect so many Naruto
on the plate! He's smart to
make him expectorate!

100
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:45,738
Okay!

101
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,140
I made it out!

102
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,879
All right. Now...

103
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:54,923
Listen up! Look carefully
around the base of my neck.

104
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:58,296
There's a rod sticking
out of it back there.

105
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,703
The chakra chains that
restrain me come from it.

106
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:06,312
They're chains from the
Rinnegan using Gedo Statue.

107
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,182
Huh? It's not on
your chest?

108
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:11,288
But that's where
the Jinchuriki
that I saw had it.

109
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:16,432
It's because we expand in
size. When we undergo Tailed
Beast Transformation, the

110
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,238
rods migrate to the
base of our necks.

111
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:22,979
Since we're bigger, they
become harder to find, too.

112
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:26,218
[angry growling]

113
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,826
You just do not know
when to give up, do you?

114
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,897
Find that rod
and pull it out.

115
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,671
That'll stop the chakra
chains from forming.

116
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,675
Come on, where is it?!

117
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,347
Hey! Found it!
There it is!

118
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,590
All of my other restraints
should vanish along with
the chakra chains as well.

119
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,727
But it won't be easy...

120
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,200
Remember, I'm being
controlled, so I
will attack you.

121
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,828
Yeah, I know that. I figured
that things might get a
little bit rough.

122
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,665
But bear with me, okay?

123
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,101
[chuckling]

124
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:28,744
Just don't go overboard
and kill me, all right?

125
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,068
[grunting]

126
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,574
<i>I can't keep this mode up</i>
<i>for too much longer.</i>

127
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,678
<i>I'm gonna push it to</i>
<i>the max, though!</i>

128
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:48,416
[attack yell]

129
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,037
Gotcha!

130
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,210
Do it, Naruto!

131
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,983
C'mon!

132
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,959
<i>It's moving!</i>

133
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,197
Ah, Naruto...

134
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,203
[screams]

135
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,911
This will not be easy.

136
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,585
Just what the hell is...

137
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,887
...this power?!

138
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,664
Those rods bind
all they touch.

139
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:34,742
They're even stronger
restraints than Nagato
Pain's Gedo Powers!

140
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,180
[strained grunts]

141
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:38,282
Naruto!

142
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,821
We should retreat for now!

143
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:43,292
Hmph!

144
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,067
[screaming]

145
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:10,514
[grunting]

146
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:15,691
They have a strong enough
binding force to restrain
even us Tailed Beasts...

147
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,563
So how are you
going to move it?

148
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,942
It is over,
Naruto Uzumaki!

149
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,548
[strained grunting]

150
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,161
In the end, it's
always the same.

151
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:43,446
Some day, you'll see!
I'll be Lord Hokage!
I'll show you!

152
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,216
I'll show all of you!

153
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:49,157
One of these days, I'm
gonna be the Hokage.

154
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:53,399
I'll surpass... every
last one of them who
came before me!

155
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,671
And when that day finally
comes, everyone in

156
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,342
the village will
respect me at last!

157
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:02,918
Now, the final test will
be on the Clone Jutsu.

158
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:08,830
"Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu."

159
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:13,272
Aw, not this again! That
one is my worst jutsu!

160
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,443
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

161
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,597
[laughs]

162
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,841
Hah! There's no such thing
as a hero... You're just
full of stupid ideas.

163
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,947
I'm going to prove it.

164
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:35,984
I'll prove that...

165
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,559
...it's true! In this world
there are real heroes!

166
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:42,631
Sorry I'm a little late.

167
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:47,608
But you know how it is:
heroes usually show up
at the last minute.

168
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,099
I vow to win!

169
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:04,307
All of those shinobi were
born destined to become
Hokage...

170
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,247
It's not something you
become just by trying.

171
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,619
Each one of them was
chosen by destiny.

172
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,864
I don't quit.

173
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:18,135
And I don't go
back on my word.

174
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,483
[painful coughs]

175
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:27,755
That's right. But if you
think you're the one who

176
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,961
can prove me wrong,
well, be my guest.

177
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:33,098
You got it! I'm gonna show
you you're wrong about

178
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,303
a lotta things,
starting right now!

179
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:46,693
[screaming]

180
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:53,874
What's the point of teaching
it to someone who can never
master it, you old fool!?

181
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:59,384
Giving him false hopes
like that. Filling his
head with stupid ideas.

182
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,958
Making him think he could
actually be Hokage some day.

183
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,707
Little kids think
life is so easy...

184
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:14,916
That's why they're
always going on and
on about their dreams...

185
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,353
That's why they
never give up.

186
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,426
They chase some stupid
dream and die...

187
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:35,189
Until I become Hokage, I
don't care what happens! I
am not gonna die!!

188
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,695
Rasengan!!!

189
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,719
You with no answers and no
solutions... Just give up!

190
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:05,751
Just give up...

191
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,022
...on trying to make...

192
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:10,126
... me give up!

193
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,397
Rasengan!

194
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:24,187
No! Never! How can I believe
in Jiraiya's words after all
of this?!

195
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,227
There never will be such a
thing as true peace!

196
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,433
Not as long as we're
forced to live in
this accursed world!

197
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,540
Peace is impossible!
Impossible!

198
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,046
Well, then...

199
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:41,188
I'm gonna break that curse
one day. If there's truly
such a thing as peace in

200
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,595
this world, then
somehow, I'll find it.

201
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,068
And I'll never give up!

202
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:50,807
You...

203
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,647
But that's...

204
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,418
Those words,
it can't be...

205
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,692
That's right.
You know them.

206
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:04,234
All of those words,
are taken right out
of this book?

207
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:08,008
The very first novel that
Pervy Sage ever wrote.

208
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:12,317
He was seriously trying to
change the world with his
message.

209
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,287
And in the back of it, he
wrote about a student

210
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,859
who helped provide
him with inspiration.

211
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:18,830
It was you, Nagato.

212
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,138
But...

213
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,687
The name of the hero
in this novel...

214
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:35,262
His name is...

215
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,172
His name's Naruto!

216
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,284
[heavy breathing]

217
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:52,463
Huh?

218
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,541
[cheering]

219
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,360
Naruto...

220
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,130
You did well.

221
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,246
Welcome home!

222
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,891
[cheering]

223
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:32,143
Hmph...

224
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:35,784
Hey, Ya know what,
Nine Tails...

225
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:38,556
[chuckle]

226
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,294
I believe I'm gonna come
after all of that hate

227
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,869
that's inside of you,
too, someday!

228
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:48,676
So that's the reason... I
want to help you, too...

229
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,761
Naruto, if you're absolutely
serious and truly wish

230
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,366
to do something for
us Tailed Beasts...

231
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,076
Just do what you've
always done...

232
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,311
Not yet...

233
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,628
All right!

234
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,314
[grunting]

235
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:26,986
<i>I hope you can</i>
<i>sense this okay!</i>

236
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,800
<i>The real me's on the</i>
<i>outside, right about here.</i>

237
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,340
<i>I told you that things</i>
<i>might get a little rough.</i>
<i>Hope you understand.</i>

238
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,749
<i>I'm gonna shove the rod</i>
<i>out... from the inside!</i>

239
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,322
Keeping doing what you've
been doing and prove

240
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:48,630
yourself through your
actions, Naruto!

241
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,201
That's who you are!

242
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,238
All right! Frog Slap!

243
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:08,570
[screaming]

244
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,443
I got it!

245
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:21,729
That's right, that's
the Naruto I know!

246
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,059
<i>Let's do this, Octopops!</i>

247
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:03,031
<i>Right! We'll fight as a</i>
<i>two-man team with me taking</i>
<i>the lead.</i>

248
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:05,870
<i>Listen, Naruto, you just</i>
<i>cover my back, agreed?</i>

249
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:08,876
<i>Octopops, you and Eight-o</i>
<i>are both injured right now.</i>

250
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,014
<i>There won't be any</i>
<i>leading or following!</i>

251
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:15,857
<i>Since we're both already</i>
<i>in two-man teams! We're</i>
<i>going in together!</i>

252
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,366
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Two-Man Team"</i>

253
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,506
<i>Hold on, Naruto.</i>
<i>Don't tell me you-</i>
