150
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,981
{\an1}This work is so boring,
isn't it, Shoseki?

151
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:45,050
{\an1}Can't argue there, Sensei.
It's boring, all right.

152
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,684
Please, guys.
Just normal ones.

153
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:49,385
{\an1}We aren't leaving
without our order!

154
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:57,154
[sigh] What a
let-down...

155
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,489
Hey, what's the matter,
Captain? You look
so disappointed.

156
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:04,491
{\an1}Oh, it's just...
I was hoping for
some new ninja tools.

157
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,457
But not those, huh?

158
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:10,292
{\an1}The other members of Team Guy
mostly specialize in
close-contact fighting,

159
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:14,559
{\an1}so in battles I often have to
hang back and provide them
with back-up from a distance.

160
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:15,927
{\an1}Oh, I get it.

161
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,561
{\an1}Don't get me wrong;
I don't mind doing that.

162
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:22,263
{\an1}But I was really hoping that I
could find some new ninja tools

163
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,964
{\an1}that would allow me to fight on
the front lines for a change.

gathered from their development

301
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,861
{\an1}to create an even more
powerful ninja tool.

302
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,029
Please, I really
need to use it now!

303
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,163
{\an1}<i>[Iou]</i>
<i>It is...</i>

304
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:58,829
{\an1}The Jidanda!

305
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,531
Those brats are pretty
good at close combat.

306
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,265
you'll be fine if you
keep your distance.

307
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,300
I wouldn't be
so confident.

308
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:08,367
Huh?!

309
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,402
Because I'm your
opponent now!

310
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:13,670
Hup!

311
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,305
That thing is...

312
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,205
Jidanda?!

313
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,073
How cool!
That thing
looks awesome!

314
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,208
'Course it's
also enormous...

315
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,108
And heavy!

316
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,475
{\an1}<i>[Iou]</i>
<i>It's not about strength!</i>

317
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,210
{\an1}It's about your technique!

318
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:35,277
Technique...

319
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,544
That's Iou's
new invention?

320
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:40,245
{\an1}Hand it over quietly,
and we'll let you live.

321
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,979
No, this
is mine!

322
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:44,280
{\an1}Then we'll just
take it from you!

323
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:49,683
[gasp]

324
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:50,616
Damn!

325
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,849
{\an1}Neji!

326
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,585
{\an1}You're going down first!

327
00:17:58,718 --> 00:17:59,719
Eagh!

328
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,387
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

329
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:06,555
Let's go!

330
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,289
Heh. Rapid fire!

331
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,190
Agh! Augh! Ah!

332
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:14,724
Oof!

333
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,426
Neji! Naruto!

334
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:21,894
{\an7}<i>I've gotta do something!</i>
<i>I'm the team captain!</i>

335
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:28,530
{\an1}Rgh! Of all the times for
me to run out of ammo.

336
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,699
{\an1}Locked and loaded!

337
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,066
{\an1}Whoa. Man, what
was that weapon?!

338
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:37,866
I don't know.

339
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,967
{\an1}All right.
Let's end this.

340
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,268
{\an1}Guys! Get out of the way, now!

341
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,001
Huh?!

342
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:47,936
Waah!

343
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:52,272
{\an1}She used the handle
to attack us?!

344
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,006
{\an1}That thing stretched
just like my spear does!

345
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:56,206
You got this?

346
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,708
Yeah, you bet!

347
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,174
Ha!

348
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:08,911
{\an1}Just stay back and let
me handle this one!

349
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,345
Uh... Okay!

350
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:11,412
Go!

351
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,779
Go! Go! Go!

352
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,583
{\an1}She intends to control
it through the recoil
of the explosions!

353
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:25,984
Ha!

354
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:30,019
Go!

355
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,389
{\an1}Those blasts aren't just
to move that metal ball.

356
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,690
{\an1}They also create a
defensive shield.

357
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,224
Go!

358
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:46,626
Hrrrrah!

359
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:48,891
{\an1}I'll stop her!

360
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,892
Right!

361
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:58,529
{\an1}We did it!

362
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,663
Nice job!

363
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,598
Now... Go!

364
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:05,198
{\an1}Eyaah!

365
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,133
{\an1}No way!

366
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,668
[relieved sigh]

367
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,670
{\an1}<i>[woozy groans]</i>

368
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:17,670
<i>[Iou]</i>
<i>Well done!</i>

369
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,371
You handled Jidanda
like a champ!

370
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,038
{\an1}Thanks, Sir Iou!

371
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:25,373
{\an1}Does that mean you're
going to let me have
Jidanda for my very own?!

372
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,939
Ah, no, sorry.

373
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:27,873
{\an1}What?

374
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:30,874
{\an1}I noticed a few adjustments
that need to be made to it.

375
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,709
Shoseki, let's
get started.

376
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:35,276
{\an1}Thank you, I'll go ahead
and take that, please.

377
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,677
{\an1}Hey! Wait!

378
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,877
{\an1}But you can't!

379
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:43,713
You know, you really
are quite adept with
ninja tools.

380
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,213
{\an1}You may take all the first-
rate weapons you like.

381
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,947
{\an1}[sigh]

382
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,482
We did complete the
mission, Tenten.

383
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,249
Yeah, you shouldn't be
disappointed at all!

384
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:56,050
And I gotta admit,
you were really
cool, Captain!

385
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,917
{\an1}I guess
you're right.

386
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:01,152
Well...

387
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:03,620
Thanks!

388
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:09,455
Are you ready?

389
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:10,622
Huh?

390
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,423
Okay!

391
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,659
{\an1}I hope they're done making
the adjustments to Jidanda!

392
