1
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,084
-Lady Tsunade.

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,319
The defense barrier and
the reanimation jutsu

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,622
have been defeated, and the
area around the main gate

4
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,724
is beginning to
return to normal.

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,360
Furthermore, the lightning
jutsu that Asuma spoke about

6
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,995
in his report, the
one that threatened

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,763
to incinerate the
village in an instant,

8
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,133
has been disabled before
it could be activated.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,101
-Very well, then.

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,273
What's that?

11
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,140
That red light?

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,841
[groaning]

13
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,250
-Sora!

14
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,787
[theme music]

15
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,060
-What is it, Asuma-sensei?

16
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,728
What's happening to him?

17
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,562
-I don't know.

18
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,169
[laughter]

19
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,537
-That's right, Sora.

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,237
Get angry.

21
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,505
Get angry!

22
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,575
Channel all that
anger into real power.

23
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,578
Use your hate to smash
the people of the Leaf.

24
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,980
To crush them into dust.

25
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,849
-Stop saying that.

26
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,186
I'll never do these
things you want me to do.

27
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,887
I wasn't brought into
this world for that.

28
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,790
-Of course you were!

29
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,992
Your life's purpose
is to serve the cause

30
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,295
of unifying the Land of Fire.

31
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,097
And the time has
finally come when

32
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,833
your powers are required, Sora.

33
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,568
-I don't understand
a word of this.

34
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,404
What's this guy talking about?

35
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,171
-Wait a minute.

36
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,018
-Asuma!

37
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,787
-Kazuma!

38
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,388
-It is you.

39
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,624
But it can't be.

40
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,594
[laughter]

41
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,062
-Asuma-sensei.

42
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,963
Tell me, what is it?

43
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,998
Do you know this guy?

44
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,032
-I do.

45
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:31,638
He was one of the
Guardian Shinobi 12.

46
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,572
-Well, whatever.

47
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,640
I don't care who you are.

48
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,342
What did you do to Sora?

49
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,644
-I just made use of this
scraps you left behind.

50
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,480
That's all.

51
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,650
-What did you say?

52
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,120
-You see, Sora is
a lot like you.

53
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:47,621
-No!

54
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,122
Stop!

55
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,591
[screaming]

56
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,449
-Sora!

57
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,258
-Naruto!

58
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,494
-What is this?

59
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,362
What is this pain?

60
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,497
Is it true, then?

61
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,667
Am I really turning into
the-- the Nine Tails?

62
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,004
-But how?

63
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,574
How on earth did
you do it to him?

64
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,008
-Heh, heh, heh.

65
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,777
You should know
about it far better

66
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,481
than I. Have you forgotten the
Nine Tails' attack on the Leaf

67
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,450
that ended with the
Nine Tails being sealed

68
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,888
in the body of an infant, at
the cost of the Fourth Hokage's

69
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,256
life?

70
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,758
This meant the Leaf possessed
the power of the Nine Tailed

71
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,060
Fox.

72
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,530
Not wanting to be outdone,
we seized the opportunity.

73
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,532
We gathered up all
the scattered remnants

74
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,269
of the chakra left behind
after the Nine Tail's rampage.

75
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,672
We nurtured it, and
then, five years later,

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,442
implanted it in Sora.

77
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,543
-Monster!

78
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,078
But Sora is your own--

79
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,712
-Yes.

80
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,113
What of it?

81
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,082
Were we to sit by
while the Leaf gained

82
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,417
such an advantage in power?

83
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,418
No.

84
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,287
We needed to find
such power ourselves,

85
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,956
in order to protect our king.

86
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,958
Is that so wrong?

87
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,567
-Naruto, what are you--

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,002
-I knew it.

89
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,303
That's right.

90
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:43,803
All along.

91
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,975
Yeah, I knew it.

92
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:57,017
And yet I-- that
voice-- I knew it

93
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,453
had to be Sora's
voice, crying out.

94
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,688
So why?

95
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,525
Why didn't I do anything
about it back then?

96
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,896
After all, I was the one,
the only one who could really

97
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,065
understand the pain
behind those cries.

98
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,838
It was the same back
at the temple, too.

99
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:22,409
Eyes all around
him, watching him.

100
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,712
Those cold, hateful eyes.

101
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,148
Silently saying, go away.

102
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,649
Get out of here.

103
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,956
It was the same for me.

104
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,360
I know what it's like.

105
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,530
I felt those same
eyes, watch me.

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,437
-Naruto.

107
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:03,783
-Grown ups' eyes, with stares
that stab you like daggers.

108
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,085
Those eyes.

109
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:09,255
I know those eyes really well.

110
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,792
-What does all of
that matter now?

111
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,362
-Eyes like those,
looking at us like

112
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:19,165
we're not human, but freaks
that belong in a cage.

113
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,035
And all the time, you're
trying to exploit us

114
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,236
for your own twisted ends!

115
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,645
It was the same way with Gaara.

116
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,451
You people-- don't you ever
stop to think how we might feel?

117
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,153
And now Sora.

118
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,722
Sora.

119
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,992
Who gave you the right to put
that monster inside of him?

120
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,740
Why?

121
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,109
Why did you have
to do that to Sora?

122
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,411
-Enough of this.

123
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,284
-Naruto!

124
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,265
-Sora.

125
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,534
-Stay away from me!

126
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,536
All of you, stay away from me.

127
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,375
It won't work anymore.

128
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,677
I won't be fooled by you.

129
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,047
Killing my father, and then
thinking you can be my friend?

130
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,353
And all your talk of
my special powers.

131
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,488
You tricked me!

132
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,389
-Sora.

133
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,158
-I told you, stay away!

134
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,662
No matter what you say,
you're still just another one

135
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,263
of the Leaf, aren't you?

136
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,698
I can't trust you!

137
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,241
-Wait.

138
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,476
What's happening now?

139
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,453
[screaming]

140
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,154
-Wait a minute.

141
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:21,754
What's going on?

142
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,922
This is impossible.

143
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,226
Why is Sora-- That's
the Nine Tails Cloak.

144
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,560
-Can it be?

145
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,729
His cells are
actually becoming one

146
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,364
with the cells of
the Nine Tails.

147
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,072
[screaming]

148
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,713
-What is this?

149
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:04,516
-Something terrible
has been set in motion.

150
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,152
-Unlike the case
with your Jinchuriki,

151
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:10,756
the Nine Tails' chakra is
too powerful for Sora's body.

152
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,159
For the past 10 years, I've
had to maintain the balance

153
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:17,429
by suppressing the chakra
with a sealing juts.

154
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:20,065
But now, the seal
has been released

155
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,468
and the balance has been lost,
with the inevitable result

156
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:26,571
that Sora's body is
being taken over.

157
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:31,143
Once the ninth tail appears,
he'll no longer be Sora at all.

158
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:34,946
Our simulated Nine Tails will
have become the real thing.

159
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:40,719
-Why, you--

160
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:49,528
-That's right.

161
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,497
I forgeit my body to the Fox.

162
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,100
And I do it gladly!

163
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,435
-Sora--

164
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:01,039
-A small price to pay for
the power to smash the world.

165
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,179
-Stop this!

166
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:07,679
Sora!

167
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,818
-Wood Style!

168
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:13,318
Dome Wall!

169
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:26,331
SAKURA: Naruto?

170
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,769
-It's Sakura.

171
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,737
-Naruto!

172
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,371
-Asuma.

173
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:35,674
-Captain Yamato.

174
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,609
-What on earth was
that red light we saw?

175
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:46,051
Is that-- it looks like--

176
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,686
-No doubt about it.

177
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,589
It's the Nine Tails cloak.

178
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:53,592
-Not only that, it's Sora.

179
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,660
-What did you say?

180
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:56,228
-Good.

181
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:58,096
Well done, Sora.

182
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,498
Show them more.

183
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,032
Give them a taste
of your real power.

184
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:06,238
-Fight it, Sora.

185
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:07,105
Fight it!

186
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:07,873
Don't let it out!

187
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:15,046
-Why don't you shut up?

188
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,014
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

189
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:23,822
-Naruto!

190
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,365
-Where ya been, Shikamaru?

191
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,066
-You're sure about this, then?

192
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,469
-Is Akamaru's nose
or mine ever wrong?

193
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:38,937
It's not just Sora out there.

194
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,673
Asuma-sensei and Naruto
are with them as well.

195
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,441
And there's the trace
of another scent.

196
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:45,110
Someone not from the village.

197
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,746
-The enemy?

198
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,514
What in the world was that?

199
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,964
-Watch out!

200
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,442
Naruto, are you all right?

201
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,443
-Yeah.

202
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:20,912
-That was a little too close.

203
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,747
-Do I really have
to do everything?

204
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:31,056
-You fight me now, Kazuma.

205
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,600
-Hey, Captain Yamato?

206
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,535
Can't you control that
Nine Tails chakra,

207
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,470
like you did with
me on the bridge?

208
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,440
-I was able to restrain the
chakra in you because you're

209
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,875
wearing the necklace
of the First Hokage.

210
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:54,012
I can't do that with
Sora, because he's not.

211
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,318
[screaming]

212
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,897
-Sora, no!

213
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:13,665
-No?

214
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:15,500
It's still like that, huh?

215
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,869
You never wanted
me, or needed me!

216
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:19,237
-It was never like that!

217
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:21,172
We just don't want you
to let that power loose.

218
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:22,674
We can't let you do it!

219
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,209
-And why is that?

220
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:27,045
Only because I'm
the one who has it?

221
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,716
This power you fear so much
is the only thing I trust now.

222
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,784
-Sora.

223
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:35,854
-At last, I'll have
revenge on everyone

224
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:37,022
who ever made me an outcast!

225
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:56,207
-Naruto?

226
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,511
-I'm so tired of this power.

227
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:04,215
Of so many people
getting hurt by it.

228
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:07,052
[groaning]

229
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:11,289
-Not that long ago, I even
hurt Sakura with it once.

230
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:20,899
-The person who injured
Sakura, it was you, Naruto.

231
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:24,202
If you continue to
rely on its power,

232
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:27,372
not only will you
hurt yourself, Naruto,

233
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:31,176
you'll be endangering the lives
of those around you, as well.

234
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,579
-And that's why I
can't let you do it.

235
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:38,950
I can't let you hurt anyone
else with this power of ours!

236
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,151
-What do you mean, ours?

237
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,454
You don't know the
first thing about it!

238
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,222
-I know everything about it!

239
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,527
You really didn't know that
the Nine Tails within you

240
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:54,432
was created from the
Nine Tails within me?

241
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,200
-Within you?

242
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,937
What are you saying?

243
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,873
-That I'm the Jinchuriki.

244
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,875
-What are you talking about?

245
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,810
No.

246
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:06,811
-Sora--

247
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:07,779
-No.

248
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,280
Stay back.

249
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:13,952
All your words--
you can't trick me.

250
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,353
You won't trick me!

251
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,465
-Shadow Possession
Jutsu complete.

252
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:31,703
-Shikamaru.

253
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:32,437
Choji.

254
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,937
-Ino!

255
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,878
-They're here.

256
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:40,712
-What's this?

257
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,347
More friends come to save you?

258
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,048
-Go for it, Choji.

259
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:45,250
-Right.

260
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:48,153
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

261
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:50,488
Both hands!

262
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,256
-Get off!

263
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,657
Get off me!

264
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,191
-Yeah!

265
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,125
He got him!

266
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,427
-Now he won't be
able to get away.

267
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,737
-It can't be right.

268
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,939
Doesn't make sense.

269
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:11,042
If you've really got the
Nine Tails inside you,

270
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,611
how can you have
so many friends?

271
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:15,847
You should be an outcast.

272
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,482
Why aren't you alone?

273
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:19,217
Like I've been?

274
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,454
Like I've been all these years?

275
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:24,989
-It was the same with me, too.

276
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,591
Once.

277
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:30,061
When I was little, for the
most part I was left on my own.

278
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:34,032
But even then, you see, I didn't
have the time to be lonely.

279
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,801
I was too busy getting
people to notice me.

280
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:39,137
And it finally worked.

281
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,904
Yep.

282
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,272
I made friends like these.

283
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:43,007
Good friends.

284
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,976
-I have no friends.

285
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:45,977
I have no friends at all.

286
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,479
-You're wrong.

287
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:51,216
I'm-- I mean, all of
us are your friends.

288
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:53,117
-Huh?

289
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:54,986
[groaning]

290
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,726
-Too hot!

291
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,462
-Choji!

292
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,129
Ino!

293
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:08,233
-Right, I'm on it.

294
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,468
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

295
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,176
-Did she do it?

296
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:25,917
[scream]

297
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,684
-What is it?

298
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:29,387
-Are you all right?

299
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,355
-Ino!

300
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:33,925
What happened with
the mind transfer?

301
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:38,696
-There was-- there was no human
consciousness left in him.

302
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,298
-What?

303
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:42,066
-I'm afraid I've
hit the wall, too.

304
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:49,307
[growling]

305
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,250
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

306
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:00,752
The third tail.

307
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:30,982
[theme music]

308
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:00,371
SAKURA: Captain Yamato,
something's wrong with Naruto.

309
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,906
YAMATO: Don't tell
me his Nine Tails

310
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,142
chakra is starting
to emerge, too?

311
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:05,510
SAKURA: Oh, no.

312
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,612
YAMATO: That's all we need,
him going on the rampage again.

313
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:09,180
SAKURA: But how can
this be happening?

314
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:12,183
He's still wearing the First
Hokage's necklace, isn't he?

315
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,918
YAMATO: Something's
different this time.

316
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,486
The necklace isn't helping.

317
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,154
Blast!

318
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,355
What's going on?

319
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:21,092
My jutsu won't work!

320
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,062
NARUTO: Next time, Resonance.
