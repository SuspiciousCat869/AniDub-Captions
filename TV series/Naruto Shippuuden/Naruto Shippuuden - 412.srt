{\an1}You abandoning your
teammate?

147
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,919
{\an1}Let us call a truce. And we
can fight together!

148
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,755
{\an7}If we act quickly, we can
still save them!

149
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:09,659
[exhaling]

150
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:10,493
All right...

151
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,528
{\an1}Please, help us with saving
Fuu.

152
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,296
Sure!

153
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,408
I see...

154
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:45,849
{\an1}<i>From what I can tell, that</i>
<i>priest is vulnerable to a</i>
<i>strike from his back. </i>

155
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:52,319
{\an1}So, this is my plan. First,
we'll divide into two
groups, an attack team and a

156
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:53,521
rescue team.

157
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,957
{\an1}The attack team will sneak
in close and approach him
from behind, and then, while

158
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,391
{\an1}he's distracted by them...

159
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:02,393
{\an1}...the rescue team will move
in and free both our
friends.

160
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,797
{\an1}Lee and Matsuri, accompanied
by you two, will attack.

161
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,497
Understood.

162
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:10,865
{\an1}All right! We will go
pulverize him!

163
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,733
Can I be on the
rescue team?

164
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,502
{\an1}No. I'm sorry but I need
Tenten for that. The two of
us will go.

165
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,537
You got it!

166
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,471
Scatter!

167
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:28,243
{\an1}Shuriken Shadow Clone
Jutsu!

168
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,279
{\an1}Water Style: Water Shuriken!

169
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,647
{\an1}Deadly Shell Meteorite!

170
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,282
Leaf Hurricane!

171
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,652
{\an1}Dharma Barrier: Celestial

What is that?!

174
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:48,990
{\an1}Some defensive jutsu?!

175
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:53,126
{\an1}There is something else
going on here, too. We have
to be careful!

176
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,060
Hm?

{\an1}Tenten, I need a Chakra

179
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,043
{\an1}I'm on it!

180
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:25,180
Ha!

181
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,617
{\an1}<i>I just need to find a</i>

182
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,792

00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,395

184
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,463
Huh?!

185
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:56,399
[grunting]

186
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,735
This means... we
can't get close to him.

187
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:01,703
{\an1}That barrier is impregnable!

188
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:06,439
{\an7}At this rate, we'll be
useless! No help to Lord
Kazekage!

189
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,440
{\an1}No, this is fine.

190
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:10,142
{\an7}Huh?

191
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,611
{\an1}Just drawing the enemy's
attention away will make
Neji's job easier, and

192
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,745
that is what we
came here to do!

193
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,713
{\an1}Are you all right,
Neji?

194
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,183
{\an1}Are you two doing okay?

195
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:26,286
{\an1}You see?! Someone came to
help, after all!

196
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:29,288
{\an1}I gave very strict orders
not to tell anyone.

197
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:31,955
{\an1}They were just worried about
you. Please, don't be too

198
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,091
angry with your
subordinates for that.

199
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:43,997
{\an1}<i>It's just as I suspected.</i>
<i>Those chains have penetrated</i>
<i>your Chakra Points. And</i>

200
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,099
{\an1}<i>they're disrupting your</i>
<i>Chakra Networks. </i>

201
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,034
{\an1}<i>They're controlling the</i>
<i>flow of chakra through your</i>
<i>Chakra Points... and</i>

202
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,502
{\an1}<i>siphoning off your Tailed</i>
<i>Beast Chakra. </i>

203
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:58,673
{\an1}That's right. And as the
Tailed Beast Chakra weakens,
he'll be able to extract the

204
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,341
{\an1}Beasts themselves.

205
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,142
{\an1}Can you do something to
help?

206
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,577
{\an1}Whether it's Tailed Beast or
not, chakra is chakra.

207
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,180
{\an1}If we block the Chakra Point
being used to siphon the
Tailed Beast Chakra...

208
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,949
{\an1}...then we just might be
able to staunch its flow.

209
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,616
{\an1}Is that possible?

210
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,586
{\an1}It is. It's sure to be
tricky, but it's still
worth a try.

211
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:20,887
Do it.

212
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,758
{\an1}<i>There it is! Gentle Fist... </i>

213

Uh?!

217
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,463
What happened?

218
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,932
I think that...

219
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,335
{\an1}...the Tailed Beast Chakra
is so powerful that it
repelled me.

220
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:47,437
{\an1}I had no idea that it would
be as unbelievably strong as
that!

221
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:56,476
{\an1}Like that time before. The
force of the Nine Tails
Chakra inside Naruto was

222
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,945
{\an1}almost unimaginable.

223
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:04,149
{\an1}<i>It appears that the Tailed</i>
<i>Beast Chakra inside Gaara</i>
<i>and Fuu... is just as</i>

224
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,916
{\an1}<i>powerful as Naruto's. </i>

225

trying! Please, we're

Huuuuuuh!

229
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,267
{\an1}All right! It's stopped!

230
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,534
{\an1}You're right!

231
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,270
Get ready, Fuu.
You're next!

232
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:38,537
