{\an1}<i>...saying I've got regrets...?!</i>

4
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:30,228
{\an1}You once told me...that you're
nobody,...that you don't wanna
be anybody.

5
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,561
{\an1}But the truth is you wanted...to
be Hokage, just like me.

6
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,094
{\an1}<i>You can hide behind a mask, but</i>
<i>it's pointless. </i>

7
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:43,294
{\an4}<i>You were Kakashi Sensei's</i>
<i>friend,...my dad's</i>
<i>subordinate,...an Uchiha like</i>
<i>Sasuke,...</i>

8
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:53,661
{\an1}<i>...my senior,...and a Leaf</i>
<i>shinobi, who shared the same</i>
<i>dream as me. </i>

9
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:58,026
{\an1}You used to have the same dream
as me.

10
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,394
Now, you're the
opposite of a Hokage!

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,827
{\an1}It's 'cause you're just like me
that-

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,993
No, it's...

13
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:05,260
{\an1}...because of that.

14
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,460
{\an1}That's why I wanted to see you
despair about this world.

15
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:15,427
{\an1}Or I suppose I wanted to feel
again for myself...

16
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:20,494
{\an1}...that the path which I've
chosen is indeed not a mistake.

17
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:29,394
{\an1}There's no need to voluntarily
walk a rugged path, whose
destination isn't even clear.

18
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:32,127
{\an1}And step over comrades' corpses.

19
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:38,659
{\an1}So, any person who's sensible
would choose a shortcut with
a fixed outcome.

20
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,626
That's right...

21
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,259
{\an1}The goal a Hokage should seek
is to create world peace.

22
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:49,426
{\an1}You don't know what you're
talking about.

23
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,092
{\an1}What I want to know isn't the
shortcut or the easy path...

24
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:58,593
{\an1}...but how to navigate the
rugged one!

25
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:03,992
{\an1}But,...in the beginning, how can
you tell which one is the
rugged path?

26
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:08,693
{\an1}I  mean,...you never really know
until someone starts walking
down it!

27
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:16,625
{\an4}<i>A Hokage is the one who walks</i>
<i>ahead of everyone else, enduring</i>
<i>their own pain. So, that's</i>
<i>why...</i>

28
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:20,225
{\an1}...a Hokage never walks over his
comrades' corpses.

29
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:27,625
{\an1}There's no shortcut to becoming
Hokage! And no way out for the
one who becomes Hokage!

30
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,692
<i>Correct?</i>

31
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,392
{\an1}<i>I just messed up a little</i>
<i>bit,...got some dust in my eyes</i>
<i>and, uh...</i>

32
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,759
Ouch!

{\an1}<i>Don't act tough and hide your</i>
<i>wounds. You know that I am</i>
<i>always watching.</i>

35
00:02:57,157 --> 00:03:00,923
{\an1}You told me that saving you was
the same as saving the
whole world, remember?

36
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,257
{\an1}Well then, since I'm keeping
an eye on you...

37
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:07,491
{\an1}...you can't hide anything from
me anymore.

38
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,357
Uh-huh.

39
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,858
{\an1}Go for it, Obito!

40
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,758
{\an1}Become Hokage and show me just
how you're gonna save
the whole world.

41
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:19,758
{\an1}And that's another promise for
you to keep!

{\an1}You are only a brat nowhere

{\an1}And you stole my line, foolish

{\an1}<i>You said it means that true</i>

{\an1}That the person who obtains...

169
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:30,070
{\an1}...the power of both the Uchiha
and the Senju will be able to
attain true happiness.

{\an1}It appears to me that...

173
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,237
{\an1}...you've been doing a lot of
plotting since leaving the
village.

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,237
No...

175
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,470

comrade came up with simply by
chance.

like me.

<i>However...</i>

178

{\an1}My coming back to life, as I've

{\an1}<i>So this is Sage Art Chakra...</i>

{\an1}That's it, huh? That's really
all there is to it?

189
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,868
{\an1}This'll be easy enough to
control.

190
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,900
{\an1}Now that you're flesh and blood
again, this will give us the
perfect chance...

00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:04,234
{\an1}...to kill you for good...

Madara has...

perpetually and greatly

Okay, gotcha.

{\an1}He's a good-for-nothing traitor
who went against Madara's plan.

222
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,530
{\an1}Now,...until Obito dies,...I'm
going to use his body to fight
you.

{\an1}It's only fair that he be useful
at the end.

killing you would be sich a

joining up  with me, as a

{\an1}Oh, please. Make no mistake...In
my mind, you're nothing but a
dead man.

00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:29,096
{\an1}Very well, then...But either
way,...you don't have a whole
