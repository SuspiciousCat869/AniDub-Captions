00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:15,716
Let go off me!

174
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,083
Let me finish the fight.

175
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,289
Gozu?

176
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,257
Ugh, ugh!

177
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,765
‐Uh?

178
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:35,135
‐I won't let you get to her.

179
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:35,636
Aargh!

180
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:39,573
‐Aargh!

181
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,892
‐[gasping]

182
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,835
‐[gasping]

183
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,170
‐Kakashi Sensei,
are you all right?

184
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,173
‐Yeah, but Guren got away.

185
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,308
‐Agh!

186
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,143
She was the key to
finally finding Yukimaru!

187
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:19,119
‐It's a shame because my
insects performed flawlessly.

188
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,420
But she escaped anyway.

189
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:25,592
‐OK, we'll split up and search.

190
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:26,960
Naruto, go with Shino.

191
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:27,961
Sai, with me.

192
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,438
‐You told me that the
enemy was formidable

193
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,473
and was burning with
a passion to fight!

194
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:41,675
‐What's the deal?

195
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,976
They were kind of lame.

196
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,077
‐Well, yeah.

197
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,379
It's like he was a
totally different person.

198
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,715
‐I bet the others aren't going
to be much of a challenge

199
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,550
either.

200
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,684
‐Humph.

201
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,052
‐Don't let your guard down.

202
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,554
‐Uh, yes.

203
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:56,256
‐Remember, even Kakashi had
his hands full with her.

204
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,458
The crystal user is no joke.

205
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:01,067
‐I cannot wait to face
her in battle and test out

206
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:01,635
my taijutsu!

207
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,740
‐We'll split into two groups.

208
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:09,710
Lee and Tenten, guard the
Sealing Team by the lake.

209
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,045
We'll join up with the others
fighting the Crystal Style

210
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:12,813
user.

211
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:13,479
Got it?

212
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:14,014
‐Got it.

213
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,348
[dog barks]

214
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,517
‐What?

215
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,151
I will not be fighting
the Crystal Style user?

216
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:18,952
‐You can never be‐‐

217
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:19,953
‐Aargh!

218
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,187
‐‐‐sure where the
enemy may appear.

219
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,723
I said don't let
your guard down.

220
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,389
LEE: Yee‐‐

221
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,157
LEE AND TENTEN: Yes!

222
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:28,394
‐Huh?

223
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:30,764
See that?

224
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:31,965
‐Yes, I know.

225
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,800
It's closer.

226
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,136
‐It's directly below us.

227
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,070
‐I sense it.

228
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:46,012
‐We're moving past the search
mode of the Four‐Corner Sealing

229
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:46,813
Barrier.

230
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:48,549
Keep your breathing steady.

231
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:49,716
Here we go!

232
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,151
ALL: Four‐Corner
Sealing Barrier.

233
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:51,652
Bind!

234
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,435
‐We'll lower the net into
the water very quietly.

235
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,404
We can't let the
Three‐Tails detect us.

236
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,107
‐See, it is the
Three‐Tails, Deidara.

237
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,875
Wait, he's not here, is he?

238
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,277
Huh?

239
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,615
Does he intend to stop them?

240
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,115
‐Huh?

241
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,082
Enemy!

242
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,050
‐Uh!

243
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,951
‐Keep concentrating.

244
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,420
HINATA: But‐‐

245
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,656
‐Leaf Hurricane!

246
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,156
‐What the‐‐

247
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,127
HINATA: Lee!

248
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,529
Tenten!

249
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,697
‐We took care of the
enemy on the other side,

250
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,865
so we hurried here.

251
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,767
I am glad we did.

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,702
And now, that I am
here, I will not

253
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,038
allow you to lay a
finger on these four!

254
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,674
‐The others should have
stopped you in your tracks.

255
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,942
‐You mean, your friends?

256
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,611
They were no match for us!

257
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:46,046
RINJI (VOICEOVER): Damn!

258
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,013
Kigiri and the others.

259
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,685
‐I am your opponent now.

260
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:52,185
‐Tch.

261
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:55,656
‐What?

262
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:56,790
He's running away?

263
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,092
TOBI: Oh, this is bad!

264
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,669
At this rate, the Three‐Tails
is going to get sealed.

265
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:05,271
But if I go out there,
I'll be outnumbered.

266
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,673
Right, Deidara?

267
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,441
Oh, yeah, he's not here!

268
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,179
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Hm.

269
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:16,683
Completely useless, all of them.

270
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,753
That Leaf ritual will
seal the Three‐Tails.

271
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:23,156
They would rather no one gets
the power of the Tailed Beast‐‐

272
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,758
unless I stop them.

273
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:34,635
Yukimaru.

274
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:37,671
‐Guren.

275
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:45,979
Please, the white camellia
can't become a red one.

276
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,313
Come back.

277
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,882
Promise me you will.

278
00:16:55,121 --> 00:17:00,466
‐Go‐‐ Gozu, why did you‐‐ oh.

279
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:06,039
Hm.

280
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,153
Yukimaru?

281
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,822
[gasps]

282
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:22,322

‐[gasps]

285
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,542
No, that grass‐whistle.

286
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:46,046
Uh, ha‐ah, uh, no.

287
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,314
That's‐‐ that's impossible.

288
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,051
Huh.

289
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:54,755
[sobs]

[grass‐whistle music]

292
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,511
GUREN (VOICEOVER): Was I
responsible for that boy's

293
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:11,211
mother?

294
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,580
Did I do it?

295
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:14,581
No!

296
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:15,348

‐[gasps]

298
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:17,784
‐Ready to go?

00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,119
‐You're here.

300
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,755
But I thought you returned
to Lord Orochimaru's hideout?

301
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:23,790
‐Something more
pressing came up.

302
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:27,227
Those Leaf ninja have started
to seal the Three‐Tails.

303
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,662
‐Huh?

304
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:31,397
‐We'll use Yukimaru to
control the Three‐Tails,

305
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,200
then obliterate their
pesky little barrier.

306
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:38,304
‐Uh, huh, Kabuto,
we need to talk.

307
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:41,207
‐This isn't really the
time for a chat, Guren.

308
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,843
‐But I must know.

309
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:46,212
If we force Yukimaru to unleash
his hidden powers, please,

310
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,948
you must tell me
what will happen.

311
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:48,849
‐I see.

312
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:50,350
Is that all you're
worried about?

313
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:51,585
‐I have a right to know.

314
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:52,352
Tell me!

315
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,987
‐Why are you so upset?

316
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,826
Live or die, Yukimaru's fate
has nothing to do with you.

317
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,267
‐No, Kabuto.

318
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,468
It does.

319
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:06,139
‐Aw, so even the devil
sheds a tear now and then.

320
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:08,709
You've murdered countless
people over the years.

321
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:13,680
To think, you actually have
a soft spot for Yukimaru.

322
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:14,981
That's a shocker.

323
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,650
‐This one is special.

324
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:17,651
‐Why?

325
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:19,319
Because you murdered
the boy's mother?

326
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,521
‐How did you know?

327
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,723
‐Hah, that's nothing.

328
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:25,692
It's just as Lord
Orochimaru predicted.

329
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:29,229
He knew that you would develop
feelings for the child.

330
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:33,466
Why do you think he
chose you for this?

331
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:38,905
If you prefer, I can
inform Yukimaru for you.

332
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,174
That the kind and
gentle Guren, whom

333
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,177
he believes is the one
he can come home to,

334
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,514
is actually the evil villain
that killed his mother.

335
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:48,915
‐Stop it!

336
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:51,818
‐Fine, as long as you carry out
my orders without hesitation.

337
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,448
‐Tenten, stay alert.

338
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,151
We do not know when the enemy
will be appearing again.

339
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,729
‐You made him feel close to you.

340
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,097
‐[laughs]

341
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,305
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Lord
Orochimaru, I hate to admit it,

342
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,744
but you were absolutely
right to select that woman.

343
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,346
‐Guren will grow
to love Yukimaru?

344
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,481
Is that even possible?

345
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,616
‐Hm.

346
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,520
Kabuto, you have much
to learn about people.

347
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:56,657
The more time you spend
with another person,

348
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,125
the stronger your bond becomes.

349
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,035
This is simply human nature.

350
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,837
‐Really, my lord?

351
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,308
‐And with those two‐‐ well,
their ties run quite deep,

352
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:11,244
it's likely that Guren
will disobey my command

353
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,113
and betray me.

354
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,114
And when she does‐‐

355
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,355
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): I suppose
that moment has arrived,

356
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:23,323
Lord Orochimaru.

357
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,967
[music playing]

358
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,769
‐Sai, how is it?

359
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:05,739
‐I'm not picking anything up
from the Crystal Style user.

360
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:09,242
‐She used up considerable
chakra during that last battle.

361
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,877
Now is the time to strike.

362
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,746
I don't want to let her recover.

363
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,680
SAI: Agreed.

364
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:15,381
I'll widen the
scope of my search.

365
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,449
‐Come on!

366
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,018
Where did she run off to?

367
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,520
‐Naruto, patience is the key.

368
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:20,721
‐Yeah, I know.

369
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:24,958
But that kid, I just
got to find him.

370
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:29,530
Next time, "The Battle
Over the Barrier."
