1
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:59,688
{\an1}Because he'd never give up
on his dreams or on reality.

2
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,192
That's the kind
of guy he is.

3
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:10,333
{\an1}And the way he forges
ahead draws others to him.

4
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:12,769
{\an1}He makes you want
to reach out when

5
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,505
{\an1}he's about to stumble.

6
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:17,173
{\an1}The larger and greater
the support behind you, the

7
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,875
closer you can
get to your goal.

8
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,119
{\an1}Naruto's path, huh?

9
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:31,589
Now take this!

10
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:34,125
{\an1}Massive Rasen Shuriken!

11
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:40,298
{\an1}If comrades you trust gather
around you, hope can take

12
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:43,335
{\an1}physical form and
become visible.

13
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,669
{\an1}That's what I believe.

14
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:48,440
Then perhaps...

15
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,919
{\an1}That Wood Dragon will
continue absorbing

16
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,320
chakra from you!

17
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:04,956
{\an1}Your chakra-absorbing
ninjutsu is nullified.

18
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,893
{\an1}You can't move or
absorb this jutsu!

19
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:09,828
Good timing!

20
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:11,663
Nice going, son
of the Fourth!

21
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,133
{\an1}Let's get him with
this and seal him away!

22
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,808
{\an1}Naruto aimed his attack over
in that direction so that's

23
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,377
where Madara is!

24
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:27,046
{\an1}Naruto, over here!

25
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:28,848
Let's go!

26
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,016
Thanks, Sai!

27
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,286
{\an1}Don't waste any time!

28
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,819
Now's our
chance to seal him!

29
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,490
{\an1}We won't let Naruto's
attack go to waste!

30
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:41,461
{\an1}Without any orders or even
a single word, everyone's

31
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:44,198
{\an1}galvanized into action.

32
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,833
Naruto...

33
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:49,470
[chuckle]

34
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,004
{\an1}And I'm one of them, too.

35
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,740
Shukaku...

36
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,478
{\an1}I'd like to borrow the power
of your Sand to seal Madara.

37
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,982
You mean Grand
Sand Mausoleum?

38
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,150
That's right.

39
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,685
{\an1}A giant one, too.

40
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:05,220
[laughter]

41
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,158
{\an1}I'm no longer bound to
you or any Jinchuriki.

42
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,193
{\an1}What makes you think
I'd listen to you

43
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,229
{\an1}after all this time?

44
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,097
{\an1}I'm not ordering you.

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,666
I'm asking you.

46
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,202
{\an1}If you refuse, fine.

47
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,538
I'll lean on
another's power.

48
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,444
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

49
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,580
{\an1}Seems you've become rather
close friends with that Fox

50
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,782
{\an1}Demon's brat, Gaara.

51
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,587
{\an1}If you're not lending a
hand, let's chat later.

52
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,088
I'm going in.

53
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,089
[chuckle]

54
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,757
You know, that
tone of yours really

55
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,627
{\an1}gets under my skin!

56
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,862
{\an1}Tanuki are mightier
tricksters than Foxes!

57
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:50,267
I won't be
one-upped by a stupid fox!

58
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,272
{\an1}I'm not doing this
because you asked!

59
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,675
I'm doing it
because I want to!

60
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:00,411
Now, lead on!

61
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,581
This way.

62
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:05,216
Right, then...

63
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:06,517
Hold on.

64
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,718
Huh?!

65
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,956
We all want to
help out as well!

66
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,761
{\an1}So that's the reason.

67
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,595
{\an1}I wanna help you, too.

68
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:19,563
Relax.

69
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,333
{\an1}We're not doing this
on a whim or anything.

70
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:25,404
{\an1}We simply want to
help Naruto out.

71
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:29,874
I thank you.

72
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,678
{\an1}Tell me this, Sand
Shinobi, are you a

73
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,879
{\an1}friend of Naruto's, too?

74
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,889
Quick! Run!

75
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,090
Use the
buildings as shields!

76
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,258
But listen!

77
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,460
Don't go inside!

78
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,161
If they fall,
they'll crush you!

79
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,664
[roaring]

80
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,715
[gasp]

81
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:11,652
You okay?

82
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:12,486
Yeah...

83
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,821
[coughing]

84
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,226
Huh?

85
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:21,362
Wait, is that?!

86
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,630
{\an1}That's my kid brother?!

87
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:24,798
He's a-?!

88
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,633
[growling]

89
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,445
[giggling]

90
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:44,853
Hello, there!

91
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,392
Uh, hello?

92
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,431
Hello!

93
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,181
[gasp]

94
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,182
It's him!

95
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,383
Run!

96
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:17,219
Hey, wait!

97
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,656
No!

98
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,489
Please, help me!

99
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,892
{\an1}Don't leave me alone!

100
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:26,763
I hate this!

101
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,432
I hate it!

102
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,635
{\an1}Everyone goes through
their lives hurting others.

103
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,637
{\an1}And being hurt...

104
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,175
{\an1}But it's not so easy for
us to hate one another.

105
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,143
Huh?!

106
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,825
{\an1}I know I'm not bleeding...

107
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,695
{\an1}But lately I've felt
a lot of pain, here.

108
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,934
That is a wound
of the heart.

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,435
Nothing has more
trouble healing, but

110
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,003
{\an1}there is a cure it's love.

111
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:08,473
It's love?

112
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,143
{\an1}Love is the heart's desire
to serve someone precious to

113
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:15,012
{\an1}you, to keep a careful watch
over them, to care for them,

114
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:17,416
{\an1}to keep them safe no
matter what happens.

115
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:19,785
{\an1}Why don't you die?!

116
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:21,420
[gasps]

117
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:22,588
He's a monster!

118
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,056
{\an1}Don't even look at him!

119
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,224
[crying]

120
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,025
I told you to
stay away from him!

121
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,695
Go away!!

122
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,397
{\an1}Your name is Gaara.

123
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,902
{\an1}A demon that loves
only itself as you must.

124
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,770
{\an1}Love no one else.

125
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:41,407
{\an1}Fight only for yourself.

126
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,746
{\an1}Because you were never
loved at all, Gaara.

127
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,415
[screaming]

128
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,069
[roaring]

129
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:10,972
He's a monster!

130
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,906
Don't you feel
anything at all?!

131
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,407
Kankuro...

132
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:46,876
{\an1}They were our friends!

133
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:48,109
[gasp]

134
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,049
{\an1}And you killed them!

135
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:54,817
{\an1}They were friends
from our village!

136
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,319
{\an1}Don't you feel anything...

137
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,988
{\an1}...right in here?!

138
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,289
Doesn't your
heart hurt, Gaara?!

139
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:02,425
Shut up.

140
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,260
{\an1}Or I'll kill you.

141
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:11,068
{\an1}I was a killing machine
from the time I was born, an

142
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,936
{\an1}uncontrollable monster.

143
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,974
{\an1}My mother died giving birth
to me, the village ignored

144
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,876
{\an1}me, my siblings avoided me.

145
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,381
My father tried
to assassinate me.

146
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,853
{\an1}I was all alone and
a solitary weapon

147
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,554
{\an1}didn't need a heart.

148
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,460
{\an1}Then I was sent to
destroy the Leaf Village.

149
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,363
{\an1}That's where I met him.

150
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,117
Let's go...

151
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,353
Hey!

152
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:02,354
You!

153
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,389
With the gourd.

154
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,057
{\an1}Identify yourself!

155
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:09,561
{\an1}My name's Gaara of the Sand.

156
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,098
{\an1}I'm curious about you too.

157
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,266
Who are you?

158
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,771
{\an1}I am Sasuke Uchiha.

159
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,843
{\an1}Hi there, I bet you're dying
to know my name, right?

160
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,346
{\an1}I couldn't care less.

161
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,015
Naruto Uzumaki.

162
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:32,619
{\an1}My first encounter with
him was uninteresting.

163
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:35,089
However...

164
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,759
I vow to win!

165
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:43,097
{\an1}With every subsequent
encounter, his words and

166
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,800
{\an1}actions towards his friends
began to send ripples

167
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,368
{\an1}through my heart.

168
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,208
{\an1}What the heck do you
think you're doing

169
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,743
{\an1}in here, you rat?!

170
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,279
{\an1}I was going to kill him.

171
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:02,416
{\an1}Stay out of my way or
I'll kill you, as well.

172
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,218
Oh really?!

173
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,587
Well, let's just
see you try it!

174
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,488
{\an1}Hey, whoa, there,
take it easy, all right?

175
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,491
{\an1}This guy fights like
he's mad, like he's

176
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:10,859
{\an1}a demon or something!

177
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:12,160
Yeah, fine.

178
00:12:12,194 --> 00:12:13,795
{\an1}He can act like a
demon, but guess what?

179
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,831
{\an1}There's a real one in me!

180
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,602
{\an1}What's more, he started
to have an effect on me.

181
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,840
{\an1}He wasn't like the
others who merely

182
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,208
{\an1}provoked hatred in me.

183
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,579
{\an1}Who are they to you?!

184
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,416
{\an1}They're my friends
is who they are!!!

185
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,818
{\an1}You try laying so
much as another finger

186
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,220
{\an1}on the two of them...

187
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,455
{\an1}And I will pulverize you!

188
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,657
Worried for your
so-called friends?

189
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,860
{\an1}That's your big mistake.

190
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:46,629
When I fight...

191
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,467
{\an1}I fight for me alone!

192
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,402
{\an1}He's no different than I am.

193
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,706
{\an1}Going through life with
the exact same sadness and

194
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,142
loneliness that
I had to carry.

195
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,246
{\an1}He fought only for himself,
never relying on anyone, and

196
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,149
{\an1}because of that, I thought
that he possessed strength.

197
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,123
{\an1}I dunno, I guess I
should'a known better.

198
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,125
That's not what
real strength is.

199
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,729
{\an1}If you never fight for
anyone but yourself you'll

200
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,765
{\an1}never be strong, no
matter what you do.

201
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,169
Haagh!!

202
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:27,206
{\an1}Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

203
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:32,811
{\an1}Na-Ru-To-2K Uzumaki Barrage!

204
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,216
{\an1}From Naruto's Handbook!

205
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,887
There's no way.

206
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,058
{\an1}There's absolutely no
way I'm gonna lose

207
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,627
{\an1}to a guy like him!!!

208
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,168
{\an1}The more I drove him
into a corner, the

209
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,369
{\an1}harder he fought back.

210
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,372
Summoning Jutsu!

211
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,014
{\an1}Transformation Jutsu!!

212
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,684
[attack cry]

213
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,854
Rise and shine!

214
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,595
{\an1}Time and time again...

215
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,631
...after
hitting rock bottom.

216
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,172
Die!

217
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,573
{\an1}I've had it with you!

218
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,590
{\an1}What could it be that
makes him so strong?

219
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,928
But why?

220
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:56,298
{\an1}Why would you do this
for anyone but yourself?

221
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,804
{\an1}'Cause they're my friends.

222
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,973
They all saved
me from myself.

223
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:08,211
{\an1}And they rescued me
from my loneliness.

224
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:11,814
They were the
first to accept me.

225
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:23,593
{\an1}"Love" Is that the thing
that makes him so strong?

226
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,630
{\an1}That day would come to
hold special meaning for me.

227
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,833
{\an1}I learned that he grew up
under the same circumstances

228
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:34,570
{\an1}as I, yet chose a
different way to live.

229
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:38,608
{\an1}And that my strength was
directly connected to this.

230
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,448
{\an1}I know what I must do.

231
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:47,319
{\an1}I must clear my own path...

232
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:49,653
{\an1}And perhaps then...

233
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:54,159
{\an1}The day will come
when I can be like him.

234
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,430
{\an1}I want to be part
of this village.

235
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,433
{\an1}So I will aiming for the
title of Kazekage,

236
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,702
{\an1}as a shinobi of the Sand.

237
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:05,737
Gaara...

238
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:09,607
I will work hard
and connect to the

239
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,344
{\an1}people of this village.

240
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:15,046
{\an1}Watching Naruto Uzumaki
has brought me clarity.

241
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:19,884
{\an1}Until I met him, my
ties to others brought

242
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,321
{\an1}only pain and sorrow.

243
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:27,293
{\an1}But he was always pushing
me to redefine those ties.

244
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,528
I think I
finally understand...

245
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,899
{\an1}The suffering and
sadness of life, the joy.

246
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,236
{\an1}These are feelings
that can be shared

247
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,770
{\an1}with those around me.

248
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,141
{\an1}He's the whole reason
my eyes have opened.

249
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:46,113
{\an1}He's known the same pain I
have and he taught me that I

250
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:50,183
{\an1}can change the path
my life will follow.

251
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,121
{\an1}I'd like to become something
precious to others too.

252
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:58,125
{\an1}Not just to be viewed as
some hideous weapon, but as

253
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,894
{\an1}the Sand's next Kazekage.

254
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,299
{\an1}I was able to take a
step forward away from my

255
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,567
{\an1}pessimistic outlook on life.

256
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,905
{\an1}And I became the Kazekage.

257
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:15,877
{\an1}I have gained more friends,
and I continue to strive to

258
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,946
{\an1}be someone who is
needed by others.

259
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,017
{\an1}With my head held high, I
stood as his equal, and step

260
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:26,488
{\an1}by step, I aimed for
the day when I could be

261
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:28,190
{\an1}acknowledged as his friend.

262
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:30,892
However...

263
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:48,445
{\an1}Whose hand is this?

264
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,848
It's- It's mine.

265
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:01,491
{\an1}Does this mean I've become
someone that people need?

266
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:06,930
Who's that?

267
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,334
Is that me?

268
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:15,772
Yes, it's me.

269
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,809
{\an1}Me, wanting to be
needed by someone.

270
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:24,647
{\an1}Why- why did I want that?

271
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,985
{\an1}Why did I yearn for that?

272
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:36,894
Those eyes, that
nose, that mouth.

273
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,098
Why?

274
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,469
{\an1}Why is that Gaara?

275
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:47,606
I was in there.

276
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:49,808
No!

277
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,677
{\an1}What am I anyway?

278
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:58,650
{\an1}I'm only aware of
being me, so who am I?

279
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:07,093
{\an1}Am I anything more than just
this small consciousness?

280
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:10,029
Gaara!

281
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,898
Gaara!

282
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,267
Who is that?

283
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:15,968
Who's...

284
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:17,870
{\an1}Who's calling me?

285
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,705
Who is it?

286
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:22,108
This hand...

287
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:27,147
{\an1}Oh, it's just my hand again.

288
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,882
My hand...

289
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:34,454
Me...

290
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:38,626
Who am I?

291
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:44,499
I- I am...

292
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,978
{\an1}When the Akatsuki
extracted the Tailed

293
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,582
{\an1}Beast from me, I died
but was revived.

294
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,252
{\an1}Thanks to Lady Chiyo
using a Forbidden Jutsu

295
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,921
{\an1}to trade her life for mine.

296
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,658
And thanks to
Naruto's chakra.

297
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:11,893
...so long.

298
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,095
Uh, yeah...

299
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,805
{\an1}I guess this is where
people shake hands

300
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,406
{\an1}and get all choked up.

301
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,508
{\an1}But, I've never really
been very good

302
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,910
{\an1}at that stuff either.

303
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,745
So let's just
leave it-- [grunt]

304
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,383
{\an1}I thought that I'd have
to try my hardest to be

305
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,285
{\an1}accepted by you as a friend.

306
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,523
{\an1}I thought I had to become
someone who was essential to

307
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:44,861
{\an1}others, someone people
looked up to, but...

308
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,071
On that day, we
came to understand

309
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:56,806
{\an1}and accept each other.

310
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,977
We were already
friends, weren't we?

311
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,714
What's wrong?

312
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:07,218
{\an1}I asked you if you're
Naruto's friend, as well.

313
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:08,119
I am.

314
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,221
{\an1}He was my first friend.

315
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:12,290
[chuckle]

316
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,730
{\an1}All right, let's hurry.
