1
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:19,000
{\an1}This time you won't
reach the other side!

2
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,335
[growl]

3
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:47,075
{\an1}I am still standing. It is
the opposite of last time.

4
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,710
I just wanna
protect the dream

5
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:56,445
{\an1}that I realized. We
have fought enough.

6
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,446
{\an1}You look pretty depressed
right now, Hashirama.

7
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:05,413
Cannot just perk
back up this time, eh?

8
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,782
{\an1}It's impossible to
show what's inside

9
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,183
{\an1}us to each other?

10
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:19,417
{\an1}The first step is to not
give up on our ideals.

11
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,818
{\an1}And we're gonna have
to get stronger, too.

12
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:24,286
Let's build our
settlement right here!

13
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,487
{\an1}It's often said that
wherever there's a will,

14
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,555
{\an1}there's a way, and yet, I.

15
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,155
That dream's now
becoming reality.

16
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,829
{\an1}A Wood Style Clone!

17
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:06,264
{\an1}I cannot believe my
back was taken.

18
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:11,165
{\an1}I will protect our-
no, rather, my village.

19
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,667
{\an1}Whatever it takes...

20
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,766
{\an1}I still believe that
protecting the village

21
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,934
{\an1}will in turn lead to
the protection of all the

22
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,135
people, shinobi
and children!

23
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:26,303
I won't forgive
anyone who would dare

24
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:27,303
{\an1}to threaten the village.

25
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:31,838
{\an1}Be they friend, sibling,
or even my own child.

26
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,641
{\an1}You have changed,
Hashirama.

27
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:44,174
{\an1}I made a resolution that
day that I would endure

28
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,676
in order to wach
over the present.

29
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,577
{\an1}You have got your
priorities backwards.

30
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:56,112
{\an1}It will someday lead
the village to darkness.

31
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:18,485
{\an1}And thus my battle with
Madara came to an end.

32
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:22,985
{\an1}I don't have any idea how
Madara returned to life now,

33
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,953
{\an1}but I know I definitely
killed my friend.

34
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:27,621
For the sake of
the village...

35
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,955
That's right.

36
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:36,089
{\an1}The village is--

37
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:39,491
{\an1}The village that Madara
and I envisioned in the

38
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:43,592
{\an1}beginning is something that
joined one clan to another.

39
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,259
{\an1}It was an invaluable
cornerstone that created

40
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:50,294
{\an1}order out of chaos and
then maintained it.

41
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:54,662
{\an1}It protected the children,
averted pointless conflict,

42
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,562
and made peace a
reality. However...

43
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:01,196
{\an1}It gave rise to darkness,
the kind your brother Itachi

44
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,765
{\an1}was forced to bear.

45
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,065
{\an1}Perhaps what Madara said
was correct after all.

46
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,600
Maybe he foresaw
this state of affairs.

47
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:15,134
{\an1}Still, I am the shinobi who
created these circumstances.

48
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,435
What's more, I
considered them acceptable.

49
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,736
{\an1}And I believe...

50
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,237
{\an1}That shinobi are those
who endure for a purpose.

51
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,504
{\an1}But depending on what
that purpose is,

52
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,038
{\an1}a shinobi can change.

53
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,837
{\an1}As both Madara and I did.

54
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,441
{\an1}So shinobi are defined
as those who endure in

55
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:44,242
{\an1}order to achieve their goals.

56
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:48,176
{\an1}The goal that I was pursuing
was building a village.

57
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,511
{\an1}But it appears that Madara
found something else.

58
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,713
{\an1}About this plan of Madara's
that Orochimaru mentioned.

59
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:59,280
{\an1}to erase all the shinobi
in this world, I don't know

60
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,580
what that means
in literal terms.

61
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:05,448
{\an1}The Infinite Tsukuyomi,
where village shinobi,

62
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,316
{\an1}everything is irrelevant.

63
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:11,050
{\an1}He'll put everyone under
genjutsu and manipulate

64
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,849
{\an1}them as he sees fit.

65
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,918
{\an1}To negate it all. To
nullify everything...

66
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,851
{\an1}My older brother, Madara's
little brother, and

67
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:23,386
all of you have
striven to protect.

68
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:39,758
{\an1}It turns out my brother
inherited your will without

69
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,292
you ever having
exchanged words with him.

70
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,427
Big Brother.

71
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:51,227
{\an1}Itachi, you also serve as
the Uchiha Clan's pipeline

72
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,662
{\an1}to the Village nerve center.

73
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,362
{\an1}You know that, don't you?

74
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,030
{\an1}Even as he shouldered
that heavy responsibility

75
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,432
for our Clan.

76
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,999
{\an1}We cannot condone
this any longer.

77
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:10,467
{\an1}If they're going to start a
revolution and use it to try

78
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,567
{\an1}to usurp our power.

79
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,635
{\an1}Then we have no choice
but to judge the Uchiha as

80
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,934
{\an1}traitors to the Hidden Leaf!

81
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,902
{\an1}Please wait, Koharu.

82
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,868
{\an1}Don't rush to conclusions.

83
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:24,371
{\an1}However, Hiruzen, the Uchiha
Clan will not be dissuaded.

84
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,505
{\an1}And since that is, in
fact, the case, we must take

85
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,339
measures to
avoid any mayhem.

86
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,973
That includes
innocent children, too.

87
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,175
{\an1}Don't say such things
in front of Itachi!

88
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,643
{\an1}Besides which, a battle
against the Uchiha will be

89
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,176
{\an1}far from an easy task.

90
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,043
We must plan our
strategy very carefully.

91
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,545
We're in a race
against time, here.

92
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,411
{\an1}We ought to strike them
preemptively, before they

93
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,945
{\an1}can make their first move.

94
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:58,213
{\an1}If we join forces, and use
our respective Black Ops to

95
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,348
{\an1}launch a surprise
attack from behind,

96
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,247
{\an1}we'll end this fast.

97
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,749
The Uchiha are
comrades in arms.

98
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:09,417
{\an1}I would like to use words
first before violence.

99
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,617
I will come up
with a strategy.

100
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,218
Itachi.

101
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,353
{\an1}It doesn't have to be
long, but buy me as

102
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:19,252
{\an1}much time as you can.

103
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:22,153
He stood between
the village and the

104
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,854
{\an1}clan amid their strife.

105
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:30,055
{\an1}I see, so you've aligned
with the other side?

106
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:32,557
Father...

107
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,157
Mother...

108
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:35,890
I just...

109
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:38,592
We already
know, Itachi.

110
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,460
Itachi, just
promise me this.

111
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,227
That you'll take
care of Sasuke.

112
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:53,596
I will.

113
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,230
Do not fear it.

114
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,565
This is the path
you have chosen.

115
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:04,499
{\an1}Compared to yours, our pain
will be over in an instant.

116
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:09,634
{\an1}Our philosophies may differ,
but I'm still proud of you.

117
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:15,469
{\an1}You are truly a kind child.

118
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:24,004
He even killed
his own parents.

119
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,905
{\an1}We've received intel
that Itachi, Uchiha of the

120
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,474
{\an1}Akatsuki, has died.

121
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,941
{\an1}You should mark his entry in
your Bingo Book, and remove

122
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,708
{\an1}him. Just cross him out.

123
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:38,275
{\an1}So that traitor has
finally died, has he?

124
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,410
{\an1}I'm surprised. Who was
able to kill someone that

125
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,211
{\an1}powerful, do you know?

126
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,944
{\an1}His little brother,
Sasuke, apparently.

127
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:51,112
{\an1}Poetic that someone who
killed his clan got taken

128
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,847
{\an1}down by his own kin.

129
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,581
{\an1}Yeah, well, it serves
him right after all the

130
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,614
{\an1}atrocious stuff he did!

131
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,248
{\an1}Not only did he join
the Akatsuki, but he also

132
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,682
{\an1}attacked the Leaf!

133
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:03,015
He's the most
notorious criminal in

134
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,349
{\an1}the Village's history!

135
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:06,883
{\an1}But damn it all. I
wish that we'd got our

136
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,016
{\an1}hands on him first!

137
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,318
{\an1}He killed his own clan
and endured being branded a

138
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:15,486
{\an1}Rogue Ninja. Yet he kept
watch over the group that

139
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,220
{\an1}wanted to harm the Leaf.

140
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,721
{\an1}And even in death...

141
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:26,522
{\an1}But I will have protected my
village. I'm Itachi Uchiha

142
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,390
{\an1}of the Leaf once again.

143
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,724
{\an1}My brother endured
longer and harder than you.

144
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:37,091
When he died he
still said that he was

145
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,760
{\an1}proud to be Leaf Shinobi.

146
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,526
[chuckle]

147
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,060
{\an1}Ironic, the one who
understood you most

148
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,128
{\an1}was a shinobi from
the Uchiha Clan.

149
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,796
Your brother
wasn't the only one.

150
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,263
{\an1}One of my subordinates
was Kagami Uchiha, a

151
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,431
man a lot like
your brother.

152
00:11:56,464 --> 00:12:00,232
{\an1}Second Hokage, I thought
that you hated the Uchiha.

153
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:02,199
{\an1}That's not the whole truth.

154
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,501
{\an1}Whatever clan they
belonged to, if someone

155
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,933
{\an1}posed a danger to the
village, I viewed them

156
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,435
{\an1}with extreme caution.

157
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:12,034
{\an1}And there's no doubt
that the Uchiha Clan

158
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,736
{\an1}warranted my suspicions.

159
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,370
{\an1}The Uchiha happened
to be a clan disposed

160
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,070
{\an1}to be considered warily.

161
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,904
{\an1}But because they could feel
deep love, there have been

162
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:25,072
{\an1}several Uchiha like your
brother and Kagami who could

163
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,573
{\an1}transcend the boundaries
of the clan and devote

164
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:28,939
{\an1}themselves to the village.

165
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,940
{\an1}My elder brother thought the
village was something that

166
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,409
{\an1}could eliminate the
framework of clans.

167
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:38,309
{\an1}Well the reality of it is
that it wasn't so simple.

168
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,611
{\an1}Elder brother's naiveté
and the potential risk

169
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:44,612
{\an1}that Madara posed.

170
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,578
{\an1}It was my role as Second
Hokage to mediate between

171
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:50,045
{\an1}the two of them, to
protect the village,

172
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,913
{\an1}and to fortify it.

173
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:59,282
{\an1}Shisui Uchiha was a
descendant of Kagami Uchiha.

174
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,083
{\an1}And he was a friend of
your older brother Itachi.

175
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,351
{\an1}There've been many,
including myself, who

176
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,819
inherited Lord
First's Will of Fire.

177
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:14,086
{\an1}But perhaps I was the most
naïve shinobi of them all.

178
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,487
{\an1}I couldn't maintain Lord
Second's village-building

179
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:18,754
{\an1}skillfully enough.

180
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:21,988
{\an1}Which is how I ended up
burdening Danzo with the

181
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,523
{\an1}village's darkness.

182
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,056
{\an1}And I killed Danzo
out of revenge.

183
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,158
{\an1}To the end, he professed
that he would protect the

184
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,258
{\an1}village, no matter what
dirty means were required.

185
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,126
{\an1}It seems that I failed
miserably time and time

186
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,827
{\an1}again as the Hokage.

187
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,294
{\an1}Even the things that led to
the current circumstances

188
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:46,529
are in part my
responsibility.

189
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:49,029
{\an1}No, it's not your
fault, Lord Third.

190
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,497
{\an1}You devoted yourself to
the village completely

191
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,264
{\an1}and respectably.

192
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:56,331
{\an1}However, I am the
one who died during the

193
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,598
{\an1}Nine Tails' attack!

194
00:13:57,632 --> 00:14:01,232
{\an1}You had such high
hopes for me as Hokage.

195
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,200
{\an1}And yet I couldn't
live up to them.

196
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:08,401
{\an1}And to think I was skipped
over in favor of you.

197
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:11,068
We were all so
disappointed.

198
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:14,270
{\an1}Lord Orochimaru. You
sound like you're pouting!

199
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:18,204
{\an1}[chuckle] A bit, since
the Third Hokage is here.

200
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:22,972
{\an1}If I hadn't died perhaps I
could've helped to foil the

201
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:26,674
{\an1}Uchiha's plans for a coup
d'état a whole lot earlier.

202
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,208
{\an1}Now then Sasuke.

203
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,842
What next?

204
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:35,743
{\an1}Will you crush the village?

205
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:37,610
Or...

206
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,148
Aww...

207
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,550
{\an1}Sorry 'bout that,
Sasuke. But we'll do

208
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,383
{\an1}it some other time.

209
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,516
Sorry, Sasuke.

210
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,516
{\an1}Maybe some other time.

211
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,617
Ow!

212
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,151
You probably
hate me, huh.

213
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,518
[gasp]

214
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:11,519
But with us it's
different because you and

215
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:12,687
{\an1}I are flesh and blood.

216
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,888
{\an1}I'm always going to be there
for you, even if it's only

217
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,288
{\an1}as an obstacle for
you to overcome.

218
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:20,622
{\an1}Even if you do hate me.

219
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:23,156
That's what big
brothers are for.

220
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:30,058
{\an1}You believe I had a
hand in this, don't you?

221
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,930
You're not even
worth killing.

222
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,797
{\an1}Foolish little brother.

223
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,698
{\an1}If you wish to kill me one
day. Foster your hatred and

224
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,432
{\an1}despise me. Surviving
in such an unsightly

225
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,032
manner as this.

226
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:06,135
It's just as you
said, brother.

227
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:09,736
{\an1}I've fostered my hatred
for you all this time.

228
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,137
{\an1}I've lived my life for
one single purpose.

229
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,405
To see you die!
It ends here.

230
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,607
{\an1}You don't interest
me at the moment.

231
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,541
{\an1}You're still too weak...
You don't have enough hate.

232
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:33,075
And you know
something? You never will.

233
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:49,781
{\an1}I have always lied to
you and asked for your

234
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:52,949
{\an1}forgiveness while
keeping you at a distance.

235
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:58,083
{\an1}Because I wanted to
keep you out of this.

236
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,250
{\an1}But now, I think...

237
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:05,285
{\an1}That perhaps you could have
changed Father, Mother, and

238
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,919
the rest of the
Uchiha as well.

239
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:14,521
{\an1}If I had only come to
you from the start, looked

240
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,355
{\an1}straight into your eyes
and told you the truth.

241
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,656
{\an1}Then I wouldn't have to
stand before you as a

242
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,457
failure, telling
you all of this.

243
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,058
But I want to
impart at least this

244
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,859
{\an1}much truth to you.

245
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,293
You don't ever
have to forgive me.

246
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:38,127
{\an1}And whatever you do from
here on out, know this...

247
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:43,062
{\an1}No matter what, I
will love you always.

248
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,867
{\an1}I'm going to head to the
battlefield! I won't let the

249
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,266
{\an1}village and Itachi
become nothing!

250
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,335
It's decided!

251
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:05,569
Tobirama!

252
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,269
Prepare to
fly us outside!

253
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:09,637
I'd love to use
Flying Raijin, but I'm

254
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,637
{\an1}bound right now.

255
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,705
{\an1}Orochimaru, was it?
What will you do now?

256
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:16,339
{\an1}I believe you said
earlier you'd stay with

257
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:18,439
{\an1}Sasuke, didn't you?

258
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,006
Of course we
shall accompany him.

259
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,774
What?!

260
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:25,274
Jugo, are you?

261
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,942
{\an1}I'll go with them, too.
After all, it's my duty to

262
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:29,977
protect Sasuke.

263
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,310
{\an1}<i>Four mighty zombies</i>
<i>and three monsters.</i>

264
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:36,344
{\an1}If I tag along, I'm
gonna die for sure!

265
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:39,512
{\an1}I'm making a break for it
when I get the chance!

266
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:44,714
This view sure
brings back memories!

267
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,748
{\an1}It's now or never!

268
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,448
What the hell?!

269
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:53,015
{\an1}So, it really was
you, huh, Sasuke?!

270
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,216
I'm--

271
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,416
{\an1}I sensed your chakra, and I
could hardly believe it, so

272
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,951
{\an1}I backtracked here,
and look what I find!

273
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:00,818
Karin?

274
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:04,920
{\an1}Oh my so many of my best
experiments, all gathered

275
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,353
{\an1}here in one place!

276
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,822
Jerk!

277
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,588
{\an1}I'll never forgive you!

278
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,022
{\an1}I'm sorry, Karin.

279
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,790
{\an1}Bastard! You think an
apology will actually get

280
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:23,525
{\an1}you off the hook for
what you did to me?

281
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,124
{\an1}Good for nothing.

282
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:29,727
{\an1}I see you still have a
weakness for Sasuke, Karin.

283
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,126
Just listen,
Lord Orochimaru!

284
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,362
{\an1}Sasuke had the gall to
stab me! You believe that?!

285
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,996
Me too, dear.
Quite a coincidence.

286
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:42,229
But now, I'm
cooperating with Sasuke.

287
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:45,330
{\an1}This is perfect. You
can come help us, too.

288
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:46,999
What?!

289
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:49,331
{\an1}Well, I guess I have
no choice! [giggling]

290
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:50,298
Who's she?!

291
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:52,599
{\an1}From the chakra and
red hair, she's of

292
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,300
{\an1}the Uzumaki Clan.

293
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,768
{\an1}<i>Four mighty zombies, three</i>
<i>monsters, and now an idiot.</i>

294
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:00,668
<i>I bet Madara'll</i>
<i>be shocked, too!</i>

295
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:06,236
{\an1}Orochimaru, why have
you decided to cooperate

296
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,336
{\an1}with Sasuke now?

297
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,337
{\an1}You've been trying so
hard to destroy the village.

298
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,839
After spending
time inside Kabuto,

299
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:16,106
I have come to
realize something.

300
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:18,641
He copied me,
tried to possess

301
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:20,274
{\an1}everything, and failed.

302
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:23,475
{\an1}Now I'm curious about
the different path

303
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,108
{\an1}Sasuke has chosen.

304
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,042
{\an1}That boy, unlike Kabuto,
didn't try to copy me.

305
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:31,777
{\an1}My fellow Hokage!

306
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,878
{\an1}From atop these Great Stone
Faces watching over the

307
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:37,879
{\an1}Leaf, let's burn this
view of the village

308
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,579
into our eyes!

309
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:41,613
[weary sigh]

310
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,414
{\an1}I'll finally meet my son.

311
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:50,016
{\an1}Naruto, I'll make up for not
being there for you as your

312
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,449
{\an1}father by bringing you
a huge present now!

313
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,450
{\an1}Now, then, it's been a
while since my last war!

314
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:59,051
I must focus and
brace for battle!

315
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:02,319
{\an1}Madara! We will defeat you!

316
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:05,754
{\an1}It's foolish, I know, but
I'm kind of looking forward

317
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,154
to seeing a
familiar old friend!

318
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,421
{\an1}Just you wait, Madara!

319
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:13,923
{\an1}There's always conflict,
no matter what the era, but

320
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,256
this shall be
the end of wars!

321
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,423
Let's go!

322
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:02,186
{\an1}Obito, your dream long
ago was to become Hokage.

323
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,054
<i>I'm certain you</i>
<i>must understand</i>

324
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,821
{\an1}<i>Naruto's feelings!</i>

325
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:07,822
{\an1}<i>You can still go back!</i>

326
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:14,656
{\an1}<i>[laughter] It's because I</i>
<i>understand Naruto mind...</i>

327
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,157
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Hole."</i>

328
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,291
{\an1}<i>...that I want to</i>
<i>negate every last</i>

329
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,793
{\an1}<i>thing that he does!</i>
