1
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:19,171
What's wrong?

2
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,577
The enemy's disguising
themselves as allies!

3
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,081
<i>That means you</i>
<i>could be an enemy,</i>
<i>too!</i>

4
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:25,919
We can't trust
anyone!

5
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:31,195
What is going on here?!
There's confusion
spreading everywhere
in the allied ranks!

6
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:38,811
What?! Granny?!

7
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:42,652
Uh! What up, bra?

8
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:47,061
Bee! Get your eyes
up here now! Have
some respect for
the Hokage!

9
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:51,503
Oh no, Bro! I'm just
shocked, that's all.
I promise you I meant
no offense.

10
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:55,177
It's just that the
Hokage's jugs are
definitely immense!

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,414
We're here to stop you!

12
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,720
You will not pass!

13
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:56,620
It looks like Naruto's
in control of the Nine
Tails' power. Well done,
Naruto.

14
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,624
Such immense chakra!

15
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:03,934
Listen, Bro, please.
You gotta let Naruto
go free. This is a
personal plea. I can

16
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:06,105
can vouch for him,
that I guarantee.

17
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,115
Enough! Silence! We're
fighting to protect you
both! If you're captured-

18
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:16,292
The enemy will complete
their jutsu. And the
world will end. Iruka
Sensei told us.

19
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,633
So why are you doing
this?! Are you both
fools?!

20
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,535
(annoyed grunt)

21
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:32,324
It's because of all
that! It's because
they're protecting
us! I can't stand

22
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,028
that people are
dying for me!

23
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,002
So what if we do
manage to win this
war?! And only I'm
left!

24
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,307
It just isn't
worth it!

25
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,144
I don't want that!

26
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:46,620
But it would be better
than the whole world
ending! That's the
reason why people are

27
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,291
prepared to sacrifice
themselves to protect
you!

28
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,768
I can't sit here doing
nothing! Not when I'm
unharmed and people are
out there fighting for

29
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,974
me! That's not the
kind of person I am!
I can't!

30
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:58,376
Besides!

31
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,681
Enough! You still
shall not pass!

32
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,591
If you won't listen...

33
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:08,998
He can keep up with
me in this mode?!

34
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:19,619
What is that punch?!
Man, it's powerful!
Gotta avoid a direct
hit!

35
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:29,739
Granny Tsunade, you
understand, don't
you?! I can stop
this war, I know it!

36
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:31,275
<i>Let me go!</i>

37
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:36,587
Please, Granny...

38
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:43,366
I'm a part of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
now, Naruto. And the
orders I've been given

39
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:49,579
are to stop you. Even
though I'm Hokage, I still
can't act independently
on this matter!

40
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,783
(disappointed sigh)

41
00:04:54,856 --> 00:05:01,269
<i>All right. I understand</i>
<i>the position that you're</i>
<i>in, Granny. So...</i>

42
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,939
I'll force my way out!

43
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,477
Faster this time!

44
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,759
How's this?!

45
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,246
<i>You're fast, old</i>
<i>man Raikage.</i>

46
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,759
<i>Nine Tails Chakra Mode</i>
<i>is able to match the</i>
<i>Raikage's speed! That's</i>
<i>just incredible!</i>

47
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:35,505
There's no shinobi
who's faster than I
am. Not since the
Fourth Hokage died!

48
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:38,243
Huh?! Wait, you
knew my dad?!

49
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:43,587
Yes, we exchanged
blows many times.
I found him to be
a noble man.

50
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,325
A finer shinobi
never lived.

51
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:51,102
Jiraiya, one of the
Leaf's three great
shinobi, called him
a Child of Prophecy,

52
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,707
a savior.

53
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:58,316
But even with all
his power, why is
he not here to
help? Because he

54
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,393
underestimated the
tailed beast. You
are his son, have
you learned nothing

55
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,497
from his sacrifice?!

56
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,938
You continue to talk
of uncertain outcomes,
and yet-

57
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:09,739
<i>You know what?</i>

58
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:14,749
Just stop it.
Don't talk about
my father.

59
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:25,303
Back then, when
you were first
born...

60
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:29,846
Minato said, "I'm
a father now!"
And he cried!

61
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,585
And...

62
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,860
He was ready to
die for his son.

63
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:41,235
He sealed half of the
Nine Tails' overpowering
chakra inside himself.

64
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:46,279
Stopping the upheaval
in the world. Dealing
with Madara and the
calamity he wanted to

65
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:50,220
unleash. He left it
all to his son.

66
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:55,765
He died, bequeathing
everything to you,
Naruto. Believing in
you!

67
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:56,600
My dad...

68
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,639
He believed in you
with all his heart!

69
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:04,114
You're wrong! The
Fourth Hokage did
not fail that day!

70
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:07,321
If you continue to
insist on going...

71
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,859
I will kill you
right here and now!

72
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:11,362
What?! No! Raikage!

73
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:15,538
That will at least
buy us a little time
until the Nine Tails
is revived.

74
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:19,946
And then our enemy
will be forced to
delay his plans!

75
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,984
Looks like you
want to die.

76
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:25,791
Wait!

77
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,901
Bee! What is this?!

78
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,473
<i>Ah! He stopped him!</i>

79
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:38,349
You kill him, and it's
the same as killing me
and the Eight Tails,
you see why? If we die,

80
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,688
the enemy's plans
would also go awry!

81
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:45,096
To let Naruto go to
the battlefield, my
life I'd gladly yield.

82
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,167
Octopops...

83
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,810
Raikage! You can't make
arbitrary decisions
without the other
Allied leaders!

84
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:54,683
I won't allow it,
Supreme Commander!

85
00:07:54,716 --> 00:08:00,360
My duty to the Allied
Shinobi Forces is to
ensure victory in this
war! And I'll do

86
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,897
anything to achieve
that!

87
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,538
Then like the Eight
Tails said, why target
Naruto over him?

88
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:10,781
If push comes to shove,
then I'm prepared to
kill anyone, even my
own younger brother!

89
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:14,488
But if I have to
choose, then the one
I pick is Naruto!

90
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:20,033
Bee is the Jinchuriki
who can control his
Tailed Beast's power,
which makes him a

91
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,803
stronger military
asset.

92
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,439
Now let go, Bee!

93
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,343
No way, fool
ya fool!

94
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:30,020
Listen to me, you
Jinchuriki can't
just run around doing
whatever you please!

95
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:35,296
You belong to your
nation and to your
village! You maintain
the balance of power

96
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,073
for your people.
Yours is a very
special existence!
You can't do whatever

97
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,444
you want! You must
understand your
position!

98
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:47,054
That might be so, but
inside of me, hidden,
there's something
personal called spirit

99
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,826
that I can't abandon,
no matter what may
happen.

100
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:53,266
Because with that
gone, I'm just
another weapon.

101
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,903
(angry growl)

102
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:01,182
Just tell me why!
Why are you defending
this boy, Bee?!

103
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,121
<i>We're bumping fists...</i>

104
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:09,198
You gotta understand!
Can't you read what's
in my soul, my brother?

105
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:26,767
Doesn't seem like any
decent prospects this
time.

106
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,837
Okay, listen up,
all of you!

107
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:32,712
Only one of you can
prove worthy to
inheriting the title
of Bee.

108
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:37,989
Ay here is a candidate
to be named as the next
Raikage! You all know
that here in the Hidden

109
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:43,499
Cloud, each Raikage
is assigned a tag
team partner.

110
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:49,378
Someone who will draw
out the Raikage's full
power. And to be "Bee"
is to be the bodyguard

111
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,716
of the Raikage.

112
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,889
We'll test your
compatibility with
Ay, one by one.

113
00:09:54,923 --> 00:10:00,366
Try to chop off this
dummy's head by teaming
up with Ay and using the
Double Lariat on it.

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,376
Remember! The Double
Lariat will only work
correctly if equal
strength is applied

115
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,646
from both sides.

116
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,288
If one side is too
strong or too weak,
the head will only
bend!

117
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:15,898
First, bump fists
with Ay to determine
how much power you
should use.

118
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:19,672
Then you'll test out
your Double Lariat
on the dummy!

119
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,279
Okay! Let's start with
you on the far right.

120
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,684
Thank you, sir!
I'm honored!

121
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,828
Ahhh!

122
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:33,934
Ahhahhahh!

123
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,270
Next!

124
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,338
Yes, sir!

125
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,608
Hnh!

126
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:38,710
Ahh!

127
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:41,616
Next!

128
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,021
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

129
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,524
(fighting grunts)

130
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,960
Next!

131
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,062
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

132
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,331
(attacking grunts)

133
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:50,433
Next!

134
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,703
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

135
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,206
Agh!

136
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,074
Next!

137
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,210
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

138
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:57,582
It appears that we
won't find anyone
this time, either.

139
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,457
If he'd had any siblings,
we wouldn't have to go
through all of this over
and over again.

140
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,392
Next!

141
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,835
Hm...

142
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,610
Wait, look, Lord
Raikage.

143
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,914
Seems we may have
found one.

144
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,661
Wheeeee!

145
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,032
(chuckle)

146
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,869
You're a bit of
an odd one.

147
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,407
Bump fists with
me one more time.

148
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,970
We two are brothers
from this day on!
Nice to know you, Bee.

149
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,119
Let's do it, Bee.

150
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:53,192
<i>Show you know the</i>
<i>plan by bumping</i>
<i>fists, man. "Kay, bro.</i>

151
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,228
<i>Yeah!</i>

152
00:11:55,898 --> 00:12:00,507
Yeah! Eat up, now!
You can't keep up
with me if you don't
get bigger and stronger!

153
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,077
Okay, Brotha!

154
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:06,385
<i>Our next mission is</i>
<i>a scroll recovery.</i>

155
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:07,888
<i>Wait, no way!</i>

156
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:10,026
Yes, way!
'Kay, Bro?

157
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,105
Is he asleep?

158
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,642
<i>Yeah...</i>

159
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:21,015
Bee's a good shinobi.
He's got talent, too.

160
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:24,722
Though not really as
a rapper. You know
what I'm talking about?

161
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,125
(chuckling)

162
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,995
Yes, I agree.

163
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:36,746
He'll probably be
next, the Jinchuriki
of the Eight Tails
after me.

164
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,119
Have you heard for
sure if that's going
to be the elders'
decision?

165
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,361
No, no one's
said anything.

166
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:50,006
Both my old man and
my uncle failed. And
I'm not compatible
either.

167
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,614
Listen, as your
cousin, I think-

168
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,588
But come on, you've
kept the Eight Tails
under control up
until this point. So-

169
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,057
<i>Just listen to me!</i>

170
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,600
Only a Jinchuriki
would understand.

171
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:07,775
Even your close
friends look at you
differently after
the process.

172
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:13,920
Well, they might believe
that they're treating you
the same. But they're not
really...

173
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:21,001
<i>You can never look back,</i>
<i>only toward the future.</i>
<i>But that future is filled</i>
<i>with darkness and loneliness.</i>

174
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:26,478
Have you achieved
compatibility, if you
walk through life with
the shadow of your death.

175
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:30,821
It fills your whole
mind day in and day
out, until you become
so consumed you don't

176
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:35,731
know who or what you
are. It feels like
someone made a hole
in your heart.

177
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:41,776
And the Tailed Beast
constantly waits to
pounce on that weakened
heart and run amok.

178
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,087
You live with the
constant fear of
death. You'd soon
rather just die.

179
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,535
But still, you have a
knack for ninjutsu as
well as skill, ancestry,
virtue, everything!

180
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:59,011
True. That's the exact
reasoning that they
used then they chose
me to become the Eight

181
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:01,683
Tails' Jinchuriki.
But...

182
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:06,826
To be honest, none
of those things are
necessary to be a
Jinchuriki.

183
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,131
Oh? So what
is, then?

184
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:15,476
Having something that
can fill that hole
in your heart!

185
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:20,119
And what is it?
That something?

186
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:26,131
It can be anything.
You'll know it when
you find it. Because
it will keep you strong.

187
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,841
So, make sure
that Bee finds it.

188
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:39,257
<i>Another failure. This</i>
<i>time, eight people were</i>
<i>victims of his rampage.</i>

189
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:44,769
The Eight Tails' is very
powerful. He's much more
difficult to contain than
the Two Tails.

190
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:49,645
How much more can we
take? How much longer
will we have to go
through this?

191
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,250
The next Jinchuriki
is supposed to be...

192
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:54,087
...that child.

193
00:14:55,991 --> 00:15:00,133
It's quite an honor to
be the Tailed Beast host!
So, now I pay tribute to
your sacrifice, no boast!

194
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,503
Yeah!

195
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,472
I don't think
he'll make it.

196
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:13,159
<i>You brat! How dare</i>
<i>you kill my comrades!</i>

197
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:16,599
So you continue to
insult me and treat
me with contempt?!

198
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,037
<i>Let's do it, Bee.</i>

199
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,741
Okay, you got
it, Bro!

200
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:26,251
Hold on! This brat's
Bee?! Then that means
you two must be the
A/B combo?!

201
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:29,191
So you must be
familiar with our
technique, then?

202
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,665
(scared gasp)

203
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,234
The Double Lariat?!

204
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:47,327
Bee, we still have a
long way to go before
the Double Lariat is
where it needs to be.

205
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,972
I'm still toning down
my strength to match
yours. You're going to
have to get stronger!

206
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,107
(insulted grunt)

207
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,915
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I got it, fool, ya fool!

208
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:03,660
How dare you address
your big brother as "fool,
ya fool!" This means
the Iron Claw for you!

209
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:08,870
I'm gonna surpass you
someday, you'll see!
And on that day, I'll
be carefree!

210
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:13,245
The trick to this
technique is keeping
both our strengths
equal. You're going

211
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,183
to have to bring
yourself up to
par.

212
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:19,826
That sounds ideal to
me. And I'll do it,
too, you'll see! Easy
as one-two-three!

213
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,531
'Cause talking down
to you is my fantasy!

214
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,000
(chuckling)

215
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:27,207
Such delusions will
have to wait until
you've honed your
Lariat!

216
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,981
This is it.

217
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:34,421
We'll seal the Eight
Tails inside Bee
tonight.

218
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,223
Yeah.

219
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:40,366
Having something that
can fill that hole in
your heart.

220
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,509
It can be anything.
You'll know it when
you find it.

221
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:49,284
So, make sure
that Bee finds
it.

222
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,123
Yo, what's up, Bro?

223
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:53,092
Hm?

224
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,872
In a little while
you're going to
become a Jinchuriki.

225
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:05,116
Everything's going to
change. Your life is
going to be very hard.

226
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,487
Oh! No sweat, I kinda
figured that might
happen.

227
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:13,132
Maybe I'll name that
octopus while I do my
own rappin'. I'll get all
eight tentacles clappin'!

228
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:24,087
Listen up, Bee. Always
tell me everything,
you understand me?

229
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,601
No secrets. Because
you're very special
to me! You and I are
the ultimate tag team!

230
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:32,605
(pleased chuckle)

231
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:50,006
<i>Even with the Steel</i>
<i>Shell Seal, I wouldn't</i>
<i>be surprised if the</i>
<i>Eight Tails' goes crazy.</i>

232
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,412
We'd better stay on
guard and keep an
eye on him.

233
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:54,615
Wheee!

234
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:59,558
The Eight Tails, that
be me, the rappin'
Killer Bee, on the
scene so take heed!

235
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,295
Yeah! Fa show!

236
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:12,851
The blonde hair and
the Teleportation
Jutsu! That's gotta
be the Leaf's Yellow

237
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,091
Flash! We gotta
retreat right now,
don't you think?!

238
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:21,101
So that's him. The one
who singlehandedly
stopped our recovery
of the Nine Tails.

239
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:27,413
And I know you. You're
the son of the Hidden
Cloud's Third Raikage.
You're called Unruly Ay.

240
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:30,286
I've heard that you're
quite fast yourself.

241
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,329
Hmph! We can take him,
the two of us, Bro!
Fool, ya fool!

242
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,333
Everyone, stay
out of this.

243
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:39,805
I'll fight them!

244
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,309
<i>He countered me at</i>
<i>my top speed!</i>

245
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,189
That's...

246
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,832
Forgive me, Bee.
You doing all right?

247
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,134
Whoa, no way.

248
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:14,709
Then is he the Eight
Tails' Jinchuriki?!
Not good.

249
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:19,752
That's the signal!
Minato! We need to
retreat!

250
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:23,025
That was nothin'!

251
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:28,268
At least, for the
Eight Tails', that
be me, the rappin'
Killer Bee!

252
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:32,778
You really are quite
brave. You overcame
being Eight Tails'
Jinchuriki, to be

253
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:36,519
your own ninja. You
have something very
powerful.

254
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:40,660
Hmmh! He's more
talented than
even I am!

255
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:45,604
No, it's more than
that. He already has
something even more
important.

256
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:46,739
Hm?

257
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:52,350
Ay, you have a very
fine family. As do I.

258
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:58,162
I suspect the next
time we meet, we'll
be fighting as one
Kage against another.

259
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:03,305
But if you don't figure
out soon what your little
brother considers most
precious to him, he will

260
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:07,046
be neither a
Jinchuriki nor
human.

261
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,856
Hmph! Don't try to
fool me with that
nonsense! You're not
getting away!

262
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:20,507
The Teleportation Jutsu
takes him to the kunai
marked with jutsu
formulas. I've noted

263
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,178
the location of most
of them.

264
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:28,590
If I can figure out
which one he'll pop
up at, I can get him
using my top speed.

265
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:34,535
Anyway, I have my
own responsibilities
so...

266
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,639
<i>Go fly!</i>

267
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,941
<i>Now, which kunai?</i>

268
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,385
I cannot fail now.

269
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:45,423
Hm?!

270
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:48,797
Oh no!

271
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,336
A Teleportation Jutsu
Formula on the Eight
Tails' tentacle!

272
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,476
<i>Was that when</i>
<i>he did it?</i>

273
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:09,170
I'm prepared for a
mutual strike. So shall
we stab each other with
these spikes?

274
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:12,644
You're my enemy,
but I'm starting
to like you.

275
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:15,650
You've got the moves
of a shinobi killer.

276
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:03,666
Even if you were to
kill Naruto, and
buy us some time until
the Nine Tails comes

277
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,610
back to life, I doubt
the next Jinchuriki
will be able to control
the Nine Tail's power

278
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:14,187
to this degree! Since
we don't have any idea
which way this war will
go, let's use all the

279
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,930
weapons we've got,
including the
Jinchuriki! I will
let Naruto pass!

280
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:22,938
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Two Suns.</i>

281
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:26,712
<i>Now you're talking!</i>
<i>That's the Granny</i>
<i>Hokage I know!</i>
