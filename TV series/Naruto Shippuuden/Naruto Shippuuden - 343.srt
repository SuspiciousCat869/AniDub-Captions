1
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,523
Go, Naruto!

2
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:16,291
{\an1}You will not fail!

3
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:17,493
Yeah!

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,860
[gasp]

5
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:24,866
{\an1}That power again?

6
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,414
[gasp]

7
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,951
{\an1}Kakashi, we really
ought to-!

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,153
Huh?!

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,323
That man, He
couldn't be...

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,163
No... There's
absolutely no way!

11
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:55,432
Kakashi!

12
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:56,266
Huh?!

13
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,169
{\an1}Hey, are you listening? The
more diversions there

14
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:01,439
{\an1}are, the better when
we're attacking him!

15
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,006
{\an1}We need to get in there!

16
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,848
{\an1}Kakashi, I've got a pretty
good idea of what you're

17
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:12,383
{\an1}thinking right now.

18
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,718
{\an1}I feel the same.

19
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,853
But you need to
just leave it be.

20
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:18,790
{\an1}There's no time to wallow in
sentimentality. Your former

21
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:21,960
{\an1}subordinate, Naruto, has
already jumped into action!

22
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:26,932
{\an1}How foolish, attacking
all by yourself.

23
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:29,835
{\an1}Yo! Agh! Damn it!

24
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,113
{\an1}You're wrong. I'm
not all by myself.

25
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,383
{\an1}Don't forget Kurama!

26
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,685
Plus Octopops,
Eight-O...

27
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,921
{\an1}Bushier Brow Sensei!

28
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,556
{\an1}And Kakashi Sensei, too!

29
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,928
{\an1}You've got a winning record
against me right now...

30
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:59,332
{\an1}You better not let of this
slow you down. Kakashi!

31
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:09,510
{\an1}Naruto... I'm glad
you were my student.

32
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:11,912
Let's go... Guy!

33
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,384
{\an1}My dear rival! Now that's
what I'm talking about!

34
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:20,054
Considering my
remaining chakra...

35
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,391
I only have a
few shots left.

36
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,560
{\an1}I don't fear a borrowed
power that cannot even

37
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,596
{\an1}string together a barrage.

38
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,399
{\an1}The true power of Kamui!

39
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,770
This Kamui...
and its timing...

40
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,638
{\an1}-I can't mess it up!
-Watch and learn!

41
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,271
Huh?

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,346
{\an1}Their knowing the trick to
my jutsu changes nothing.

43
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,284
{\an1}If he has to materialize
when he pulls things in, he

44
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:50,486
{\an1}has to do so when he
spits things out!

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,554
{\an1}This is our chance!

46
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,290
If you can
counterstrike, that is!

47
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,463
{\an1}[gasp] What is this?!

48
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,866
{\an1}Naruto! These have the Curse
Marks on them that restrain

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,968
Tailed Beast
power. So whatever

50
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,837
{\an1}you do, don't let
them touch you!

51
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:09,673
Octopops!

52
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,076
{\an1}Could you shield me
for just a little bit?

53
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,044
{\an1}Shadow Clone Jutsu!

54
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,749
{\an1}Gotcha, come here!
I'll be your umbrella!

55
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,325
Kamui!

56
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:32,731
{\an1}If it's the same move, all I
need to do is not have

57
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,666
{\an1}Naruto slip through me.

58
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,403
{\an1}What? A Shadow Clone?

59
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:41,873
Kakashi!

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,975
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

61
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:47,680
{\an1}Seems my attack was
quicker than you, Kakashi.

62
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,649
{\an1}You missed transporting
the Rasengan...

63
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,186
{\an1}...and wasted another Kamui.

64
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,456
{\an1}Not yet! Tailed Beast Bomb!

65
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,727
{\an1}A bit late. How futile.

66
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:04,865
[scream]

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,940
[gasp]

68
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:16,543
You're--!

69
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:19,680
Naruto Uzumaki!

70
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,751
{\an1}I see... That Kamui just now
wasn't transporting the

71
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,220
Rasengan but the
Shadow Clone itself!

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,857
{\an1}He beat me to it!
Damn you, Kakashi!

73
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:31,292
Who...

74
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,593
No...

75
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,395
...are you?!

76
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,419
{\an1}As of today, Kakashi is
a Jonin just like I am.

77
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:50,824
{\an1}Remember, we were just
talking about this the

78
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,158
{\an1}other day? When we
discussed getting

79
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,660
Kakashi a gift!

80
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,398
Sorry. Guess I
wasn't listening.

81
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,335
{\an1}Well, here's what
I got for ya.

82
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:04,071
A custom-made
kunai knife.

83
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,006
{\an1}It's a little heavy and
unconventional.

84
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,641
But you'll get
used to it quickly.

85
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,277
Yeah, thanks.

86
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:12,279
{\an1}This one's from... me!

87
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,582
{\an1}I made a personalized
medkit for you.

88
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:18,086
{\an1}I adjusted a few things to
make it easier to use.

89
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,054
Thanks.

90
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,658
{\an1}What are you holding
your hand out for?!

91
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,873
{\an1}Kakashi's father, Sakumo...

92
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,408
{\an1}...took his own life
after he was vilified by

93
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:41,743
{\an1}everyone around him.

94
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:47,016
{\an1}This is where we go
our separate ways.

95
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,152
Let's get going
then... Captain!

96
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,300
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!

97
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,881
We'll be taking
this one with us.

98
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,389
Are you crazy?

99
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,691
{\an1}Do you have any idea what
you're saying, Kakashi?!

100
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,059
Yes...

101
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,362
{\an1}The two of us have to
complete this mission alone.

102
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:34,265
{\an1}And Rin?! What do we
do about Rin, huh?!

103
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,934
We'll come back
for her later.

104
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,703
{\an1}We must carry out our
mission even at the

105
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,205
{\an1}expense of our comrades.

106
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:45,911
{\an1}You're right, in the Ninja
World, those who break the

107
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,414
{\an1}rules and laws are
regarded as scum...

108
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,215
But...

109
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:54,186
{\an1}Those who would abandon
even one of their friends...

110
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:55,854
{\an1}Are worse than scum.

111
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,140
I found them!

112
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,627
{\an1}Kakashi?! Why did you-?!

113
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,630
{\an1}Well, I certainly can't
leave this up to a crybaby

114
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:38,499
{\an1}Ninja like you, can I?

115
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,868
Kakashi...

116
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,639
{\an1}Obito, behind you!

117
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,915
Agh! My eye!

118
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,117
Kakashi!

119
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,490
Kakashi, hey!
Are you all right?!

120
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,974
{\an1}But... how?! There's no way
that you could've seen me!

121
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,043
{\an1}Obito! How did-?!

122
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:35,993
Release!

123
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:39,163
Kakashi! Obito!

124
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,801
This is bad!

125
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:04,756
{\an1}Whatever the village or
anyone else may say...

126
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:08,427
{\an1}I think... that you're
a great Jonin...

127
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:11,897
{\an1}It's true. That's
how I really feel.

128
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:14,633
{\an1}Please accept this...

129
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:26,146
{\an1}Is that you... Obito?!

130
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:34,054
What!? Is that
really Obito?

131
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,426
{\an1}I thought he was dead!

132
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,246
{\an1}There's no mistake...

133
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:01,649
{\an1}That's Obito Uchiha...

134
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,587
{\an1}You can call me by that name
if that's what you want.

135
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,825
But it means
nothing to me.

136
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:16,198
Agh! My eye!

137
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,132
Kakashi!

138
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,137
{\an1}Obito! How did-?!

139
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:34,851
{\an1}This time, I will
protect my comrade!

140
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,557
{\an1}But that day, you...

141
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:47,998
{\an1}Run for the exit!

142
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,101
Kakashi!

143
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:09,753
{\an1}You guys all right?
Rin? Kakashi?

144
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:10,322
[gasp]

145
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:11,856
Obito!

146
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:23,669
No, don't. It's
okay, Kakashi.

147
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,673
{\an1}I don't- I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

148
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:31,077
My right side is
completely crushed.

149
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:34,380
{\an1}I can't even feel
anything there anymore.

150
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:44,924
{\an1}So what if I'm captain now?!
So what if I made Jonin?!

151
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:49,563
{\an1}Oh, that's right...
I totally forgot...

152
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:54,968
{\an1}I was the only one... Who
didn't give you a gift...

153
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:58,171
{\an1}For becoming a jonin and
being named captain.

154
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:01,643
[gasp]

155
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:08,950
{\an1}I'm... giving you
my... Sharingan.

156
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,228
{\an1}Kakashi... Promise me...

157
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:22,997
{\an1}Take care of Rin.

158
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,099
I will.

159
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,541
Obito!

160
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:38,581
Obito...

161
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:46,656
{\an1}You- you survived...

162
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,425
Who is he?!

163
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:53,563
{\an1}Our classmate and an
Uchiha who was a Leaf Shinobi.

164
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:56,933
{\an1}We all thought he was killed
in action during the last war.

165
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,671
{\an1}But if you were alive,
why not come forward?!

166
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:05,309
{\an1}Because it's irrelevant
whether I had survived or not.

167
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,647
{\an1}Although... I suppose...

168
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:12,583
If you really
want an answer...

169
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,162
{\an1}The reason is because...

170
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,400
You...

171
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,372
Let Rin die.

172
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,746
{\an1}[chuckle] Oh, please. Relax.

173
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,382
And what's with
that look, Kakashi?

174
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,189
So you're not
going to condemn me?

175
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:55,128
{\an1}What would I gain from
criticizing this absurd reality?

176
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,638
{\an1}I've no interest in the
affairs of a world soon to end.

177
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,210
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei! I don't know
what happened between you

178
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,480
{\an1}two, but we can't afford
to dwell on it right now!

179
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,817
{\an1}We can discuss it all later!

180
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,720
{\an1}But now, stopping what
this guy is trying to

181
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,655
{\an1}do has got to come first!

182
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,657
{\an8}<i>Well said!</i>

183
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,527
{\an1}Kakashi! Naruto's
absolutely right!

184
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,830
{\an1}The fate of the world
currently rests in our hands!

185
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,300
{\an1}I have nothing more to
talk to you about, anyway.

186
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,870
{\an1}Stay tied down to
this reality...

187
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:36,037
Fire Style...

188
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,105
...and die!

189
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:38,573
{\an1}Bomb Blast Dance!

190
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,017
{\an1}Nine Tails' tail...

191
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,370
-[gasp]
-Wait- What is-?!

192
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:13,777
{\an1}Looks like you're
having fun over here...

193
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,615
Obito.

194
00:22:58,054 --> 00:23:00,355
<i>He's... Madara!</i>

195
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,592
{\an1}<i>Madara? That Madara?</i>

196
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,194
{\an1}<i>But why? Why is that Madara</i>
<i>over here right now?</i>

197
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:09,332
{\an1}<i>Hey, Naruto! With him</i>
<i>here, that must mean...</i>

198
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,167
{\an1}<i>What's happened to</i>
<i>everyone over there?!</i>

199
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,569
{\an1}<i>Not sure, but I bet...</i>

200
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:17,975
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden: </i>
<i>"Obito and Madara."</i>

201
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:21,410
{\an1}<i>...that none of them</i>
<i>are doing that well.</i>
