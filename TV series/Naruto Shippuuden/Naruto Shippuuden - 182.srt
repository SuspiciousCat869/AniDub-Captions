1
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,992
This one's proven to
be quite a challenge...

2
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,393
{\an5}...but that just
means it'll be a
great puppet once
I master it.

3
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:24,462
{\an1}I wondered why
you'd been cooped
up in here so long.

4
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,129
{\an1}<i>(Temari)</i>

5

{\an8}Yeah...

6
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:31,233
{\an8}This one's a bit
complicated to
assemble... Ugh!

7
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,167
{\an8}And I wasn't
cooped up!

8

{\an7}Are you preparing
for war?

9
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:44,209
{\an8}In a way...

10

{\an8}<i>(Kankuro)</i>
<i>You heard what</i>

14

[painful scream]

15
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:02,889
{\an8}<i>(Kankuro)</i>
<i>Not to mention </i>

16

{\an8}<i>(Kankuro)</i>

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,226
{\an7}<i>(Temari)</i>

18

19

{\an8}<i>(Kankuro)</i>

20

Damnit. I
screwed up.

22
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:25,905
{\an5}Frankly, can they
get over what the
Akatsuki did to then
without their Hokage?

23

25
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:39,114
{\an1}But... At least
the Leaf Village
still has <i>him.</i>

26
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:43,985
{\an5}<i>(Kankuro)</i>
<i>I don't wanna</i>

<i>You know how</i>

27
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:46,820
{\an5}<i>(Kankuro)</i>
<i>-they see you.</i>
<i>You're a weapon</i>
<i>of terror!</i>

28
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:53,323
{\an8}Seriously. Leaving
us and joining the
regular troops won't be
easy. Nowhere near it.

29
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:56,426
{\an8}They're full of
Jonin who think
pretty pooly of
you...

30
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:01,730
{\an8}And most of the
villages are as
terrified of you as
they've always been.

31
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:11,104
{\an8}However-

32
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,871
{\an1}I know that.

33
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:18,542
{\an4}<i>(Gaara)</i>

<i>will almost certainly </i>
<i>bring even greater pain.</i>

34
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,512
And I know
exactly what
I must do now.

35
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,449
I must find a
way to clear my
own path...

36
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:36,353
{\an8}Perhaps then the
day will come when
I can be like him.

37
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:41,091
{\an7}(Naruto)
SERIOUSLY!? This is
a joint mission with
the Hidden Sand?

38
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:44,259
{\an7}Come on! We can
handle this without
those guys! Can't
we!?

39
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:46,794
Don't be that
way, Naruto.

40
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:49,296
{\an8}There's trouble
on the boarder we
share with the Sand
Village...

41
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,631
{\an8},,,if only one side
was asked to help,
the other might be
offended.

42
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:57,936
{\an8}Isn't it better if
the two allied
villages work together
on this mission?

43
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,337
It makes both
our jobs easier!

44
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,139
{\an1}[annoyed groan]

45
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:06,441
{\an4}This alliance was
formed after the attack
on the Leaf Village,
but it's untested.

46
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:09,111
{\an1}There are
still problems
to work out.

47
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:12,146
{\an1}The first step
is to build trust
on both sides...

48
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,748
{\an4}...and that's
really what this
particular mission
is all about.

49
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:18,150
{\an5}Wow, Sasuke!
Impressive!
You're so
clever!

50
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,019
{\an4}But, it does
take all the fun
out of it if you
put it like that.

51
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,988
{\an1}put it like what!?
I still don't get
it you guys!

52
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,456
Guess it's just
too deep for <i>you</i>
to understand!

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,526
{\an5}It's about nations,
villages, important
people, and critical
ideas!

54
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:35,561
{\an4}Knock it off,
Sakura!  You
don't have to
sound so mean!

55
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,765
{\an5}In any event, we're
allied nations, so
let's try to get
along, okay?

56
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:42,100
{\an1}Yeahhh, okay.

57
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,035
{\an7}I think that's enough
talking for now.

58
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,037
{\an7}Let's just head to
the rendezvous point
with the Sand.

59
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:52,141
{\an7}Yeah! Let's race to
see who gets there
first! Last one
there's a rotten egg!

60
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:54,609
{\an8}No fair! You
didn't even
say "go!"

61
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:59,278
{\an1}I win!! That
makes you a
rotten egg!

62
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,946
You're so
immature!

63
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,313
{\an1}Bahaha!

64
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:03,982
Stop it.

65
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:08,185
{\an5}This should be our
rendezvous point.
Looks like they're
not here yet.

66
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,721
{\an4}Of course they're
late! What do you
expect from a bunch
of jerks like that!?

67
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:18,159
{\an4}You can never tell what
those guys from the Sand
are thinking. And they're
sorta scary, too.

68

and saying "hi!"

I think you mean
Kankuro and Temari.

94
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,336
I'm enlisted with
the regular forces
right now.

95
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:14,273
Let me introduce
Yaoki and Korobi.
They serve under me.

this mission,

{\an7}And this is Naruto,

{\an8}Hey! What's up?

{\an8}Nice to
meet you!

102
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,516
{\an1}Hi there!

103
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,185
{\an1}Nice to meet
you too!

104
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:35,288
{\an5}They're still
rookies, so
please, be
patient.

105
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:42,559
{\an4}Now that we're all
together, I suggest that
Gaara's team approach
from the Western side-

106
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:45,694
{\an5}-of the mountain
and my Squad 7
will approach from
the East.

107
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:49,831
{\an4}Then, at midnight,
we'll simultaneously
attack the bandits
at the summit.

108
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,833
{\an1}How's that sound?

109
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:58,371
{\an1}Ugh! I don't see
why we have to
wait till then!

110
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:01,772
{\an4}Squad 7 can take
care of those
bandits by ourselves
right now!

111
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,574
These bandits are
made up of rogue
ninja.

112
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,943
{\an5}And word has it
that there are
even chunin-class
ninja among them.

113
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,345
{\an7}Yeah, you hear
that, Naruto!?

114
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,447
{\an7}If you rush in
there, you'll end up
putting us all in
really serious danger!

115
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,516
{\an5}Got it...
There's nothing
wrong with my
hearing...

116
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,119
{\an1}I believe we
should go with
your strategy.

117
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,323
{\an1}But I must
speak with you.

118
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,861
{\an7}Hey, why's Gaara
acting so secretive
all of a sudden?

119
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:36,462
{\an5}The team Captains
probably just want
to go over the
details, that's all.

would disappear.

myself as well.

help but believe
it was true!

195

everything I
faced, was the
hardest to bear.

00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,276
{\an1}But still...
Let them be.

269
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,879
{\an1}They're my people
even if they
cannot accept me.

270
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,747
I understand.

271
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:18,085
{\an1}Well, alright then!
Shall we get back to
our original mission now?

272
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,954
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>That's where it </i>
<i>all started for me...</i>

273
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:28,626
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>With that small</i>
<i>bond... that hand</i>
<i>extended in trust.</i>

274
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:35,030
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>I wanted to be</i>
<i>something precious</i>
<i>to others, too.</i>

275
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:44,203
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>NOt just to be</i>
<i>viewed as some</i>
<i>hideous weapon.</i>

276
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:58,213
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>But as the Sand's</i>
<i>next Kazekage.</i>

277
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,783
{\an8}Your people
do need you.

278
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,586
{\an8}You forged a bond
with all of them,
and were accepted
by them...

279
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,555
{\an8}You are the
Kazekage of the
Hidden Sand!

280
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:15,058
{\an5}He's the reason
my eyes opened.
He's known the same
pain as I have-

281
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,960
{\an5}and he taught me
that I can change
the path that my
life will follow.

282
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,264
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>The Leaf Village </i>
<i>has him...</i>

283
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:29,267
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>One who cherishes the</i>
<i>bonds of friendship</i>
<i>more than anyone I know.</i>

284
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,904
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Naruto Uzumaki...</i>

285
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:38,208
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Knowing him... and</i>
<i>the friends that he</i>
<i>holds so dear...</i>

286
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,643
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>They'll overcome</i>
<i>this disaster.</i>

287
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:47,547
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>And grow even stronger</i>
<i>as a result of getting</i>
<i>through it together.</i>

288
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,722
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Tell me again...</i>

289
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,857
Huh??

290
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:04,159
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Tell me what you</i>
<i>said back there.</i>
<i>Just one more time.</i>

291
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:07,027
{\an1}We're sorry we ran
off without you.

292
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,496
{\an7}<i>(Gaara)</i>
<i>Not that...</i>
Huh?

293
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:12,532
{\an7}The other thing.
Before that.

294
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:15,299
{\an1}Huh? Oh! Heh.

295
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,869
Yeah! Of course!

296
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,269
We're your
friends!

297
00:22:56,103 --> 00:22:57,672
{\an1}<i>(Tsunade)</i>
<i>Are you </i>
<i>kidding me?! </i>

298
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:01,240
{\an4}<i>(Tsunade)</i>
<i>After all this time your</i>
<i>people still haven't</i>
<i>captured Naruto!?</i>

299
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:04,610
{\an5}<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Lady Tsunade! He's</i>
<i>proving more troublesome</i>
<i>than we'd expected!</i>

300
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:07,812
{\an5}<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Naruto is just more</i>
<i>than the medical teams</i>
<i>alone can handle!</i>

301
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:13,082
{\an4}<i>(Tsunade)</i>
<i>Given the danger he posesses</i>
<i>we must stop him by whatever</i>
<i>neans necessary!</i>

302
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:17,385
{\an5}<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Naruto</i>
<i>Outbreak"</i>

303
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:20,754
{\an1}<i>(Tsunade)</i>
<i>This time you won't</i>
<i>get away, Naruto!</i>
