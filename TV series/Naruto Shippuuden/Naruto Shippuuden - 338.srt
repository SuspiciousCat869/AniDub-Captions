1
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,426
{\an4}I'll keep him trapped so
that it's easier for me to
cast my usual genjutsu on
him.

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,062
{\an1}So, then right now, Kabuto's
caught in the loop you've
created?

3
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:29,165
{\an1}And that's the Izanami?

4
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,400
{\an1}When did you cast it?

5
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:36,903
{\an1}The very first time Kabuto
stabbed me with that blade.

6
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,643
{\an1}Way back then, huh?

7
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:45,110
But how?

8
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:51,148
{\an1}You said that it was a
Visual Jutsu that worked
even without vision.

9
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:55,151
{\an1}How can a Visual Jutsu
work without eyesight?

10
00:00:55,184 --> 00:01:00,921
{\an4}Izanami is a Visual Jutsu
that works with the physical
senses of you and your
opponent.

11
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:03,990
{\an1}The physical senses of both?

12
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:08,594
{\an1}<i>As you are battling</i>
<i>your opponent...</i>

13
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:13,364
{\an4}<i>You use your Visual Prowess</i>
<i>to take a record, like a</i>
<i>picture, of the sensations</i>
<i>you and your </i>

14
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,666
{\an1}<i>opponent are feeling</i>
<i>in an instance.</i>

15
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,867
{\an1}<i>We'll call that "Exhibit A."</i>

16
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:22,871
{\an1}<i>As time progresses, you find</i>
<i>that "Exhibit B" is a more</i>
<i>important moment.</i>

17
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:26,540
{\an1}<i>Then you record "Exhibit C"</i>
<i>and so on with Sharingan.</i>

18
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:33,011
{\an4}<i>Then you recreate those</i>
<i>exact feelings. So you're</i>
<i>using your powers to create</i>
<i>a perfect copy </i>

19
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:36,113
{\an1}<i>of Exhibit A. We'll call</i>
<i>this "A Prime."</i>

20
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:42,951
{\an4}<i>By overlaying and connecting</i>
<i>A to A Prime, the Izanami</i>
<i>also links a path</i>
<i>including B Prime</i>

21
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:47,021
{\an1}<i>and C Prime to create</i>
<i>fluctuations within</i>
<i>a fixed time.</i>

22
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:51,058
{\an1}Thus, you can create
an infinite loop.

23
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,727
{\an1}All in exchange for one's
sight, of course.

24
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,595
{\an1}Just like the Izanagi.

25
00:01:57,196 --> 00:02:01,832
{\an1}So Kabuto's consciousness
is trapped inside the loop
that you created.

26
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:06,235
{\an1}He'll be fighting a phantom
you and a phantom me for all
eternity, then.

27
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:12,240
{\an1}Not quite... There's an escape
route built into the jutsu.
He could feasibly disengage.

28
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:17,677
{\an1}You see, the Izanami was
developed to admonish and
salvage an Izanagi user.

29
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:21,046
[surprised gasp]
What does that mean?

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,683
{\an1}You know a little bit about
the Izanagi already.

31
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:29,586
{\an1}It's a perfect Uchiha Visual
Jutsu designed to change
destiny.

32
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:35,825
{\an4}If something doesn't go the
way you want, you can just
erase that outcome and start
over.

33
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:40,694
{\an1}Ultimately, you can pick and
choose the most desirable
end result.

34
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:50,935
{\an4}What I'm about to tell you
is the story of the Uchiha's
Izanagi and how the Izanami
came to be.

35
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:53,002
{\an1}I want to be sure
you know this.

36
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,373
Izanami...

37
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,940
{\an1}...and the story of
it's creation...

38
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:51,456
{\an1}A long time ago, there was a
great battle the Uchiha Clan
couldn't afford to lose.

39
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:54,859
{\an1}The Izanagi tuned out to
be an invaluable jutsu.

40
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,661
Move in!

41
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,895
[battle cries]

42
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,673
{\an1}No, damn it! They
set a trap for us!

43
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,144
What?!

44
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,046
Now you die!

45
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:35,855
{\an1}As long as we Uchiha possess
the Izanagi it is impossible
for us to lose!

46
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:38,891
{\an1}[maniacal laughter]

47
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,294
{\an4}However, a jutsu that
allows the caster to choose
their own ending carries
with it a bigger

48
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,363
{\an1}risk of only the loss
of one's vision.

49
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:52,901
{\an4}Most who used that overly
powerful Visual Jutsu
couldn't handle it and
abused the power

50
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,401
that they held.

51
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:58,838
{\an1}If there was only one
Izanagi user, there
was no problem.

52
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:03,742
{\an4}But when two or more
used it, there was a
scramble within the
Uchiha Clan to see who

53
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,476
{\an1}could get the best result.

54
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,479
{\an1}You know, you're not the
only one who can use the
Izanagi!

55
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,817
I don't like you
bossing us around!

56
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,085
{\an1}But I am the one who
achieved it!

57
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,755
{\an1}In the shinobi world,
only results matter!

58
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:28,058
{\an1}Well, then... It seems my path
is clear. I'll just have
to rewrite that result...

59
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,160
{\an1}...with my own Izanagi!

60
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,368
{\an1}You fool! You're all talk!

61
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,370
I shall rule!

62
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:46,439
{\an1}Not just over the Uchiha,
but the entire shinobi
world!

63
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,440
{\an1}All thanks to my Izanagi!

64
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:54,445
{\an1}I'll take your wish and
I'll make it mine!

65
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:58,080
{\an1}Thanks to the power
of my own Izanagi!

66
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,917
{\an1}[triumphant laughter]

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,230
{\an1}[triumphant laughter]

68
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:25,601
{\an1}The Izanagi's ability to
influence outcomes caused
much inter-clan rivalry.

69
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:29,837
{\an1}The Izanami was ultimately
created to control its
power.

70
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,777
{\an1}Normal vision-based genjutsu
is powerless against Visual
Prowess...

71
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:48,184
{\an1}If you intend to oppose me
too, then I'm afraid that I
have no choice.

72
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:03,228
{\an1}There has to be a way to
settle this without more
fighting.

73
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,865
{\an1}[om harrumphing chuckle] My
hands are already deeply
stained with blood.

74
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,499
{\an1}You think I would stop now?

75
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,068
{\an1}What would be the point?

76
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,402
{\an1}You don't know yourself
anymore!

77
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,605
{\an1}You don't know what your
true strength really is!

78
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,874
Oh, be quiet!

79
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:36,185
{\an1}There's still time
to turn back!

80
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:40,254
{\an1}If you have the will to
change, then take my hand!

81
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,891
{\an1}You can't fool me!

82
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:04,873
{\an1}If you continue to refuse
to listen to me, then I'm
prepared, as well.

83
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,719
{\an1}First-rate work sneaking up
behind me like that!

84
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:25,989
{\an1}However, while I have the
Izanagi, you won't be able
to beat me!

85
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,690
{\an1}It's over for you!

86
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:57,879
What is this?!

87
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:02,281
{\an1}My right eye... I should have
gone blind after activating
the Izanagi!

88
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:06,184
{\an1}The Izanagi that you depend
on so much will not protect
you now.

89
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,285
Quiet!

90
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:13,322
No! Not yet...

91
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:14,457
Not yet!

92
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:20,528
{\an1}Reality is a product of
chance that we call fate.

93
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,296
{\an1}We cannot predict it.

94
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:27,801
{\an1}But Izanagi can twist around
an inconvenient reality and
lead it to a new fate.

95
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:32,970
{\an1}At a whim, the user can
change the original reality
into a new one.

96
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:38,541
{\an1}A fallen opponent can just
revive, so to an enemy, it's
an intolerable jutsu.

97
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:44,479
{\an4}If someone is using the
Izanagi to change an
outcome for their own
benefit, the Izanami

98
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:47,581
{\an1}causes them to circle
endlessly in a loop.

99
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,251
{\an1}I believed that the Izanagi
was the ultimate Visual
Jutsu...

100
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,587
{\an1}But this means the Izanami
is a far superior one...

101
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:03,325
{\an4}Izanami forms a loop using
physical sensations, even
stopping Izanagi from
warping reality.

102
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:07,495
{\an1}Since the Izanami is a jutsu
meant for stopping the
Izanagi...

103
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:11,598
{\an1}There's an escape route
that's built into the loop.

104
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:22,806
{\an1}Originally, the Izanami was
designed to keep the Uchiha
humble and honorable.

105
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:28,177
{\an4}It's to stop you from taking
the easy way out and
avoiding inconvenient
outcomes.

is a Forbidden Jutsu.

125

{\an1}I understand why Izanagi and
Izanami became Forbidden
Jutsu.

126
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:52,548
{\an4}And I also see how one must
learn from the past, accept
one's fate, and then find a
way to move on afterward.

127
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,219
But, why?

128

getting everything,
he can accomplish
whatever he wants to.

132
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:16,566

that he can't fail, even if
that really amounts to lying
to himself.

myself trust anybody.

00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,449
{\an1}Both of us were used
by the shinobi world.

137
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:42,685
{\an1}He can't forgive himself or
accept himself for what he
truly is.

138
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:46,722
{\an1}It's clear that what he's
doing is wrong.

139
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,657
{\an1}But he's not completely to
blame for not realizing
that.

140
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:58,030
{\an1}My chance has passed me by,
but he can still forgive
himself.

141
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,433
{\an1}But why, Big Brother?! Why
would you feel you needed to
help him do that?

142
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:07,837
{\an1}He is not like you.
No, you were perfect!

143
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,804
Sasuke...

144
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,977
{\an4}You know I was going to
control you. I planned to
use the Visual Jutsu Koto
Amatsukami.

145
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:22,714
{\an1}I treated you as though you
were a child. I thought you
needed my protection.

146
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,483
I was unable to
trust your strength.

147
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:32,389
{\an1}It may be that a perfect
being does not exist at all
in the whole world.

148
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:38,625
{\an4}Sometimes two people
who appear to be complete
opposites are actually two
sides of the

149
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:41,895
{\an1}same coin and can only
succeed when they work
together.

150
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,998
{\an1}Like the Izanagi and
Izanami....

151
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:50,302
{\an1}Look at me and find in
yourself what I couldn't
find in me.

152
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,137
However...

153
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,872
Do not ever say
that I was perfect.

154
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,141
First off...

155
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:11,283
{\an1}No! It's impossible! I've
already become a perfect
being!

156
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:16,187
{\an1}But this isn't the real me!

157
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,289
{\an1}How long will you
imitate Orochimaru?

158
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:26,094
{\an1}If you want to exit this
loop, you must reexamine
your mistakes!

159
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:27,195
Shut up!

160
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,397
{\an1}I know he's going to
use a Fire Style Jutsu.

161
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,365
{\an1}Water Style! Water Dragon--!

162
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,167
{\an1}Water Style! Water
Dragon Missile!

163
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,338
{\an1}He saw that coming
with his Sharingan!

164
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,818
{\an1}But how did I get
any of this wrong?

165
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,020
{\an1}Where have I ever make a
mistake in all this?!

166
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,757
{\an1}<i>All I ever wanted was for</i>
<i>someone to be there for me!</i>

167
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,059
{\an1}<i>Someone to acknowledge me!</i>

168
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,061
{\an1}<i>Someone to appreciate me!</i>

169
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:18,032
{\an1}<i>Tell me, where is this</i>
<i>mistake in wanting that?!</i>

170
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:29,374
{\an4}First off, I should
have acknowledged
and appreciated myself
for the person I was.

171
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:32,975
If I'd just done
that, I never would've
had to lie to anyone.

172
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:36,112
{\an1}To myself or to you.

173
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:39,847
{\an1}If you lie to yourself, how
can you have friends or be
trustworthy?

174
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:44,817
{\an1}In the end all these lies
will keep you from seeing
your true self.

175
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,522
{\an1}If I wasn't trapped here...

176
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,425
{\an1}I'd have won this war.

177
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:57,460
{\an1}I would have been
sleeping by now!

178
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:01,963
{\an1}Damn you, Itachi!

179
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,642
{\an1}It's 9 o'clock already.

180
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,411
Something wrong?

181
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:24,280
{\an4}No, I just wish we could
wrap up this war so I could
finally get a good night's
sleep!

182
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:30,918
{\an4}They never tell us rear
guard shinobi what's going
on. We're kept almost
completely in the

183
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,886
{\an1}dark on everything.

184
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:34,620
That's true.

185
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:38,457
{\an1}So, what are you gonna do
when this war's over?

186
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,892
Well, I'll start
by going home.

187
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:45,828
{\an1}If the war ends and the Five
Great Nations continue to be
friendly allies...

188
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:51,032
{\an4}Then maybe my little
brother, who's been on a
mission forever, can finally
come back home.

189
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,202
{\an1}Boy, I envy those who have
a home to return to...

190
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,873
{\an1}Yeah well, you could come
home with me?

191
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,708
{\an1}I mean, my home is
just an orphanage.

192
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:08,711
{\an1}But if my little brother's
there, he can take a look at
your wounds for ya.

193
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,347
{\an1}Wow, Urushi! Thank you!

194
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:16,518
{\an7}<i>I really hope you'll</i>
<i>come home this time.</i>

195
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,087
<i>Kabuto.</i>

196
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,395
{\an1}I'll stop the Reanimation
Jutsu now.

197
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:39,568
{\an1}All the reanimated
shinobi will be gone.

198
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:44,737
{\an1}And that should bring
the war to an end.

199
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:49,842
But Brother.

200
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,477
You'll go, too.

201
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:57,247
{\an1}But I will have protected my
village. I'm Itachi Uchiha
of the Leaf once again.

202
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:01,083
{\an1}I have no more regrets.

203
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,684
But why?!

204
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:06,854
{\an1}Why help the very village
that did this to you?! That
put you where you are?!

205
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,590
{\an1}You may be able to forgive
the Leaf, but I can't!

206
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,125
{\an1}You have no more regrets?!

207
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,194
{\an1}What about what you've made
me become? What about that,
huh?!

208
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,629
{\an1}[heavy breathing]

209
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,268
I will let you
deal with Sasuke.

210
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:30,671
{\an1}I tried to do everything
myself, too. And I failed.

211
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:35,741
{\an1}So this time I will leave
that task for a comrade to
handle.

212
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,146
{\an1}I'm not the one who can
change you, Sasuke.

213
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:48,684
{\an1}But I can stop this. This
reanimation jutsu is
something I can affect.

214
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:53,088
{\an1}In doing so, I'll fulfill my
promise to Naruto, at least.

215
00:20:55,624 --> 00:21:00,726
{\an1}It's time to end this. Tell
me the signs to stop the
Reanimation Jutsu!

216
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,861
Tsukuyomi!

217
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,739
{\an1}I've kept my promise. I
leave the rest up to you...

218
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,607
Naruto!

219
00:22:56,544 --> 00:23:01,248
{\an1}<i>I hate the Leaf Village for</i>
<i>causing you so much pain!</i>

220
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:04,350
{\an1}<i>I hate it more than I've</i>
<i>ever hated it before!</i>

221
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:10,120
{\an4}<i>It's because I'm your</i>
<i>brother that no matter what</i>
<i>you say, you're not going to</i>
<i>stop me!</i>

222
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:15,258
{\an1}<i>Even if you protect the</i>
<i>village now, I will still</i>
<i>destroy it someday.</i>

223
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:19,995
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "I Will Love You</i>
<i>Always."</i>

224
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,631
{\an1}<i>Goodbye, Big Brother.</i>
