00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:11,321
-Kabuto, I can fill you in
about this child later on.

2
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:15,998
For now, why don't you signal to
the three baby rats behind you

3
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:18,502
to come on out?

4
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:21,073
[laughs]

5
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:23,244
YAMATO (VOICEOVER): So he
must have known all along.

6
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,121
-There's the signal.

00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:36,837
-Well, it's you again.

-Mm, I know that
face all too well.

9
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:44,117
And it looks like the
nine-tails tagged along.

10
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,556
Well, we might as well
have a little fun together.

11
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:56,542
Let's find out who's gotten
stronger, you or Sasuke.

12
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:28,236
-Give Sasuke back.

13
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:29,738
You give him back.

14
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:45,636
-It's not as simple
as giving him back.

15
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:48,074
Really, you're way off here.

16
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,746
Sasuke came to us
of his own accord.

17
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:53,451
You can't dwell on
the past like this.

18
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,256
It's unbecoming of a man.

19
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,093
-Shut up, four eyes.

20
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:00,832
You don't understand
how people really feel.

21
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:02,301
You only understand cold logic.

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,011
-If you really want
to know about Sasuke,

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,982
then I'm afraid
you're just going

24
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:17,663
to have to force it out of me--
if you think you're up to it.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, what is this?

27
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,202
SAI (VOICEOVER): What is that?

28
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,846
-I see.

29
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,685
So it's just as I feared.

30
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:26,893
-Judging by the shape the chakra
was taking, the number of tails

31
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,030
will probably grow.

32
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:32,904
And eventually, they'll be nine.

33
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:41,187
-That about sums it up.

34
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,395
-Master Jiraiya, how
many tails have you seen?

35
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:45,896
-Hm.

36
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:54,746
In all my years of living, I've
come close to death only twice.

37
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,085
The first time, I broke
six ribs, both arms,

38
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,925
and ruptured a handful
of internal organs.

39
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:04,832
That was when I was caught
doing research at a hot spring,

40
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:08,673
and Tsunade beat me like a drum.

41
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:17,523
The second time--
the second was back

42
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:20,529
when Naruto and I were
off training together,

43
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,199
and the fourth tail appeared.

44
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,710
His anger acts like a trigger.

45
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:30,681
The number of tails increases
along with his rage.

46
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,408
He was able to
maintain consciousness

47
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,779
with the appearance of
the first three tails.

48
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:17,438
But after the fourth,
his mind was overpowered.

49
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,777
All that was left was a
hunger for destruction.

50
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:25,487
He was like a smaller version
of the nine-tailed fox.

51
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,290
-That far gone?

52
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:31,331
Even with the
fourth Hokage seal?

53
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:36,107
-I can't say what's causing it,
but one thing is for certain.

54
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,684
The fourth Hokage seal
formula seems to be weakening,

55
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,087
near as I can tell anyway.

56
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,971
-The fourth Hokage
sealing jutsu?

57
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,739
-Hard to believe.

58
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:58,417
-There's more.

59
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,925
When Naruto is cloaked in
the chakra of the nine tails,

60
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,765
I know it looks like
he's being protected,

61
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:10,473
but the truth is his
body is continuously

62
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,779
being harmed by
that same chakra.

63
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,718
When the fourth tail
emerged, his whole body

64
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,688
suffered severe injuries.

65
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,594
He ran amok covered in blood.

66
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,615
Once the cloak had
finally disappeared,

67
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:38,326
Naruto's internal nine tails
chakra began healing his body.

68
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,465
But if he continues this
cycle of egregious harm

69
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:45,206
and rapid recovery, his
body will pay the price,

70
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,377
and the span of his
life will be shortened.

71
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,071
-That's exactly why we need
you for this mission, Yamato.

72
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,721
After all, you carry
the cells of the First

73
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,327
Hokage in your blood.

74
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,501
-You alone possess the ability
to control the jinchuriki now.

75
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,839
It's in your blood.

76
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:23,746
Luckily, Naruto also wears
the First Hokage's necklace.

77
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,955
We're counting on you.

78
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:44,720
-Naruto, you've come a long way
as a jinchuriki, haven't you?

79
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:48,194
The power of the nine tails
gets stronger and stronger.

80
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,908
-Jinchuriki wield unimaginable
power thanks to their resonance

81
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,311
with the beast they carry.

82
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:06,528
-Naruto.

83
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,480
-You're starting to act
more like a jinchuriki,

84
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:26,949
aren't you, boy?

85
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:34,697
Now I see.

86
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:55,251
That's why he was chosen
to be your watch dog, yes?

87
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:59,360
Seems some of my experiments
came in handy after all.

88
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,695
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Experiments?

89
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:06,807
-Honestly, the
Leaf Village really

90
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:09,812
ought to be more grateful to me.

91
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,624
[laughs] Wouldn't you agree,
my darling little test subject?

92
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:18,162
-Test subject?

93
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,899
Who exactly is this guy?

94
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:28,716
-Years ago, when I still walked
amongst the fools of the hidden

95
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,623
Leaf Village, I sought the
power of the shinobi, who

96
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:36,431
was not only the ultimate
wood style ninjutsu master,

97
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:39,269
but also the one person
who had total control

98
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:43,745
over tailed beasts,
the First Hokage.

99
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:49,088
[laughs] I extracted some
DNA samples from the First's

100
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:52,962
remains and conducted
an experiment,

101
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,701
implanting genetic
components into the cells

102
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,606
of 60 worthy children.

103
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,745
But their bodies violently
rejected the treatment.

104
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:07,189
They perished in rapid
succession, one after another.

105
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,429
Just as I was closing
the book on the subject,

106
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,704
someone stumbled onto one
of my other experiments.

107
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,546
I was forced to flee, leaving
my laboratory exactly as it was.

108
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:25,291
I thought all the test
subjects had succumbed.

109
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,027
I never dreamed there'd
be any survivors.

110
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,779

So that's it.

-Four pillar prison jutsu.

112
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:49,504
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But-- but
isn't that wood style ninjutsu,

113
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:53,745
a secret ninjutsu known
only to the Hokage?

114
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:58,321
How is Captain Yamato
able to use it?

115
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:02,796
No wonder he can use
the First's ninjutsu.

116
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,200
-So that's his story.

117
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,639
How fascinating.

118

of your work all those years

You can observe the
fruits of your labor.

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,491
-There's no question
he's intriguing.

122
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,996
But I wonder more about Sasuke.

123
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,367
He needs to stretch his wings.

124
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,537
Maybe we could put
his growth to the test

125
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,877
by pitting him
against Naruto here.

160
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,902
An enemy survivor of the
battle at Kikyo Pass,

161
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:58,941
he was taken in by the captain
of the Leaf medical unit

162
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:00,912
and raised as a son.

163
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:05,086
Hence, little is known
of his real origins.

164
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,257
He hid his true
skill in the Leaf

165
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,662
by posing as an average genin.

166
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:13,269
But in battle, his masterful
handle of medical ninjutsu

167
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,644
proved a challenge
even for Tsunade.

168
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,164
Originally one
Sasori's agents, Kabuto

169
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,508
came to admire the man
he'd been sent to spy on,

170
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:26,945
and his loyalties
swung to Orochimaru.

171
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:31,950
But his intentions, much like
the man himself, are an enigma.

172
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,953
His case still remains open,
and further investigation

173
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,588
is recommended.
