1
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,365
{\an1}No! Stop! Why are
you doing this?!

2
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:21,566
{\an1}[painful grunting]

3
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:26,935
[screaming]

4
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:38,441
{\an1}Now to test these
outside...

5
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,413
I already know
these eyes...

6
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,315
See the darkness
quite well...

7
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,265
{\an1}I wonder if Sasuke
and Karin are okay?

8
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,867
{\an1}I wouldn't waste any
time thinking about
that if I were you.

9
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,302
{\an1}What? Why's that?

10
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:30,803
{\an1}Because even if Karin and
Sasuke are alive and still
together.

11
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:32,971
{\an1}Do you really think if we
found them, we'd have

12
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,739
{\an1}some kind of touching,
emotional reunion?

13
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:40,175
{\an1}Just listen... Karin
wants to get hot and
heavy with Sasuke.

14
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:44,144
{\an1}Which means that to her,
the two of us will just
be in the way.

15
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:45,278
I see...

16
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,880
{\an1}So what do we do? Just keep
collecting blades, then?

17
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:51,582
{\an1}Nah, no way! We're going
to meddle, of course!

18
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:55,716
{\an1}After all, that's my second
favorite pastime after
collecting blades.

19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,552
{\an1}So, are we going to look
for Sasuke and Karin?

20
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,287
{\an1}Let's check out Orochimaru's
hideout first!

21
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:02,185
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei! Bushier Brow
Sensei! You both came!

22
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,853
{\an1}You know that I can't just
sit back and relax not while

23
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:08,188
{\an1}my student from Team 7
is working so hard!

24
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:13,791
{\an1}Oh! Right! Him! He's got
a Sharingan and a Rinnegan
that are linked,

25
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,959
{\an1}left eye to right eye,
and there's a rod sticking

26
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,628
{\an1}out of the left side of the
chest, and, and, uhhh!

27
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,396
{\an1}Just calm down! You aren't
making any sense at all!

28
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:25,464
{\an4}His right eye holds a
Sharingan and his left a
Rinnegan. And he has the

29
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,667
{\an1}same rods that Pain
used. So I see, at least...

30
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,635
{\an1}Well, your deductive
skills are as impressive
as always, Kakashi.

31
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:33,935
Here it comes!

32
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:36,103
{\an1}I count Five Tails!

33
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,172
Leaf Rock Crush!

34
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:43,241
{\an1}Hey! Thanks! That's
way better!

35
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:47,943
{\an1}He's after the Eight Tails!

36
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,078
I'm real sorry,
Eight-o! You okay?

37
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:55,214
{\an1}We share pain, remember?
So are you all right, Bee?!

38
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,018
{\an1}Wait, was it trying
to attack him??

39
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,221
[angry roar]

40
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,824
{\an8}<i>So painful!</i>

41
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:17,527
{\an8}<i>I can't believe,</i>
<i>I'm letting him...</i>

42
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:21,329
Why, you!

43
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:25,497
{\an1}There! He's done it!

44
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,703
{\an1}But why is he bottling up
the Tailed Beast's power?

45
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:37,671
{\an1}I don't know... He doesn't
seem to have the Tailed

46
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,305
Beast completely
under his control.

47
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,707
{\an1}Maybe that's why...

48
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,974
[angry growling]

49
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:53,379
{\an1}Hey, did you hear that,
Naruto? That voice?

50
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,146
Yeah. I did.

51
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:58,915
{\an1}That was the Tailed
Beast... Five Tails' voice.

52
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:01,049
[growling]

53
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,018
We Tailed Beasts
have emotions.

54
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:08,721
{\an1}It pains me to see
one of my kind treated
like that!

55
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,357
{\an1}Agh! Now you get mad?!

56
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:19,760
{\an1}It's always been the same
with every single shinobi
who has kept us as pets!

57
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:25,996
{\an1}Eight Tails, you and that
brat Bee are a special
exception.

58
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,964
{\an1}[harrumphing chuckle]
I wonder about that
Nine Tails...

59
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:32,700
{\an1}Huh?! Wait, Nine Tails
can talk directly to
Eight Tails?!

60
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,268
I know you, Nine
Tails. You-

61
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,370
{\an1}You talk too much!

62
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:42,373
{\an1}By the way, given the number
of tails you have, aren't

63
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,441
{\an1}you the next most powerful
after me, Eight Tails?

64
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,643
{\an1}Hurry up and finish this!
I'm going to take a nap!

65
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:53,545
{\an1}Don't decide who's
stronger or weaker based
on the tail count!

66
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,714
{\an1}You've always been like
this! That's why that Tanuki
One Tail really hates you!

67
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:04,016
{\an1}Hey, are you even listening
to me, you fool?! Don't you
dare play possum, you fox!

{\an1}Eight Tails and Nine Tails
are actually fighting!

71
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,589
{\an4}Tailed Beasts can talk to
other Tailed Beasts
mind-to-mind, but it's a

72
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,623
{\an1}real rare thing, of
the amazin' kind.

incoming!

{\an1}Remember, don't let
your guard down
just 'cause I'm here!

00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:23,528
Right!

77
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,929
{\an1}We need to confirm which one
performs which of Pain's
jutsu! Got it, Guy?

78
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:30,931
{\an1}Listen, I have enough
trouble remembering
people's faces.

{\an1}What's going on? They're
not using any of those!

90
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:13,921
Why?!

91
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:15,756
{\an1}They're not using
Pain's jutsu!

92
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:18,023
{\an1}Maybe they or he can't.

93
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:21,993
{\an1}Or maybe just he's shrewd
enough not to divvy up his
chakra and waste it...

94
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,327
{\an1}in order to make them
perform Pain's jutsu,

95
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,829
{\an1}which we already know
and are able to counter.

96
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:31,030
{\an4}Yeah It's got to take an
enormous amount of chakra to
completely control seven

00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:34,299
{\an1}Tailed Beasts with just
one's Visual Prowess.

{\an1}Gotta hand it to you,
Kakashi Sensei!

99
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:39,202
{\an1}There you go using that big
brain of yours again!

100
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:45,071
{\an1}Kakashi Hatake... He's
got very discerning eyes.

101
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,642
{\an1}Well then, let us just
power it up a little
bit, shall we?

Damn it.

108
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,127
{\an1}We'll distract them
with Nine Tails Chakra
Shadow Clones,

109
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,829
{\an1}while we go after this
masked guy head on!

110
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:31,063
{\an1}You can't make any more Nine
Tails Chakra Shadow Clones!

111
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:35,065
{\an1}If you do, Nine Tails will
take all of your own chakra,
and you'll be done!

112
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,835
{\an1}And you don't have to
guess: that is no fun!

113
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,369
{\an1}Bee, have you still
not noticed?

114
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,771
{\an1}I thought you bumped
fists with him!

115
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,638
{\an1}Given the number of clones
he's produced, Naruto

116
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,240
should have been
half-dead long ago.

117
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:51,541
{\an1}That he's not means Nine
Tails stopped taking

118
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,809
Naruto's chakra
a while back!

119
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,710
{\an1}Right, Nine Tails?

120
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,948
{\an1}I don't know what happened
between you two, but...

121
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,952
{\an1}Hey! Ya know what,
Nine Tails...

[chuckle]

{\an1}I believe I'm gonna come
after all of that hate

124
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,655
that's inside of
you, too, someday!

125
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,591
{\an1}And just who the hell
are you to decide...

126
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:25,760
{\an1}...that having a Tailed Beast
makes me feel despair like
that?!

127
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:33,731
{\an1}What the heck is that?!

128
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,499
{\an1}Whatever you do, don't let
that stuff touch you, Guy!

{\an1}Guy, we've got our own
problems! We need to
help ourselves first!

each other's backs and focus
on what's in front of us.

140
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:06,147

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,031
{\an1}Let's wrap this up quickly
and go help Naruto!

148
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,938
[grunting]

149
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,240
Hey! Let Naruto
go, monkey!

150
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,212
{\an1}Nine Tails... it seems that
you're helping out Naruto's
clone, who's fighting the

151
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:08,081
{\an1}other Madara, by giving
him some of your chakra.

152
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:12,850
{\an1}You ought to lend this one
strength, as well before
it's too late.

153
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,587
{\an1}I'm not like you, Eight
Tails. I don't keep wagging

154
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,488
{\an1}my tails at my Jinchuriki
time after time.

155
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,657
{\an1}Are you saying you don't
care what happens to Naruto?

156
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,096
[angry growling]

157
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,396
Nine Tails...

158
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,366
{\an4}This transient form is
nothing more than a nodule.

159
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,936
{\an1}You're only a piece of
yourself, a pittance
of your true power.

160
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,036
Quiet.

161
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:52,739
{\an1}You are merely an ignorant
and unstable power...

162
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,139
Shut up!

163
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:57,875
{\an1}The ones who shall guide
you are the Uchiha.

164
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:03,177
{\an1}You Tailed Beasts are
simply servants of those
with Visual Prowess!

165
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,912
{\an1}Shut the hell up!

166
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,747
Now, obey me!

167
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,818
{\an1}Nine Tails... Your power is
too great, too destructive.

168
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:17,785
{\an1}I'm sorry, I can't let
you run around loose.

169
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:21,654
No matter what
words they use...

170
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:26,190
{\an1}Whenever you exercise
your power, you always
draw hatred to you.

171
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:29,191
{\an1}Please, just stay
quiet inside me.

172
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:33,694
{\an1}Humans are always saying...

173
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:40,465
{\an1}This is an unfortunate
situation for the both of
us, so please listen.

174
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:45,467
{\an1}You're here to keep the
world in check, but I'm
here to keep watch over you.

175
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,435
...the same thing.

176
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:55,539
{\an1}And now, this brat? How
dare these shinobi...

177
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,675
{\an1}I'll bet even he's the same...

178
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,645
{\an1}Hey, ya know what,
Nine Tails?

179
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:07,145
{\an1}I believe I'm gonna come
after all of that hate

180
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:10,048
{\an1}that's inside of you,
too, someday!

181
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,888
[groaning]

182
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:28,591
[screaming]

183
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:31,525
Naruto!

184
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,861
[screaming]

185
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:43,932
What?!

186
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:48,101
{\an1}I suppose that now you want
to take my power, too?

187
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:52,070
{\an1}Coming all the way in
here... You obnoxious
little brat!

188
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,405
Hold on, are you
Four Tails?!

189
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:59,775
{\an1}Don't you dare call me "Four
Tails!" I have a proper
name, you know!

190
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:05,110
{\an1}I am the handsome Monkey
King of Suirendo, The King
of Sage Monkeys, bestowed

191
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:09,379
{\an1}with the priestly title "Son"
from the Sage of Six Paths!

192
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:14,214
{\an1}The Great Monkey Equal
of Heaven, Son Goku!
[screeching scream]

193
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,685
{\an1}Huh? What? So... Which
part's your name?

194
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,053
{\an1}Is it [screeching scream]?

195
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,285
It's Son Goku!

196
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,688
Hmph! You humans
are all stupid!

197
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:28,423
{\an1}Can't even remember
names! You all are
less than apes.

198
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:31,825
{\an1}I really don't want to give
my power to the likes of
such...

199
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,392
{\an1}So, where are we? This is
like where Nine Tails lives...

200
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,995
{\an1}Do you not pay attention?! I
just told you my name!

201
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,897
{\an1}How dare you ignore me!
You are far too rude!

202
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,331
Heh? Oh, uh...

203
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:45,598
{\an1}Sorry about that...

204
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:47,299
Hm?

205
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:53,503
{\an4}You seem rather genuine for
a human. You're the first
one I know of who's ever

206
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:56,005
apologized to a
Tailed Beast.

207
00:16:56,038 --> 00:17:00,107
{\an1}I guess you didn't
come to steal my
power after all, eh?

208
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:08,745
{\an1}You have one inside you,
as well. So that's
how you got in...

209
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:12,047
{\an1}It seems that Kurama
has trained you well.

210
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:12,880
Kurama?

211
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,115
Who's Kurama?

212
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:20,584
{\an1}Huh?! You're his Jinchuriki
and you don't even know
his real name?!

213
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,020
{\an1}You humans disgust me!

214
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:26,088
{\an1}What?! You mean Nine
Tails has a name, too?!

215
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,655
[growling]

216
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,890
Oh, I see! His
name's Kurama, huh?

217
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:35,827
{\an1}You humans only see us as
sources of great power.

218
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,294
{\an1}You don't even care
if we have names.

219
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,629
You show us no
respect whatsoever!

220
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:45,798
{\an1}You imprison us and you
deny us our true status.

221
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,038
{\an1}Look, it's that child.

222
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,872
{\an1}Ignore him and keep walking.

223
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:00,906
{\an1}Who is that kid, anyway?

224
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,574
{\an1}You don't need to know.

225
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,682
[chuckling]

226
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,983
What is this?!

227
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:21,584
Why you annoying
little brat!

228
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:28,254
{\an1}I may not be the same
as you, but I understand
how you feel.

229
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,455
{\an1}I used to misbehave
all the time...

230
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,125
{\an1}Just so I'd get noticed.

231
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:35,692
Huh?

232
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,228
{\an1}I'd do anything to get
people's attention! Because
even having people get upset

233
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,030
{\an1}with me was better
than being invisible.

234
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,464
{\an1}I'm a Jinchuriki...

235
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:50,067
{\an1}But, still I've got a name
I cherish, too! Naruto!

236
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,568
{\an1}It's a memento from my
parents and master!

237
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:54,169
Hmph!

238
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,071
That's why...

239
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:05,341
{\an1}Nobody. I don't want to be
anybody. I just want to
fulfill Project Tsuki no Me.

240
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,109
{\an1}That will be enough.

241
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,879
{\an1}I hate that he doesn't even
care enough about who he
is to have a name.

242
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:17,181
{\an1}It is not worth living in
this world where only
despair exists.

243
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:21,450
{\an1}But despite that, he's still
forcing you to do whatever
he wants!

244
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,488
{\an1}Well, then, what would
you want to do with us?

245
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,958
I guess I'd be
like Octopops...

246
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,560
{\an1}Yeah, that's what I
want. To be like Octopops
and Eight Tails.

247
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:41,828
Huh?

248
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,129
{\an1}Whenever I watch them
together, they're always

249
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,197
{\an1}joking and fighting
and playing...

250
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,398
{\an1}I can't really explain it
well, but I can see it when
I'm with them.

251
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,499
They're like-

252
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,834
{\an1}They are true friends.

253
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,004
{\an1}And seeing them together,
it always makes me feel...

254
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,303
Hm?

255
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:03,173
{\an1}I guess kind of jealous!

256
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,674
[laughter]

257
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,143
{\an1}Come on! Are you telling me
that you, a human, really

258
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:16,580
{\an1}wants to be friends
with a Tailed Beast?!
[hysterical laughing]

259
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,820
{\an8}<i>This human...</i>

260
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,787
{\an7}<i>Is completely serious.</i>

261
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:39,425
{\an1}So that's the reason I
want to help you, too...

262
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:42,295
{\an1}But, uh, what was
your name again?

263
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,495
[sigh]

264
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:46,996
{\an1}Just call me Son...

265
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,565
{\an1}By the way, I ate you.
What're you going to do now?

266
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:54,633
{\an1}Oh, yeah! I forgot about
that! What do I do?!

267
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,168
Uh...

268
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:03,672
{\an7}<i>At least he's better than</i>
<i>the guy in the mask...</i>

269
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:07,141
{\an1}There is a way to stop me.

270
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:08,408
Huh?!

271
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:12,877
{\an1}Just undo these chains and
I'll tell you what I mean.

272
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,512
[chuckling]
Son!

273
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,668
{\an1}<i>I don't trust Jinchuriki</i>
<i>humans on principle. </i>

274
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:05,205
{\an1}<i>Especially not fools like</i>
<i>you that claim they want to</i>
<i>be friends with Tailed Beasts!</i>

275
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:07,705
{\an1}<i>Don't assume that even if</i>
<i>you do set me free from</i>

276
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,574
{\an1}<i>these chains I'll</i>
<i>automatically become </i>
<i>your ally.</i>

277
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,643
{\an1}<i>That's the kind of</i>
<i>response I'd expect.</i>

278
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:18,678
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Nine Tails."</i>

279
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:22,014
{\an1}<i>All that humans want</i>
<i>is to imprison us!</i>
