-Well, when this is
all over, one of us

11
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,766
will have both scrolls.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,233
And the other will be dead.

KABUTO: That young
genin who once

16
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,766
trembled before you, he's
matured a lot, hasn't he?

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,300
-I knew the moment the boy
turned his immature Sharingan

18
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,300
on me.

19
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,566
He had such magnificent
eyes, even then.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,400
[laugh]

21
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,300
-Anyone who's
developed a Sharingan

22
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,166
that strong at his age
must be someone special.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,700
I knew that he would prove
an even greater treasure

24
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,533
than Itachi.

25
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,833
Oh yes, I realized at once
he was the perfect choice.

26
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,333
Especially when I saw the
pain he carried within him.

27
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,933
I knew he would eventually
come seeking me out,

28
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:08,266
in search of even more power.

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,800
-Yes, I remember.

30
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,700
It was for that reason you
gave them the curse mark

31
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,133
and stayed to watch
the chunin exams to see

32
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,133
if it would bear fruit.

33
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,633
-You mean that
business with Anko?

[laugh]

35
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,600
-That was just a coincidence.

36
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,400
You see, I always
had every intention

37
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,566
of striking against the
Leaf Village, anyway.

38
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:36,200
I knew that if Yoroi drained
him of all his chakra,

39
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,933
Sasuke would be forced to use
the power of the curse mark.

40
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:45,000
Go on, release that
delicious forbidden power.

41
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,800
Set it free.

What more can be said?

52
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,766
He was perfect, having
the strength of will

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
to fight off the curse mark.

54

as well as the wisdom

55
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,433
of knowing when to use it.

56
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,533
KABUTO: It's true.

57
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,333
There's nothing like
combat for accelerating

58
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:33,766
a ninja's development.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,600
You were wise to let him
continue the chunin exams.

60
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:41,833
-Hm.

61
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,633
I suppose so.

62
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,566
After all, he did
improve, didn't he?

now, there's no more

67
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,833
he can learn from the Leaf.

68
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,733
There is no one
else in this world

69
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,933
who can train him
as well as I can.

70
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,133
No one who so fully
understands the darkness

71
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,433
that consumes his soul.

72
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,166
-And there's no one else who
can make him more like you,

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
is there?

is merely a side benefit.

And for this transgression,
you shall be punished.

I shall take away all the
jutsu you hold so dear.

it's just a distant memory now.

made a complete survey

00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,434
The ANBU Black Ops
stationed there

have vanished without a trace.

The Three-Tails is gone too.

-Hm.

172
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,434
-It's my fault.

173
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,401
It's all because I failed
to seal the Three-Tails.

174
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,534
Still, I wonder who
could have done it.

175
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,168
-Exactly.

176
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:19,101
Who would be capable of
taming the Three-Tails,

177
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,968
and in so short a time?

have to teach me, Orochimaru.

Now you'll see I can be

You are still naive.

So at this point, I
don't see a reason

00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:11,301
to just hand over my body.

you could handle.

to see if this nursling

lay claim to me.

You thought you could bind me
to you with this curse mark.

-You're acting like a fool.

You should come with us.

Lord Orochimaru
offers you power.

-Come on now, you
didn't really think

238
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:44,068
you were Lord Orochimaru's
only pet, did you?

239
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:46,034
-In exchange for
the curse's power,

240
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:49,201
you will be tethered
to Lord Orochimaru.

241
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:52,568
All semblance of freedom
will be lost to you.

To gain one thing, another
must be left behind.

What is your purpose
in this life?

-I'm an avenger.

00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,134
I want revenge.

247
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,601
I wanted it so badly, I
was willing to give up

248
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,134
my body to get it.

249
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:17,501
What you wanted was
the Sharingan, right?

250
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,701
But how to get it?

251
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,534
Itachi was out of the question.

252
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:25,901
So you come after me,
the baby of the clan.

253
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,234
Isn't that so?

254

And they say you're the genius
out of the legendary sannin.

But it turns out, you're just

and you know it.

You're not even in the
same league as the Uchiha.

In fact, next to the
Uchiha, genius like yours

looks pretty ordinary.

The way you covet the
power of the Uchiha,

261
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,801
the way you fill yourself
up with medicines

00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,901
and go leaping from body
to body, it's disgusting.

As an Uchiha, all I
see when I look at you

264
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:01,068
is a miserable wretch.

don't like your style.
