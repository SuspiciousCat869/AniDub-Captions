1
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,318
-So that's his real body?

2
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,090
-I've waited 20 years.

3
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:30,461
I want to see my
grandson's face.

4
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:53,508
-What took you so long?

5
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,713
-I got back here
as fast as I could.

6
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:58,585
And besides, you're the one
who didn't send a replacement

7
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,255
border guard soon enough.

8
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,195
It was your plan, and it
completely fell apart.

9
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:04,130
-Really?

10
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:05,800
I carried out your
selfish request,

11
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,738
even though I had
just been poisoned.

12
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,207
You don't seem very grateful.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,109
If you ask me.

14
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,191
Well then, shall we go?

15
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,762
-Yeah.

16
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:20,329
-Yes, sir.

17
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:51,025
-It can still move?

18
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,502
-Well played.

19
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:15,876
I should've expected no
less from my own granny.

20
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,915
No wonder even a kid like
that could dodge my attacks

21
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:19,716
so easily.

22
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:32,175
You can foresee my
attacks, old woman.

23
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,980
Then you control the
girl with chakra threads

24
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:38,153
using your Puppet Master Jutsu.

25
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,557
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): He knows.

26
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,731
-By the way, how clever of
you to attach chakra threads

27
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,506
to Hiruko's tail too.

28
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,109
Silly me.

29
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,745
I only noticed when
the tail's motion

30
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,218
was brought to an abrupt halt.

31
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,324
You did it when you threw
those kunai, didn't you?

32
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,271
The thread tied to the
knife stuck to his tail

33
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:04,708
once they were deflected.

34
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,163
-Good.

35
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,302
Even though I used the
tiniest bit of chakra

36
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,773
to keep the strings
undetectable,

37
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,979
you still figured it out.

38
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,583
-But of course.

39
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:28,389
Remember who taught me
how to play with puppets,

40
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,827
who drilled the talent into me.

41
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:31,796
It was you.

42
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,733
-Indeed.

43
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:37,875
But, unfortunately,
play time is over.

44
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:42,785
-You don't know
how right you are.

45
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:46,224
[gasp]

46
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:52,136
-So, do you still think
this'll be easy, Granny Chiyo?

47
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:05,430
-Lady Chiyo, is that person
there the real Sasori?

48
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,869
-I don't understand.

49
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:10,307
Your face is exactly the same.

50
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,476
You haven't aged.

51
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,557
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
It can't be him.

52
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,197
They told me Sasori left the
Hidden Sand 20 years ago.

53
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,201
He couldn't be that young.

54
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,670
[theme music]

55
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,824
-Ah, damn it all to hell.

56
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,167
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
There's noise

57
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,471
coming from inside the cavern.

58
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:40,745
No doubt about a battle's
already underway.

59
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,849
I need to know what's
going on in there, but--

60
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,491
NARUTO: I've had it.

61
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,963
Hand over Gaara right now!

62
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,001
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): It's
only a matter of time

63
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:55,308
until my man Sasori takes
care of their friends inside.

64
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,228
But if he rushes out here, the
whole point of using this guy

65
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,132
to draw out that
nine-tailed jinchuriki

66
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,201
you will be for nothing.

67
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,213
NARUTO: You bastard!

68
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:16,785
You're not getting away!

69
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,856
Hold it right there!

70
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,024
-Naruto, no!

71
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:20,860
Stop!

72
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,563
-Just stay and help Sakura.

73
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:25,168
I can take this
guy, Kakashi-sensei.

74
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:25,936
-Ah, damn it.

75
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,025
Guy, come in.

76
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,996
How are things on your end?

77
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,497
GUY: Haa!

78
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:52,657
Hate to say it,
Kakashi, but I think

79
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,027
this is gonna take a while.

80
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:06,519
-Rotation!

81
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,233
If you're trying
to delay someone,

82
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,902
I can't think of a
better way than this.

83
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,267
-This is tough
when your enemy has

84
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,037
the same exact skills as you.

85
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,447
-I believe it will not
be very easy to bring

86
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,751
this fight to an end.

87
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:48,069
Your moves are good, imposter.

88
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,539
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
At this point,

89
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,142
there's no way I
can help the others.

90
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:59,459
Sakura, Lady Chiyo, you'll have
to hold your own a bit longer.

91
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:04,269
-There's no chance I'm
letting you get away!

92
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,581
-Still chasing me.

93
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,516
Hm.

94
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,720
You'd better catch
up with me soon!

95
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,934
But when you do reach me,
I'll take care of you.

96
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,187
-Everyone stop.

97
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,295
-Wh-- Why'd you
stop us, Kankuro?

98
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:52,132
-We should all rest for a while.

99
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,101
-Do what?

100
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,205
What are you talking
about, Kankuro?

101
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:57,944
We don't have time to just
sit here and take a load off.

102
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,048
-Now don't be so impatient.

103
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,186
It's not like you to
lose your cool, sis.

104
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:08,132
[panting]

105
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:10,001
-I'm sorry that we
can't keep up, Temari.

106
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,472
-A few more minutes.

107
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,275
Then we'll be able to
start running again.

108
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:13,977
-Please.

109
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,484
Let us catch our breath.

110
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,854
-No discipline.

111
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:20,858
You people call
yourselves shinobi?

112
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:22,728
-You're asking the impossible.

113
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,264
Look at 'em, will you?

114
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:27,638
They took turns on border
guard duty 24 hours a day,

115
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,509
then the second they
get back to the village,

116
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:32,380
they're called to run out
here as fast as they can.

117
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:34,685
No matter how disciplined
these ninja might be,

118
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,792
you can't force them to
do more than they're able.

119
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:38,393
-No.

120
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,462
We can keep going!

121
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:40,697
We can't give in to
our own weaknesses

122
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,468
when Lord Gaara's in trouble!

123
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,411
-We must do everything
in our power

124
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:49,515
for the sake of the Kazekage!

125
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,551
-That's right.

126
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,454
To protect our dear Kazekage.

127
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,829
-Lady Temari, we're
ready whenever you are.

128
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,131
-All right then.

129
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,801
That's the passion I want.

130
00:10:58,835 --> 00:10:59,569
-Now, now.

131
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:01,206
Let's not get too fired up.

132
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,644
-Lo-- Lord Ebizo,
what do you mean?

133
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:04,680
-Remember.

134
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,117
a good ninja never
loses his composure

135
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,888
under any circumstances.

136
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,894
When Kankuro forgot that,
and recklessly chased

137
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,234
after an enemy, he nearly got
himself killed, didn't he?

138
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:20,043
Look at yourselves,
all worked up.

139
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,983
You don't even realize
where we are, do you?

140
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,987
-What are you talking about?

141
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,490
-Well, for example, over there.

142
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,835
-Look at that.

143
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,273
-It appears to be the
aftermath of a battle

144
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:37,279
between the Akatsuki
and Leaf ninja.

145
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:38,514
-But that means--

146
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:39,684
-Indeed.

147
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,788
It is safe to assume
we have already

148
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,696
crossed into the territory
controlled by the Akatsuki.

149
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,435
There's no telling what
kind of dangerous traps

150
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:50,271
are out there waiting for us.

151
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,576
All of us must make our
way through this area

152
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,212
with extreme caution.

153
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,453
If the five of you were to
just go rushing in, especially

154
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,357
in your worn out
condition, you would

155
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,461
be annihilated in
no time at all.

156
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:06,471
[gasping]

157
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:07,840
-It'll be fine.

158
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,711
In fact, while
you get some rest,

159
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,916
I could tell you a story
about the old days.

160
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:20,567
It was a long, long time ago.

161
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,105
I'm sure you young people must
have heard something of it

162
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:27,647
before, what happened
with the Third Kazekage.

163
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:28,316
-Wait a minute.

164
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,286
The Third Kazekage?

165
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,622
-Yes, dear.

166
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,395
The one before our
previous leader.

167
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:38,001
The Third Kazekage was said
to be the most powerful

168
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:42,110
of any Kazekage, but then,
in the blink of an eye,

169
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:45,650
his mysterious disappearance
changed everything.

170
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,289
The village was
overwhelmed with distress

171
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,693
trying to find
their lost leader.

172
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,332
Looking back on it, you
could see how easily

173
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:56,606
people could let panic
cloud their judgment.

174
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,144
The Village Guard
became distracted,

175
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,348
allowing the enemy to invade.

176
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,554
Pandemonium ensued.

177
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,891
If they had taken
a collective breath

178
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,766
and dealt with things calmly,
the subsequent bloodbath

179
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,536
could have been avoided.

180
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,907
Now, I of all
people am painfully

181
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:16,613
aware of how eager
you must feel.

182
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:20,621
Even so, you must not
allow emotion to blind you,

183
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,358
else you'll repeat
the mistakes that

184
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,195
were made in the time
of the Third Kazekage.

185
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:30,341
-But, Lord Ebizo, how
does the story end?

186
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:34,750
Did they ever find out what
happened to the Third Kazekage?

187
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,255
-For years, the ANBU
Black Ops continued

188
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,994
to investigate in
secret, but no body

189
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,231
was ever discovered,
nor any sign

190
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,068
that the Kazekage
had been kidnapped.

191
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,923
-What's the matter,
Granny Chiyo?

192
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,328
Are you so filled with
emotion that you can't speak?

193
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:18,839
I'm not surprised.

194
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:24,049
It's our first
union in 20 years.

195
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,622
-Sasori, you--

196
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:29,261
SASORI: While I have you, let
me show you something special.

197
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:37,010
I guarantee it will move you.

198
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,184
This piece was particularly
difficult to acquire.

199
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,053
-Three?

200
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:43,455
What?

201
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:47,263
-But on the other hand, that's
what makes me so fond of him.

202
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:56,849
-No.

203
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,920
That can't be.

204
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:00,156
Impossible.

205
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,426
-What is?

206
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:02,394
What's impossible?

207
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,143
-It's him.

208
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,412
It's the Third Kazekage.

209
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:18,894
OK

210
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:19,863
-The Third Kazekage?

211
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,777
[chuckling]

212
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,158
-What do you think?

213
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:37,432
Doesn't he just take
you back, Granny Chiyo?

214
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:38,734
-The Third Kazekage?

215
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,340
Lady Chiyo, what does this mean?

216
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,813
-So this must be
what happened to him.

217
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,717
-Are you saying?

218
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,324
-It's been over ten years since
the Third Kazekage suddenly

219
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:55,001
disappeared from the
village without a trace.

220
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:58,775
We scoured the countryside
but could never find him.

221
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,650
The strongest of our
Kazekage simply vanished.

222
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:05,889
Sasori, it was you?

223
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,558
-Yeah.

224
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,695
And what if it was?

225
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:11,066
I'm not afraid of a
retired old woman.

226
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,740
You've got one foot in the
grave and you want revenge.

227
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,611
You can't even touch me.

228
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,013
-Retired?

229
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,951
One foot in the grave?

230
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,254
Maybe.

231
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,792
But if I hadn't hauled this
old body here to face you,

232
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:26,831
I would have died with
far too many regrets.

233
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,768
My own grandson.

234
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:32,209
It's bad enough you got yourself
mixed up with evil people,

235
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:35,015
but to think you could
betray your own village

236
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:38,255
and meddle with the
Kazekage for the third time!

237
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,257
-Third time?

238
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,405
-Orochimaru may have
been the one who

239
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,945
killed Gaara's father,
the Fourth Kazekage,

240
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:53,719
but Sasori was complicit
from the beginning.

241
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:58,896
And now he's taken Gaara
and the Third Kazekage too.

242
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,133
-Wait a minute.

243
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,706
I wasn't involved with the
death of the Fourth Kazekage.

244
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:06,645
That was all the doing
of one of my agents.

245
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,516
-If that's the
case, it's the same

246
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,888
as if you did it
with your own hands!

247
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,392
Do you claim you
weren't involved at all?

248
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:17,501
-It's true Orochimaru and the
Akatsuki have some history.

249
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,472
We've done some work together.

250
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:32,498
-So you were.

251
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,669
If you worked with
Orochimaru, then

252
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:38,410
you know all him and the
things that he's done.

253
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:45,892
Which means you have all
the answers I'm looking for.

254
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:46,393
-Hmph.

-I'd love to stay and
chat, but unfortunately

257
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:58,718
I really must eliminate
the two of you,

258
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:02,426
and then go capture
that jinchuriki.

259
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,064
I do hate to keep
people waiting.

260
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,171
Sadly, there's no time to
answer your little quiz.

261
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:12,913
Well then, shall we begin?

Here he comes.

-Slick move, old lady.

267
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,154
But how are you going
to block this one?

268
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,067
-No!

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
That was close.

SASORI (VOICEOVER): With the
old lady controlling the action

Quick.

Hold your breath, Sakura!

-Poison.

SASORI (VOICEOVER):
Control her all you want.

It won't save her from the gas.

village's top ninja.

323
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:15,827
Outside the Uchiha Clan,
he's one of the few

324
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,730
who possesses Sharingan,
and because he

325
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,600
can duplicate enemy
jutsu, he's sometimes

326
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,504
called Mr. Monkey-see Monkey-do.

327
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:22,340
-No.

328
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:23,676
I think you mean the Copy Ninja.

329
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,047
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): As such,
Kakashi-sensei's only original

330
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:29,096
and most powerful jutsu is the
secret 1000 Years of Death.

331
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:30,097
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): No.

332
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,231
That's totally wrong.

333
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,799
It's called Lightning Blade.

334
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,402
Tenten, is it just me or was
my intro the worst one ever?

335
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:35,902
-Oh.

336
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,570
Come on.

337
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:37,738
Don't be ridiculous.

338
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:39,242
[giggling]
