[laughing]

2
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:28,449
Dry land! It's been so
long!

3
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:34,662
{\an4}At last, we're here! Tell
me, does this mean that
we've finally made landfall
on the new continent?!

4
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:39,272
New continent? Are you
saying that we've arrived
at the Land of Lightning?

5
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:44,249
No, Not quite yet. We're
just stopping here to
restock our supplies.

6
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:47,724
{\an1}Our ocean voyage is
really only beginning,
Guy.

7
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,326
[freaking out]

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,103
{\an4}You mean I have to endure
more time on the high
seas!? I'll never make
it!

9
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:54,939
Huh?

10
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,981
{\an4}After we leave this port,
we're not going to be
able to dock anywhere
for a while.

11
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,852
Oh... I see...

12
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:06,429
{\an4}We'll sail for two weeks.
Beause that's how long it
takes to navigate the Sea
Route of Silence.

13
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,835
{\an1}The Sea Route of Silence?

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,681
{\an5}Yes. The Sea Route of
Silence is a very unusual
region in the middle of
the ocean.

15
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:17,854
{\an1}In that area, there's no
wind or sealife at all.

16
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:22,363
{\an1}There's an odd magnetic
field. So even steamships
don't work there.

17
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,437
{\an1}But, then how is our ship
supposed to move?!

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,448
{\an4}There's a narrow strip,
only as wide as a canal,
where a small current
continuously flows.

19
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,520
{\an1}The boat will be carried
safely along that current.

20
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:37,428
{\an1}But once we're on it, we
won't be able to speed up
or to turn around.

21
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:38,798
Hmmm...

22
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,039
{\an1}So it's kinda like riding
on a horse that you can't
control?

23
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:44,778
{\an1}But there are good things
about it, too.

24
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:48,452
{\an1}Every single ship that
enters that route will be
in the same situation.

25
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:51,458
{\an1}So pirates or other
enemy ships can't
attack us.

26
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,229
{\an1}Okay, I get it...

27
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:56,804
Anyway, we need to get
two-weeks worth of
provisions.

28
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:00,444
We can't afford to run
out while we're on the
Sea Route of Silence.

29
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:02,850
Aoba, can you
get these supplies?

30
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:06,457
Naruto, I need you to
get Guy Sensei's share.

31
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,831
{\an1}Why are all of you guys
spinning around?

32
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,771
Well, I guess if I have
to...

33
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:28,939
{\an7}Okay! Well, that's everything
on the list. Now, I just
need to get back to the
ship and we can set sail!

34
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,847
Whoa! Hey, what's the
matter, there, boy?

35
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:35,787
[grunting]

36
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,771
{\an1}I'm sorry about that,
mister. Are you okay?

37
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,406
I think so...

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,912
Hey, you're a Hidden
Leaf Ninja, aren't you?

39
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:50,684
{\an1}Huh? Oh... Yeah...

40
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:56,097
{\an4}Is it true the Five Great
Nations are now allies
and are preparing to go
to war?

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,434
{\an1}Is that the rumor that's
going around?

42
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:03,579
{\an5}Sure is. Small nations
like ours have little
choice but to do what
the Great Nations say.

43
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,786
But seeing that you've
stopped here to get
provisions...

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,527
{\an8}I suppose you're going
through the Sea Route of
Silence to the Land of
Lightning?

45
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,999
{\an1}Yeah, that's the plan,
all right.

46
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,271
{\an1}I can't tell you much
more than that.

47
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:19,479
{\an4}I wish I could buy some
vegetables from you to
make up for what
happened, but I already

48
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,985
{\an1}got everything that we're
going to need.

49
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:22,854
{\an3}Then--

50
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,458
{\an1}How about buying one of
these?

51
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,330
{\an1}Oh, um, What's that?

52
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:30,369
{\an1}This is a mushroom that's
known as a Moldshroom.

53
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,307
{\an1}A Moldshroom, huh...?

54
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:37,886
{\an4}They're really quite
delicious! And they
reproduce quickly. In
case of an emergency...

55
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,495
{\an7}You can just grow some
more, so you won't have
to worry about running
out of food.

56
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:47,373
{\an7}<i>Those who sail the Sea</i>
<i>Route of Silence often</i>
<i>buy one to keep as a last</i>
<i>resort. </i>

57
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,382
{\an1}Huh-- That does sound like
a good thing to have!

58
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:54,254
{\an1}All right! Sounds good to
me; I'll take it!

59
00:03:58,396 --> 00:03:59,431
{\an1}'Bye!

60
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,637
{\an1}'Bye! Thank you!

61
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:53,240
{\an1}"Eat or Die! Mushrooms
from Hell!"

62
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:59,019
No, I don't want to go!
I won't get back on
board!

63
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,659
This is the Hidden Cloud
Village! Right?!

64
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,996
{\an1}<i>You guys are mistaken! </i>

65
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,241
{\an4}Please, Guy! Be
reasonable. Don't act
like a spoiled child, all
right?

66
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,245
Uh!

67
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:13,750
[grunting]

68
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,223
{\an3}Guy!

69
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,695
{\an7}Naruto, why did you do
that?!

70
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:22,769
{\an5}'Cause I don't have the
time or patience to deal
with Bushier Brow sensei
freaking out.

71
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:24,907
{\an7}Well, none of us
do, but still--

72
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,246
{\an1}C'mon! It's time to set
sail!

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,751
All right, Guy.
Let's go.

74
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:40,173
[seagulls cawing]

75
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:47,822
[seagulls cawing]

76
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,297
[grunting]

77
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,398
{\an1}Have a safe trip, now!

78
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,269
{\an1}It would appear we
finally entered the Sea
Route of Silence.

79
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,473
{\an1}I can barely see anything
at all here...

80
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:04,018
{\an7}And all this humidity.
Just thinking about
sailing through this
for two weeks...

81
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,457
{\an1}It makes you feel so
gloomy...

82
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:10,966
{\an1}That may be, but this is the
safest place on the ocean
for us right now.

83
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:14,975
Listen, Naruto... you
should use this time to
rest up.

84
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,947
{\an1}Yeah, you're right...

85
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,188
{\an1}What's the matter Captain
Yamato?

86
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,895
It's nothing,
I'm fine!

87
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,657
Yamato!

88
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,661
{\an1}Yamato! Wake up!

89
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:43,335
He just doubled over in
pain. And then he
collapsed.

90
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,741
All we can do for now is
let him rest.

91
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:48,013
{\an1}Did something happen?

92
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:51,419
{\an1}Bushier Brow Sensei! You
aren't feeling seasick?!

93
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:55,528
{\an4}The swaying subsided once
we entered the Sea Route
of Silence, and because
of that,

94
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:58,133
my seasickness
finally faded away!

95
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:03,244
{\an7}Oh, that's good. But just
when you're feeling
better, Captain Yamato's
feeling worse...

96
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,884
{\an1}Huh? What's going on with
Yamato?

97
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,556
We aren't certain just
yet. That said...

98
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,799
{\an5}It appears to me that
something unknown has been
eating away at Yamato's
chakra.

99
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,103
{\an1}Eating away at his
chakra...?!

100
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,307
We can't explain why
it's happening.

101
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,847
But is he going to be
okay...?

102
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,583
{\an1}We've got a problem!

103
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:22,585
What's wrong?!

104
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,422
Come with me. I'll show
you.

105
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,009
{\an1}What are all those?!

106
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:35,914
{\an1}<i>Mushrooms?! </i>

107
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:39,088
Did some kind of spore
get mixed in with our
food?!

108
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:43,831
{\an1}I did buy a mushroom that
this guy called a Moldshroom,
but only one of them.

109
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,539
And it didn't have a
poisonous-looking color
like all of these do.

110
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:50,846
{\an1}This is the ship's entire
food supply, right here.

111
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,184
You mean all our food is
destroyed?!

112
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:57,325
{\an5}Then these mushrooms are
the only things that we
have left to eat
onboard?!

113
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,466
{\an1}<i>But check out their</i>
<i>coloring. Don't you think</i>
<i>they're poisonous?!</i>

114
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,548
It's not just the food.

115
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:09,619
{\an1}Our water supply
is gone, too.

116
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:14,196
{\an7}No way! But we can't keep
going without food or
water! We're gonna have
to turn this ship around

117
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,298
{\an8}right now!

118
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,071
{\an1}We can't. Once we're on
the Sea Route of
Silence...

119
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,175
{\an7}...turning back is
impossible.

120
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,848
{\an1}But we just started
sailing on the Sea
Route...

121
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,454
Are you saying that we
can't change course for
another two weeks?!

122
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:31,767
{\an8}Then it seems that we
have no choice. We'll
simply have to do without
food or water until then.

123
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,704
{\an1}Are you kidding...?!

124
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,664
{\an1}<i>Even if there's no</i>
<i>food... </i>

125
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,403
{\an1}<i>There's gotta be at least</i>
<i>one fish. </i>

126
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,563
{\an1}All right, maybe a
bird...?

127
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:08,979
{\an1}There's nothing!

128
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,869
{\an1}<i>Once, at the peak of my</i>
<i>hot-blooded youth...</i>

129
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,774
{\an1}<i>I trained by fasting. </i>

130
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:27,785
{\an1}A person burns sixteen
hundred calories every
day.

131
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:33,298
{\an4}When it's robbed of
nourishment, the human
body converts its own
muscle into protein and

132
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,736
{\an1}turns its fat to energy.

133
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,575
{\an1}<i>And that keeps you from</i>
<i>starving... </i>

134
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:42,817
{\an1}I can't believe
this... I don't wanna
go out this way.

135
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,093
But all that's true only
if you can keep yourself
hydrated.

136
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,899
And right now, we can't
do that.

137
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:55,744
{\an4}In a situation like this,
even the most determined
adult will die in one to
two weeks.

138
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,450
{\an1}Wait, what day is this?!

139
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:02,326
I don't know. A whole
week might have passed
already.

long, my stomach can't
even tell the time!
What'll we do?!

141
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:11,144
{\an1}If this continues, then
all of us are going to
starve.

142
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:14,318
{\an1}Perhaps it's time for our
last gamble.

{\an1}Our last gamble?

last gamble?

{\an1}It's our only option now.

{\an1}If these are edible...

149
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:33,258
They sure look really
poisonous to me.

150
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,866
{\an1}But these mushrooms could
be delicious for all we
know...

151

And if we don't eat
something really soon,
then we're gonna die!

rapidly.

{\an1}<i>Just eat, already! </i>

283
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,988
{\an7}<i>Can't I have something</i>

284
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,291
{\an1}<i>What are they doing? </i>

285
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,796
{\an1}<i>Seems like Naruto and his</i>

286
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,171
{\an1}<i>This is just great!</i>

290
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:19,768
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: Revenge of the</i>
<i>Shadow Clones. </i>

291
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:22,540
{\an1}<i>It's one hassle after</i>
