1
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,185
Another one!

2
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:14,830
We have reports from all
regiments! Our comrades
are falling victim to
multiple surprise attacks!

3
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:17,669
It's chaos! We don't
know who the enemy is!

4
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:23,213
What could be going
on?! It's doubtful
that they'd launch a
night raid. Sensory

5
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:26,286
ninja watch each
camp, and we've
increased patrols.

6
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,256
So why can't we
detect the enemy?!

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,964
Is is some kind of
poison? What's the
condition of the
corpses?!

8
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:37,107
All of them received
external wounds! So,
they're physical
attacks.

9
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:42,484
Someone from the outside
must be using some sort
of control genjutsu on
them.

10
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:43,554
(gasp)

11
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:45,357
Itachi...

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,232
Wait, hold on!
There's word from
the Medical Corps!

13
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:52,071
It seems that the
enemy is...

14
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:56,981
White Zetsu has been
impersonating various
Allied Forces Shinobi.
He's able to mirror

15
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,551
our chakra imprints!

16
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,189
That explains it...

17
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>If one of our shinobi</i>
<i>had his chakra absorbed</i>
<i>during the daytime</i>
<i>battle...</i>

18
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:07,401
White Zetsu can fully
transform into him!

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:13,113
Well, Shikaku? What
should we do? There's
no way that we can tell
friend from foe, now.

20
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:17,656
How do we prepare to
fight when dawn comes?
If we don't discover
a way to tell the

21
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:22,364
difference fast, we
will lose time, plus
all our men will be
endangered! In the

22
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:26,072
end they could wind
up killing each
other by mistake!

23
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:30,548
So this was White
Zetsu's ability
all along, huh?
The battle during

24
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:34,422
the daytime was to
set up these secret
nighttime assaults.

25
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:37,227
<i>That was the</i>
<i>enemy's true</i>
<i>motive.</i>

26
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,864
(frustrated groan)

27
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:41,008
There's no sign
of the enemy.

28
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:44,315
Good. But make
sure to stay
alert.

29
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:48,490
Yes, sir. I have
lookouts posted
everywhere.

30
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,311
Huh?

31
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:01,249
Halt! Who goes there?!

32
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,552
I'm an ally.

33
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:07,227
I'm Kurotsuchi, of
the Stone, Second
Company. And I've
come to speak to

34
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,531
your prisoner.

35
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:16,045
I'm here to
relieve you.

36
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:17,816
Great, thanks.

37
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,324
Try to get some rest,
all right? Don't worry
he'll keep watch.

38
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,397
You got it.

39
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,131
It's tasteless to
exhibit one's ultimate
are over and over, but
if I must! Fine! Hmph!

40
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,267
(painful grunt)

41
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,970
<i>Lightning Style?!</i>

42
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:06,345
And I was being careful
since I'm susceptible
to Lightning Style!

43
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,653
<i>Deidara...</i>
<i>Deidara!</i>

44
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,291
Stop calling my
name! It's obnoxious!

45
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,495
It's me, Zetsu.

46
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,567
Zetsu?!
Seriously?!

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,377
You were always a fun
guy. So I'm going to
help get you out of here
in remembrance of that.

48
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,749
Yes! Excellent!
Hurry!

49
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,885
Hurry...

50
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,389
<i>Hold on a</i>
<i>second...</i>

51
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,429
(startled gasp)

52
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,068
<i>He's inside</i>
<i>that? Really?</i>

53
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,374
What's this?

54
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,880
Big brother Deidara,
you alive in there?

55
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:46,225
Of course not. I'm dead.
Wait, Kurotsuchi? You
here to rescue me for
old times' sake?

56
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,168
Well, I probably was
sent because we used to
be friends, but no, I'm
not here to help you.

57
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,239
I need your help.

58
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,945
Huh?! What do
you mean?

59
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,651
She's questioning
Deidara...

60
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,755
Where is Kabuto
Yakushi?

61
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,928
I don't know! I
wouldn't tell you
if I did!

62
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:08,236
Ugh, look, bro.
Kabuto brought you
back to life and
is using you for

63
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:13,112
his own ends! You're
dead, so the least
you can do is forget
the past and cooperate

64
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:15,918
with us a little.
Come on!

65
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:20,962
Kabuto gave me
an opportunity
to acquire a Super
Ultimate Art!

66
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,270
Then where is
Sasuke Uchiha?

67
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:29,512
Sasuke?! Why, was he
reanimated as well?

68
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,984
What? No, Sasuke
isn't dead!

69
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,259
Don't be ridiculous!
I know! I killed him
myself with my
Ultimate Art!

70
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:40,735
But I saw him after
you died! Sasuke was
alive and well, and
fighting against the

71
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,906
Raikage and a bunch
of other guys.

72
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,996
Wow! Amazing!

73
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,471
He joined the Akatsuki
and is now an enemy
of the Allied Shinobi
Forces.

74
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,576
What?! He's with
the Akatsuki now?!

75
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,477
Right?

76
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,649
Huh? Uh, yeah,
I guess.

77
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:10,895
What's up with that?
Sasuke's alive? And
joined the Akatsuki?
You've gotta be kidding.

78
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:16,005
In death, I shall
become art itself!
No one's seen an
explosion like this!

79
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:21,617
One that shall leave
behind a scar on the
very earth itself!
And then! I'll receive

80
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,423
more admiration for
my art than anyone
has ever seen before!

81
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,096
Tremble! Be afraid!

82
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,070
Recoil in despair!
Cower in awe!

83
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,076
And cry your
heart out!

84
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,915
Because my art...

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,888
(powerful grunt)

86
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:45,731
Is an explosion!

87
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,004
There's no way
he's still alive.

88
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,741
<i>I'm telling you, he is!</i>

89
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,945
But I used my
Ultimate Art!

90
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,651
<i>Listen, nobody</i>
<i>cares about art!</i>

91
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,659
That damn bastard!
What's the deal
with that guy?!

92
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,431
Was he not in awe?!
Trembling in fear?

93
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:07,407
Didn't he feel
despair?! Didn't
he scream out, what
the hell is this?!

94
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:11,449
Earth Style's
vulnerable to
lightning. I knew
that if I used it,

95
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:14,723
then the lightning
blade would defuse
your bombs.

96
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:17,160
It's their Achilles'
heel, isn't it?

97
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:20,066
You know what,
Sasuke?! Screw you!

98
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,741
Just watch! Your
Lightning Style won't
hold me down forever!

99
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,253
Commander Mifune!
Message from HQ!

100
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:34,863
A disguised enemy's
infiltrated our men
and is taking them
down, as well!

101
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:37,869
Chaos is spreading
within all the
companies!

102
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,708
Is this company in
any danger, sir?

103
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,246
No, not at the
moment, we're not.

104
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,283
Right! I'll send
your reply.

105
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,759
<i>Sir, what about the</i>
<i>Hidden Stone Kunoichi</i>
<i>who showed up earlier?</i>

106
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,532
I don't think she's
an enemy...

107
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,673
Big brother? Hey,
are you listening?
Answer me!

108
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,445
Argh! This is
going nowhere!

109
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,983
Open it up. I
want to face him.

110
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,123
Should we open it?

111
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,829
Hey...

112
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:08,997
Sir?

113
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,066
Mountain...

114
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,003
Huh?

115
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,907
Mountain...

116
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,481
Uh...Distant skies?

117
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,550
(painful grunt)

118
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,288
It's River.

119
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,092
Damn samurai...

120
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,167
You're so
predictable!

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,802
Bastards!

122
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:28,904
It's Zetsu!

123
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:29,773
What?!

124
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:32,010
Careful! They'll
absorb you're
chakra!

125
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:46,272
That is true art!
It's an explosion!

126
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:47,942
Nice one, Deidara!

127
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:52,150
But how?! Why didn't
Lightning Style seal
his Explosion Style?!

128
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,087
(chuckle)

129
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,693
He used that
sword to ground
the lightning.

130
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,732
What was it doing
inside that puppet?!

131
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,670
It was thanks
to me!

132
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,272
Zetsu...

133
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:04,609
What?

134
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,212
Let's go!

135
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,182
Hey! Wait!

136
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,118
Stop them!

137
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,019
Man...

138
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:12,725
Deidara's such a pain
even when he's dead!

139
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:17,902
The prisoner Deidara
has escaped with his
comrade, Zetsu!
Apprehend them, now!

140
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,238
<i>Okisuke!</i>

141
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:22,845
Sir! I take full
responsibility for
this blunder!

142
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,918
This isn't the time for
blame! Just get them!

143
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,387
Yes, sir!

144
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,694
Why are we running
away? I say we just
kill of them.

145
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:33,567
I can't! I'm all out
of Detonating Clay.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,170
I need to find more.

147
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,875
Oh! They're coming!

148
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:45,958
Outta my way!

149
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,768
In front, too!

150
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:52,905
Damn it!

151
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,249
You're still just
as weak as ever,
aren't you?

152
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,656
That was merely a
tactic to buy us
some time.

153
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,328
So, you escaped
the seal.

154
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,498
Kabuto!

155
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,606
As expected. I'll
bring you back.

156
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,782
<i>Wait! My Ultimate</i>
<i>Art was completely</i>
<i>rejected! I can't</i>
<i>die like this...</i>

157
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:18,422
<i>...e-even if I am</i>
<i>already dead. Hmph.</i>

158
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,861
You intend to stay
there and fight?

159
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:24,669
<i>I'm going to perfect</i>
<i>my Super Ultimate Art.</i>

160
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:29,779
I simply don't
understand how you
artist think. But
intellectuals do

161
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,417
have to protect
artists, I suppose.

162
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:34,421
(gasp)

163
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:35,958
That's...

164
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:39,364
You escape. I will
hold them off.

165
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,335
They're all
yours, Chukichi!

166
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:46,178
Now, then. Hidden
Frost Jutsu.

167
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,328
What the hell
is this?!

168
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:56,131
Where's he hiding?

169
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,973
(attack yell)

170
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,951
So many...

171
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,230
He's gone.

172
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,234
Curses!

173
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,478
Commander Mifune!
I sense them! They
went that way!

174
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:21,215
Let's go!

175
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,758
How much farther are
we going to run?

176
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:30,801
I need clay! Hm...
So I need to find a
place with clay in
the soil.

177
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,974
Just leave it to
me, I'll find some.

178
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:42,525
You may fight as you
see fit, Deidara.
Freedom suits you
quite well. Besides,

179
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:46,231
I'm going to be
busy myself.

180
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,739
Unless we catch Deidara
before he finds some
detonating clay...

181
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:51,475
...this could get
troublesome.

182
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:55,818
Omoi contained the
explosion with his
Lightning Style
earlier. But he's

183
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,922
in a different
company now.

184
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:00,728
Anyone in this
unit us Lightning?

185
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:05,537
The Fifth Company has
been split in two. The
weapons in this half
are mainly samurai

186
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:10,914
swords, and our only
ninja are sensory,
sealing, and intel
support personnel.

187
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,488
Captain Mifune, I
can wield Lightning
Style, sir.

188
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,191
Good...

189
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,013
(shocked gasp)

190
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,921
They're getting close,
Deidara! There's lots!

191
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:35,129
Agh! I've only managed
to get this much
Detonating Clay!

192
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:36,265
Scatter!

193
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,110
Lightning Style!

194
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,387
What now?!

195
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,089
Did he?!

196
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:49,324
Down there!

197
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:50,259
Land mines!

198
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:51,228
Jump!

199
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,430
Hgh!

200
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,340
You can't stop us!

201
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,127
Take this!

202
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,137
Ahhh!

203
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,513
Nope, that's
not enough!

204
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:24,027
This is what
true art is!

205
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,603
Big Brother's
gonna explode!

206
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:33,079
You need to keep on
discharging it. We
need a stronger level
of Lightning Style!

207
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,283
This is the best
that I can do!

208
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,026
Lord Mifune!

209
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,301
(attacking grunt)

210
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,903
Hey, welcome back.

211
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,309
What's happening?!

212
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:09,284
<i>A reanimated body is</i>
<i>immortal, remember?</i>
<i>In a way, you're like</i>

213
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,790
the walking
Detonating
clay bomb.

214
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:17,100
I thought so.
So crass!
How depressing.

215
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:19,539
Why?

216
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:24,816
Art is a single
moment of brilliance!
A scattering of
blossoms! But this

217
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,086
body can't scatter
anymore...

218
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:33,567
I'll find a Super
Ultimate art that
will transcend my
Ultimate Art.

219
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:43,119
Damn you, big
brother. Not cool.

220
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,331
Lord Mifune?!
Where are you?

221
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:53,272
Lord Mifune!

222
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:58,750
The holes left by
his land mines became
trenches in which to
hide.

223
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:02,591
Guess he wasn't very
thorough with his
Detonating Clay,
was he?

224
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,862
We're gonna
need a plan.

225
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:08,804
Insulation would keep
him from channeling
away the lightning.

226
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,808
Our Lightning Style
wielder's too weak.

227
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:12,945
I'm sorry. I
tried my best.

228
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,349
Focus on sensing
their whereabouts.

229
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,055
Shall I request
reinforcements?

230
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,694
No, we don't have
time to wait for
them.

231
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,340
We'll do it with
the personnel
we have.

232
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,403
What am I
going to do?

233
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:46,746
This immortal body is
incompatible with my
aesthetic.

234
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,190
Sasori might have been
able to come up with
something, but he
left too quickly. Hmph.

235
00:16:54,227 --> 00:17:01,041
I'm all alone. But
then, artists are
loners to begin with.

236
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:06,084
I buried all the
land mines. Well?
Any ideas yet?

237
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:10,092
True art doesn't
come to one that
easily. Especially

238
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,598
not a Super
Ultimate Art.

239
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,109
Sasuke?!

240
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,180
What?! Why
are you...

241
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:47,100
It's you two, huh?

242
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,972
Bastard! How
are you alive?!

243
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:51,876
Tell me where
Naruto is.

244
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,118
I don't know! But
you need to pay
attention to me
right now!

245
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,022
My business is
with Naruto.

246
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:03,132
Damn it! Not
that crap again!
First Itachi, then
Naruto? You don't

247
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,202
give a damn
about me, do
you?

248
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,473
No.

249
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,512
Bastard!

250
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,781
They're coming!

251
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:11,849
Good luck.

252
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,018
Stop!

253
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:14,689
Deidara!

254
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,726
Get them!

255
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,466
<i>You won't escape!</i>

256
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,337
Deidara! Wait!

257
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,409
Doesn't Sasuke
seem different?

258
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,713
(painful grunts)

259
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:34,595
This time you'll
tremble with fear!
And awe, too!

260
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,298
<i>You'll feel despair!</i>

261
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:39,505
I'll wipe that smug
expression off your
face!

262
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:47,554
Huh?

263
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,232
Ha ha ha!

264
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,504
I see you!

265
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,177
Right there!
Right up there!
Ha ha ha ha!

266
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,354
Your weakness isn't
Lightning Style, Bro,
it's you ridiculous
obsession with art!

267
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,093
(shocked gasp)

268
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,264
Kurotsuchi?!

269
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,604
Bastards! What
are you up to?!

270
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,378
(attacking grunt)

271
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,885
They were duds?

272
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,427
Damn!

273
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:32,443
Nice sword you got
there. But it cannot
stop my art!

274
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:36,919
(painful grunt)

275
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:39,592
Samurai, don't use
Lightning Style!

276
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:44,835
It's not Lightning
Style. It's a storage
cell. Seems to come
in quite handy!

277
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,910
Too bad it
doesn't work!

278
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:51,749
What?!

279
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:54,922
What you're standing
on is all bedrock,
big brother.

280
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:59,832
The sword can't
pierce it. And it
won't discharge the
Lightning Style.

281
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,348
Not again!

282
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,396
There.

283
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:24,047
One other thing.
Where's the real
Sasuke right now,
Big Bro?

284
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,823
<i>Damn it, Kurotsuchi!</i>
<i>Treating me like a</i>
<i>fool, pretending to</i>
<i>be Sasuke! You didn't</i>

285
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,196
<i>even look like him</i>
<i>by the way! Get</i>
<i>out of here!</i>

286
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,306
Oh, well! I suppose
it's no use trying to
get any information out
of Big Brother now.

287
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,678
He's too busy
pouting.

288
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:45,122
We'll head back. And
maintain our front
line. Go inform
Headquarters.

289
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:49,030
Commander, Uh, could
I have that back now?

290
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,836
Huh? Oh!

291
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,144
Here's hoping you
don't come back to
bother us again, Big
Brother Deidara!

292
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,948
See ya!

293
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:10,005
That just might work.
It'll be the theme
of my Super Ultimate
Art!

294
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,746
I think it really
could use a face
on it, though...

295
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:22,296
Art will never die!
Even if I already
have!

296
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:03,833
While the shinobi are
all away fighting in
the Fourth Great Ninja
War, we need to be

297
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:07,641
prepared to protect
the village! The
enemy could come
for us as well!

298
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:12,183
<i>We've had incidents</i>
<i>like that before. And</i>
<i>every time we just</i>
<i>beat the stuffing out</i>

299
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,586
<i>of them and chased</i>
<i>them out!</i>

300
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,126
Do not underestimate
the mothers of the
Hidden Leaf Village!

301
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,738
<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Allied</i>
<i>Mom Force!</i>

302
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:26,077
Protecting the
village is a huge
responsibility, too!
