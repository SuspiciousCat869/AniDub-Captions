{\an1}I am Hagoromo Otsutsuki.

00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,990

of the Six Paths.

other comrades, as well.

100
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:19,143
{\an1}And also, there was a former
friend, who lent me a lot of
strength when I needed it.

101

{\an1}That's why I said you did a good
job in guiding everyone.

102

you were Obito's friend as well.

from me like that? I sure did
miss you!

106

{\an1}Quit yelling so loudly! I wasn't

Obito to tell me that tale in

00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:44,578
{\an1}Yeah.

121
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:50,618
{\an1}Kakashi, I really made a mess of
the Shinobi world.

122
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:55,825
{\an1}So much so that I don't even
know what to say to you in
parting.

123
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:08,941
{\an1}Well, at least we get to say
goodbye as friends, not enemies.

124
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:13,813

one who was always late 'cause
of helping others.

125
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,683

for me.

{\an1}Well, all right, then. Guess
I'll be going now.

{\an1}Did you prepare a good excuse to
give her for being so late?

131
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:52,592
{\an1}Don't worry I already told her,
I'd be helping you.

00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:16,859
Yes.

148
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:32,811
{\an1}I guess that neither you nor I
were able to achieve what we
wanted.

149
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:39,887
{\an1}It's never that easy. Our job is
merely to do all that we can do
while we're alive.

150
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:46,828
{\an1}And then bequeath the rest of it
for future generations to
accomplish.

151
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:49,532
You're so naive.

152
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,104
{\an1}Just as you usually are.
[chuckles]

153
00:14:54,605 --> 00:15:00,679
{\an1}And you have always been the
optimist.

154
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:10,157
{\an1}Although perhaps that is the
proper way to be.

155
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:17,566
{\an1}The dream that I had has been
squashed.

156
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:25,442
{\an1}But your dream is still relevant
now, and it continues to live
on.

157
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:32,116
{\an1}We were both too hasty. We
didn't need to reach our dreams
ourselves.

158
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,388
{\an1}It was far more important to
cultivate those who would come
after us...

159
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:38,357
{\an1}to whom we could entrust our
dreams.

160
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:42,762
{\an1}Which means I would have failed,
anyway.

161
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:50,871
{\an1}After all, I have always hated
having somebody standing behind
me.

162
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,847
{\an1}When we were just kids,
you once said to me...

163
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,019
{\an1}"We are shinobi after all, we
never know when we might die."

164
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:06,658
{\an1}And you also told me that for
neither side to die, both of
them would have to reveal,,,

165
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:09,762
{\an1}what's inside of themselves,
hiding nothing at all...

166
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,398
{\an1}and to drink together, as if
they were brothers.

167
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,603
{\an1}But the both of us are about to
die.

168
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:21,908
{\an1}So right now, we have a chance
to drink together as old war
buddies.

169
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:30,085
{\an1}As war buddies...huh.

170
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:46,204
{\an1}Well then...I suppose
that...would be...okay...by...

171
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,459
{\an1}Now is the moment.

172
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:08,964
{\an1}I'll release the jutsu, freeing
the Five Kage and the Reanimated
shinobi.

173
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,334
[gasping]

174
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,076
Well, go on.

175
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,682
[sighs]

176
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,858
Dad, I...

177
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,964
{\an1}Oh, that's right. There's
something that I've been meaning
to tell you.

178
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:37,733
Huh?

179
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:02,796
Happy birthday, Naruto.

180
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:08,302
{\an1}You've really become a splendid
young man, you know that?

181
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:14,844
Yeah, thank you.

182
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:22,118
{\an1}We're an existence outside of
the rules. So we can't just
remain in this world forever.

183
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,955
{\an1}This is good-bye.

184
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:40,340
{\an1}I promise you that I'll tell
Kushina everything.

185
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:57,994
{\an1}Tell her not to worry! I'm
eating properly! Lots of
different stuff! I'm not picky!

186
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:04,369
{\an1}Like I'll have tonkotsu ramen,
miso ramen, and sometimes I'll
even have shoyu ramen too!

187
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:07,907
{\an1}Oh, but I don't only eat ramen
though, I swear!

188
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,212
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Uh, I bathe almost</i>
<i>every day even going to the Leaf</i>
<i>Hot Springs once in a while.</i>

189
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:18,620
{\an1}<i>Although everyone tells me that</i>
<i>my baths are only lightening</i>
<i>quick dips! [chuckles]</i>

190
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,755
{\an1}Let's see, what else, what
else...

191
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:25,694
{\an1}I've managed to make a whole lot
of friends! And they're all
really good guys! And...

192
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:30,534
{\an1}Well uh, I was pretty awful at
school, to tell you the truth.

193
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,637
{\an1}But I never got depressed about
it!

194
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,273
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) I had more confidence</i>
<i>than anyone else!</i>

195
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:40,279
{\an1}<i>And of course I always obeyed</i>
<i>Lord Third and Kakashi Sensei,</i>
<i>too!</i>

196
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,782
{\an1}<i>I mean, I totally respect them</i>
<i>both.</i>

197
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,218
{\an1}<i>They're right here, so you</i>
<i>can just ask them yourself!</i>

198
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,923
{\an1}<i>Oh! And those Three Prohibitions</i>
<i>of the Shinobi?</i>

199
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:52,393
{\an1}<i>I learned a whole lot about them</i>
<i>when I was with Pervy Sage!</i>

200
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,863
{\an1}<i>He was hopeless when it came to</i>
<i>them, though!</i>

201
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:59,167
{\an1}<i>But he was an awesome</i>
<i>Sannin, and I respect him</i>
<i>the most! I do!</i>

202
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:07,110
{\an1}<i>I just turned seventeen today,</i>
<i>so I don't know much about</i>
<i>alcohol or girls yet...</i>

203
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:13,052
{\an1}I know that Mom said that I
should find someone just like
her, but...

204
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:14,452
{\an1}[chuckles] I don't know.

205
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:17,923
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) That's kind of, um..</i>

206
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,463
{\an1}Anyway! Not everything that Mom
told me about went well.

207
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:26,467
{\an1}But I always tried to do the
very best that I could, you
know!

208
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:31,506
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) I've got dreams, too!</i>
<i>I'm gonna be an even greater</i>
<i>Hokage than you, Dad.</i>

209
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,975
<i>I swear I will!</i>

210
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,813
[crying]

211
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:44,555
{\an1}Tell Mom, when you see her over
there...

212
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:49,461
{\an1}that she doesn't have to worry
about me even a bit! [crying]

213
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:52,698
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) Tell her I'm doing my</i>
<i>best!</i>

214
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:58,772
{\an1}Don't you worry. I'll make sure
that I tell her about
everything.

215
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:05,446
[sobbing]

216
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,186
{\an1}<i>(Hagoromo)  Having battled my</i>
<i>mother Kaguya...</i>

217
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,822
{\an1}<i>is there any change to the</i>
<i>answers you gave me?</i>

218
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:06,557
{\an1}<i>(Naruto) My answer is the same.</i>

219
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,296
{\an1}<i>(Hagoromo) Very well then. Now,</i>
<i>Sasuke, the rest is up to you.</i>

220
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,566
{\an1}<i>(Sasuke) Yeah, all right. But</i>
<i>before that...</i>

221
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,070
{\an1}<i>the current Five Kage inside the</i>
<i>Infinite Tsukuyomi will be...</i>

222
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,009
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>"The Final Valley."</i>

223
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:24,312
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) What did you say,</i>
<i>Sasuke?</i>
