{\an1}Go, clones! We can do
this!

Yeah!

13
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:12,383
We did it!

14
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,286
{\an1}Nice job, guys! I'll
release the jutsu now.

[sighing]

Awesome, we can
rest!

{\an1}<i>Naruto! </i>

18
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:23,293
{\an4}We could lose the mast to
the wind! Can you have
your clones go try to
support it?

19
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,395
{\an1}Sure thing! We'll get on
it right away!

20
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:26,463
Huh?!

21
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:29,666
You're going to
make us do even more
work?!

22
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:33,902
{\an1}We're in a tight
situation here. We need
every available hand now!

23
00:01:34,204 --> 00:01:36,105
{\an1}Now come on, let's get to
work!

24
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:41,275
{\an1}All you "me's"! Give it
your all!

25
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,249
{\an4}This is ridiculous! Even
if we are just clones,
this is asking way too
much of us!

00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,252
[yelling]

27
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:25,615
{\an7}Boy, that doesn't look
too safe. Why don't one
of you guys go on up
there and check it out.

28
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:26,616
{\an7}Hey.

29
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,252
Why the heck don't
you go do it?

30
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:30,386
{\an7}'Cause I'm tired, that's
why!

31
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,121
Yeah, we're all tired!

32
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:35,624
{\an7}But the fatigue hits me
way harder than it does
you guys.

33
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,392
{\an1}I've never heard that
before.

34
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,595
{\an7}Well, I'm the leader, so
I have the heavier
burden.

35
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,496
{\an1}And who made you our
leader?

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,597
{\an1}What?!

37
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,533
This isn't fair!

38
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:50,070
{\an7}You keep us on a bunch of
all-night watches, and
when the storm finally
passes, you refuse to

39
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,373
release the Multi Shadow
Clone Jutsu? What's up
with that?

40
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:59,913
{\an4}Look, if another storm
blows in, we're gonna
need your help again!
I don't have a choice.

41
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,216
{\an1}So are you the one
who's real? Or is
it me?

42
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,718
That's enough! What do
you think we are anyway?

43
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,153
{\an1}You're clones of me!

44
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,789
{\an4}You have to do what I
tell you to do. You
don't have a choice.
Got it?

45
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:12,356
What?!

46
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,691
{\an1}Are you kidding?!

47
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:17,829
{\an1}Drop it. Don't bother
with him... even his
clones don't trust him!

48
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:23,267
{\an5}If you think I'm gonna
take a bunch of clones
seriously, you're out of
your clone mind!

49
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,535
Mm? Huh?

50
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:33,142
[grunting]

51
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,187
Huh?

52
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:47,421
<i>Damn it! </i>

53
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,990
Just who the hell do you
think you are?!

54
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:53,293
Listen up! You owe
everything to us clones!

55
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,862
You even learned Wind
Style thanks to us!

56
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:59,165
{\an1}Are you kidding?! My power
is all my own!

57
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,000
What?! Get real!

58
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,468
{\an1}Huh...

59
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:07,240
{\an1}<i>You clones... You look</i>
<i>different than just a</i>
<i>moment ago... </i>

60
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:09,107
<i>Heh!</i>

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,811
{\an5}That just goes to show
that you don't really
have what I'd call an
up-close-and-personal

62
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:14,511
relationship with us.

63
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:19,515
{\an4}He means that we may be
your clones, but you're
still real prejudiced
against us.

64
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,587
{\an4}No, that isn't true at
all! Maybe it's just hard
for me to believe that
some of you guys are

65
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:25,855
{\an1}really part of me.

66
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,957
Oh, my, my... attacking
yourself...

67
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:33,462
{\an7}There's just no way
that a softie like you or
a gloomy one like this guy
are actually a part of me!

68
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:36,832
{\an1}Or you just can't accept
the truth of who you
really are...

69
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:41,303
{\an5}If this that personality
weren't inside you, then
you couldn't do the Sexy
Jutsu.

70
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:45,606
And if you want to know
the truth, that jutsu is
just embarrassing.

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,775
I did it 'cause I
wanted attention.

72
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:50,677
Hey, don't cry! All of
that stuff is in the
past!

73
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,247
{\an1}Now, the entire village
makes a big fuss over us,
so be happy!

74
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,916
Stop it!

75
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,387
{\an4}You guys are pissin' me
off! Fine! If you want
me to release the stupid
jutsu, I will!

76
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,891
{\an5}Oh, just give it a rest.
You'll probably keep
working us to the bone. Like
it or not, we're stayin'.

77
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,060
{\an1}I think you need to go
cool down!

78
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,161
{\an1}Release!

79
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,129
Bang!

80
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,665
Now we're
all fading!

81
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:16,934
{\an1}What is-? Why aren't
you guys gone already?!
Release!

82
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,237
Release!

83
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:22,873
Release!!

84
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,642
{\an4}Release! Release!
Release! Release!
Release! Release!
Release!

85
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,577
{\an1}It's not working.

86
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,479
{\an1}Huh?

87
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:34,683
{\an4}Didn't you know? It's up
to us whether we're
summoned or released.
Since we don't have faith

88
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:37,420
{\an1}in you anymore, we're
done listening.

89
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:38,320
{\an1}But you-

90
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:39,254
Get him!

91
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,589
{\an1}Hey! Stop! Let go
of me! Stop it!

92
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:47,294
{\an8}We're not gonna let you
hit us and get rid of us
that easily! Tie him up,
boys!

93
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:48,128
Right!

94
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:48,862
{\an1}Ow!

95
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:49,930
What are you doing,
Naruto?

96
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:52,598
{\an1}<i>Come on, you</i>
<i>worthless clones!</i>
<i>Get off of me!</i>

97
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,368
{\an1}Huh...? Oh!

98
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:59,238
{\an4}This is just great!
Fiery, hot-blooded men
fighting and colliding,
freeing pent-up energy!

99
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,940
{\an1}I guess. But that really
doesn't seem to be the
case, here.

100
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,977
{\an1}Uh... A little help,
here, Captain Yamato!

101
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,380
{\an1}The Naruto Gang... is
taking control of this
ship!

102
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,382
And he's gonna be our
hostage!

103
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:15,753
{\an5}So if you value Naruto's
life, then you'll agree
to our demands
unconditionally!

104
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,422
{\an1}What is going on, here?!

105
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:23,693
{\an5}Hey, you guys, I can see
the shape of an island at
about one o'clock over
there!

106
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,362
Let me see...

107
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:32,067
{\an1}<i>That'll be just perfect</i>
<i>for our plans! </i>

108
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,603
All right! Set sail for
that island now!

109
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,172
What do you think
we should do?

110
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,708
{\an1}I can't believe that the
clones would actually
take Naruto's life...

111
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:44,312
{\an1}But you know... I really
could use some rest on
dry land.

112
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:44,946
{\an3}Huh?!

113
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,780
{\an1}Aye, aye! Straight ahead!

114
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,682
<i>Straight ahead.</i>

115
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:40,115
{\an1}"Revenge of the Shadow
Clones"

116
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:44,685
{\an7}Look,... we clones are
simply seeking improvements
in our work environment.

117
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:49,423
{\an1}We demand full compensation
and fair treatment for
all the risks we take!

118
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:54,294
{\an4}And until these rightful
demands are met, we, the
clone workforce, will
remain on strike!

119
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,330
{\an1}Don't forget that we
really want some better
food to eat, too!

120
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,932
Yeah, get us some ramen,
you idiots!

121
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:03,369
{\an1}Miso-flavored stock with
roast pork!

122
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:07,005
{\an1}Yeah, now you're talking!
Nice one, Real Naruto!

123
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:08,639
[grunting]

124
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:12,910
{\an4}Until we get a
satisfactory resolution
to this situation, you
guys can wait there on

125
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,111
that island!

126
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:17,081
Wow, what an incredibly
disturbing turn of
events...

127
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:22,285
{\an4}If this strike continues to
drag on and our arrival gets
pushed back any further,
then Lady Hokage is gonna

128
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:23,786
{\an1}have all our hides.

129
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,357
{\an1}Oh, yeah! Make sure that
you get a lot of meat in
there!

130
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:34,363
{\an4}Huh? You two, make sure
that you get some of this!
Remember, you can't wage a
war on an empty stomach.

131
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:38,200
{\an1}Look, don't even bother
listening to the demands
of these jokers!

132
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,068
{\an1}Just hurry up and defeat
'em all, would you?!

133
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,539
{\an1}Sorry, no one's
listening. They're just
eating curry.

134
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,440
[groaning]

135
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:50,277
{\an4}Come on, do you really
believe that Captain
Yamato and the others are
going to come to rescue you?

136
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,045
Yes! Of course they'll
come!

137
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,583
{\an8}And in the face of a
jonin's super ninjutsu,
dummies like us, I mean
like you guys--

138
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,785
{\an8}will be wiped out before
my friends can even break
a sweat!

139
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:04,022
{\an7}I wonder what kind of
tactic they'll use.

140
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:11,362
{\an1}Are they making
their move?!

141
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:13,864
{\an1}<i>Look! There! </i>

142
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,677
{\an1}But... Why do you think
he's swimming?

143
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,179
{\an7}Yeah, he's a shinobi. He
could just run across
the surface, right?

144
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:36,017
{\an8}How interesting! Guy
Sensei is a jonin, too.
They must have something
up their sleeves...

145
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,863
{\an1}Hey! Naruto, my boy!

146
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:54,534
{\an1}Stay on your toes, guys. They
could attack us from a
blind spot.

147
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:55,368
<i>Don't you see? </i>

148
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,203
See what?

149
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:02,774
{\an7}What this chiseled body
of mine is tryin' to tell
ya? I have no weapons with
me. And no tricks!

150
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:05,810
You mean you came here
without any strategy at
all?!

151
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:09,247
{\an1}I hope that means you've
decided to agree to all our
demands, then!

152
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,782
Heh! How pretentious!

153
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:12,883
What?

154
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:19,356
{\an4}The music of flesh
hitting flesh. Resonating
through your bones.
That's how we'll

155
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,757
{\an1}understand each other!

156
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,759
{\an1}Come at me and let me
feel your thoughts!

157
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,363
{\an1}Why'd they have to send
this guy to help me out?!

158
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:30,165
Come on! Let's go!

159
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,367
[grunting]

160
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,670
{\an1}Way to go, Bushier Brow
Sensei! Now hurry up and
untie me!

161
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:36,871
Again!

162
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,172
Ahhhh!

163
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:43,010
{\an1}If even one blow hits us,
then we're done for...

164
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,112
Damn!

165
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,148
H'yahhh!

166
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,883
Whoooaaaa!

167
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,854
{\an1}Hold it!

168
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,161
[yelling]

169
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:12,236
Mmm?

170
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,104
Haaaaa!

171
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:15,406
[grunting]

00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:22,378
[groaning]

173
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:25,515
{\an1}Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

174
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:31,119
{\an7}<i>Looking good! That's the</i>
<i>way! </i>

175
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,458
{\an1}Time to get serious!

176
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,192
Uh-oh!

177
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:43,931
[grunting]

178
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,167
{\an1}Ahhhh! Take this!

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,268
Ahhh!

180
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,680
[grunting]

181
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,283
{\an1}That was close! I thought
I was gonna die!

182
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,485
[sighing]

183
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:07,552
Oh, man...

184
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,687
{\an1}<i>So you're safe, huh? </i>

185
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:10,555
Huh?!

186
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,657
Coming back to the ship
was smart.

187
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,960
{\an5}I mean I really can't
fight seriously onboard
this ship without
damaging it.

188
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,695
[chuckling]

189
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,864
{\an8}Do you actually think
that our whole strategy
was simply running away
from you?

190
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,767
[gasping]

191
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,137
{\an8}If we could get you to
unleash a big attack at
sea and then make it back
onto the ship...

192
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,573
{\an1}Then naturally, you'd
have to follow after
us.

193
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:33,843
{\an7}And right around that
time, the waves from your
attack...

194
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,012
[struggling]

195
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,617
{\an1}All this rocking and
swaying! Please! Make it
stop!

196
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,619
{\an1}It's awful! My inner
ear's going nuts!

197
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:49,256
{\an1}Oh, boy... And I just
finished eating all
that delicious curry.

198
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,357
[gagging]

199
00:13:57,563 --> 00:14:01,366
{\an1}The only thing Guy's
attack has done is leave
us at a disadvantage.

200
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,237
{\an1}<i>Does he even know the</i>
<i>purpose of our strategy? </i>

201
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,641
{\an1}<i>Maybe he just wanted to</i>
<i>release the pent-up</i>
<i>stress of being at sea. </i>

202
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,175
{\an1}<i>Oh, great. He's</i>
<i>been caught.</i>

203
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,478
Looks like I've been
caught.

204
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,481
{\an1}The only thing you've
done is given them
another hostage.

205
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:22,752
{\an4}Guy Sensei. Start
talking. Tell us what
Captain Yamato's plan of
attack is going to be.

206
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:26,423
{\an7}Thing is... I only rushed
in to fight you on an
impulse.

207
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,525
{\an7}So I know nothing at all
about that.

208
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,994
{\an1}Then why did you come
here at all?!

209
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,098
Oh!

210
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,801
Wow! That's amazing!

211
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,934
{\an1}Yeah, this fish is huge!

212
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,672
Let's grill it up!
Although I guess fried
would be good, too...

213
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,974
{\an1}Here. We could also make
a stew...

214
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,610
{\an1}Hey, make sure that
you're guarding that
side!

215
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,044
We are!

216
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:53,880
{\an1}Huh?

217
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,281
Eh?

218
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,417
Huh?

219
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:02,755
{\an1}<i>[seagulls squawking]</i>

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,791
What the heck is this?

222
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,995
{\an1}I can't see!

223
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,231
Ahhh!

224
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,201
Huh...?

00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,773

226
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,888
{\an1}Uh, Ninja Art, Animal Suit
Jutsu... Get it?

227
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,923
{\an1}Are you tellin' me
you couldn't come up
with a better strategy?!

228
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,225
Get them!

229
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:50,865
{\an1}Nice, Captain Yamato!

230
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,765
Untie him while we still
can!

231
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,905
{\an4}<i>Damn it. Those gulls</i>
<i>were just a diversion so</i>
<i>Captain Yamato could</i>

232
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,373
<i>Yes! </i>

233
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,576
{\an7}Take that you lousy
clones! I'm free at last!
Ha!

234
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,613
But for some reason it
doesn't really feel like
I'm free...

235
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:13,149
{\an1}That's because the way
things stand now, all of
us are hostages, stupid.

236
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:18,154
{\an4}How dare you call the
real me "stupid"?! You
stupid clones are the
real stupid ones, stupid!

237
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:21,658
{\an1}I guess that stupidity is
all that you have left
inside you.

238
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,292
{\an1}Hey! What did you say?!

239
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,227
Now, hold on, Naruto.

240
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:29,030
{\an1}Why don't you just do it?
Why don't you give in to
their demands?

241
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,567
{\an1}Huh?! What are you
saying, Guy Sensei?

242
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,702
I think I understand
where they're coming
from.

243
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:39,908
{\an4}<i>You get the credit for</i>

<i>without complaint. Isn't</i>

244
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,843
{\an1}<i>it fair to listen to</i>

{\an3}Well?

246
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,749
{\an1}Yeah. We're just asking
for a little understanding,
here.

247
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,116
{\an1}The demands don't matter-

248

{\an1}<i>Stop messing around. </i>

249
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:52,920
{\an1}Huh?

250
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,222
{\an4}Why should I listen to
anything that these
wannabe me's have to
say?!

supposed to obey their
dad, isn't that right?!

everything!

as the real Naruto, and
the chance to have equal
turns as our leader!

255

{\an7}Clones are nothin'
but clones. There's no
way you can be the
real me!

256
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,842
{\an7}You're just copies! Don't
be so arrogant!

257
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:21,277
Naruto! Now, that's
uncalled for.

258
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,613
{\an7}Just whose side are you
on, Guy Sensei?!

259
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:29,585
{\an7}I'm on your side, Naruto!
But take a good look at
them and take a look at
yourself as well!

260
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:30,686
Just look!

261
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:48,134
{\an7}No, I'm not like them!
I'm not a wimp, and I'm
not conceited!

262
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:53,138
{\an7}I don't go around
grinning all the time,

{\an4}Sorry Captain Yamato.
I know that you had a
strategy planned to save
me.

265
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,415
{\an1}But still... I've got to
do this my own way!

266
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,452
{\an1}Is he still gonna rely on
clones?

267
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,121
{\an1}Guess so. He can't use
Rasengan without any
clones, after all.

268
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:16,126
{\an1}Keep talking! I'll summon
a hundred more, and it'll

00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,804
[grunting]

286
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,475
{\an1}[gasping and screaming]

287
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:53,180
{\an1}Hey, relax, there's
really no reason to
get so worked up.

288
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,047
{\an1}Huh?

289
00:19:55,081 --> 00:20:00,518
{\an4}<i>But... Where are your</i>
<i>weapons? Aren't you guys</i>
<i>still on strike and looking</i>
<i>to steal my identity?</i>

290
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:01,954
Huh?

291
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:04,923
What are you talking
about? What kind of
nonsense is that?

292
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:09,393
{\an1}Wait, hold on... I'm
positive that there were
four clones before.

293
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:13,397
{\an5}Oh, that's right.
Earlier, a pulley up
there on the mast came
loose...

294
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,867
...and one of the
clones got wiped out when
he shielded you from it.

295
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,568
{\an1}So he protected me...?

296
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,104
Don't you remember?

297
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:33,448
{\an1}So are you the one
who's real? Or is
it me?

298
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,952
{\an7}We demand the same rights
as the real Naruto!

299
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:41,422
{\an1}I guess... that was
just a clone's dream.

300
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:45,826
{\an1}And when the clone
was released, the details
were left in my mind.

301
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,129
{\an1}And it just turned
everything inside me
upside down.

302
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:54,033
{\an1}Whoa, you're finally
gonna release the
jutsu?

303
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,969
{\an1}Yeah... good work.

304
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,402
Release!

305
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:00,778
{\an1}<i>Lady Tsunade, I know the</i>
<i>war will begin soon. </i>

306
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,249
{\an1}<i>And I know you're planning</i>
<i>to send me to the front</i>
<i>lines as a commander.</i>

307
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:08,552
{\an1}<i>One bad decision from</i>
<i>me... and my comrades</i>
<i>could die. </i>

308
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:15,458
{\an4}<i>Do I really have the</i>
<i>strength to command</i>
<i>everyone... and hold</i>
<i>their lives in my hands? </i>

309
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,894
{\an1}<i>I just have doubts... </i>

310
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:20,663
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Closed</i>
<i>Route. </i>

311
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,499
{\an1}<i>Go. This mission's just</i>
<i>right for you.</i>
