1
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,321
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) Hmm. What a dilemma.</i>

2
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,755
{\an1}What's the matter, Lord
Kakashi?

3
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,391
{\an1}Please, just drop the "lord"
part.

4
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:00,127
{\an1}Remember the mission I gave to
get wedding gifts?

5
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,895
{\an1}Do I really have to assess
every one of them?

6
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,030
{\an1}Of course you do!

7
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:05,563
Oink oink.

8
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,698
Oink oink.

9
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,069
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) The honey wine is a</i>
<i>great gift. It's perfect for a</i>
<i>special occasion like this.</i>

10
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,570
{\an1}<i>(Shizune) You can tell that Team</i>
<i>8 really went all out.</i>

11
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:19,409
{\an1}<i>And this hot springs honeymoon</i>
<i>and the gift certificates for</i>
<i>dinner are very thoughtful, too!</i>

12
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:23,145
{\an1}<i>(Kakashi) I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>this from Choji and Shikamaru.</i>
<i>They outdid themselves.</i>

13
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:26,414
{\an1}<i>(Shizune) You can really see the</i>
<i>girls' tastes reflected in these</i>
<i>choices.</i>

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,649
{\an1}Yes, they're very cute, but
take a look at this.

15
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:30,884
Hmm?

16
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,787
{\an1}[comically horrified]

17
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,021
{\an1}Unbelievable, right?

18
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:41,458
{\an1}Also Konohamaru hasn't turned
in the video he was making
yet.

19
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,895
{\an1}Uh. Well, I guess that it all
worked out!

20
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:48,463
{\an1}Now they can be the ones given
assignments on the day of the
wedding!

21
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:52,467
{\an1}It's true that if I'm supposed
make my selections based on the
gifts...

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,535
{\an1}then these three should
be the candidates.

23
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:57,771
{\an1}But is this really the right
way to do this?

24
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,946
{\an1}<i>(Hinata) Kakashi Sensei?</i>

25
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,148
Hmm?

26
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:17,786
{\an1}Oh, Hinata! It's been awhile,
hasn't it? What's up?

27
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:21,256
{\an1}I'm meeting Sakura and the
girls. It's been so long!

28
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,659
{\an1}Last girls' get-together as a
single woman, huh?

29
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:29,129
{\an1}How are your wedding plans
going, anyway? I take it
Naruto's doing well?

30
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,530
{\an1}Huh? Yes, he's fine.

31
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,467
{\an1}He's doing really well!

32
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,900
{\an1}Where are you headed, Kakashi
Sensei?

33
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,536
{\an1}Oh. I'm hoping to take a quick
nap.

34
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,838
I see.

35
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,406
{\an1}I'm sorry to have bothered
you.

36
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,674
{\an1}If you'll please excuse me.

37
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,209
Oh, yeah sure.

38
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,945
[sighs]

39
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:57,918
[sighs]

40
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,155
{\an1}Hey, what's the matter, Iruka
Sensei? Was the ramen not good?

41
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:07,459
{\an1}Oh, no, no! The ramen was
delicious, as always! It isn't
that.

42
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,194
{\an1}I knew that you'd be here,
Iruka Sensei!

43
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,463
Konohamaru!

44
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,365
{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) No more delays! I</i>
<i>need your congratulatory</i>
<i>message!</i>

45
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:19,402
{\an1}'Cause otherwise, I can't turn
in this video as my wedding
gift!

46
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,735
I'm so sorry!

47
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,439
{\an1}Oh, is that what you've been
agonizing about?

48
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,041
{\an1}It is. I can't think of what
to say.

49
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:30,576
{\an1}Well, you're agonizing about
it too much! Now get ready!
'Cause I'm recording!

50
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,078
{\an1}[gasps] Hey, wait!

51
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:32,879
Ahh!

52
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:35,981
{\an1}[groans] Get it together, Iruka
Sensei!

53
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:44,687
{\an1}I have to agree with Konohamaru.
How can anyone not know what to
say in a congratulatory message?

54
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,923
{\an1}You're Naruto's teacher, well
aren't you?!

55
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,557
{\an1}That's the reason why!

56
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,296
That is?

57
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:59,132
{\an1}Back when Lord Kazekage came
in to Ichiraku...

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,371
{\an1}I'm going to honor Naruto not
as Kazekage, but as a friend.

59
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,574
{\an1}When I heard him say that, I
began to wonder...

60
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:12,743
{\an1}in what role exactly I should be
celebrating Naruto.

61
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,112
{\an1}And what does that mean?

62
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:18,449
{\an1}But how else would you do it?!
You're his teacher!

63
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:24,519
{\an1}I realize that almost everybody
probably thinks of me as being
Naruto's "teacher."

64
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:28,289
{\an1}That's right! So, hurry up and
let me record you, or I can't
finish this video!

65
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,023
<i>(Iruka) But.</i>

66
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:29,957
Hmm?

67
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,993
{\an1}Thing is, I kinda feel like
this shouldn't be coming from
the point of view...

68
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:35,495
{\an1}of a teacher to his student.

69
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,730
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) I don't even know if</i>
<i>it's right to do this as his</i>
<i>teacher or not.</i>

70
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:43,334
{\an1}<i>But I feel that Naruto's a</i>
<i>little different than my other</i>
<i>students.</i>

71
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:47,070
{\an1}<i>And that's why it feels wrong</i>
<i>to do it as instructor. </i>

72
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:51,974
{\an1}But I also don't think it's
really right to call us
friends...

73
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,775
{\an1}in the way Lord Kakashi spoke
of.

74
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:55,710
So you see...

75
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,248
{\an1}the more that I think about it
all, the more unsure I become
about my message for him.

76
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,485
{\an1}Hmm, I think I see what you
mean now.

77
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,086
{\an1}Saying that you and Naruto are
friends doesn't quite feel
right.

78
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:12,557
{\an1}<i>(Teuchi) But anyway, I am gonna</i>
<i>have to charge you for that bowl</i>
<i>you broke.</i>

79
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,791
[groans]

80
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,361
{\an1}And, Is all the prep for the
wedding done?

81
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,331
{\an1}Yes! Well, most of it.

82
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:25,567
{\an1}I have to say, I'm really
surprised that the first ones
out of our entire group...

83
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,536
{\an1}to get married are you and
Naruto!

84
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,370
{\an1}How's Naruto doing, anyway?

85
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,439
{\an1}Is he even helping you at all
with the planning?

86
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:36,543
{\an1}[chuckles] Of course! But
actually, more than Naruto...

87
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:39,044
{\an1}it's my father who keeps
telling me what I should do.

88
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:42,746
{\an1}It's true what they say about
the father of the bride being
a real pain.

89
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,617
{\an1}I guess that planning a
wedding is a huge task, huh?

90
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,419
{\an1}Yeah, of course it is! Even for
us! Like how Kakashi Sensei gave
us...

91
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,821
[loud scream]

92
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,422
Hey! Sakura!

93
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,057
{\an1}What's the deal?! [gasps]

94
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:01,162
{\an7}<i>Even for us, like how Kakashi</i>
<i>Sensei gave us... Damn that was</i>
<i>close</i>

95
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:04,330
[yelling]

96
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,101
Uhh?

97
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,703
{\an1}What was that about Kakashi
Sensei?

98
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:13,504
Uh!

99
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,772
Oh, uh...

100
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:17,441
{\an1}He's just going through a lot.

101
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:20,010
{\an1}Trying to wrap up all the
missions before the wedding,
that's all!

102
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:25,314
{\an1}Yeah! And unlike us, you already
have someone like Naruto, so
you're really lucky.

103
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,814
{\an1}Uh, yeah, that's right!

104
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,385
{\an1}Well, I guess so!

105
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,388
{\an1}So, tell us everything! Are
you gonna wear a kimono for
the ceremony?

106
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,223
{\an1}You're gonna look really
pretty as a bride no matter
what you wear!

107
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,291
{\an1}Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

108
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,926
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Hey, Hinata!</i>

109
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,362
[chuckles]

110
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,530
{\an1}Long time no see, huh?

111
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,533
Kiba! Shino!

112
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,301
{\an1}Are you doing okay?

113
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,636
{\an1}M-hm. You two seem great!

114
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,339
{\an1}Well, we're going to be
celebrating your wedding soon,
so of course we are!

115
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,273
{\an1}The reason is because...

116
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:03,343
{\an1}How is Naruto doing, anyway?!
We hardly ever get to see him
anymore these days.

117
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,979
{\an1}Oh, I guess he's probably
busy getting ready for the big
day, huh!

118
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,948
M-hm.

119
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,584
{\an1}Although, he's been busy with
missions.

120
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,851
{\an1}But I can still count on him to
help with the wedding, too!

121
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:15,320
Oh, yeah?

122
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,022
{\an1}We just completed a mission
ourselves, and I'm sure that
it's gonna make you happy.

123
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:19,989
Kiba!

124
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:20,557
Huh?

125
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,158
Oh, oops!

126
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:23,892
Uh.

127
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,261
{\an1}Huh? What about me?

128
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:27,896
Uh, well...

129
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:32,633
{\an1}What I meant is just that you
and Naruto are definitely gonna
make a happy home together!

130
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,101
{\an1}And, uh, we're looking forward
to the wedding!

131
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,570
Oh thank you!

132
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,343
Hmm.

133
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:53,416
Hmm? Oink oink!

134
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,016
Huh?

135
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,988
{\an1}[gasps] Lady Tsunade!

136
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:05,158
{\an1}[sighs] It's been a while, huh,
Shizune?!

137
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:07,093
{\an1}So how've you been?

138
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:11,863
{\an1}Just great, thank you! What
about you? How has your
betting been going these days?

139
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:15,634
{\an1}With Naruto and Hinata's
wedding coming up, I've been
keeping it in check.

140
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,068
{\an1}That's probably a very wise
decision.

141
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,404
{\an1}So, what did you want? What's
up?

142
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,540
{\an1}M-hm. Right. Actually, it's
about Lord Kakashi.

143
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:29,344
{\an1}Kakashi?! Really? What's the

<i>Sensei...</i>

145
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:38,884
{\an7}<i>but I have to turn this in as my</i>

{\an1}<i>(Tsunade) Wedding presents?!</i>

147
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:45,123
{\an1}Yes. We have that rule on the
books about assessing the gifts
the invited shinobi will...

148
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:50,394
{\an1}<i>(Shizune) present in order to</i>
<i>determine who will be allowed to</i>
<i>attend the wedding, right?</i>

149
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:52,061
{\an1}Oh yeah. I remember.

150
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,965
{\an1}<i>(Shizune) Lord Kakashi has been</i>
<i>having a real dilemma about how</i>
<i>he's going to judge the gifts...</i>

151
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,769
{\an1}<i>and therefore who he's going</i>
<i>to have to eliminate from the</i>
<i>wedding ceremony.</i>

152
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,906
{\an7}<i>When you think about it, if</i>
<i>anyone's excluded...</i>

153
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,043
{\an7}<i>that's probably going to make</i>
<i>Naruto and Hinata very sad.</i>

154
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,615
{\an1}At the same time, we need to
have people to go on missions
and be on guard that day.

155
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,516
{\an1}That's what he's stressing out
about?!

156
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,384
Damn it.

157
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,885

{\an1}[groans] This is the worst!

167
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:57,879
{\an1}I get it. It's like this.

168
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,816
{\an1}<i>(Shikamaru) Most of the shinobi</i>
<i>in the village...</i>

169
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,784
{\an1}<i>will want to attend Naruto and</i>
<i>Hinata's wedding ceremony.</i>

170

{\an1}<i>However, there are still gonna</i>
<i>be missions that day.</i>

171
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:11,190
{\an1}<i>We'll need people on duty.</i>

172
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,159
{\an1}<i>Plus, there are gonna be a</i>
<i>lot of VIPs attending. </i>

173
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:18,062
{\an1}<i>It'll be crucial to have enough</i>
<i>security for the event.</i>

174
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:21,365
{\an1}That's right. And a lot of
Naruto and Hinata's friends...

175
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:24,501
{\an1}are now top-ranked jonin, so
they'll be in demand that day.

176
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,035
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) What does that mean? </i>

177
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,571
{\an1}Are we just gonna have to draw
lots or something like that...

178
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,705
{\an1}to see who can go to the
wedding?! How lame!

179
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:31,639
No way!

180
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,408
{\an1}<i>(Lee) Then we cannot truly</i>
<i>celebrate with the couple!</i>

181
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,878
{\an7}<i>I didn't think that our wedding</i>
<i>would cause so much trouble.</i>

182
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:42,515
{\an1}This whole thing's been
bothering Kakashi Sensei, too.

183
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,483
{\an1}That makes sense.

184
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,585
{\an1}Why'd it have to turn into
such a big thing?

185
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:52,556
{\an1}Well, because Naruto's bond is
with the whole village, not
just us. It had to.

186
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,391
{\an1}So we just sit and wait to be
judged?!

187
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:59,428
{\an1}I don't think there's gonna be
any need. I'll take on the dirty
work, and that'll be that.

188
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:04,432
{\an1}Me, too! I want everyone to
attend the wedding, so I will
volunteer for duty!

189
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,000
{\an1}<i>(Choji) Yeah! I'll do it, too!</i>

190
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,802
{\an1}<i>(Kiba) Fine, sign me up!</i>

191
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:09,503
{\an1}<i>(Akamaru) [barks]</i>

192
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,773
{\an1}No way! If Team 8 isn't there,
Hinata's gonna be really sad.

193
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:19,376
{\an1}But still I don't feel okay
about somebody else missing the
wedding just so we can go.

194
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,578
{\an1}We definitely feel the same
way.

195
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,628
{\an1}All right, lounging around
won't solve this. Better get
back.

196
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,432
Kakashi Sensei!

197
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,432
Hmm?

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,236
{\an1}Hm! Kakashi Sensei! I'm so
sorry!

199
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,874
{\an1}Huh? What? [gasps] What's
wrong, Hinata? What happened?

200
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:04,879
{\an1}I heard about the dilemma
you're facing. And it's all
because of our wedding!

201
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,614
{\an1}Huh? What? What's that, now?

202
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,717
{\an1}You haven't decided who can
attend our wedding, right?

203
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,051
{\an1}What?! You found out?

204
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,352
Yes!

205
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,620
And the mission?

206
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,621
Yes.

207
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:17,689
Everything?!

208
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:18,390
Yes.

209
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,724
Oh. I see.

210
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,663
{\an1}Listen, I would never want to
put anyone through trouble just
to celebrate our wedding day.

211
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,933
{\an1}Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no,
no!

212
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:33,601
{\an1}We are going to have a
ceremony for you two, there's
no doubt about that!

213
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:37,404
{\an1}Well all right, but about the
security...

214
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:40,807
{\an1}can't we have the Hyuga Clan
handle the missions and guard
duty that day?

215
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,075
{\an1}Uh, no, that won't work.

216
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,043
Huh?!

217
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:48,480
{\an1}The day of your wedding is a
happy day for your clan too,
isn't that right?

218
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:56,118
{\an1}As Hokage I have to make sure
your whole family can be there
for you. That's my duty.

219
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,820
Okay, I see.

220
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,556
{\an1}I'll figure out something
about the missions.

221
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,325
{\an1}Don't worry about anything.

222
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:05,292
Right.

223
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:09,530
{\an1}So for now just focus on
yourselves, that's all.

224
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,233
{\an1}Actually, I'd better get back!
See you!

225
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,036
{\an1}What?! What's this all about?

226
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:25,842
{\an1}We all know. About Naruto and
Hinata's wedding. And that we
can't all be there.

227
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,077
{\an1}And that the mission to find
wedding gifts for them...

228
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,179
{\an1}was so you could assess them to
see who goes.

229
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:33,748
{\an1}Oh, I see. So, you guys found
out, too.

230
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,984
{\an1}And that it's all been
troubling you.

231
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,519
{\an1}Don't mind that, it's part of
the job.

232
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:42,288
{\an1}So what about it? Are you here
to voice your opposition?

233
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:44,524
{\an1}No, the opposite, in fact!

234
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:45,358
What?

235
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,260
{\an1}Everyone here will handle the
assignments that day.

236
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:52,763
{\an1}But if you do that, Naruto and
Hinata are going to be sad
that you aren't there!

237
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:55,966
{\an1}And that's why we're going to
the wedding as well!

238
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:57,967
{\an1}What do you mean?

239
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,405
{\an1}It's simple. We'll schedule the
missions and guard duty, and
we'll all just work in shifts.

240
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:05,373
{\an1}If everybody puts in a little
time...

241
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,875
{\an1}then all of us can still be
there to wish them well!

242
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,811
{\an1}After all, helping each other
out is something that Naruto
taught us.

243
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,916
{\an1}Well? This way you won't have
to bear the whole burden.

244
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,784
You guys.

245
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:20,652
Thank you all!

246
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:23,654
{\an1}One thing, if we do this, we
gotta change that rule.

247
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:28,124
{\an1}Don't you worry. Come hell or
high water, I'll think of
another solution.

248
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,592
{\an1}<i>(Tsunade) You'll just drown!</i>

249
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,393
What?!

250
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:32,929
{\an1}Besides, there's no need for
all that.

251
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:33,895
Lady Tsunade?!

252
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:37,999
{\an1}Look, Lord Sixth, the thing
is, that rule was made...

253
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,869
{\an1}<i>(Tsunade)...back during a time</i>
<i>when there was a sudden upswing</i>
<i>in shinobi weddings...</i>

254
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,972
{\an1}<i>and while there was a serious</i>
<i>shortage of manpower.</i>

255
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,408
{\an1}Plus it was during the Great
War.

256
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,642
{\an1}The situation's different now.

257
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:57,747
{\an1}Also, and perhaps most
importantly, the Hokage is
you.

258
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:03,284
{\an1}You don't have to be bound by
old rules. Choose the path that
you believe is fair and just.

259
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:07,689
{\an1}So then you will choose to let
us all volunteer to work,
right?

260
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:09,089
Sorry, I can't.

261
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,091
{\an1}What?! But why not?!

262
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:14,995
{\an1}My job is to find a way for
everyone who wants to
celebrate...

263
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:18,530
{\an1}alongside Naruto and Hinata to
be able to attend the wedding.

264
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,732
{\an1}No one leaves early or comes
late.

isn't Hinata!

{\an1}What's the matter?! Did Naruto
do something?! He did, didn't
he?! I knew it!

270
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:57,961
Huh?

to treat women!

273
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,268
{\an1}Uh! I mean, not that I even
really know about that kind of
thing, of course!

00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,039
[grunting]

275
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:19,012
{\an1}[groans] I don't know what
happened, but as a favor to
me, please, forgive Naruto!

{\an1}[laughing] Iruka Sensei.

280
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:39,292

but you decided that Naruto
must've done something wrong...

00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,528
{\an1}and started to apologize.

282
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,864
{\an1}Oh. So he didn't?

283
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:53,038
{\an1}To be honest, it didn't even
cross my mind...

284
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:56,573
{\an1}that having a wedding would
cause so much trouble for so
many people.

285
00:17:56,607 --> 00:18:00,176
{\an1}Looking back I guess I
should have known all along.

286
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:04,080
{\an1}Because this wedding isn't
really just for us.

287
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:07,649
{\an1}After all, Naruto's a hero who
connects every village.

288
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,719
{\an1}I was probably just being naïve.

289
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:15,321
{\an1}And only thinking about marrying
the man that I'd loved for so
long.

290
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,090
{\an1}You're wrong about that,
Hinata!

291
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,557
Huh?

292
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:30,232
{\an1}No matter how great he might
become, no matter how big a
hero he may be...

293
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:34,637
{\an1}to me and to everyone else,
Naruto will always be Naruto.

294
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,973
Iruka Sensei.

295
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,576
{\an1}<i>(Iruka) Nothing will change our</i>
<i>desire to wish you both the</i>
<i>best.</i>

296
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,179
{\an1}So, don't think of this as a
big fuss.

297
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,847
[giggles] Yeah!

298
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,052
<i>(Kakashi) I see.</i>

299
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,222
{\an1}I feel really bad for
everything I put Hinata
through. I'm sorry too, Iruka.

300
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:02,559
{\an1}Oh no. Although I do
understand how Hinata feels.

301
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:06,762
{\an1}Naruto's become someone that
connects everyone in every
village together.

302
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,964
{\an1}Did you say every village?

303
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,332
Oh! Humph!

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,570
{\an1}Thank you so much, Iruka! I
know what the solution is now!

305
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:19,505
You what?!

306
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,506
{\an1}But what does that mean?

307
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,110
{\an1}Forget it! I'm just gonna have
to bow my head a little,
that's all.

308
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,177
{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) Iruka Sensei!</i>

309
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,312
{\an1}<i>I know you're in there! I</i>
<i>heard you!</i>

310
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:32,782
{\an1}C'mon, now! I need to record
your message or I won't have a
wedding gift!

311
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,584
What's up?

312
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:41,189
{\an1}Now that Hinata's found out
about the wedding gifts from
everyone...

313
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,557
{\an1}it's no longer a surprise. Which
means there's nothing to keep
hidden.

314
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:48,928
{\an1}Well, then! Konohamaru, I
think it's time you got to
work!

315
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:51,930
{\an1}Huh? I, uh, what now?

316
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,837
{\an1}In short, would it be possible
for you to dispatch some...

317
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,305
{\an1}Hidden Sand shinobi for the
day of the wedding?

318
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,977
{\an1}I sincerely implore you.

319
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:12,312
{\an1}Please raise your head, Lord
Sixth.

320
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:17,316
{\an1}<i>(Gaara) The Raikage, Tsuchikage,</i>
<i>Mizukage, and I have talked</i>
<i>about what we can do.</i>

321
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,686
{\an1}We didn't want to overstep our
bounds.

322
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,623
{\an1}I still plan to celebrate with
them as Naruto's friend...

323
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,758
{\an1}but want to do something as
Kazekage, as well.

324
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,961
{\an1}He means that we'd be happy to
cooperate with you.

325
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,663
{\an1}This is all possible because
of the peaceful bonds...

326
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:36,965
{\an1}that were forged through
Naruto's strength.

327
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:42,937
{\an1}Therefore, I think it only
fitting that we help to make
his wedding a great success.

328
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:45,072
{\an1}Thanks so much, Gaara.

329
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:49,209
{\an1}Actually, may I be so bold as
to ask for one more favor?

330
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:51,043
{\an1}You only have to ask.

331
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:53,245
[chuckles] Uh.

332
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:55,647
{\an1}Come here, Konohamaru!

333
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,849
{\an1}<i>(Konohamaru) Yes, sir!</i>

334
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,118
[giggles]

335
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:06,689
{\an1}Oh! A video message, huh?
Gaara, say something!

336
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,523
{\an1}What should I say?

337
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,625
{\an1}Just make up a proverb or
something!

338
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,860
{\an1}I can't! Not just like that!

339
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:17,530
{\an1}Oh, come on! What Kazekage
can't come up with a proverb?!
[gasps] Hey!

340
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,933
