1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,113
NARUTO: Yup.

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,448
Looks like Ichiraku
hasn't changed

3
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,417
a bit since I've been away.

4
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,418
Mm.

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,586
That's the smell I love.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,289
I'm getting hungry.

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:22,856
Here goes.

8
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,159
Hey.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,528
How's it going?

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,030
-Hello there.

11
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,266
-Old man, come on.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,234
Don't you remember me?

13
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,569
-Naruto?

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,272
As I live and breathe!

15
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,340
How could I ever
forget that face?

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,975
-Long time no see.

17
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,610
-Naruto!

18
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,745
Look how much you've grown.

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,247
-It's sure good to
see you guys again.

20
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,482
-Well, what'll you have?

21
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,683
Still got your appetite?

22
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,284
-You bet.

23
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,652
I'm starving!

24
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,653
-OK!

25
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,955
Then today your
food's on the house.

26
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,557
Order anything you want.

27
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,591
-No way.

28
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,059
-IRUKA: Hold it.

29
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,063
Let me get this one.

30
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,732
I had a bunch you
might be here, Naruto.

31
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,301
-Iruka-sensei!

32
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:07,868
-Hey.

33
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,669
Where's Sakura.

34
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:09,770
I thought she'd be with you.

35
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,876
-Well, if I'd known the check
was going to be taken care of,

36
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,111
I definitely would've
brought Sakura along.

37
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,489
-I don't know.

38
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,024
Maybe I should have
let him treat me

39
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,559
to half a bowl of
ramen or something.

40
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,832
Another order of
anmitsu dessert, please!

41
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,591
[chuckling]

42
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,423
-What is that?

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,725
Is that Lord Kazekage's sand?

44
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,027
-Amazing.

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,296
Look at the size of
the shield he created.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,365
-I expect nothing less
from the Kazekage.

47
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,603
-Gaara did it.

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,587
-Now you're within range.

49
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:12,693
Haa!

50
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,064
-Gaara!

51
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,232
[theme music]

52
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,019
-Now you're within range.

53
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,723
Haa!

54
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:26,927
-Gaara!

55
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,521
-He did it.

56
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,589
Our leader is astonishing.

57
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,961
-Gaara's Ultimate Defense
can withstand much more

58
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,329
than that detonation.

59
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,298
-Lord Baki, our attack
preparations are now complete.

60
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,466
-Very well.

61
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,301
You will launch the
assault on my signal!

62
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,723
-I expected as much.

63
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,392
That special sand of his
makes quite a tight defense.

64
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:46,473
However--

65
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,545
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): That's
exactly what I was counting on.

66
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,665
-Hah.

67
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,033
My left hand might
have been crushed--

68
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,580
-Sand Coffin.

69
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,917
-But I used the opportunity
to eat your sand,

70
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:35,055
and I mixed some of it
with my detonating clay.

71
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,724
You doomed yourself the
moment you used that sand

72
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,961
to try and form a defense.

73
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,464
And the best part is, I
planned it that way all along.

74
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,871
True art is--

75
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:52,439
-No!

76
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,373
-An explosion!

77
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,447
-One extra large serving
of the House Special Ramen.

78
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,615
-Whoa.

79
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,650
Oh, man.

80
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,120
The real Ichiraku Ramen.

81
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,457
For all of these years,
during my entire training,

82
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,192
I dreamt about
eating this ramen.

83
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:12,892
-Oh yeah?

84
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:13,626
Well, you better hurry.

85
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,694
It's getting cold.

86
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,195
-Oh.

87
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,764
Right.

88
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,499
Time to chow down.

89
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,636
[slurping]

90
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,840
-I kind of want to ask
a little favor, sensei.

91
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,375
-You want another bowl?

92
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,175
-Uh-uh.

93
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,810
I wanna try on your headband.

94
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,311
Come on.

95
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,013
Please?

96
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,481
-Oh this?

97
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,715
No way.

98
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,183
You can only wear
the Leaf headband

99
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,254
when you finally graduate from
the Academy and become a ninja.

100
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,056
You've gotta pass
the test tomorrow.

101
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,157
NARUTO: That is so uncool!

102
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,832
-Naruto.

103
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,234
NARUTO: Hm?

104
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,269
-You've sure come a
long way since the time

105
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,838
you were just a kid trying
to earn one of these.

106
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,773
-I'll say.

107
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,042
I'm glad you noticed.

108
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,143
Admit it.

109
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,011
Aren't you glad you
gave me this headband?

110
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,080
It looks pretty darn good
on me, don't you think?

111
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,250
[chuckle]

112
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,018
-I wouldn't be so cocky.

113
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,254
You've still got
a long way to go.

114
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,558
Be careful that you
don't get a swelled head.

115
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,929
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): He's
grown so much since then.

116
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,431
-Wow.

117
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,132
It's just like I remember.

118
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,003
Ichiraku's the
best in the world.

119
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,439
-I'm glad to hear
you say that again.

120
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:37,811
-Except-- there is one thing
I'm not too happy about.

121
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:38,912
-Huh?

122
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,748
Naruto, you come into my
shop after all this time

123
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,316
and the first thing
you do is tell me

124
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,018
what's wrong with my cooking?

125
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:45,518
Huh?

126
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,186
-No.

127
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,187
It's not like that.

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,388
There's nothing
wrong with the ramen.

129
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,722
It's perfect as always.

130
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,592
-Then what is it?

131
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,496
-It's just-- I was hoping the
next time Iruka-sensei treated

132
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,234
me to ramen would be on the day
when I finally became a chunin.

133
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,369
-Oh, Naruto.

134
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,105
-Every single one
of my classmates

135
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,507
has made the leap up to chunin.

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,810
The only one who's
still a genin is me.

137
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,946
[sigh]

138
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,081
IRUKA: It doesn't matter
whether technically you're

139
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,016
a genin or a chunin.

140
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,120
You've been trained privately
by Master Jiraiya himself.

141
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,554
NARUTO: I know, I know.

142
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,790
But even that hasn't
been a walk in the park.

143
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,559
That Pervy Sage
is out of control.

144
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,428
His training's so
intense it messed up

145
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,063
the headband you gave me.

146
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,732
And all my clothes got
totally ruined too.

147
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,135
That's why I had to go get
this new outfit made for me

148
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,138
and a replacement
cloth for my headband.

149
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,040
-I'm sure the training
was very intense at times,

150
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,309
but it made you
strong, didn't it?

151
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,145
You should be proud of yourself.

152
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,513
-Yeah.

153
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,816
I've definitely got another
step closer to becoming Hokage.

154
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,685
IRUKA: Well, somebody
sounds confident these days.

155
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,820
NARUTO: Sure.

156
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,588
And speaking of which,
I heard Gaara already

157
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,957
became Kazekage of
the Sand Village.

158
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,958
IRUKA: Oh.

159
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,561
Well, Gaara's sort
of a special case.

160
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,333
-You say he's special,
but that's not it.

161
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,668
-Huh?

162
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,673
-Just because you're special
doesn't make you Kazekage.

163
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,142
I know what I'm
talking about here.

164
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,713
That guy, I bet you he
worked incredibly hard.

165
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:26,052
All that time pushing himself,
proving himself to everyone

166
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,787
until he was Kazekage.

167
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,240
-That blast, what happened
inside the sphere?

168
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,841
-Is-- is he?

169
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,813
-Mm.

170
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,582
[chuckling]

171
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,687
-Gaara!

172
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,065
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade, tell me.

173
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,969
Have you decided on a first
mission for Team Kakashi.

174
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,071
-Naruto and Sakura
did nothing but train

175
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,306
for the last two
and a half years.

176
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,075
So, if you ask me,
they're gonna need

177
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,310
to make up for all
that lost time.

178
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,011
Ooh.

179
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,446
How about this one here?

180
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,515
A Land of Rice
Paddies escort run.

181
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,718
A nice tricky B-rank mission.

182
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,454
-But, milady, Naruto hasn't
been on a real mission

183
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,722
in a pretty long time.

184
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,457
Don't you think we
ought to start him off

185
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,159
with something easier?

186
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:40,860
Here.

187
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,561
Like this one.

188
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,732
-A dog walking job?

189
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,667
That's only a D-rank.

190
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,435
Sakura's a chunin now, And?

191
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,070
I'm sure Naruto's stronger.

192
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,473
I can't send them to
walk someone's mutt.

193
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,609
-It's just-- don't forget
about the Nine-Tailed fox.

194
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,078
If we send them out of the
village too soon, couldn't it--

195
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,280
-Yes.

196
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,881
But that's why I teamed
them up with Kakashi.

197
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,751
-I know, but I just worry that--

198
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,451
-Fine.

199
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,486
Give 'em this one then.

200
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,355
That's my final offer.

201
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,491
-Escorting a gold convoy.

202
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,493
A C-rank mission?

203
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,729
-If I know Naruto, he
won't like that one at all.

204
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,364
He'll say it's way too easy.

205
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,273
-Huh?

206
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,242
Sorry about that, old man.

207
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:29,976
-Don't worry.

208
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,377
It's nothing.

209
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,078
-Oh, man.

210
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,012
What a total waste.

211
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,492
-Lord Kazekage!

212
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:46,993
-No.

213
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,361
It can't be.

214
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,863
He broke Gaara's
Ultimate Defense?

215
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,098
-How on Earth did he do that?

216
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,350
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): I had to
detonate at point blank range,

217
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,686
so I needed to get you to defend
yourself using the same Sand

218
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,122
Armor that crushed my hand.

219
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,892
Except, I only had
one attack left.

220
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,096
So I thought, how can I
manipulate him to make sure

221
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,133
my explosion will be at
a close enough range.

222
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,503
That's when I got the
idea to drop my specialty

223
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,472
right on top of your village.

224
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,336
-Time to get the prize.

225
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:32,799
Hmph.

226
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,299
Ah.

227
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:33,800
Yes.

228
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,868
Of course.

229
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,336
-What now?

230
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,105
-He's using every
last bit of power

231
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,042
to transport the sand
safely outside the village.

232
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,013
He's trying to save his people.

233
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,315
-Such a noble Kazekage.

234
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,883
Fighting when it
would be so much

235
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,452
easier to drop it
on their heads.

236
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,361
-Gaara.

237
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,230
-What did you men
think you're doing?

238
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,399
We must rescue our Kazekage!

239
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,867
Commence the attack!

240
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,668
-Yes, sir!

241
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,439
-Fire!

242
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,020
-Why do you even bother?

243
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:28,521
-Again!

244
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,758
-Don't you get it?

245
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,026
Your arrows won't work.

246
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,839
They're getting a bit more
creative, aren't they?

247
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,480
I guess I'd better wrap this up.

248
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,083
Sasori might get ticked
off, if I'm not there soon.

249
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,094
-How long are you
gonna keep me waiting?

250
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:18,137
[heavy breathing]

251
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:24,043
[heavy breathing]

252
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,978
-Lord Kazekage, you can do it!

253
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,347
[cheering]

254
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,196
-Gaara!

255
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,897
Come on.

256
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,765
Don't give up yet.

257
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,721
He did it!

258
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,675
IRUKA: You know, Naruto.

259
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,645
Now it's your turn to
go after your dream.

260
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,715
-He's already the
Kazekage, and I'm still

261
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,250
just some insignificant genin.

262
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,919
IRUKA: But all that
training with Master

263
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,688
Jiraiya wasn't for
nothing, right?

264
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,124
Rumor has it you
and Sakura managed

265
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,059
to snatch Kakashi's bells.

266
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,528
And that's something
to be proud of.

267
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,663
-Yeah.

268
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,264
Doing that was more of
a cinch than I thought.

269
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,499
Who knows?

270
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,601
I might even be stronger
than you now, Iruka-sensei.

271
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,202
-What?

272
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,403
Not so fast.

273
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,672
You've got a long way to
go before you can beat me.

274
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,742
-Guess we won't know that for
sure unless we go to head.

275
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,643
[chuckling]

276
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,344
-Yeah right.

277
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,414
Well anyway, tomorrow
morning you'll be back

278
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,049
is a member of Team Kakashi.

279
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,083
I wish you luck.

280
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,589
-Mark my words.

281
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,557
I will become the Hokage.

282
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,160
There's no way I'm gonna
let Gaara outdo me.

283
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,232
-Gaara!

284
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:26,932
-Hurry.

285
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,533
Save the Kazekage!

286
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,942
-Taking him down
without killing him

287
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,244
was much harder than I thought.

288
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,247
-No!

289
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,940
-Well, my mission is clear.

290
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:08,441
Hmph.

291
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:17,283
-Gaara!

292
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,497
[theme music]

293

WEATHERMAN
(VOICEOVER): And now we

294
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,221
turn to the latest
weather forecast.

295
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,723
It should be mostly clear
and sunny today in the Sand

296
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,159
Village, but you can
expect a 40% chance

297
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,862
of oddly colored sand
raining down from the sky.

298
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,897
Like last night, this
system may develop

299
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,366
into a storm of
detonating clay as well.

300
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,602
So keep that in mind
as you plan your day.

301
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,470
You might want to store
your favorite puppets

302
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,507
inside scrolls, and don't
forget your umbrella.

303
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,778
Well, that's it for today's
Sand Village Accuweather Report.

304
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,680
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time-- Run, Kankuro!

305
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,530
-Today we're going
to be taking a look

306
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,634
at the very important jobs
for ninja known as missions.

307
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,670
The village receives mission
requests on a daily basis.

308
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:56,675
Anything from finding lost pets
to escorting big-shot VIPS.

309
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,310
Missions are broken
into five ranks

310
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,879
according to the
level of difficulty,

311
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,983
and are assigned to each
shinobi based on their ability.

312
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,852
If the shinobi succeeds
and completes the mission,

313
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,153
the village will earn a reward.

314
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,726
For the most part,
missions are carried out

315
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,029
in three man squads, units of
three ninja whose leader is

316
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,464
of chunin rank or higher.

317
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,766
This is the ideal
number of team members

318
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,469
to carry out a mission
covertly and swiftly.

319
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,409
Hey.

320
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,877
Wait that's way too many people.

321
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,947
This mission isn't gonna-- What?

322
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,582
Whoa!
