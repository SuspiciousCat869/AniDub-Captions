00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,458
{\an1}We've been
walking quite
a while.

2
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:21,160
{\an1}Ever since the
sun began to
rise.

3
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,596
{\an4}It's got to
be time for
us to fight,
then.

4
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:26,264
{\an1}But who are
we fighting
against?

5
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:35,005
{\an1}No way...
Are they close?

6
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,309
Something feels
familiar,
nostalgic...

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,614
{\an1}[surprised gasp]

8
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:46,583
{\an1}Itachi Uchiha?!

9
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:47,317
{\an1}Nagato?!

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,852
{\an1}You know
these guys,
Naruto?

11
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,053
{\an1}Yeah, I do.
I know both
of them.

12
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:55,657
{\an5}Incredible. I never
would have thought
I'd have to battle
you again, Naruto.

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,091
Not like this...

14
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,228
{\an1}For you, it's been
a while since we
last met, hasn't it?

15
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,163
{\an4}But for me,
it's only been
a matter of
moments.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,933
{\an1}You're different
now, Naruto.

17
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,435
{\an1}Oh, you
mean this?

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,536
{\an1}I sure am!

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,773
{\an4}I'm in control of the
Nine Tails Chakra!
What you're seeing
is my Chakra mode!

20
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,474
{\an1}Your what?!

21
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,878
{\an1}I see...
You are quite
different then.

22
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,379
{\an1}I see it
in your face.

23
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:26,985
{\an4}You're now
in command of
the power of
the Nine Tails?

24
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,453
{\an1}I'm impressed
with your
development.

25
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,356
{\an1}Well, he and
I are sibling
students.

26
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,258
{\an1}I'm not
surprised
at all.

27
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:38,427
{\an4}I made him be what
he could be. Talk all
you want his control
is thanks to me.

28
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,563
{\an1}No way!
That's so
not true!

29
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,164
{\an1}Have you
actually
done it?

30
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,801
{\an4}Have you been
able to
overcome
hatred, Naruto?

31
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:46,636
{\an1}Sure did!

32
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,871
{\an4}As my elder,
you taught me
about what
pain really is.

33
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:53,340
{\an4}Then Octopops
showed me how
to handle the
Waterfall of Truth.

34
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:54,776
{\an1}And my
mom and dad...

35
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:58,679
{\an4}Everyone who cares
about me helped me!
I have all of you
to thank!

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,948
{\an1}I see...

37
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:05,084
Naruto...
There's something
I must ask you.

38
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:06,052
{\an1}Huh?

39
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:10,422
{\an4}Wait, that reminds
me! I have stuff
that I wanna
ask you, too.

40

he's gonna
take revenge on
the Leaf Village!

65
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,131
{\an1}He even went
and joined up
with the Akatsuki!

66
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,533
Why did he
turn his back
on the village?!

67
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,404
{\an4}He found out
the truth about
your top-secret
mission!

00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,742
{\an1}And now he's
gonna destroy
the Leaf!

{\an1}What secret
mission?

{\an1}Did Madara...?!

00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:02,325
{\an4}Yeah, he did.
And Madara told
me the truth about
what happened, too!

{\an1}Oh he did,
did he?

73

Is what he said
actually the truth
or isn't it?!

74
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,802
{\an4}Was the Uchiha
Clan really going
to take over
the village?!

{\an1}Is he telling
the truth, Itachi?

{\an7}You made yourself look
like the bad guy in order
to save Sasuke and the
whole Hidden Lead Village!

80
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:30,383
{\an4}Sasuke understands
all of your pain, and
your resolve to do
what you did!

81
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:33,019
{\an1}But Sasuke
isn't like you...

{\an4}He's really
going to
destroy the
Hidden Leaf!

83
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,724
He's going to kill
everyone in order to
avenge the pain...

84
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:43,128
{\an5}...That the
village caused
his older brother
that he loves so much.

Damn that
Madara...

86
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,398
So he did
know the truth
about me...

87
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,702
{\an4}And does everyone
in the village
know about this
as well?

88
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,039
{\an1}Kakashi Sensei
and Captain Yamato
heard it when I did...

89
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,043
{\an1}But, there wasn't
any proof of what
Madara told us.

90
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,378
{\an1}So Kakashi Sensei
said to keep quiet.

91
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,747
{\an4}I don't think
there's anyone
else that knows,
though.

92
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:08,951
{\an1}Then please, Naruto...
You mustn't tell
anyone about this.

93
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:12,687
{\an1}You cannot let
the Uchiha Clan's
name be tarnished!

gonna do that!

00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:32,815
{\an1}Are you
kidding me?!

144

{\an1}[gasp of
realization]

145
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,523
{\an1}Why are you
so obsessed with
my brother?

146
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,624
{\an1}He's just a
rogue ninja.

147
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,028
{\an1}It's true that
we may not be
blood, but...

148
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:51,898
{\an7}He's more of a
brother to me than
you ever were to
him.

149
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,206
{\an1}[grunts]

150
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:07,179
{\an1}You're already
under my

151
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,548
{\an1}[grunting
and struggling]

152
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,819
{\an1}I'll say it
again. I just
want to talk.

153
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,623
{\an4}I'm aware you
want to take
Sasuke back to
the Leaf.

154
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:25,094
{\an4}But, what if
it doesn't go
the way you
want?

155
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,496
{\an1}[angry grunt]

156
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,663
I'll do anything
to make it happen!

157
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,631
{\an1}Even taking
him by force?

158
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:35,703
{\an7}Sure, if you're lucky.
Sasuke will just
obediently return with
you to the Village.

159
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,738
{\an4}But tell me,
what if the
opposite were
to happen?

160
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,208
What are you
talking about?!

161
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:46,779
{\an4}You just said
you consider Sasuke
to be like a
brother to you...

162
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,017
{\an4}What if Sasuke
were to attack
the Hidden Leaf
Village?

163
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,852
{\an1}What would
you do then?

164
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:58,656
{\an4}Why would...?
No, there's just no
way that Sasuke would
ever do something like that!

165
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:04,695
{\an4}Sasuke is still a
blank canvas. He can
easily be dyed into
any color.

166
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:08,664
If he resists...
Will you be able
to stop him?

167
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,136
{\an1}Or even kill
him, if need be?

168
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,704
{\an1}Come to
think of it...

169
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:16,172
{\an1}That day...

170

{\an1}[gagging sounds]

171

{\an1}I have shared
some of my
power with you.

172
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:31,418
{\an4}Though I hope
the day that you
will have to use it
never comes.

173
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,490
{\an1}[shocked gasp]

happened?!

181
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,883
{\an1}[stunned gasp]
Then it wasn't
Amaterasu!

00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:10,487
{\an1}[startled gasp]

183
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,792

that's it,

00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,261
{\an1}What is
going on?!

185

{\an1}Wait, did he mess
with the
Amaterasu?!

190
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,113
{\an4}That crow
down there.
It's one of
yours?

191
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,983
{\an1}What exactly did
you do with
that bird?

192
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,387
{\an1}I underestimated
him...

193
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:55,025
{\an4}Itachi Uchiha...
He's clearly very
different than
all the others.

194
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,794
{\an1}He resisted
the Reanimation
Jutsu.

195
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,430
{\an1}It worked...

196
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,600
{\an1}Of course, I
understand now.

197
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,168
{\an1}Amaterasu!

198
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,114
{\an1}Hey, he-!

199
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:25,185
Take it easy.
I am no longer
being controlled.

200
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:28,688
{\an1}I used a new
genjutsu against
the enemy's jutsu.

201
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:29,656
{\an1}Huh?!

202
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,192
{\an4}This genjutsu
orders me to
protect the
Leaf Village.

203
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:36,961
{\an1}The Reanimation
Jutsu...is undone

204
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:37,829
{\an1}[stunned gasp]

205
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:39,632
{\an1}Thanks to
that crow...

206
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:46,471
{\an4}It emerged in response
to my Mangekyo Sharingan,
and prepared it in case...
For a time just like this.

207
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,740
{\an1}What are you
talking about?

208
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:52,942
{\an1}I implanted it
in that crow's
left eye.

209
00:15:54,877 --> 00:16:01,216
{\an4}Wait, it's his eye!
Yes, there's only one
genjutsu that's capable
of doing that!

210
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,185
{\an1}Shisui Uchiha's
Mangekyo Sharingan...

211
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:10,124
{\an1}The ultimate genjutsu:
Koto Amatsukami.

212
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,029
{\an1}That genjutsu broke
Kabuto's control
over me...

213
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:20,266
{\an4}However, it appears
that the Mangekyo
had already worn
off.

214
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,669
{\an1}I don't get it.
Shisui Uchiha?

215
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:28,307
{\an4}Uchiha's most
powerful Genjutsu
user, Shisui the
teleporter?!

216
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,244
{\an1}Shisui's Visual
Prowess...is
unique.

217
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:37,315
{\an4}It creates a powerful
Genjutsu that allows
you to control someone
without them even realizing it.

218
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,019
{\an8}I programmed the
Genjutsu to protect
the Hidden Leaf into
Shisui's eye.

219
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:48,191
{\an5}I put the command
in the crow's eye and
then gave the eye
to you, Naruto.

220
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:53,429
{\an4}Of course I never
realized that I'd
be using it against
myself someday.

221
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,365
{\an1}But why did you even
have that eye in the
first place?

222
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,400
{\an1}And why did
you give it to me?

223
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:03,805
Self-sacrifice.

224
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:06,239
A true shinobi
does not set out
to seek glory.

225
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,810
They protect from
the shadows. That is a
mark of a true ninja.

226
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:12,713
Shisui was the
one who taught
me that.

227
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:18,250
{\an7}Shisui knew...that
a battle for the possession
of his eyes would
ensue after his death.

228
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:21,454
{\an4}He faked the
destruction of his
eyes and took his
own life.

229
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:26,024
{\an4}I helped him by
letting myself
become the target
of suspicion

230
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:31,796
{\an4}The last time
I saw Shisui, Danzo
had already stolen
his right eye.

231
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:35,132
{\an1}The left one,
he bequeathed
to me.

232
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:39,536
{\an4}He instructed me to
to use it to protect the
Village, and then
disappeared.

233
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,741
{\an4}I gave that eye
to you, a ninja with
the same integrity
as Shisui.

234
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,779
{\an1}<i>If Sasuke, whom I</i>
<i>left behind, ever became</i>
<i>a threat to the Village...</i>

235
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,683
{\an1}<i>Then I would have violated</i>
<i>all that Shisui entrusted</i>
<i>me to do.</i>

236
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,652
{\an7}You were the only
one who could
ever make it right.

237
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,757
{\an1}You said that
you consider
Sasuke a brother.

238
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,827
{\an4}That's why I knew
that you, Naruto, were
the only one who
could stop him.

239
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:13,899
{\an4}<i>I knew Sasuke</i>
<i>would at least</i>
<i>try to transplant my</i>
<i>eyes into himself.</i>

240
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:17,836
{\an1}<i>He wanted that</i>
<i>true power. The</i>
<i>Eternal Mangekyo.</i>

241
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,838
{\an1}<i>If that did</i>
<i>come to pass...</i>

242
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:24,375
{\an4}<i>The crow was set to</i>
<i>emerge from you</i>
<i>when it came in contact</i>
<i>with my eyes.</i>

243
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:30,046
{\an4}<i>The crow would cast</i>
<i>the Koto Amatsukami</i>
<i>on Sasuke, making him</i>
<i>want to protect the Leaf.</i>

244
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,581
{\an1}That was my plan.

245
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:36,919
{\an4}Why didn't you just
cast that jutsu upon
Sasuke right from
the get-go then?

246
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,954
{\an1}It's not a
question of
didn't...

247
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,023
{\an1}...It's simply that
I couldn't.

248
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,526
{\an1}Not back then.

249
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:48,663
{\an4}Shisui's Mangekyo...
takes more than a
decade to
reactivate...

250
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:51,800
{\an1}...Unless you have
Hashirama Senju's
chakra.

251
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,935
{\an1}Sasuke wanted
me dead for
many reasons.

252
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,505
{\an4}I had to concentrate
on what my death
would do to
Sasuke.

to do anymore
at all!
