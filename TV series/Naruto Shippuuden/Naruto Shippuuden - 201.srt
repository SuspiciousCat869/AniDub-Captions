Hmf.

{\an1}[Black Zetsu]
Yeah.

00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,382

{\an1}He did what?!

14
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,689
That's right.

15
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:02,523
In order to
protect Sasuke,

16
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,656
{\an1}He took all of her abuse.

<i>prevent you from worrying,</i>

Naruto...

22
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,925
And now he's
on his way,

23
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,025
to ask the Raikage
to pardon Sasuke.

24
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:49,259
{\an1}What? Why would he
be so reckless?!
Wasn't Kakashi with him?!

25
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,892
{\an1}<i>I doubt that would've</i>
<i>stopped him.</i>

26
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,925
Kakashi Sensei
believes in Naruto.

27
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:59,625
{\an1}Even if it's a long shot,
Kakashi wants to
give him a chance.

28

Kakashi to take Sasuke's place.

31

{\an1}So I still don't really
know all of you very well.

32

And I'm not good
with emotions.

Also,

34
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,659
What?!

35
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,859
Have you told sakura
how you feel?

36
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,261
{\an1}No way. I mean,
how could I?

37
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,994
{\an1}I'm the guy who couldn't
even keep my promise to her.

38

47
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:26,328

{\an1}Don't you worry one bit.
I'm gonna bring Sasuke back.

gonna keep my promise;
I won't give up!

52
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,130
{\an1}It was the promise of a
lifetime! I really meant it.
Completely.

53
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:53,530
I said I would.

of his promise to you.

00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:18,265
And plans to for the

{\an1}Hey! Don't talk
to her like that!

71
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:21,400
{\an1}You know how Ino's
felt about Sasuke
all these years.

72
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,001
{\an1}Yeah but it can't be helped!

00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:27,367
Things are different now
than they were before.

75
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,734
{\an1}You sure about this?
If that's Ino's reaction,

76
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,034
{\an1}<i>How will Naruto and Sakura feel?</i>

77
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,367
{\an1}Let's leave it to Shikamaru.
He always knows the right
thing to say.

78
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:45,101
{\an1}Remember that his first mission
as squad leader failed.

79
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,434
{\an1}He still feels
responsible for that.

80
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:55,501
{\an1}Yeah, I know. Just
imagine if we had somehow
gotten Sasuke back home.

81
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:58,735
It haunts him.

82
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:01,735
{\an1}<i>That's why Shikamaru</i>
<i>volunteered to convince her.</i>

83
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:08,169
{\an1}<i>[Shizune]</i>
<i>Wait a minute! Naruto genuinely</i>
<i>wants to rescue Sasuke,</i>

84
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,369
{\an1}<i>it's not just because of</i>
<i>his promise to Sakura!</i>

85
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,136
{\an1}<i>Don't you think that's true?</i>

86
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,203
<i>[Sai]</i>
<i>Yes, I totally</i>
<i>agree with you.</i>

87
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:22,003
<i>But, both Sakura and I,</i>
<i>and everyone else, rely</i>
<i>on Naruto too much.</i>

88
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:27,302
{\an1}<i>I've been watching Naruto</i>
<i>lately, and I think I figured</i>
<i>out what he's feeling.</i>

89
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,369
It's sadness.

90
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,271
{\an1}And then when I
think about Sasuke,

91
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,137
{\an1}I get a burning
feeling in my gut.

92
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,403
{\an1}<i>And I've come to know</i>
<i>that that's anger.</i>

93
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:53,670
{\an4}So for Naruto's sake, as well
as that of the Hidden Leaf,
we must not rely solely on
Naruto anymore.

94
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,804
We have to take
action ourselves.

95
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,804
Sasuke is...

96
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,038
{\an1}<i>[Shikamaru]</i>
<i>Sai's right.</i>

97
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:02,538
<i>[Shizune]</i>
<i>Shikamaru!</i>

98
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,437
We're not kids anymore.

99
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:12,071
{\an1}We need to stop the Akatsuki.
And then,

100
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,304
{\an1}<i>We have to stop Sasuke.</i>

101
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:23,639
I came here to talk to
Team 7's members and
get their consent.

102
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,206
Consent?! Please
don't tell me that--

103
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,505
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:35,505
{\an4}<i>We can't allow a war to</i>
<i>break out between the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf and the Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud because of Sasuke.</i>

105
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,906
Let me try to put
it another way.
Just hear me out.

106
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,274
{\an4}<i>If the Hidden Cloud did kill</i>
<i>Sasuke, there's no way you</i>
<i>or Ino, or especially</i>
<i>Naruto, would just let it be.</i>

107
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:54,373
{\an1}And if any of you were to lash
out recklessly and get killed by
Cloud ninja,

108
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,673
{\an4}Neither I nor Choji,
nor Inoichi, or even
your parents would
just sit still.

109
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:02,840
{\an1}We'd go out and avenge you.

110
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,973
<i>Then the other side</i>
<i>wouldn't remain quiet.</i>
<i>They'd retaliate, too.</i>

111
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,374
{\an1}If Choji or I were to get
killed by Cloud ninja,

112
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:15,407
{\an1}Well, then, our fathers
would just head out.

113
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,974
{\an1}<i>Before you know it,</i>
<i>we'd be at war.</i>

114
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:25,908
{\an4}<i>According to what the</i>
<i>messenger from the Cloud said,</i>
<i>they already consider Sasuke</i>
<i>an international criminal.</i>

115
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,541
{\an1}If Sasuke continues to align
himself with the Akatsuki,

116
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:33,307
{\an1}the hatred spreading
through the country
will only grow.

117
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:39,642
{\an1}So I believe it's time for
the Hidden Leaf Village to
deal with Sasuke ourselves.

118
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,708
{\an1}<i>You understand</i>
<i>what I'm saying?</i>

119
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,875
{\an1}<i>Right, Sakura?</i>

120
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:55,842
{\an1}That's why I want your consent.
Sakura, will you--

121
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,842
<i>[Sakura]</i>
<i>Shikamaru...</i>

122
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,075
[sigh]

123
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,441
{\an1}Please. Just don't.

124
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,843
{\an1}Don't say anything more.

125
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,509
I'm sorry,
Sakura.

126
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:22,743
{\an4}But regardless of what
your answer is, I'm going
to have to act, to protect
the Leaf's future.

127
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,278
{\an1}I'll talk to Naruto, too.
Where is he right now?

128
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,877
Naruto's gone,
he went to the
Land of Iron.

129
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,944
To meet with
the Raikage.

130
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,544
Ahn! He's willing
to go that far!?

131
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:41,977
{\an1}Well, I guess I should've
known that this whole
thing was gonna be a drag.

132
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,343
{\an1}<i>[Sakura]</i>

Let me take on
that role.

138
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,746
{\an1}I'm the one who's caused
Naruto the most pain.

139
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,712
{\an1}I'm always messing up.
Just one failure after another.

140
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:26,479
{\an1}I don't want to make any more
mistakes. I don't want to fail!

141
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,846
I'll do it.

142
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:44,814
{\an1}What?! Let the Hokage lead
the Allied Shinobi Forces?!

143
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,380
{\an1}If all of you approve this,
I will gladly and humbly
accept this position.

{\an1}[growling]

146
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:07,948
Why the Hokage?!

147
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,548
{\an1}<i>This man is also</i>
<i>known by the moniker,</i>
<i>The Shinobi of Darkness!</i>

148
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:16,282
{\an1}<i>We cannot let him take charge!</i>

149
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,015
Then who else?

150
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,714
{\an1}My village has not
produced even one single
member of the Akatsuki.

151
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:28,982
{\an1}Such a crucial role must be
filled by the most trustworthy!
It ought to be me!

152
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,116
<i>[Mifune]</i>

154
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:37,448
Huh...?!

155
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:43,749
{\an1}<i>[Mifune]</i>
<i>I am well aware that a certain</i>
<i>amount of intensity and strength</i>

156
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,216
{\an1}<i>is necessary to assemble</i>
<i>and lead a force of</i>
<i>powerhouses such as these.</i>

157
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:52,416
{\an1}<i>But someone such as yourself,</i>
<i>whose acts are ruled by his</i>
<i>emotions,</i>

158
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,883
{\an1}<i>would probably end up</i>
<i>splintering an allied force</i>
<i>just like you did that desk.</i>

159
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,483
Rrrgh.

160
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:05,217
{\an4}I am simply stating my
unbiased opinion as a
neutral party in these
discussions, Lord Raikage.

161
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,917
<i>Lord Kazekage is still</i>
<i>too young to spearhead</i>
<i>such a venture.</i>

162
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:15,750
{\an4}<i>He does not have much pull</i>
<i>with other nations, and his</i>
<i>title of Kazekage alone</i>
<i>will not be sufficient.</i>

163
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:22,118
{\an4}<i>Lord Tsuchikage, on the</i>
<i>other hand, is too old and</i>
<i>gives the impression of</i>
<i>one whose power has waned.</i>

164
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:27,417
{\an4}<i>He has also used the</i>
<i>Akatsuki too often. </i>
<i>He's the least trustworthy</i>
<i>among you here.</i>

165
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:33,484
{\an1}<i>And since Lady Mizukage's Hidden</i>
<i>Mist is suspected to be the</i>
<i>birthplace of the Akatsuki,</i>

166
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:39,851
{\an4}<i>There is some concern about</i>
<i>possible intelligence leaks.</i>
<i>People might wonder</i>
<i>if there are spies.</i>

167
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:45,418
{\an4}We don't know why the
Akatsuki are gathering the
Tailed Beasts or what they
intend to do with them.

168
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:48,985
{\an1}But we do know that
we can't let them
have the Nine-Tails.

169
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,552
{\an1}<i>The Nine-Tails belongs</i>
<i>to the Hidden Leaf.</i>

170
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:56,418
{\an1}<i>Thus, I feel it</i>
<i>appropriate that the</i>
<i>Hokage be named as leader.</i>

171
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,618
{\an1}[Raikage]
Regardless of any
other concerns,

172
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:04,820
{\an4}I would never agree to an
Allied Shinobi Force that
would compromise the
security of my village!

173
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:10,753
{\an7}<i>Something's just not</i>
<i>sitting right about this.</i>
<i>I need to check it out.</i>

{\an8}<i>Byakugan!</i>

179

{\an7}<i>What?! What's this?!</i>

180
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:37,154
{\an7}<i>How could this be?! The color</i>
<i>of the chakra in Danzo's</i>
<i>right shoulder and right arm,</i>
<i>and his right eye as well...</i>

181
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,821
{\an7}<i>There's no mistake.</i>

182
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,654
{\an7}<i>It's Shisui Uchiha's!</i>

183
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,320
{\an7}<i>He was a formidable foe</i>
<i>that I fought against once.</i>

184
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:55,122
{\an7}<i>I'll never forget that color.</i>

00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:52,990
[gasp]
Wait, is that--?!

200
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,490
{\an1}My right eye is also a
precious spoil of war, from
a battle against the Hyuga.

201
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,623
{\an1}So I'm not really
one to cast blame.

202
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:08,292
