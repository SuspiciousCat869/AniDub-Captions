[struggling]

5
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,766
{\an1}I'm getting accustomed to
these powers. It's going
well, not bad at all...

6
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:43,574
{\an1}I think it's about time
to put my plan into action.

8

{\an1}Well, what's the matter?
Just press the Storing
Square!

9
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:42,830
{\an1}Feeling unsure, eh,
Naruto? I can't say
that I blame you.

10
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,565
But why?

11
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,709
{\an4}Lord Fukasaku, The way
that the Nine-Tails gets
its power is by mixing
two things together:

12
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,146
{\an1}its chakra and
its will.

13
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,947
[grunting]

14
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,622
{\an4}<i>To control this power,</i>
<i>you must extract only the</i>
<i>Nine Tails' Chakra,</i>
<i>convert it into your own</i>

15
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:01,693
{\an1}<i>chakra, and thus make it</i>
<i>your own power. </i>

16
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:04,098
{\an1}<i>But that's not as easy as</i>
<i>it sounds. </i>

17
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:05,666
[laughing]

18
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,240
{\an1}<i>When you pull out the</i>
<i>Nine-Tails' chakra,</i>
<i>his will tags along.</i>

19
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:17,352
{\an7}<i>The Nine Tails' will is a</i>
<i>mass of hatred that's</i>
<i>bound tightly to his</i>
<i>chakra by strong forces. </i>

20
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:24,530
{\an7}<i>No matter how hard you</i>
<i>try to shield yourself,</i>
<i>it will find some hatred</i>
<i>buried deep inside you</i>

21
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,201
{\an1}<i>and try to take over. </i>

22
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,205
{\an1}<i>In other words... </i>

23
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:35,881
{\an4}<i>You must have a strong</i>
<i>will of your own,... one</i>
<i>that's completely empty</i>
<i>of hatred... </i>

24
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:41,491
{\an4}<i>... One that's capable of</i>
<i>completely separating</i>
<i>Nine-Tails' will from his</i>
<i>chakra. </i>

25
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:50,972
{\an4}<i>The Fourth Hokage made</i>
<i>Nine-Tails' seal so a</i>
<i>little bit of its chakra</i>
<i>leaks out of its cage,</i>

26
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,944
{\an1}<i>hopefully to naturally</i>
<i>become one with</i>
<i>Naruto's own chakra. </i>

27
00:03:55,246 --> 00:04:00,087
{\an4}<i>It's known as the</i>
<i>Eight-Trigram Sealing</i>
<i>Formula and creates a</i>
<i>double-interface</i>

28
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,956
{\an1}<i>Tetragram Seal. </i>

29
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,965
{\an4}<i>If Naruto uses this key</i>
<i>to open the Tetragram</i>
<i>Seal, he could pull out</i>
<i>all of Nine-Tails' chakra.</i>

30
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:13,375
{\an4}And that means that
all of the Nine-Tails'
Will would tag along with
its chakra!

31
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:17,514
{\an1}And as soon as Naruto's
will loses to the
Nine-Tails' will...

32
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,586
{\an1}<i>The Nine Tails will be</i>
<i>fully resurrected! </i>

33
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,591
{\an1}<i>How terrible.</i>

34
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:29,133
{\an1}And tell me... has the
key ever been used to
open the seal?

35
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,540
{\an8}Actually, the Tetragram
Seal is always getting
weaker.

36
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:38,982
{\an8}To restrain Naruto, who
started a Nine-Tails
transformation in
training, Jiraiya used

37
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,750
{\an8}the key to tighten the
seal.

38
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,057
[roaring]

39
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,958
{\an1}Uh!

40
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:56,843
{\an1}<i>There. That should hold</i>
<i>him for a while.</i>

41
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,581
{\an1}Only for "a while,"
huh? Man...

42
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,683
Hm?

43
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,234
{\an1}Hmmm...

44
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,607
{\an1}What's going on?
Something wrong, Pervy
Sage?

45
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:21,216
{\an4}<i>Jiraiya was greatly</i>

48
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,800
{\an1}All right. I guess I'll
have to try it.

49
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,770

{\an1}A toad just came out of
your mouth!

52
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:48,694
{\an4}Give me a break, would
you, Jiraiya? You just
summoned me a little
while ago, you know!

53
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,095
{\an1}What do you want?!

54
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,999
Look, I need a favor.
Just hear me out, all
right, Gerotora?

55
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,301
It won't
take long.

56
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,103
Huh?!

57
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,607
{\an1}It's about Naruto's
Tetragram Seal.

58
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:02,948
{\an4}Come on! You just
tightened it, didn't you?
Do you want it even
tighter now?! Sheesh.

59
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:06,020
{\an1}Not quite. Just the
opposite.

60
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:09,859
{\an1}If it's not too much,
I wanna loosen it up
just a little bit.

61
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:11,261
{\an1}What?!

62

when I told you that you
reminded me of the Fourth
Hokage?

75

{\an4}<i>You're the shinobi who</i>

<i>the Fourth Hokage</i>

{\an1}<i>himself. So shape up! </i>

{\an1}You have no idea... Just
how happy I was then.

78
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:19,471
{\an4}Back when I first learned
the Rasengan... I mean,
it's the Fourth Hokage's
own jutsu!

79
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:23,911
{\an1}It's almost like I'd
taken over the work of
one of my idols!

80
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:26,715
{\an1}But--

81
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:33,760
{\an4}As hard as it was for me
to learn the Rasengan,
that was nothing compared
to this training!

82
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,067
{\an1}Hmph!

83
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,173
{\an4}I guess you think
mastering the Rasengan
was a miracle and not
due to hard work!

84
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:46,112
{\an1}Maybe I was just
expecting too much
out of you.

85
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,688
Look, I know the Fourth
Hokage was a great shinobi.
You don't have to remind me!

86
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,759
{\an1}Yeah, that's
for sure.

someone like you who gets
stupid excited about mastering
one measly little jutsu.

88
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:05,678
{\an1}Unlike you, my most
foolish apprentice, he
was a true prodigy.

89
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:09,249
{\an1}The jutsu he developed
was simply extraordinary.

90

{\an1}Even I couldn't grasp the
ninjutsu that he came up
with.

Mm-hmm.

<i>that came after him,</i>
<i>either. </i>

94
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,373
{\an1}His jutsu was that
amazing?

95
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:29,281
{\an1}I knew he was in a class
all by himself! How can
I ever become Hokage?!

00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:35,859
{\an1}Listen, okay?

97
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:41,233
{\an4}There's only one shinobi
now who has the potential
to master such
extraordinary jutsu.

Uh! You are?!

101
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,821
{\an4}That's right. Only you
possess the Nine-Tails'
chakra and can master
that jutsu!

102
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:58,260
{\an1}It's a jutsu that only I
can master? Do you mean
that...?

103
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:03,168
{\an7}Yeah. The Fourth Hokage
left it solely for your
sake.

104
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,573
{\an7}He meant it as his legacy
to you.

00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,245
{\an1}It's his legacy...?

Fourth Hokage?!

113
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,176
{\an1}the tighter the grip
of the Nine Tails will
on me becomes.

114
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,348
{\an1}He just ignores my own
will and tries to hurt
everyone near me.

115
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:58,590

from only opening the
seal a tiny bit.

116
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:03,866

<i>Hinata... </i>

136
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,489
{\an1}<i>I was so angry. I lost it</i>
<i>again. </i>

137
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,430
{\an1}<i>My heart linked itself to</i>
<i>Nine Tails' Will all by</i>
<i>itself. </i>

138
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:20,082
{\an1}Right now, I feel safer
because the Fourth Hokage
rebuilt the seal.

139
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:27,227
{\an1}It could fall apart at
any time, though.

140
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:31,701
{\an1}But I need Nine-Tails'
chakra in order to fight
Sasuke.

141
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,241
{\an1}I am the Nine Tails'
Jinchuriki, after all.

142
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,347
{\an1}I can't hide from that
forever.

143
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:44,221
{\an1}I sealed half of the
Nine-Tails' chakra inside
of you.

144
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,958
Because I believed that
you could master this
power.

145
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:53,068
{\an7}<i>I'm going to conquer this</i>
<i>control thing, Dad! No</i>
<i>more hurting my friends.</i>

146
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,640
{\an7}<i>No more giving in to</i>
<i>hatred.</i>

147
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:11,197
{\an7}<i>Well... no use getting</i>
<i>depressed. </i>

148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,306
{\an4}<i>Now I see just how</i>
<i>dangerous it is to</i>
<i>release the Nine-Tails'</i>
<i>chakra.... </i>

149
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:25,019
{\an4}<i>But he has the Fourth</i>
<i>Hokage's love and that</i>
<i>sheer gutsiness instilled</i>
<i>in him by Jiraiya-boy.</i>

150
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:31,662
{\an1}<i>Contract complete!</i>
<i>Storage time! </i>

151
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,401
Huh? What do you mean,
what's "storage?!"

152
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:39,075
{\an4}Relax, you don't need to
do a thing. Just open up
your mouth nice and wide,
you got it?

153
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,677
{\an1}Mouth...?

154
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,282
{\an1}Just say "Ahh!"
Ya understand?

155
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,085
Ahhh...

156
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:47,054
{\an1}No, wider! Open up!

157
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,559
[grunting]
Ahhh!

158
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,894
{\an1}All right! I'm going in!

159
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,399
[freaking out]

160
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:59,140
{\an1}Hey! Open wider! Are you
going to let me get
inside you or not?!

161
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:03,713
{\an7}<i>Why by mouth? He's all</i>
<i>slimy. This is gross! </i>

162
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,049
{\an1}Hhh'yah!

163
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,084
Uh!

164
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:11,393
{\an1}[gagging and coughing]

165
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:16,568
{\an1}Storage is now complete!
I'll be returning Naruto-boy
to the Hidden Leaf.

166
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,239
{\an1}And then we'll have to
find the octopus.

167
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:23,912
Oh, that's right... the
prophecy said I was
gonna meet an octopus.

168
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,181
{\an1}Mm-hmm!

169
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,319
So where is this thing?
Can't you give me any
more clues?

170
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:34,696
{\an4}It's not clear, but
it's an island. avoided
by people. A creature's
paradise.

171
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,002
{\an1}It seems a veritable
pleasure resort to me!

172
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,242
[happy reacting]

173
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:48,018
{\an1}I believe that is where
the octopus will
cooperate with you.

174
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:50,955
{\an1}In any case, you'll
receive guidance there.

175
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,258
{\an1}Yes, sir!

176
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:03,742
{\an1}There's no mistake
about it, this is
Kabuto's doing.

177
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:08,951
{\an1}This method of killing...
Kabuto is becoming more
and more like Orochimaru.

178
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:15,094
{\an1}But still, why is he leaving
a trail? If he wanted, he
could erase it easily.

179
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,931
Do you think it
was deliberate?

180
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:19,902
What is he plotting?

181
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,908
{\an1}I suspect that he's taken
on Orochimaru's will.

182
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:28,949
{\an7}Now the big question is:
is he going after the
Hidden Leaf or the
Akatsuki?

183
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:34,891
{\an1}Let's start with
greetings, Tobi. Oh,
that's right...

184
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:38,131
{\an1}I hear you're going by
Madara these days.

185
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:40,101
{\an1}I'm impressed you found
me.

186
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:45,809
{\an4}You shouldn't
underestimate my volume
of intel, from criss-
crossing the land

187
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:49,148
{\an1}a spy and as an Akatsuki
member.

188
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:54,890
{\an4}That's right. You were
one of Sasori's spies.
You're a traitor to the
Akatsuki.

189
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,508
{\an1}This is...!

190
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:23,069
{\an1}The Reanimation Jutsu.

191
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:28,344
{\an1}A Forbidden Jutsu known
only to the Second Hokage
and Lord Orochimaru.

192
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,614
{\an1}Now, I'm the third one to
know.

193
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,822
{\an1}I've surpassed the two
of them in other ways,
as well.

194
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,559
This show was for your
benefit.

195
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:40,430
So you'd believe in my
power and trust me.

196
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:45,170
{\an1}<i>Rest assured. I did not</i>
<i>come here to fight you. </i>

197
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,441
{\an1}Then what do you want?

198
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,879
{\an1}I want us to
join forces.

199
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,551
{\an1}Join forces?

200
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,691
And what would be in it
for me?

201
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:04,235
{\an4}I hear that you're
starting a war. I can
offer you more strength
in battle.

202
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:06,873
{\an1}In the form of...

203
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,343
{\an1}<i>Itachi.</i>

204
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,179
{\an1}<i>Sasori.</i>

205
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,182
{\an1}<i>Deidara.</i>

206
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,018
{\an1}<i>Kakuzu.</i>

207
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,988
{\an1}<i>And Nagato. </i>

208
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:23,131
{\an7}They're all stalwart
warriors. Also... They're
not the only pawns that I
possess.

209
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,670
And in return...?

210
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,540
Sasuke Uchiha.

211
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:34,683
{\an1}What are you plotting?

212
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,120
{\an1}Nothing in particular...

213
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:41,627
{\an1}I'm just interested in
finding the pure truth
behind ninjutsu.

214
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,935
{\an1}Sasuke is merely
necessary for part
of my research.

215
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:50,006
{\an1}I need a young, living
Uchiha specimen.

216
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,213
{\an1}And if I refuse?

217
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,620
{\an1}Summoning Jutsu:
Reanimation

218
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,241
{\an1}Th- That's-!

219
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:15,916
Surely you didn't think
that I'd come unprepared
to a meeting with you?

220
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,354
See? You cannot refuse
me.

221
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:23,394
{\an1}Why you-- where
did you get that?!

222
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,297
{\an1}Oh, I have
my means.

223
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,370
{\an7}But don't worry. I
haven't told anyone
else about this.

224
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,250
[chuckling]

225
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,153
{\an7}Did I say something
funny?

226
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:47,399
{\an7}Kabuto Yakushi. I never
imagined that you would
become such a...
formidable vessel.

227
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:51,238
Quarreling with you now
would only lower my
battle strength.

228
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:57,080
You came here at the
perfect opportunity. You
are very clever.

229
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:59,150
{\an1}So what's your answer?

230
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:02,188
{\an1}Very well. We'll join
forces.

231
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:07,163
{\an4}But I'll only hand over
Sasuke after you've both
completed your roles in
the war.

232
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:10,401
{\an1}Until then, you
can't even see
him.

233
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,106
{\an1}You comprehend quickly.

234
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,879
{\an1}As expected from Madara.
Your vessel's unique.

235
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,215
{\an1}And you're insolent.

236
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:25,727
{\an4}I'll reformulate my
strategy after I confirm
your battle strength.
Come along.

237
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,297
[chuckling]

238
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,986
{\an1}He left corpses lying
around this remote area?

239
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:47,293
{\an8}Judging by how these
bodies are strewn about,
I'll bet there's
something up ahead.

240
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,335
{\an1}Originally I thought this
chase would lead through
the Hidden Waterfall

241
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,338
{\an1}<i>then back to the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf.</i>

242
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,581
{\an7}<i>But this... It's like he</i>
<i>wants us to follow him.</i>
<i>I don't get it. </i>

243
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,185
It could be a trap.

244
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:04,555
{\an1}What's the plan?

245
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:05,523
{\an3}Uh!

246
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,494
Tokuma! Two o'clock.
Byakugan.

247
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,195
{\an1}Right!

248
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:10,799
{\an1}Byakugan!

249
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:27,291
{\an1}Captain Mitarashi!
It's--

250
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,560
What is it?

251
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:32,699
{\an1}Kabuto isn't alone! He's
with a masked member of
the Akatsuki!

252
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,838
{\an1}It looks like they're
going into some kind of
underground entrance!

253
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,407
{\an1}Are you sure?!

254
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,281
{\an1}Wait, a masked Akatsuki?!
Could it be he's the one who
claims to be Madara?!

255
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:45,120
Does this mean we
finally found his hideout?!

256
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:49,359
{\an7}But why are he and Kabuto
together? Are those two
allies?

257
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:53,398
{\an7}Wait a minute. Could it
be possible that Kabuto
deliberately led us here?

258
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:56,403
{\an1}In order to show us
where Madara's hideout
is?

259
00:20:56,437 --> 00:21:00,376
{\an7}But why? If they've
joined forces, why betray
him?

260
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,180
{\an1}I don't know just yet.

261
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:05,819
{\an1}But we need to notify the
village right away!

262
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,571
{\an4}<i>Hide them away? Naruto</i>
<i>and Bee can lend battle</i>
<i>strength! Why hide them</i>
<i>away? </i>

263
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:06,477
{\an1}<i>The Five Great Nation's</i>
<i>aim in this war is to</i>
<i>protect those two. </i>

264
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,685
{\an1}<i>Your sole dissent as</i>
<i>Hokage is not enough.</i>
<i>Majority will rule. </i>

265
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,723
{\an1}<i>Listen, you stripling!</i>
<i>Naruto is- </i>

266
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:16,059
{\an1}<i>I know him quite well.</i>

<i>Shippuden: The Five</i>
<i>Kage's Decision. </i>

268
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:22,503
{\an1}<i>All right! Fine!</i>
