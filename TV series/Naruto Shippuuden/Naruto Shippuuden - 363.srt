1
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,844
{\an1}Whoa! Is that thing the--?!

2
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:58,745
That's--!

3
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,446
No mistake.

4
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,381
[gasping]

5
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,759
[grunting]

6
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,197
Yeah...

7
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:22,832
That's him!

8
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:29,537
[roaring]

9
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:31,372
Ten Tails!

10
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,379
[angry roaring]

11
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,621
{\an1}But I thought the statue's
evil chakra had disappeared!

12
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,290
{\an1}[growl] They got us!

13
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:56,260
{\an1}He doesn't have those kinds
of emotions or feelings!

14
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:58,628
{\an1}He can't be sensed.

15
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,364
{\an1}He's natural energy itself,
the same as that which

16
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,934
{\an1}circulates around this
world, that you can

17
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,204
{\an1}feel in the soil,
water, and air.

18
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,339
{\an1}It would be a different
story if you tried it while

19
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:15,076
engaged in Sage
Mode, though.

20
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,277
Right, gotcha!

21
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,912
{\an1}Well then, if you say
he's all Nature Energy

22
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:21,881
then I can check
him out if I do this!

23
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:26,219
{\an1}Forget it, Naruto. If
you try to do that...

24
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:32,623
{\an1}...all you'll see is
how immeasurable it is.

25
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:35,860
[chuckle]

26
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,228
{\an1}You're not kidding!

27
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,666
{\an1}I had planned to capture
those two before the Ten

28
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,338
{\an1}Tails fully revived, but
they're surprisingly good.

29
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,773
{\an1}I want to start the Infinite
Tsukuyomi Ritual now.

30
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,575
{\an1}That massive genjutsu
requires time

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,011
{\an1}to summon the moon.

32
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,780
{\an1}They'll interfere with
the jutsu. It'll go more

33
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,849
{\an1}smoothly if we use
the Statue's power to

34
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,516
{\an1}get rid of them first.

35
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,719
Don't you agree?

36
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,755
{\an1}Madara, you just want
to test out Ten Tails'

37
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:12,324
{\an1}power, don't you?

38
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:14,491
That's why you--

39
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,760
{\an1}You're just like a child.

40
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,263
{\an1}Nope. You're Wrong.

41
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,798
{\an1}Children are impatient,
touchy fools, nothing more.

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,303
[angry roar]

43
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,073
Hey, here comes
a big one.

44
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,342
You really think
we can do this?

45
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,777
{\an1}Don't think you can hide
under your tentacles 'cause

46
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,048
{\an1}you're scared! But
first, hand Guy over!

47
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,785
{\an1}I can heal him up later on.
And Kakashi and Naruto, too!

48
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,053
Yeah!

49
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,087
Heads up!

50
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,589
[grunting]

51
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:57,527
{\an1}Listen up. First, we
keep our distance and

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,663
{\an1}see what move he makes!

53
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,731
{\an1}We'll counter it and
hit him with a big blow

54
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:04,067
{\an1}as close as we can get.

55
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,269
{\an1}Like I said earlier.

56
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:09,305
{\an1}Nine Tails, you're
acting like a captain.

57
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,673
{\an1}Huh?! Got a problem
with that?!

58
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:14,343
Nope! In fact, I
feel kinda happy!

59
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,710
[chuckle]

60
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:23,016
{\an1}Save that line for after
we've won! Let's go!

61
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,254
Huh?

62
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,392
[angry roar]

63
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,299
<i>Man, he's fast!</i>

64
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,100
{\an1}<i>There was no time</i>
<i>to see his moves!</i>

65
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,302
<i>Damn it!</i>

66
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,108
[angry roar]

67
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:58,913
[charging roars]

68
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,581
[growl]

69
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:07,519
[defiant roar]

70
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:10,322
Go now, Eight-o!

71
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,298
{\an1}Tailed Beast Bomb Barrage!

72
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,534
There's no real
need to dodge them.

73
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,903
{\an1}I'd like to preserve
Ten Tails' power as

74
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,271
much as we can.

75
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,144
This is...

76
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:37,778
...not good!

77
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,666
It's on you now!

78
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:19,414
Persistant, I'll
give them that.

79
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,283
Listen, Naruto,
don't tell me--

80
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,651
{\an1}Bushier Brow Sensei,
don't worry.

81
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:29,389
{\an1}Nice control, Naruto!

82
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,958
You got them in
nice and close!

83
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,529
<i>We focused too</i>
<i>much on the Ten Tails.</i>

84
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,797
{\an1}I'm sorry about that
leg, but here we go!

85
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:41,865
Kamui!

86
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,102
Yeah!

87
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:47,438
{\an1}To our enemies it may
appear that we left one

88
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:49,872
{\an1}octopus leg behind, but...

89
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,706
{\an1}Bee! Eight Tails!

90
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:55,210
{\an1}Operation Octopus Pot!
Sorry for the sneaky plot!

91
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,449
{\an1}I'm smashing this
right into his eyeball!

92
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,717
Get him!

93
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,158
[gasps]

94
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,959
[groaning]

95
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,129
{\an1}Two flies are buzzing
above us too.

96
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,132
[grunt]

97
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,734
{\an1}Ten Tails' tail?!

98
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:26,369
Naruto!

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,442
[grunting]

100
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:42,716
{\an1}<i>Naruto, you really</i>
<i>are a lot like me.</i>

101
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,552
[grunt]

102
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:49,556
{\an1}<i>That's right. You're</i>
<i>merely younger than me.</i>

103
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,290
<i>Eventually...</i>

104
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>Eight-O and</i>
<i>Octopop, forgive me!</i>

105
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,870
{\an1}Just another Shadow Clone.

106
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:17,312
[grunt]

107
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:20,616
[painful grunt]

108
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:41,199
{\an1}Kurama! How could you fall
apart at a time like this?!

109
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:45,035
{\an1}That was eight minutes,
it's longer than before,

110
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,504
{\an1}but that's the limit.

111
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,872
{\an1}I have to infuse and
build up my chakra.

112
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,376
I guess that we
have no choice.

113
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,713
That hurt!
Fool, ya fool!

114
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:04,118
{\an1}Bee! I need to rest,
too. I'm also at my limit.

115
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:08,122
So I can't get
healed yet?

116
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:10,558
{\an1}Pulling something as massive
as Eight Tails in and out

117
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,059
{\an1}sure comes with a
correspondingly

118
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:16,094
large cost. I'm
drained already.

119
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:20,798
{\an1}Seems the Eight and
Nine Tails have run

120
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,267
{\an1}out of chakra for now.

121
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,212
{\an1}Your favorite, Shadow
Clone Jutsu? It's forbidden

122
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,379
{\an1}high-level ninjutsu,
but upping the

123
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:38,681
{\an1}number of losers won't-

124
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,149
I'm not a loser!

125
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,218
{\an1}Don't, Naruto! It's
meaningless to create Shadow

126
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,086
{\an1}Clones that'll split
up your chakra even

127
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,188
{\an1}more. They might be useful
as diversions but not for

128
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,524
decisive hits.

129
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,926
{\an1}And if you go down
we'll lose this war.

130
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,862
{\an1}You were always just
a motley crew anyway.

131
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:01,967
Huh?! We're a
m-m-m- motley wha?

132
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,237
{\an1}You are pathetic.

133
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,739
{\an1}He's saying it's pointless
to merely increase the

134
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,342
{\an1}number of heads if
all of them are empty.

135
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:16,778
{\an1}You and I are both
powerless shinobi. You...

136
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,551
{\an1}No, everyone, actually...

137
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,387
{\an1}...shall eventually
just end up like me.

138
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,658
{\an1}There's no way that I'll
ever end up like you!

139
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,727
{\an1}How many times do I
haveta say it?!

140
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,295
My dream is to
become the Hokage!

141
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,564
{\an1}You needn't worry.

142
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:40,099
Everything will
go as planned.

143
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,602
{\an1}No jutsu is mightier than
the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

144
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,538
{\an1}I'll make you Hokage
inside this jutsu.

145
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:54,244
{\an1}So just disappear along
with the rest of the world!

146
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,322
[gasps]

147
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:38,615
What the--?!

148
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,719
He missed?!
Deliberately?!

149
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:48,790
About time!

150
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,391
Kakashi! Guy!

151
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,259
{\an1}Sorry we're late!

152
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,395
{\an1}I can't believe he shook off
my Byakugan-aided, spot-on

153
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:58,030
Mind Transfer in
just two seconds!

154
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:00,900
{\an1}You still managed to shift
that big thing's aim off.

155
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,601
So good work!

156
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,102
Naruto, are you
doing okay?

157
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,036
Yeah!

158
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,372
{\an1}Just because Hinata's here
doesn't mean you have

159
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,039
{\an1}to act tough, Naruto!

160
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:11,576
{\an1}Beetle Jamming Jutsu!

161
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,313
{\an1}Hidden Mist Jutsu!

162
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,488
{\an1}We're here, Naruto!

163
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:30,057
{\an1}All right, good! We won't be
so easily detectable now.

164
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,059
Lord Bee! You're
in way better shape

165
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,227
than I expected!

166
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,096
{\an1}Lord Bee! You look
seriously wounded!

167
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,465
{\an1}You know what, Omoi?
You worry too much!

168
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,166
{\an1}Guy Sensei, do not tell me
you unleashed the Hirudora?!

169
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,034
Lee!

170
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,636
{\an1}I'm sorry we're late,
Captain Kakashi.

171
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,772
{\an1}Sakura, first of all!

172
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,206
Yeah, I know!

173
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,079
{\an1}The Sensory Water
Sphere won't maintain its

174
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:58,382
{\an1}original shape. We better--!

175
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,685
{\an1}Inoichi! Ao! Confirm
the situation!

176
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:03,753
-Roger!
-Okay!

177
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:08,390
{\an1}First Company has
arrived on the scene!

178
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,725
Second Company
has also arrived!

179
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,160
{\an1}Third Company has arrived!

180
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,596
{\an1}Fourth Company has arrived!

181
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,831
{\an1}Fifth Company has arrived!

182
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,899
The Medical
Unit's here, too!

183
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,335
Sensory Unit's
arrived as well!

184
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:25,137
{\an1}You call that hiding?

185
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,745
Wind Style! Art
of the Gust Blade!

186
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:47,356
{\an1}You see? Were not a
motley crew anymore!

187
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,626
{\an1}We brought something with
us. It's called the Allied

188
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,760
{\an1}Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

189
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:55,228
{\an1}The world's greatest, most
invincible, super-duper

190
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,063
{\an1}ninjutsu, y'know!

191
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,333
{\an1}A jutsu that trumps
the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

192
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,568
Remember that!

193
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,470
{\an1}The Allied Shinobi
Forces Jutsu?

194
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,639
Isn't that a
bit of a stretch?

195
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,474
{\an1}We're gonna stop the both
of you with this jutsu!

196
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:13,143
{\an1}You're wrong. Why won't you
realize that it's completely

197
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,512
meaningless for
you to stop us here?

198
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,549
{\an1}This jutsu of yours will
crumble to dust after the

199
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:20,918
{\an1}war. Then someone
on your side will

200
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,921
{\an1}eventually attempt what
we're doing anyway.

201
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,389
{\an1}There is no victory,
no matter how

202
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,390
{\an1}much you struggle.

203
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,994
Get it through
your head, already.

204
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,397
{\an1}Hope doesn't exist
in this world!

205
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,768
{\an1}So what? I don't care!

206
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,003
{\an1}I'm gonna say it does!

207
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,677
{\an1}It is pointless to argue if
there is or isn't something

208
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,879
{\an1}during war. How 'bout
we just settle this thing?

209
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,114
{\an1}When there's a difference of
opinion, you usually go by

210
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,984
{\an1}majority rule, don't you?

211
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:02,486
Well?

212
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,621
{\an1}Good idea. Okay...

213
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:09,692
{\an1}We'll call it after we've
erased all of you. And...

214
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,795
{\an1}I guess I should've
expected that. But...

215
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:23,269
This world...

216
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,508
{\an1}-Is going to end!
-Is not gonna end!

217
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,675
{\an1}Let's go, everybody!

218
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,177
{\an1}This is the final
deciding battle!

219
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,580

{\an1}<i>Good job on buying</i>
<i>us some time, Naruto.</i>

222
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,088
{\an1}Was it enough time to
come up with a strategy?

223
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:48,390
{\an1}<i>Thanks to you, I'll be able</i>

<i>time to be shocked.</i>

226
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,998
{\an1}<i>For this fight, we need to</i>
<i>take and maintain the upper</i>

<i>any chance to counter!</i>

228

{\an1}<i>Our intel shows that our</i>
<i>enemy boasts impressive eyes.</i>

229
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,773
{\an1}<i>So first we'll impede</i>
<i>their movement by</i>

230
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:08,507
{\an1}<i>destroying their vision.</i>

{\an1}Ah, their true aim
is to blind Ten Tails!

237
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,370
{\an1}<i>With the two jutsu from</i>

245

{\an1}<i>And since their sheer bulk</i>
<i>prevents them from hiding,</i>

{\an1}<i>Like father like son!</i>

252

{\an1}This will make it

{\an1}We'll just mow them down
