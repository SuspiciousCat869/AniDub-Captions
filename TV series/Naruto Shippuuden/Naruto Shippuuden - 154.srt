[theme music]

2
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,228
{\an1}-In the beginning,
Jiraiya boy's only goal

3
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,196
{\an1}was to gather intelligence.

4
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,965
{\an1}It appears that he never
intended to battle Pain,

5
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:15,069
{\an1}but Pain's abilities far
exceeded his imagination.

6
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:17,937
{\an1}And without knowing the
extent of his powers,

7
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,872
{\an1}no one could defeat
Pain, no matter

8
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,107
{\an1}how many times they fought.

9
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:25,308
{\an1}Jiraiya boy pushed himself
beyond his own limits,

10
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,378
{\an1}and he almost managed
to uncover the secrets

11
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,445
{\an1}that Pain was hiding.

12
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,514
{\an1}No one buy Jiraiya boy
could have gotten this far.

13
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:35,016
I'm sure of it.

14
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,684
{\an1}He could have gotten
away if he wanted to.

15
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,885
{\an1}Instead, he sacrificed
his life so he

16
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,954
could leave us
this coded message.

17
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:44,656
{\an1}He bequeathed the
future to all of you.

18
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:49,458
-All right.

19
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,127
{\an1}This frog that I'm
giving to you supposedly

20
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,762
{\an1}contains a captured
Hidden Rain ninja.

21
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,728
-Yes.

22
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:57,530
I received prior
notice from Jiraiya.

23
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:58,431
All right.

24
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,599
{\an1}Expand to full size.

25
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,270
-And be as rough
as you need to be.

26
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:08,838
{\an1}Get everything out of him.

27
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,140
{\an1}-Oh, I intend to.

28
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:16,777
{\an1}-This is one of the three
crucial sources of data

29
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,979
{\an1}that Jiraiya left us.

30
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:22,180
{\an1}We have to discover all its
secrets, no matter what.

31
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:22,881
-Right.

32
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:23,815
-OK.

33
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:24,481
Let's begin.

34
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,386
{\an1}-You've been really
quiet for a while.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,854
{\an1}Do you notice anything?

36
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:33,354
-Uh--

37
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:39,258
{\an1}-I talked to Lady Tsunade
and Kakashi-sensei.

38
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,759
{\an1}They had no clue.

39
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,929
{\an1}So I'm guessing that Jiraiya
wrote this message specifically

40
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,295
{\an1}with you in mind.

41
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,165
{\an1}No, I'm positive he did.

42
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:48,398
I'm sure.

43
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,866
{\an1}There's just got to
be something there.

44
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,102
{\an1}-Please, tell us anything
that comes into your mind.

45
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,436
Anything at all.

46
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,603
{\an1}It's not like we're asking
you to instantly decode

47
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,104
the message.

48
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,674
{\an1}-There is one thing that's been
bothering me since I saw it.

49
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,743
-What?

50
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,744
{\an1}-Well, there are all
those numbers, right?

51
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:10,113
{\an1}So why is there one katakana
letter among all of them?

52
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:10,880
-Huh?

53
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,414
{\an1}-Katakana letter?

54
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,348
{\an1}-Where do you see that?

55
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:14,882
-See?

56
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,151
Right here.

57
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,552
{\an1}-What are you talking about?

58
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:20,419
{\an1}Isn't that just the number nine?

59
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:23,155
{\an1}-That's what I thought
at first, but no.

60
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,255
Look again.

61
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,091
{\an1}It's not a number at all.

62
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:28,392
{\an1}It's the katakana
letter for the sound ta.

63
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,560
SHIHO: What?

64
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,562
{\an1}-Well, yeah, I suppose that you
could interpret it that way,

65
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,629
{\an1}but it's still a big stretch.

66
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:38,099
{\an1}SHIHO (VOICEOVER): Maybe--

67
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,300
{\an1}-Frankly, Naruto,
what makes you think

68
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,169
{\an1}that it's the katakana letter
ta instead of the number nine,

69
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:44,402
anyway?

70
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:47,605
{\an1}-Well, you know Pervy
Sage, always writing books.

71
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,609
I mean, he was a
writer, after all.

72
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,377
And I traveled
all over with him.

73
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,080
{\an1}Wherever we went, he always made
me read his handwritten drafts,

74
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,115
{\an1}and asked me what I
thought about them.

75
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,548
{\an1}They were really boring, though.

76
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:08,953
Huh?

77
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,386
What's this?

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:20,627
{\an1}What's nine "kitticks?"

79
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,497
{\an1}Anyway, each time he used the
letter ta, it was hard to read,

80
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,031
{\an1}because whenever I saw it, it
looked like the number nine

81
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:27,799
to me.

82
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:29,366
{\an1}-It's a penmanship quirk.

83
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,768
{\an1}-So it was a habit, then.

84
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,138
Like so.

85
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:39,240
{\an1}When Lord Jiraiya wrote
the katakana letter ta,

86
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,176
{\an1}he had a habit of drawing the
first stroke shorter than most.

87
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,911
{\an1}So the first and third
strokes get connected.

88
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:48,213
{\an1}And since he rounds
his second stroke,

89
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,015
{\an1}the whole thing ends up
looking like the number nine.

90
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:54,750
-Found it.

91
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,051
Now, let's see.

92
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,887
{\an1}This is a sample of
Jiraiya's handwriting.

93
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:06,525
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: It's the same.

94
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,859
{\an1}-Jiraiya planned this.

95
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,293
{\an1}He knew that Naruto would
remember this idiosyncrasy

96
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:14,164
{\an1}of his that he wrote the
katakana ta like a nine.

97
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:16,932
{\an1}So frankly, that was the link
between Jiraiya and Naruto.

98
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,100
{\an1}We've finally figured it out.

99
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,002
{\an1}-What were you thinking, Naruto?

100
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:23,469
{\an1}Why didn't you mention such
an important thing sooner?

101
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:25,004
-What's the big
deal about knowing

102
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:26,638
{\an1}that it's the letter ta?

103
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:27,139
Sheesh.

104
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,876
Wait.

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,211
that's it.

106
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,712
{\an1}It was back when you were
reading Jiraiya's manuscripts.

107
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:38,880
That was it.

108
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,749
{\an1}That's when you found out
about his writing habit.

109
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:44,717
{\an1}The code must refer to
the book you were reading.

110
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,584
-Book?

111
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:46,418
-Yes.

112
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,386
{\an1}That's exactly right, Shikamaru.

113
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,654
It must be.

114
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,822
{\an1}I believe that more clues
must be hidden somewhere

115
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:54,090
{\an1}inside his writings, as well.

116
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:56,592
{\an1}The numbers in the code
probably represent a word order

117
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,561
{\an1}or number of lines, or--
or even page numbers.

118
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:01,929
{\an1}it's got to be related
to the encryption key.

119
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,131
{\an1}-Naruto, which book
were you reading?

120
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,533
{\an1}-Uh, Make Out something.

121
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,135
What was it?

122
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,636
{\an1}-OK, then just tell me how
many of Jiraiya's books

123
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,803
{\an1}have been published.

124
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:17,506
{\an1}-I'm not sure, but
four or five, maybe?

125
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:18,173
-Good.

126
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:19,174
{\an1}That's not too many.

127
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,675
{\an1}We'll just have to
check all of them.

128
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,442
{\an1}KAKAHI: It's probably this one.

129
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,080
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: Make Out Tactics!

130
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,614
Ta!

131
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,615
-Kakashi-sensei!

132
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,383
-It's been on my
mind, so I decided

133
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,585
to pop in when I
overheard your voices.

134
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,452
{\an1}I think I caught most of it.

135
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:40,956
{\an1}I'm pretty sure this is the
book you're looking for.

136
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,290
{\an1}-Make Out Tactics.

137
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,390
{\an1}Yeah, that's right.

138
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,859
That's the same
one that Pervy Sage

139
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:49,061
{\an1}was working on all the time
during our training together.

140
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,262
-Of course.

141
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,030
{\an1}That's something else only
Naruto would have known.

142
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:56,967
{\an1}Just as I thought, Lord Jiraiya
did pass the key to Naruto.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,234
-Mm-hm.

144
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,035
{\an1}-This ta is the first
character in the code.

145
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,503
{\an1}Of all Jiraiya's books,
this is the only title

146
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:05,571
{\an1}with a word that begins with ta.

147
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,174
{\an1}-When a character from a
book is used in a code,

148
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,976
{\an1}it could signify word
placement or line number,

149
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,476
{\an1}but the first line
of investigation

150
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,577
{\an1}should always be page numbers.

151
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,146
So, the numbers
separated by a comma

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,583
{\an1}are 31, 8, 106, 7, 207, and 15.

153
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:26,518
{\an1}Meaning six pages
worth of information.

154
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:28,355
{\an1}Let's start with page 31.

155
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:30,788
{\an1}So please, flip to page 31.

156
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,790
-Page 31.

157
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,192
OK, here it is.

158
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,592
{\an1}What do we do next?

159
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,728
{\an1}-First, we look at
what the first letter

160
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,096
{\an1}or word on that page is.

161
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,998
{\an1}Please, read the first
sentence out loud.

162
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,866
-What?

163
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,737
{\an1}Uh-- ah-- um-- ahem.

164
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,603
No.

165
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:54,105
I mean, uh--

166
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:56,106
{\an1}-Look, what is the problem?

167
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:57,774
{\an1}Just hurry up and
read it, already!

168
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:06,680
{\an1}Come on, spit it out, would ya?

169
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,214
-Really?

170
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:11,917
I-- love you.

171
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,824
-There.

172
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,860
{\an1}Now we have all six pages done.

173
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,193
-What's it say?

174
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,329
{\an1}If I read the first character
from each page of the book

175
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:35,966
{\an1}in order, the real
one's not among them.

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,800
{\an1}That's what it says.

177
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:41,603
{\an1}-And what does that mean?

178
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,004
{\an1}SHIKAMARU: No idea.

179
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:46,340
{\an1}-We ought to relay this to
Lord Fukasaku right away.

180
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,008
{\an1}Perhaps it will mean
something to him,

181
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,410
{\an1}since he fought Pain, too.

182
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:53,946
{\an1}-Then l go ask Lady Tsunade to
summon this Lord Fukasaku right

183
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:54,979
away.

184
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,646
{\an1}-May I come along
with you guys, too?

185
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,248
-Yeah.

186
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,682
{\an1}Please do, Shiho.

187
00:09:58,715 --> 00:09:59,115
-Great.

188
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,816
Thank you.

189
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,284
-Let's do this.

190
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,652
{\an1}We gotta tell grandma
Tsunade what we found out.

191
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:11,290
{\an1}-The real one's not among them.

192
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,993
{\an1}-Geezer Sage, what do you think?

193
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:19,129
{\an1}Does it make sense to you?

194
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,097
{\an1}JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Actually, none of those six

195
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,799
{\an1}really remind me of
Nagato all that much.

196
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,402
{\an1}And yet, a completely unrelated
Pain knew of a conversation

197
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:31,870
{\an1}that the Rinnegan bearing
Nagato and I shared alone.

198
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:33,973
{\an1}The faces are different,
but I definitely

199
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:36,975
{\an1}sense Nagato in them.

200
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,275
-I'm not sure.

201
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,810
it's still all
too unclear to me.

202
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:44,246
{\an1}-But you do have some
hypotheses, though, right?

203
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,981
{\an1}-I've already told
you absolutely

204
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,415
{\an1}everything I know about Pain.

205
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:51,184
{\an1}He seems to be able to
come back from the dead,

206
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,419
{\an1}so I hesitate to give
you mere conjectures.

207
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,054
{\an1}Under these conditions,
it's still mighty dangerous

208
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,222
to take him on.

209
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:01,257
We must first
uncover his secrets.

210
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,392
{\an1}How are the other
investigations going?

211
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,027
-The autopsy and
the interrogation?

212
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,394
-It looks like
they're both going

213
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:08,196
{\an1}to take a little bit longer.

214
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:10,063
{\an1}-Like how much longer?

215
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:11,164
{\an1}-I can't really say.

216
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,698
{\an1}I don't think that
they even know.

217
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:13,332
-What?

218
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,532
{\an1}What do you mean?

219
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,835
{\an1}While they're goofing
around, we're losing time.

220
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:20,636
{\an1}-Interrogation aside, an
autopsy requires detailed cell

221
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,206
{\an1}and tissue analysis, and
enzyme extraction. it all

222
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,440
{\an1}must be detailed.

223
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,441
Doing all those
things takes time.

224
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,943
{\an1}-It'll be a week at the
soonest before it's all done.

225
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:31,277
-That long?

226
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:35,047
{\an1}-Now, now, Naruto, you don't
have to be so disappointed.

227
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,083
{\an1}-So what should we do in the
meantime, then, Lady Tsunade?

228
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,418
{\an1}-Shizune is heading
up the autopsy,

229
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,386
so it should be
quicker than usual.

230
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,520
But we'll still
just have to wait.

231
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:46,287
-No.

232
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,788
{\an1}I'll go make 'em speed up.

233
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,023
-Naruto.

234
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,524
{\an1}If you get in Shizune's way,
you are so gonna get it.

235
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,594
{\an1}-I will avenge Pervy Sage.

236
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:05,200
{\an1}I can't just sit around
here doing nothing.

237
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,269
{\an1}-But listen, Naruto boy.

238
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,569
{\an1}Now that we've deciphered
the coded message,

239
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,705
{\an1}there's nothing else going on
that involves you right now.

240
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:13,639
{\an1}-So what about it?

241
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:15,441
{\an1}What are you trying to say?

242
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:19,877
{\an1}-You're definitely not strong
enough to defeat Pain yet.

243
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,111
{\an1}-What did you say?

244
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:22,712
{\an1}-You know I'm right.

245
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,981
Even Jiraiya boy
couldn't defeat him.

246
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:27,449
{\an1}And if he couldn't,
you think you could?

247
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:31,052
{\an1}-Well-- guess not.

248
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,819
-If you were to
fight him now, you

249
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,355
would merely die
a senseless death.

250
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,688
-So what are you
saying, Geezer Sage?

251
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:41,024
{\an1}I should just totally forget
about avenging the Pervy Sage?

252
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,193
{\an1}-I said no such thing.

253
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:46,095
{\an1}Being asked to come here
was quite opportune.

254
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,630
{\an1}You see, for a long
time I'd been planning

255
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:51,632
{\an1}on coming to speak
with you, Naruto boy.

256
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:52,999
-Huh?

257
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:56,502
{\an1}-Tell me, then, do you want to
come and train in Sage Jutsu

258
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:57,969
{\an1}under my guidance?

259
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,870
{\an1}-Train in Sage Jutsu?

260
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,138
{\an1}KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I see.

261
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,273
{\an1}Naruto learning sage jutsu.

262
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,307
Good plan.

263
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,708
-Is Sage Jutsu
really that awesome?

264
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,077
-Yes.

265
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,710
{\an1}Jiraiya was the only one capable
of using it in this village.

266
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,246
{\an1}-And remember, Pain
defeated Jiraiya,

267
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,215
{\an1}who had summoned Lord
Fukasaku and Lady Shima.

268
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,284
{\an1}That means that at
this point, there's

269
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:20,251
{\an1}not one person from
the Hidden Leaf Village

270
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:24,020
{\an1}who could possibly defeat Pain.

271
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,090
{\an1}-I'm as furious as you.

272
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:32,259
{\an1}I too want to avenge the death
of my student, Jiraiya boy.

273
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:36,296
{\an1}I believe that the only one
who can do is you, Naruto boy.

274
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:36,795
-What?

275
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:37,930
Me?

276
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,264
{\an1}-You do want to avenge
Jiraiya boy, don't you?

277
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,300
{\an1}-You better believe I do.

278
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,034
{\an1}-Then come along with me now.

279
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,135
{\an1}I'll teach you Sage Jutsu at Mt.

280
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,369
Myoboku.

281
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,871
{\an1}The same way I hammered
it into Jiraiya boy,

282
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:52,373
{\an1}I'll hammer it into
you, if that's OK.

283
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,974
{\an1}-Will it let me win?

284
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,242
{\an1}Could I stop pain?

285
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,876
-No guarantees.

286
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,345
{\an1}It all depends on
you, Naruto boy.

287
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,580
{\an1}Are you all right with this?

288
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:03,613
-Yes, of course.

289
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,482
{\an1}Naruto, go with him.

290
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:09,585
{\an1}-I warn you, Sage Jutsu training
is unbelievably rigorous.

291
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,685
You ready?

292
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,354
{\an1}-If Pervy Sage was
able to master it,

293
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,821
{\an1}then I'll give it
my best shot, too.

294
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,756
Count me in.

295
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,558
{\an1}FUKASAKU (VOICEOVER):
An entrusted student.

296
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,327
{\an1}The child of prophecy.

297
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,260
{\an1}FUKASAKU: Nicely said.

298
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,700
{\an1}We should be moseying along now.

299
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,068
So, Naruto boy,
say your goodbyes.

300
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:35,668
-All right.

301
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,703
I'm off, guys.

302
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:39,571
{\an1}Shikamaru, take care
that code for me.

303
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:41,806
{\an1}-Don't you worry about us.

304
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,442
{\an1}-If our investigation uncovers
anything, I'll send word.

305
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,843
I will leave a
messenger frog with you.

306
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:51,146
{\an1}Send him to me if
anything happens.

307
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:51,980
-Right.

308
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:54,815
{\an1}-Well then, good luck, Naruto.

309
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:55,916
-Thanks.

310
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:56,583
All right.

311
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:57,950
Now, let's go.

312
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,654
{\an1}You guys know where Mt.

313
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,788
Myoboku is?

314
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,023
'Cause I don't.

315
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,657
{\an1}-He's supposed to save us?

316
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,758
{\an1}We're all doomed.

317
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,959
{\an1}-It takes a month to
get there on foot.

318
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:14,028
It's also known
as maze Mountain ,

319
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,962
{\an1}because if you don't
know the secret route,

320
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:19,265
{\an1}you won't be able to get there.

321
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:22,367
{\an1}-Why does this place have
to be so hard to reach?

322
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,568
{\an1}-Wait, Naruto boy.

323
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,869
{\an1}You already signed a binding
contract with the toads.

324
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,605
{\an1}There's no need to worry, son.

325
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:33,375
-Hey.

326
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:34,742
That's the--

327
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:39,045
{\an1}-I'll just be borrowing
this boy, then.

328
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,746
{\an1}-Please take care of him.

329
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:41,813
-Hold on.

330
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,549
{\an1}What do you mean there's
no need to worry?

331
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,283
-He's gone.

332
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,284
{\an1}-It's a reverse summoning.

333
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,684
-What?

334
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,654
{\an1}-Good luck on your end
of things, as well.

335
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,424
-Now then, let's
concentrate on figuring out

336
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,126
{\an1}the information Jiraiya left us.

337
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,926
-Roger that.

338
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,498
{\an1}TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): The fact
that the Great Lord Elder

339
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,567
{\an1}prophesied Jiraiya
writing those books

340
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,968
{\an1}may have been intended to
enable him to eventually leave

341
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:17,638
{\an1}the encrypted message, meaning
that the prophecy may be real.

342
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:22,608
{\an1}In which case Naruto Uzumaki
truly is the child of prophecy.

343
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:36,784
-Where am I?

344
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:39,485
No way.

345
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,688
{\an1}Geezer Sage, where are we?

346
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,455
{\an1}-We are in the Land of Toads.

347
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,256
-Land of Toads?

348
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,624
-Naruto!

349
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:47,391
Hey!

350
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,459
-Gamakichi.

351
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,659
-Yeah.

352
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,528
{\an1}I was the one who summoned
you here to this place.

353
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,661
Welcome.

354
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:53,962
-Oh, I get it.

355
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,230
{\an1}That's how I got here.

356
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:58,031
-Before we begin
training, we must eat.

357
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:00,132
Come along.

358
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,033
-Huh?

359
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:01,534
Food?

360
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,805
-All right!

361
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:08,938
{\an1}Now eat your fill.

362
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:12,242
{\an1}I've put extra effort
into making this meal.

363
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,042
{\an1}Now now, don't be shy.

364
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,110
{\an1}Try the caterpillars.

365
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:17,378
{\an1}They're delicious.

366
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,580
{\an1}-Uh-- thank you, ma'am.

367
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,298
[groan]

368
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:56,771
{\an1}-Ma will have a fit if
she sees you like this.

369
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:57,804
-Hey, look.

370
00:17:57,838 --> 00:17:59,574
{\an1}I forced all that
food down, didn't I?

371
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,808
{\an1}-Wel, if you're hungry enough,
your belly won't be so choosy.

372
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,776
{\an1}I'm sure you'll get used
to it sooner or later.

373
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,177
{\an1}NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I'll probably

374
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,346
be dead before
that ever happens.

375
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,081
{\an1}-Snap out of it. your
training starts now.

376
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:12,582
-Right.

377
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:13,549
Yes, sir.

378
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,384
-First of all, I
must explain to you

379
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,818
{\an1}that what I'm about the
teach you is not ninjutsu,

380
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,053
but Sage Jutsu.

381
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,588
{\an1}And there's a big
difference between them.

382
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,123
-So what is it?

383
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,490
-Listen.

384
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:28,092
{\an1}As opposed to ninjutsu, where
you utilize internal energy,

385
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:31,662
{\an1}Sage Jutsu involves making
use of outside energy.

386
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,562
-Outside?

387
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,297
{\an1}What does that mean?

388
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,264
-As you probably
know, the way one

389
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:39,099
{\an1}performs ninjutsu is
by manipulating chakra

390
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,800
that is created
from mixing one's

391
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,536
{\an1}mental and physical
energies together.

392
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:47,072
{\an1}Now, with Sage Jutsu, it
involves taking all of that

393
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,141
{\an1}internally generated
chakra and adding to it

394
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:53,109
{\an1}nature energy from
the outside, resulting

395
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:55,577
{\an1}in an even more powerful chakra.

396
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:58,346
{\an1}And that leads to all
your ninjutsu, genjutsu,

397
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:03,283
{\an1}and even your taijutsu getting
a really serious power boost.

398
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:06,519
{\an1}Mental energy and physical
energy from within you,

399
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:09,421
{\an1}and nature energy
from the outside.

400
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,188
{\an1}The jutsu and other
techniques that

401
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:14,090
{\an1}are born from the chakra created
when these three energies are

402
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,526
{\an1}mixed together are
called Sage Jutsu.

403
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,795
-Hm.

404
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,128
-Or to put it in
other words, it's

405
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,431
{\an1}like how adding a mint swirl
to chocolate and vanilla

406
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,398
{\an1}soft serve makes it
even more delicious.

407
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,032
{\an1}Know what I mean?

408
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,234
{\an1}FUKASAKU: Quit confusing
him more, Gamakichi.

409
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:30,802
-Oh!

410
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,202
I get it now.

411
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,738
-It took that to
make you understand?

412
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:35,672
-Yep.

413
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,105
That's just the
kind of guy he is.

414
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:39,407
{\an1}-But back to this whole
nature energy thing.

415
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:41,576
{\an1}What is that all about, exactly?

416
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,677
{\an1}-Energy that is external to you.

417
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:47,946
{\an1}The energy that exists in the
atmosphere and in the terrain.

418
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,748
{\an1}-Atmosphere and terrain.

419
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:51,649
Huh.

420
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,150
{\an1}-By that he means in
the air and ground.

421
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:54,883
-Oh.

422
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,151
Now I see.

423
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:56,919
[groan]

424
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:57,986
-Enough talk.

425
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,921
Let me just show
you what I mean.

426
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,058
{\an1}This should be good enough.

427
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,300
-Wow.

428
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,034
{\an1}Lord Fukasaku's amazing.

429
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,570
{\an1}Look at him gather all
of that nature energy.

430
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:23,504
-Eh?

431
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:24,204
But where?

432
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,538
I don't--

433
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,039
-Whoa.

434
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:36,912
{\an1}-He-- he lifted that thing?

435
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:37,646
-Well, son?

436
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,548
{\an1}What do you think?

437
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:41,882
{\an1}What you're looking at
is the fearsome power

438
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:44,084
of nature energy
enhanced Sage Jutsu.

439
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:53,057
{\an1}-But-- I don't have any
idea how you just did that.

440
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,759
{\an1}Except that I saw
you weave a hand sign

441
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,059
{\an1}at the beginning of it.

442
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:58,994
{\an1}-Well, naturally you don't see.

443
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:04,931
{\an1}You're not yet able to sense
nature energy, Naruto boy.

444
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,300
{\an1}Nor can you take any of
it into yourself yet.

445
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,301
{\an1}-Then how do I do it?

446
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:16,774
{\an1}-What you must do is
become one with nature.

447
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,674
{\an1}-How do I do that?

448
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,942
{\an1}-Basically, he means that
you're gonna have to die.

449
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:22,444
-What?

Sage Jutsu training at Mt.

Myoboku.

454

from ninjutsu,

Naruto struggles
with the training.

-All right.

461
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:21,491
I can do this.
