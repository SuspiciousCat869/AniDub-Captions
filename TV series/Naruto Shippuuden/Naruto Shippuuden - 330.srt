1
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:10,386
Heave... ho!

2
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,290
{\an1}Did you hear Madara's back?

3
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,357
What?

4
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,659
{\an1}Yeah, rumor is that Madara
showed up on another
battlefield.

5
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:23,861
Madara?

6
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,229
{\an1}Well, we are at war with
him, so him showing

7
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,697
{\an1}up isn't really anything
unusual, is it?

8
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,198
{\an1}No, not him! I'm not talking
about that shady-looking
masked Madara.

9
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,933
{\an1}They're saying the
real one appeared!

10
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:38,669
{\an1}What?! The real one?! What
do you mean!? Are you saying
all this time the one behind

11
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,872
{\an1}all this has been a
fake or something?

12
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:45,106
{\an1}No, I mean someone new has
appeared, and he's super
strong, just like the real

13
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,308
{\an1}Madara Uchiha was
supposed to be!

14
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:50,878
{\an1}He's strong enough to
take on all Five Kage!

15
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:55,212
{\an1}Oh, come on! Take on the
Five Kage?! No way! Give
me a break!

16
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:58,148
{\an1}It's the truth! Really!
Listen, from what I've
heard...

17
00:04:58,448 --> 00:04:59,749
{\an1}...he hurled down
meteorites...

18
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,651
...and created a
jungle instantly!

19
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:06,253
{\an1}What's more, he's a giant,
tens of meters tall!

20
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,555
Giant?!

21
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,022
[laughter]

22
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:13,957
{\an1}Well, they're just
rumors, you know...

23
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,225
{\an1}That's enough, you
two, cut it out!

24
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,094
{\an1}It's true that the enemy's
numbers have dwindled
greatly...

25
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:23,230
{\an1}But we still need to hunt
down the ones that remain.
We're in a war here!

26
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,799
{\an1}So all of you need
to get serious!

27
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,767
Focus on the
enemy, right now!

28
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,934
{\an1}Right. I'm sorry...

29
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,135
{\an1}You're correct, of course.

30
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,004
{\an1}We weren't able to show what
we can really do during the
last battle...

31
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,006
{\an1}We'll have to make sure to
show them on the next time
around!

32
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,374
Good.

33
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,941
[gasp]

34
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,047
{\an1}I'll take the enemy on the
left! You dispatch any on
the right!

35
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,648
Roger!

36
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:53,148
Let's go!

37
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,183
Yeah!

38
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,387
{\an1}[confident chuckle]
Another one down!

39
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,022
{\an1}Hey, don't forget that I was
the one who got this guy!

40
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:06,957
{\an1}What? Are you really trying
to take all the credit?!

41
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,293
{\an1}Well, all you did was use
a little jutsu there at
the very end!

42
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:13,295
Huh?! Yeah, and
that's what did him in!

43
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,429
{\an1}All right, fine. I'll give
you that much...

44
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:20,232
{\an1}But still, catching one
weakling isn't anything
to brag about.

45
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:22,200
{\an1}That's true... [chuckle]

46
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,202
[angry yell]

47
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,302
{\an1}Eight Trigrams: Air Palm!

48
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,405
You both must be
more careful!

49
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:30,639
You all right?!

50
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,574
Yeah, because
you saved us!

51
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,708
{\an1}The big battles have ended;
if we were to get killed

52
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,410
{\an1}now, right when this
is almost over...

53
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:40,044
{\an1}We were just about to
be humiliated...

54
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,114
{\an1}The next battle to be fought
is going to be at the front
line.

55
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,254
{\an7}<i>The Five Kage are</i>
<i>holding back Madara...</i>

56
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,723
{\an7}<i>And sending Kakashi and</i>
<i>Guy on ahead seems to</i>
<i>have worked...</i>

57
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,059
{\an7}<i>But Naruto and the others on</i>
<i>the front line are under</i>
<i>pressure...</i>

58
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:06,862
{\an7}<i>Once the other battles wind</i>
<i>down, the combatants there</i>
<i>will rush to lend support...</i>

59
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,597
{\an1}Are you all right?!

60
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,132
{\an1}Yes... I'm so sorry...

61
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,702
{\an1}Compared to all of those
guys out there fighting on
the battlefield...

62
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,704
{\an1}I know that I have it really
easy here, but still...

63
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:24,672
{\an1}No... We have our own kind
of stress here that we
have to contend with.

64
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:26,273
Don't be so hard
on yourself!

65
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,307
{\an1}This is a critical time...

66
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,309
I'll be okay!

67
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,945
{\an1}All right, then. Thank
you for your help...

68
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,217
{\an1}Listen up, everyone!

69
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:47,988
{\an1}At this moment, the war is
entering its final stages!

70
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,121
{\an1}We're the central command
center for every company.

71
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:53,390
{\an1}We can't afford to make
a single mistake!

72
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,459
I can't tell you
not to overdo it.

73
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,894
{\an1}Please, hang in there
and do your best!

74
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,228
I beg you!

75
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,338
{\an1}There isn't a man in the
Sensory Unit who'd throw

76
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,773
{\an1}in the towel over
something like this.

77
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,140
Right, guys?!

78
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,909
That's right!

79
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,242
No way!

80
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,978
{\an1}Yeah! Me, either! We're
never going to quit!

81
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:28,712
{\an1}Right, Captain Inoichi?!

82
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,281
{\an1}Let's show 'em the
Communications Unit...

83
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,115
{\an1}...will persevere,
no matter what!

84
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,753
{\an1}Yes, you're right... but if
you get too tired, then I
can take over...

85
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,287
...so it's okay
to rest a bit--

86
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,756
Stop that! Don't
take it easy on us!

87
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,256
{\an1}Tell us to follow you
and give it our all!

88
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,292
{\an1}Boy, did you miss the point!

89
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:56,629
[laughter]

90
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,464
{\an1}I'm sorry... I'm not good
at that kind of stuff.

91
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,035
{\an7}<i>That erased the pent-up</i>
<i>anxiety everyone was</i>
<i>feeling... </i>

92
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,269
{\an7}<i>and created a sense</i>
<i>of unity here.</i>

93
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,538
{\an7}<i>Headquarters, each battle</i>

94
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,040
{\an7}<i>the others fighting on</i>
<i>the frontline...</i>

95
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,908
{\an7}<i>If we stand united in our</i>
<i>purpose, our foundation</i>

96
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:19,310
{\an7}<i>will be unshakeable and</i>
<i>we can win this war!</i>

97
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:26,415
[gasp]
This... This is...

98
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,648
What is it?!

99
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:38,989
{\an1}Tailed Beast Bomb!

100
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,934
{\an1}Time for the front
line at last.

101
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:00,936
{\an1}Yeah! Just you wait! I'll
show 'em what I can do!

102
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,638
[gasp] What?!

103
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,039
{\an1}What's happening?!

104
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:21,816
{\an1}Isn't that in the direction
of the front line?

105
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,084
{\an1}Huh? Look over there!

106
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,285
{\an1}Is that where we're going?

107
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,855
{\an1}Yes... That talk earlier about
Madara, Maybe those weren't
just rumors.

108
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,825
Man, that looked
like something...

109
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,125
...enormous...

110
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:42,428
{\an1}Yeah. Here's our chance to
show 'em... Right?

111
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:55,536
{\an1}Nicely done, Naruto!

112
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:59,672
{\an1}I never thought you would be
able to completely control
Nine Tails.

113
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:04,375
{\an1}However, it appears as
though you still cannot
maintain it for long.

114
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,977
{\an1}So same old, same old.

115
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:25,055
{\an1}It's not the same
old, same old...

116
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:30,792
{\an1}Not anymore! I just learned
a whole bunch of really
difficult names all at once!

117
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,526
Difficult names?

118
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,062
{\an1}What does that have
to do with anything?

119
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:39,630
{\an1}[confident chuckle] Oh,
so you don't know, do ya?!

121
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,835
{\an1}Egh! Well, I'm sure
not gonna tell ya!

122
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,412
{\an1}Wow, look at Naruto go! He's
gained so much experience
and strength!

123
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,815
{\an1}Frankly, it makes me feel
quite old and feeble!

124
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,516
{\an1}What is going on? You're
not being yourself!

125
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,385
{\an4}This is so out of character
for you! I hate to be the
one to say it, but the

126
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,654
{\an1}springtime of our youth
is far from over, Guy!

127
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,488
{\an1}We still have a lot
of work to do.

128
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,924
{\an1}Oh, be quiet! You want
me to feel worse?!

129
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,525
{\an1}Ah, that's the Guy I know!

130
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,762
{\an7}<i>That expression...</i>

131
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:38,867
{\an7}<i>Hm? Am I perspiring?</i>

132
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,537
{\an7}<i>No, it's just the rain... </i>

133
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:48,606
{\an7}<i>These fools could</i>
<i>never make me sweat!</i>

134
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:55,477
{\an7}<i>Naruto was always merely</i>
<i>a pawn to test Sasuke.</i>

135
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:59,146
{\an7}<i>That brat's only supposed</i>
<i>to be an amusement.</i>

136
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,614
{\an7}<i>I knew what his limits were.</i>

137
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:05,283
{\an1}There's no way his power
could be pushing me this
hard.

138
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,219
{\an1}So what is it?! What
has happened?

139
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:21,526
{\an1}It does not matter. It does
not matter who or what
Naruto is now...

140
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:30,966
{\an1}After this war is over,
there will be no past or
future.

141
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,869
{\an1}Nothing that exists now
will matter then!
Not one thing...

142
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,673
A-Amazing...

143
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,742
{\an1}Did all of you feel that?

144
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,676
{\an4}I can't believe it, but...

145
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,010
{\an1}There's no doubt about it.

146
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:52,146
{\an1}So much power. It has
to be Nine Tails!

147
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,147
Yeah...

148
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,348
{\an7}<i>And yet, I also detect</i>
<i>something a bit</i>
<i>different...</i>

149
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,751
{\an1}What's the current
situation?

150
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,853
{\an1}Naruto is holding back
the Masked Madara

151
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:05,154
{\an1}with an unbelievable
amount of power.

152
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:07,489
{\an1}The chakra's incredible!

153
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:12,358
{\an1}Naruto's keeping him at
bay.. It's just the four of
them! Naruto, Lord Bee,

154
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,993
Kakashi and Guy!

155
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,129
Inoichi!

156
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,896
{\an1}I need you to relay Naruto's
actions directly into

157
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,965
{\an1}the minds of the
reinforcement troops!

158
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:23,699
{\an1}Give it everything
you've got!

159
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:28,168
{\an1}Fifteen seconds is all we
need! I want to boost
everyone's morale!

160
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:33,072
{\an4}Those four are out there
giving it their all! I want
the rest of us here to do

161
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,739
everything that
we can as well!

162
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:37,406
{\an1}Convey their iron
resolve to everyone!

163
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:41,009
{\an1}What?! Everyone?! Doing
that will overload the
Chakra Network!

164
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,477
{\an1}And if we make just
one little mistake...

165
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,146
{\an1}...Inoichi's dead!

166
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,580
[chuckle] You're
asking a lot...

167
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,414
{\an1}Just ten seconds!

168
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,581
Master Inoichi!

169
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:54,017
{\an1}I'm sorry... But this is
critically important,
Inoichi!

170
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,719
{\an1}Make it short but make it
count, you understand?!

171
00:14:56,752 --> 00:15:00,155
{\an1}Well, I'm not very good
with words, but you
can count on me!

172
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,289
Message from HQ!

173
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:06,125
{\an1}Reinforcements! We now
have the upper hand!

174
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,161
{\an1}Naruto Uzumaki is
standing firm!

175
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:13,963
{\an1}The ones we must protect at
all costs, Naruto and Lord
Bee, are fighting with

176
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,732
{\an1}everything they've got on the
front line of this battle!

177
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,432
Guy and Kakashi
are there, too!

178
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:24,837
{\an1}Everyone in the Allied
Forces, I need all of you to
add to their mighty hearts!

179
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,538
{\an1}Amplify it with your
mighty hearts!

180
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,241
{\an1}If you do, I promise
you victory!

181
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,343
[gasp]

182
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:44,849
{\an1}I knew I was bad with words...
That took me twenty seconds...

183
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:53,320
Captain, you...

184
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:58,356
{\an7}<i>Yeah... That just shows</i>
<i>how mighty your heart</i>
<i>is, Inoichi...</i>

185
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:03,561
I'm sorry!

186
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,562
[groaning]

187
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,876
{\an7}<i>Naruto... I've run after</i>
<i>you my whole life.</i>

188
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,945
{\an8}<i>And even now...</i>

189
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:34,580
{\an8}<i>Here I am, still</i>
<i>running after you.</i>

190
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,617
{\an7}<i>But when this war is over...</i>

191
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,019
{\an8}<i>I am not going</i>
<i>to run anymore.</i>

192
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,190
{\an7}<i>I'll stand with you. I'll</i>
<i>hold your hand. And I'll</i>
<i>walk with you by your side.</i>

193
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:53,558
{\an7}<i>So please, Naruto...</i>

194
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,393
{\an8}<i>Wait for me!</i>

195
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:02,097
{\an8}<i>Naruto...</i>

196
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,565
{\an7}<i>It seems like ages ago, I</i>
<i>set my eye on you...</i>

197
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,133
{\an8}<i>As my rival!</i>

198
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,204
{\an7}<i>You just hang tight against</i>
<i>Madara until I get there!</i>

199
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:17,840
{\an7}<i>I'll support you completely</i>
<i>with my ninjutsu, Naruto...</i>

200
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,942
{\an7}<i>And the reason...</i>
<i>is not necessary!</i>

201
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:24,911
Naruto is doing
well out there.

202
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,379
{\an1}Yeah, he's reckless, but
despite the way that he acts

203
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,348
sometimes, he's
actually pretty sharp,

204
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,782
{\an1}and he can also be
surprisingly resourceful.

205
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:37,086
{\an4}People think that Naruto's
dumb and I'm fat, but it
turns out that isn't really

206
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,821
{\an1}isn't the case at all! I
guess appearances truly
can be deceiving!

207
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:46,690
{\an7}<i>You just wait! Skinny</i>
<i>Choji is coming to help</i>
<i>out Smart Naruto!</i>

208
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,261
{\an1}<i>Although, he isn't really</i>
<i>a calm and collected</i>
<i>strategist.</i>

209
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,997
{\an7}<i>But I am! And I'm coming</i>
<i>to help you, Naruto!</i>
<i>Just hold on!</i>

210
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,634
{\an7}<i>Dad... thank you!</i>

211
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:07,037
{\an7}<i>You relayed Naruto's mighty</i>
<i>heart to everyone in the</i>
<i>Allied Forces!</i>

212
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,473
{\an7}<i>And now, we must bring</i>
<i>true your prediction.</i>

213
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:16,043
{\an7}<i>I hope that Guy Sensei is</i>
<i>all right and that he's</i>
<i>protecting Naruto!</i>

214
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,913
{\an7}<i>Kakashi Sensei is with him,</i>
<i>so they must be okay,</i>
<i>but... </i>

215
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:27,883
{\an1}If it just wasn't raining,
we could ride my Super
Beast Scroll drawings...

216
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,518
{\an1}Stop complaining, Sai,
and pick up your speed!

217
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:34,288
{\an4}This is the time for each
one of us to follow Guy
Sensei's and Naruto's

218
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,289
examples and
exceed ourselves!

219
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:38,089
Yes!

220
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:41,025
{\an7}<i>This is camaraderie...</i>

221
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:46,161
{\an7}<i>I have a really good</i>
<i>grasp of it now. Thanks</i>
<i>to you, Naruto.</i>

222
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,367
{\an7}<i>Naruto... you saved the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

223
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,269
{\an7}<i>And now, you're trying to</i>
<i>save the entire shinobi</i>
<i>world...</i>

224
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,438
{\an7}<i>We've always let you put the</i>
<i>burden on your shoulders</i>

225
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,572
{\an7}<i>and trusted you to</i>
<i>do the impossible.</i>

226
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,810
{\an7}<i>But this time, no</i>
<i>matter what you say...</i>
<i>You'll have help...</i>

227
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:14,645
{\an7}<i>Not just from me...</i>

228
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:20,149
{\an7}<i>Everyone will stand with</i>
<i>you and fight together!</i>

229
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,551
{\an1}<i>We need to find Sasuke</i>
<i>before we get mixed up</i>

230
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,852
<i>in this whole</i>
<i>ridiculous conflict!</i>

231
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,554
{\an4}<i>Suigetsu, why are you here?</i>

232
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:04,455
{\an1}<i>Are you in The Taka just to</i>
<i>cause trouble with Sasuke</i>
<i>and Karin?</i>

233
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:08,623
{\an1}<i>I would love nothing better</i>
<i>than to break both of those</i>
<i>two losers up for good! </i>

234
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:10,125
{\an1}<i>I can't help myself!</i>

235
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:12,226
{\an1}<i>You're reprehensible,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

236
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:16,262
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Eyes That</i>
<i>See in the Dark."</i>

237
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,164
<i>To be honest, I</i>
<i>hate you all!</i>
