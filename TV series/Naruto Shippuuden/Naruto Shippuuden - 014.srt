1
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:19,583
-Attack!

2
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,522
-Water Clone Jutsu!

3
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,797
Water Prison Jutsu!

4
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:43,474
-Lee, Neji, Tenten!

5
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,976
-Haa!

6
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:46,477
Rasengan!

7
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:52,383
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Another shadow clone.

8
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:01,392
What the?

9
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:02,860
Sakura?

10
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:03,360
Freddy?

11
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:07,798
Sakura, are you?

12
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:13,270
Huh?

13
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:25,649
Kakashi-sensei.

14
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,695
What the hell is going on here?

15
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,513
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER):
This is really bad.

16
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,415
-I've gotta admit.

17
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,417
I'm a little surprised.

18
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,586
These kids are better
than I thought.

19
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:09,159
LEE (VOICEOVER): I cannot move.

20
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,295
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Damn it!

21
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,729
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
Can't breathe.

22
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:20,170
-At any rate, now we can fight
without any interference.

23
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,352
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): I wanna
help, but if I were to act now,

24
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:37,888
I'd only get in the way.

25
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,256
All I can do is wait.

26
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,994
Hang in there, team.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,776
-This is the mighty
blade known as Sharkskin.

28
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:03,213
And it only allows
me to wield it.

29
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:08,018
-I guess so.

30
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,320
I shouldn't have messed
with an unfamiliar weapon.

31
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,027
I'll just stick to my own then.

32
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,429
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): Is
that what I think it is?

33
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,798
LEE (VOICEOVER): He is
resorting to his nunchaku.

34
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:23,967
NEJI (VOICEOVER): The enemy
is indeed powerful then.

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,437
-Haa!

36
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:32,376
-Hm.

37
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:41,752
-Well, well, well.

38
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:43,754
This is going to be interesting.

39
00:03:54,665 --> 00:04:06,076
[chuckling]

40
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,947
-Now, what do you say we
finally get down to business?

41
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,815
[theme music]

42
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:20,277
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
More shadow clones?

43
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,767
-Huh?

44
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,952
But I never looked
him in the eye.

45
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,464
How did I get drawn in?

46
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:52,035
-These eyes aren't the only
way I can wield genjutsu.

47
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:55,138
All I need is a single finger.

48
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,821
ITACHI: It's time you
came with me, Naruto.

49
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,660
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's when he did it.

50
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,395
ITACHI: You needn't worry.

51
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:22,165
I won't use the
Mangekyo Sharingan.

52
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,134
Or I suppose I should
say, to be more

53
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,103
precise I can't
use it right now.

54
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,175
-What exactly is that
supposed to mean?

55
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,747
-That's hardly your concern.

56
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:41,284
More importantly, it's
time I put you to sleep.

57
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,955
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn it!

58
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,089
I was so careful.

59
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,458
I can't believe I got
caught in his genjutsu.

60
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:55,765
NARUTO: Genjutsu?

61
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,201
You mean you're gonna teach
me genjutsu, Pervy Sage?

62
00:08:58,235 --> 00:08:59,135
Actually,

63
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,170
-Actually, I'm
going to teach you

64
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:02,239
how to break
genjutsu, all right?

65
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,139
-Huh?

66
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:03,773
Break 'em?

67
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,475
What do you mean?

68
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,811
-Just listen to me, will you?

69
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,680
If you ever get caught in one,
there's a trick to getting out.

70
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:11,748
NARUTO: Pervy Sage.

71
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,383
-And it's one you're
pretty familiar with,

72
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,384
as a matter of fact.

73
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,452
NARUTO: Pervy Sage!

74
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:16,419
-What already?

75
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,989
-I wanna learn how
to do genjutsu, not

76
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:22,792
learn what I should do
if I get trapped in one.

77
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:25,762
Eh?

78
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,264
[sigh]

79
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:27,864
-Hey!

80
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:28,665
Don't sigh at me.

81
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,234
You got a problem or what?

82
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,670
JIRAIYA: You see,
Naruto, genjutsu

83
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,339
works on your
opponent's five senses.

84
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:40,043
You control the chakra flowing
through their cranial nerves.

85
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:44,948
It's a highly advanced
intellectual ninjutsu.

86
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:46,149
-Hm.

87
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,051
I don't really get it.

88
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:48,618
JIRAIYA: Ooh.

89
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:51,087
Big surprise.

90
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,924
Nobody is asking you
to master genjutsu, so

91
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,759
get it out of your head already.

92
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:58,228
You have to be a
genjutsu type shinobi

93
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,664
in the first place, which
you clearly are not.

94
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:01,998
-Wa-- Wait.

95
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,934
Really?

96
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,936
-Hm.

97
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:06,436
-OK.

98
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,270
Fine.

99
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:08,505
Why don't we just skip it then.

100
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:09,706
Back to the grindstone.

101
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,107
Let's get to training.

102
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,943
JIRAIYA: Not so fast.

103
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:13,610
-Why?

104
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:15,011
What's the big deal?

105
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:18,615
-There's plenty of enemies
who can use genjutsu.

106
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:20,951
For example, Itachi Uchiha.

107
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:28,224
-That's right.

108
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:29,492
I almost forgot.

109
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:32,862
Even Kakashi-sensei was
outmatched against him.

110
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:33,830
-That's right.

111
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:35,465
Which is why it's
essential for you

112
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:36,933
to know how to
deal with genjutsu.

113
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:41,905
-OK then.

114
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,244
JIRAIYA: When you're in
the grip of an opponent's

115
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,115
scheduled genjutsu, the chakra
that flows through your mind

116
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,718
is under their control.

117
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,920
So if you find
yourself caught in one,

118
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:59,389
you need to stop the
flow of your own chakra

119
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:01,024
as best as you can.

120
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,226
-Cut off the flow of chakra?

121
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,828
What do you mean?

122
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,831
-Thanks to all the training
you've had up until now,

123
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,699
you've learned how
to focus your chakra

124
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,201
at the bottom of
your feet, and are

125
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,437
able to walk along the
surface of the water.

126
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:15,605
-Oh yeah.

127
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:17,207
That's right.

128
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,443
JIRAIYA: You want to put a
temporary stop on all of it.

129
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,746
Give it a try.

130
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,681
-Right.

131
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:27,017
Just concentrate on
stopping the flow of chakra.

132
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,517
Got it.

133
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,362
JIRAIYA: then once
you've done that,

134
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:42,399
disrupt the flow of chakra
in one powerful shot.

135
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:42,932
-All righty.

136
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,367
You got it.

137
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:44,868
Haa!

138
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:58,248
-And if you can do that,
the genjutsu will be broken.

139
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:03,053
-Hm?

140
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:03,553
-Haa!

141
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,101
[chuckling]

LEE (VOICEOVER): Guy-sensei.

TENTEN (VOICEOVER): Can't
hold out much longer.

144
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:35,812

Tenten is fading.

incredible power!

147
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:17,253
-Hold on.

148
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,721
I know you.

149
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:21,658
-So you finally remembered, huh?

150
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:22,825
Too little, too late!

151
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:26,863
LEE (VOICEOVER):
Oh no, Guy-sensei!

152
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:36,472
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
Guy-sensei, it can't be.

153
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,942
LEE (VOICEOVER): Our sensei
will not be beaten that easily.

154
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,060
GUY (VOICEOVER): I know
I've met this guy before.

155
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:58,561
-Ha.

156
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,497
I'm not done settling
the score just yet.

157
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,266
Not by a long shot.

158
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:09,239
Water Style Five Hungry Sharks!

159
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:12,709
-Huh?

160
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,683
-Here's the first meal.

161
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:25,655
Second meal.

162
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:33,096
The third meal.

163
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:47,977
GUY (VOICEOVER): No effect, huh?

164
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:48,945
-The fourth meal.

165
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,453
The fifth meal.

see the flow of our
