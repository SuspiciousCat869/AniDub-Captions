person, Tenma?

290
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:10,763
<i>[groaning]</i>
<i>Shinko! That was too hard!</i>
<i>That really hurt! </i>

291
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,264
{\an1}<i>(Itachi thinking)</i>
<i>Friend, huh? </i>

292
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,631
<i>[groaning]</i>

293
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:16,133
{\an1}<i>Oh, my face. Ugh.</i>

294
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,170
{\an1}Hey, Big Brother! What is
this?

295
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,771
{\an1}Oh, that's from
that time...

296
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,538
Mmm!

297
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:29,740
[chuckling]

298
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:38,845
{\an1}<i>Life is born... and life</i>
<i>dies... But sometimes...</i>
<i>life is saved again... </i>

299
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,947
{\an1}<i>Wait... when I saved</i>
<i>Tenma back then...</i>

300
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,648
{\an1}<i>... I didn't really think</i>
<i>too deeply about it.</i>

301
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:50,584
{\an1}He's your friend! Of course
he's gonna help you out
when you need it!

302
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:57,888
{\an1}<i>A clan grows. A village is</i>
<i>born. And bonds are</i>
<i>formed.</i>

303
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:03,425
{\an1}<i>If that's what friends</i>
<i>are... then we were friends,</i>
<i>no doubt about it. </i>

304
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,759
{\an1}<i>We formed a bond. That's</i>
<i>why it happened.</i>

305
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,664
{\an1}<i>We shared a bond...</i>

306
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,866
<i>That's why he--</i>

307
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:30,072
<i>(Tenma)</i>
<i>I'll swear I'll make it</i>
<i>up to you for this! </i>

308
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:39,376
<i>...died. </i>

309
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:45,046
{\an1}<i>I didn't understand back</i>
<i>then... </i>

310
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,013
{\an1}<i>...what real pain is. </i>

311
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,648
{\an1}<i>Pain of losing a life.</i>

312
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:57,153
{\an1}<i>I first felt it after</i>
<i>losing-- No. I was forced</i>
<i>to realize it.</i>

313
00:20:57,453 --> 00:21:01,788
{\an1}<i>The feeling of not wanting</i>
<i>to lose something precious. </i>

314
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:06,624
{\an1}Big Brother! Your eyes!

315
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:12,161
{\an1}<i>Will the day come when you</i>
<i>possess these eyes, too,</i>
<i>Sasuke? </i>

316
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:16,595
{\an1}<i>The day when you come to</i>
<i>know what sadness truly is? </i>

317
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:01,016
{\an1}<i>Well, I have to go. </i>

318
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,185
{\an1}<i>Big Brother! You said you</i>
<i>were gonna play with me</i>
<i>today! </i>

319
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,752
{\an1}<i>I did, didn't I? But I</i>
<i>have a mission now.</i>

320
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,355
{\an1}<i>Sorry, Sasuke. Some</i>
<i>other time, okay?</i>

321
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,555
<i>[gasping]</i>

322
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,656
{\an1}<i>(Shisui)</i>
<i>I apologize, Sasuke. I</i>
<i>need your brother for a bit.</i>

323
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,427
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: "Shisui's</i>
<i>Request." </i>

324
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,328
{\an1}<i>(Shisui)</i>
<i>He's probably going to</i>
<i>resent me now too, you know.</i>
