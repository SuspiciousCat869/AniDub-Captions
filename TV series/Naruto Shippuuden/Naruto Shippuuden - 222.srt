1
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:19,792
{\an1}<i>You're saying the Fourth</i>
<i>Great Ninja War is about</i>
<i>to start? </i>

2
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:22,929
{\an1}Even though we're talking
about Madara Uchiha.

3
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:25,733
{\an1}Can he really take on the
Five Great Nations?

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,972
{\an7}You need to wake up and
face the facts! Madara
Uchiha leads the
Akatsuki!

5
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:35,609
{\an7}<i>Just one of them was able</i>
<i>to destroy the Leaf</i>
<i>Village! </i>

6
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,745
{\an1}<i>Have you already</i>
<i>forgotten that?! </i>

7
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:44,051
{\an4}I agree with Lady
Tsunade. The Akatsuki
already have the other
Tailed Beasts, from

8
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:46,186
{\an1}One-Tail to Seven-Tails.

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,092
{\an4}If they intend to use
them as military weapons,
we must consider their
strength to be far

10
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,094
{\an1}<i>greater than even</i>
<i>Nagato's. </i>

11
00:00:54,664 --> 00:01:01,971
{\an5}And if that's the case,
the Five Great Nations--
no! The entire world is in
danger of destruction!

12
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,907
We cannot delay action!

13
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:09,746
{\an1}Very well... But where
should we strike? Do you
know where Madara is?

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,016
{\an1}We do have a general idea
of the location.

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,121
{\an5}The Mitarashi Unit
recently reported in, and
they've confirmed spotting
someone who fits.

16
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,591
{\an1}the description of Madara
Uchiha.

17
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,192
What? They have...?!

18
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:25,730
{\an1}Right now they're working
to gather more conclusive
intel.

19
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:37,141
{\an4}<i>Nah, it doesn't rhyme.</i>
<i>What a crime. There must</i>
<i>be some phrase that'll</i>
<i>earn some praise. </i>

20
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:40,311
{\an1}Without knowing the
enemy's precise
location...

21
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:45,784
{\an7}The success of a surprise
attack is doubtful, so
first we must organize
scouting parties.

22
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,320
{\an1}<i>Know you... to maximize</i>
<i>their efforts, we'll need--</i>

23
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:52,826
{\an1}<i>"Know you..." Eh. No</i>
<i>originality.</i>

24
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,062
{\an1}<i>But switch around the</i>
<i>words... you get "you</i>
<i>know." </i>

25
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:03,971
{\an7}<i>Then all you got to do is</i>
<i>add a little nuance...</i>
<i>and make it... "You know</i>
<i>it!" </i>

26
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:08,376
{\an1}<i>You know it, you know it,</i>
<i>now come on and show it. </i>

27
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,979
{\an4}<i>Now I have a pretty clear</i>
<i>picture of the Hidden</i>
<i>Cloud's military</i>
<i>strength... </i>

28
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:15,650
{\an1}Luckily, the Eight
Tails is a fool.

29
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:20,388
{\an7}<i>Nah, this phrase just</i>
<i>seems... to rub me the</i>
<i>wrong way. Ya know? </i>

30
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,125
{\an1}No, it's not working.

31
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:29,431
{\an5}Right now, we have very
little intel on the enemy.
So we must rely on the other
four villages.

32
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:33,636
{\an4}Are you serious? We're
just supposed to sit here,
empty-handed and depend
on them?

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,472
{\an1}I mean, are they even
gonna share their data
with us?

34
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:42,046
{\an7}If they won't divulge it
to us, then the Allied
Shinobi Force is
absolutely meaningless.

35
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:46,617
We're just gonna have
to trust them.

36
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,453
We don't have any more
time to waste now.

37
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:52,056
Because out there, right
at this very moment...

38
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,026
{\an8}Madara Uchiha is
preparing for battle.

39
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,929
{\an1}All right!

40
00:02:57,962 --> 00:03:03,367
{\an4}I'll have the Allied
Shinobi Force meet here
in three days! Send a
summons to each village!

41
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,710
{\an7}Very soon, I'll announce
to the entire village the
coming Fourth Great Ninja
War.

42
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,379
{\an1}The Fourth Great
Ninja War?

43
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:20,820
{\an1}You haven't heard this
yet, Sakura... But Madara
Uchiha has declared war.

44
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:25,758
{\an4}This time, the Five Great
Nations aren't battling
each other but have
joined forces for a

45
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,128
conflict unlike any seen
before.

46
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,361
{\an1}Then who-?

47
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,832
{\an1}We face the Akatsuki.

48
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:35,702
{\an7}<i>The Akatsuki! We're</i>
<i>really going to battle</i>
<i>Sasuke.</i>

49
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:40,540
{\an8}When the fighting breaks
out, many will wrestle
with doubt and with fear.

50
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:44,545
{\an8}It will be your job to
keep a close watch on
their mental state.

51
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,684
{\an4}Circulate among the teams
and report anything
unusual. Do not hide
anything, understood?

52
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,818
Yes, m'lady.

53
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,289
{\an7}And one other thing: make
sure you keep an eye on
Naruto.

54
00:03:55,858 --> 00:04:01,997
{\an4}<i>I cannot have him acting</i>
<i>recklessly. In this war,</i>
<i>Naruto is the Akatsuki's</i>
<i>goal. </i>

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,603
{\an1}Hmm? Yes,
Shizune?

56
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:12,075
{\an1}Lady Tsunade, Naruto
suddenly disappeared from
Ichiraku Ramen just now.

57
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:13,076
What?!

58
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,078
{\an1}Wait. You don't think
the enemy could've--

59
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:20,017
{\an4}It's impossible for
Naruto to be kidnapped
from this village! I
want him found right now!

60
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:05,029
{\an1}"The Five Kage's
Decision"

61
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,866
See ya, Giant Gramps
Sage!

62
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,736
{\an1}All right, off you go!

63
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,239
[gasping]

64
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,676
{\an1}Huh?! Oh, I'm back
home.

65
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,747
Where'd you go?! First
you disappear and then
you just reappear again!

66
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,183
{\an7}[chuckling]
Stuff to do...

67
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,984
<i>Wow! Naruto! </i>

68
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,551
{\an1}Huh?

69
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,721
{\an5}Man, they said you
were gone and everyone
nearly went out of
their minds!

70
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,657
{\an1}They did? Seriously?

71
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,494
{\an1}Yeah! Wow, I never
thought I'd run into
you, here!

72
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,231
{\an1}Oh, that's right! Can I
get your autograph?

73
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,835
{\an1}And could you make it out
to my kid, please? He's a
real big fan!

74
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,271
{\an1}Autograph...?

75
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:48,676
You're the hero of the
Hidden Leaf! Naruto, the
kid who makes miracles!

76
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,013
Can I please have
your autograph, too?

77
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:54,916
{\an1}<i>What? Can't you do it? </i>

78
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,586
{\an1}No, it's not that; I'm
just not used to this
celebrity thing...

79
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,922
I've never given
an autograph before.

80
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:07,096
{\an4}<i>Everyone's making a</i>
<i>fuss over him lately as</i>
<i>the miracle kid. What an</i>
<i>about-face from not long</i>

81

{\an1}<i>ago. Can't blame him for</i>
<i>feeling the way he does. </i>

82
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,670
Listen, guys, just let
him eat his ramen before
he signs anything, okay?

83
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,072
{\an1}Oh! Sure!

84
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,540
{\an1}Bring it on!

85
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:21,178
{\an1}I finally get
to eat real food!

86
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,678
<i>Naruto! </i>

87
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,480
Hey, Sakura,
what's up?

88
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:28,952
{\an1}[panting]
We've been looking
everywhere for you!

89
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:31,655
{\an1}Oh, well, I got summoned
suddenly and I-

90
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:36,427
{\an4}Look, just come with me!
Lady Tsunade and everyone
else are worried sick
about you!

91
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:39,998
{\an1}Aw, come on, Sakura! Let
me eat my ramen!

92
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,532
{\an1}<i>That can wait! </i>

93
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,937
{\an1}You saw the Great Lord
Elder?

94
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,008
{\an1}Yeah, he used a Reverse
Summoning Jutsu.

95
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,609
{\an1}And we went through all
that trouble...

96
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:55,247
{\an1}Lord Fukasaku could have
at least let me know
beforehand.

97
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:59,319
{\an1}Yes, but still... it's a
relief you're okay,
Naruto.

98
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:02,322
{\an1}Hey, I'm more than okay!
I'm doing great!

99
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:06,592
{\an7}I'm glad. But why did the
Great Lord Elder summon
you?

100
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:11,231
{\an4}Giant Gramps Sage had
something he wanted to
tell me, a prophecy he
had.

101
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,370
{\an7}Like the one that he
foretold to Jiraiya?

102
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:19,473
{\an7}So what did the Great
Lord Elder have to say
to you?

103
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:22,009
{\an1}Uhh-- Well,
I--

104
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,478
{\an1}What is it?

105
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:26,914
{\an8}Well, I'm gonna go
to some cool resort
and meet an octopus
there!

106
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,518
{\an1}Huh!? You're
gonna what?!

107
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,584
Uh...

108
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,190
{\an1}And what's that supposed
to mean, exactly...?

109
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:40,662
{\an1}Well, uh this octopus is
supposed to cooperate
with me somehow...

110
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:45,001
{\an7}Giant Gramps Sage didn't
know all the details
either. And...

111
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:50,039
{\an1}He said that I'm gonna
end up fighting Sasuke.

112
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,508
Fight Sasuke?

113
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,520
{\an1}But I'm ready now. I've
already prepared for it.

114
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,022
But, Naruto...

115
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:07,624
{\an1}It's all right.
Don't worry.

116
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:10,894
{\an7}Let me handle Sasuke.
This is my task.

117
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,836
{\an1}It sure is quiet.

118
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:19,505
<i>Yeah, I'll say. </i>

119
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:23,007
So peaceful.

120
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,610
{\an1}What? No, it's not! Not
at all!

121
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:26,845
{\an3}Uh?

122
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,516
{\an1}Sure, the Village is
being rebuilt after
Pain's attack,

123
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:33,018
{\an1}and Lady Tsunade's
come out of her coma...

124
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:37,424
{\an4}But as for Sasuke,...
there's only talk that
Naruto is gonna do
something.

125
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:41,660
{\an1}And there's gonna be a
full-out war, isn't
there?

126
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,264
What?! How'd you know
that?!

127
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:48,768
{\an7}I'm not stupid, you know.
I can tell by watching
the jonin prepare.

128
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:50,438
{\an3}Hm.

129
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:51,705
I guess so.

130
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:55,343
{\an1}[grunting]

131
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:58,980
{\an1}It's true. War is
right at our doorstep.

132
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,783
{\an1}[sighing]
I kinda figured.

133
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:05,387
Yeah. This fight is
something-

134
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,260
{\an4}I mean, this is something
unlike any other shinobi
has ever experienced
before.

135
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:17,300
{\an7}Just imagine, to crush
the Akatsuki, the Five
Great Nations are joining
forces for the first time.

136
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,704
{\an1}It's the start of the
Fourth Great Ninja War.

137
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:26,142
{\an1}The Fourth Great
Ninja War...

138
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,979
{\an1}Man, aren't you
scared, Shikamaru?

139
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:33,683
{\an7}Yeah. You'd better
believe I am.

140
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,319
Huh?

141
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:40,357
{\an1}But this time, it doesn't
matter how scared we are
or how hard it'll be.

142
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:46,063
{\an7}Our enemy, the Akatsuki,
is made up of members so
skilled that it took just
one of them to destroy

143
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,200
{\an7}the Hidden Leaf Village.

144
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:53,038
{\an7}And the abilities of
their leader, Madara, are
completely shrouded in
mystery.

145
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:58,043
{\an7}And even worse than that,
he has Seven Tailed Beasts.

146
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:04,884
{\an8}If he unleashes all of
them at once, who knows
if even the Five Great
Nations together can win.

147
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:08,788
{\an7}Now, the entire ninja
world is at stake.

148
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:14,695
{\an7}So each and every shinobi
will have to do their
absolute best or we'll
have no chance to win.

149
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:19,433
{\an7}Choji, I'm counting on
your strength, big time!

150
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:22,936
{\an1}Uhhh...

151
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:37,686
{\an7}<i>Shikamaru, I hope</i>
<i>I can do my best.</i>

152
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,189
{\an7}<i>Man... it's hard to take</i>
<i>this all in... </i>

153
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:50,032
[gagging]

154
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:56,239
Are you okay...? You
wanted to know what to
expect from war.

155
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,507
{\an1}Yes. I'm fine.

156
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:01,144
But nothing can prepare
you for the real
battlefield.

157
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:04,481
The wounded's cries, the
smell of blood.

158
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:07,752
It's almost impossible
not to be affected by
it all.

159
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:14,358
{\an4}But regardless, a Medical
Ninja must maintain their
composure, no matter what
happens.

160
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:19,930
{\an7}<i>Everyone fights hard,</i>
<i>counting on us to be</i>
<i>there to save their lives</i>
<i>if need be. </i>

161
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,799
{\an1}Yes, I know...

162
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,834
{\an1}That's why I wanted to--

163
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,440
{\an1}To know, I guess.

164
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:34,414
{\an1}Heh! All right. I guess that
I'm done nagging you for
now, Sasuke!

165
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:40,687
{\an7}<i>Damn it, this is</i>
<i>ridiculous! I'm not any</i>
<i>good with words; I shouldn't</i>
<i>try to lecture you.</i>

166
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,156
{\an1}[chuckling]

167
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,427
{\an7}Well, I guess if the
worst does happen and
both of us end up
dying...

168
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:52,566
{\an7}You won't be an Uchiha
and I won't be the
Nine-Tail's Jinchuriki
anymore.

169
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,035
{\an7}We'll be free of our
burdens.

170
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,772
{\an1}<i>And we'll understand each</i>
<i>other in the afterlife! </i>

171
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,576
{\an7}<i>Naruto. You--</i>

172
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:07,082
{\an7}<i>If both Naruto and Sasuke</i>
<i>get seriously wounded...</i>

173
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:10,885
{\an7}<i>Who will I save first...?</i>

174
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:20,563
{\an1}Found ya!

175
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,398
Tadah!

176
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:24,967
Keep it
quiet, now.

177
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:29,338
{\an1}<i>Master, what's the</i>
<i>meaning of this? </i>

178
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,441
{\an1}Don't scare us like that.

179
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,777
[coughing]

180
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,780
{\an1}I'm Killer Bee quiet!

181
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,515
{\an1}Nice cadence...!

182
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,182
{\an1}Well?

183
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,117
What is it?

184
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,884
Hm?

185
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,555
{\an1}What?! These are for
us?!

186
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,858
We're supposed to sell
these tickets?!

187
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,695
{\an1}My brother interfered
during that last concert
of mine.

188
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:54,165
{\an1}This time, I'm gonna make
sure that I nail it, baby!

189
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:55,768
{\an1}They're tickets
for a concert?

190
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,035
Uggggh, who's gonna
wanna buy these?!

191
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,237
[beat-boxing]

192
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,374
{\an1}You saying you got a
thing against hearing me
sing?

193
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,777
{\an1}You fools! You big
idiots!

194
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,678
{\an1}No, it's not that!

195
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,717
Okay, Master, relax!
We'll sell 'em, even if
it kills us!

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,886
{\an1}Yeeeaaaahhh!
I'm countin' on you.

197
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,258
{\an1}<i>You all came quickly. </i>

198
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,829
{\an1}The situation calls for
swift action.

199
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:26,232
{\an1}Listen, Princess Tsunade.
Are you sure you're up to
this?

200
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:30,171
{\an1}You know, you should've
handed the reins over to
someone a little younger.

201
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,573
{\an1}You're getting way
too old for this.

202
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:37,077
{\an4}You should really
speak for yourself,
you old fence sitting
geezer.

203
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:43,318
{\an7}Setting aside the Danzo
mess, I'm so relieved to
see that you're back as
Hokage, Lady Tsunade.

204
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:48,290
{\an1}Let us be done with the
greetings and just proceed
right to our main business.

205
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:52,127
{\an7}First on the agenda are
the Eight- and Nine-Tails
Jinchuriki.

206
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,300
{\an7}And then we'll move onto
information on the
enemy's stronghold and
battle strength.

207
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:03,272
{\an7}Some of my shinobi found
a location that may be
the enemy's base. But it
could also be a trap.

208
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:06,777
{\an7}I think it's best to
gather more intel
first.

209
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,516
{\an7}And we've also organized
multiple scouting parties
which are collecting data
as we speak.

210
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,653
{\an7}We must pool and share
the intel from each
village with each other.

211
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:21,626
{\an7}Well, what about forming a
separate unit within the
Allied Force that only
handles intel?

212
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:26,297
{\an1}Now that's a good idea!
Share and share alike,
that's what I say!

213
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,266
{\an1}Yes, of course!

214
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:33,639
{\an7}If our nations become
driven by greed and self-
interest, the Akatsuki will
pull the rug from under us

215
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:35,374
{\an7}before we even start!

216
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:39,778
{\an1}So... where will we hide
away the two crucial
Jinchuriki?

217
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,881
{\an1}Hide them away?!

218
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,215
{\an1}What's the problem?

219
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,486
{\an1}Naruto and Bee can lend
battle strength! Why
hide them away?

220
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:53,193
{\an7}At first I thought so as
well, but our enemy's
goal in this war is to
possess those two.

221
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,696
{\an1}Considering what could
happen, we can't let them
participate.

222
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,199
{\an1}That's what we all
decided at the last
meeting.

223
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:02,068
{\an1}Of course, you were
still unconscious,
Princess.

224
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:04,070
{\an1}Our enemy is Madara!

225
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:08,743
{\an4}Hold back strength and
we'll lose our chance to
win and we won't get
another!

226
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:10,144
{\an1}We must hit them hard-

227
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,650
{\an1}The Five Great Nation's
aim in this war is to
protect those two.

228
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:19,555
{\an1}Your sole dissent as
Hokage is not enough.
Majority shall rule.

229
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:22,057
Listen, you stripling!
Naruto is--

230
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,293
{\an1}I know him quite well.

231
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:36,706
{\an1}Ya sure had us worried
there..!

232
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:43,079
{\an7}He takes too many risks,
especially when it comes
to his friends. That is
why.

233
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:49,186
{\an7}Before we discuss
military strength, the
five Kage must reach a
consensus.

234
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:51,455
{\an1}Or no victory
will be possible!

235
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:54,358
I must agree with the
others, Lady Tsunade.

236
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,028
All right! Fine!

237
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:03,602
{\an7}The Slug Princess is back
to her impudent self.
That retort is proof
she's well!

238
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:07,039
{\an1}Let's decide where to
hide Eight- and
Nine-Tails.

239
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,507
{\an1}Any objections,
Lady Hokage?

240
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,412
{\an7}None at all. Just hurry
it up so we can move on.

241
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,949
{\an7}I've got just the place
in mind.

242
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,388
{\an7}It lies inside the Hidden
Cloud, which so far,
hasn't produced any
Akatsuki members.

243
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,323
{\an7}I set it aside in case.

244
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:32,000
{\an1}And why do you need to
speak privately?

245
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,767
Because I need a favor.

246
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,335
{\an1}<i>Heh. A favor? </i>

247
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:40,008
{\an4}I understand that your
younger brother Bee has
the Eight Tails under
control.

248
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:44,812
{\an8}My hope... is that Bee
can train Naruto....

249
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,881
{\an8}And teach him to control
Nine-Tails.

250
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:50,385
{\an1}Hm. Wouldn't that
be convenient...

251
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:55,724
{\an7}If that brat named Naruto
gains complete control
over the Nine-Tailed fox--

252
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,561
{\an7}<i>He'll be the ultimate</i>
<i>weapon for the Hidden</i>
<i>Leaf. </i>

253
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,665
{\an7}Do you actually believe
that I would ever agree
to that?

254
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,635
I understand your
concerns.

255
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,773
But this isn't the time
for us to be arguing
about our own interests!

256
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:10,940
{\an1}Hmph.

257
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:13,576
We're facing Madara
Uchiha!

258
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,715
Eventually, we're going
to be forced to use Bee
and Naruto's powers!

259
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,216
{\an7}But if we wait, it'll be
too late!

260
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,456
{\an7}You shouldn't shout. Is
that any way to ask
someone for a favor?

261
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,458
{\an1}[sighing]
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:31,096
Well, I have to admit,
you do make a good point.

263
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:34,231
{\an1}I know, because I
considered it a
long time ago.

264
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,233
You did? What
are you saying?!

265
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:40,706
{\an4}Where I'm sending those
two isn't just some secret
place where they can both
hide.

266
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:43,341
{\an1}I said I set
it aside, didn't I?

267
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,379
{\an1}A long time ago, when we
were younger...

268
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,482
{\an1}<i>Bee and I trained</i>
<i>on that island. </i>

269
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,721
{\an1}<i>An S-rank mission?! </i>

270
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:57,958
{\an1}No way! You're giving me
a big assignment like
that?

271
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:01,795
{\an1}That's right. It's a
mission that only you
can undertake.

272
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:05,399
{\an1}You and Yamato will go to
a site in the Hidden
Cloud.

273
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,735
Mm?

274
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,774
So is that the resort?

275
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:18,646
{\an4}The Great Lord Elder's
prophecy was correct. It
seems that is the place
he foresaw.

276
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,517
So then, you're saying I
am gonna meet the octopus
on this island?!

277
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,423
{\an4}I gotta say, I kinda feel
bad! Everyone's so busy
and I get to go to a
swanky resort and---

278
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:30,126
{\an1}Quiet, you fool!

279
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,027
{\an1}You're going on a
mission!

280
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:35,731
Yeah, I know, granny! I
was just jokin' around.

281
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,667
But if I'm going to the
place from the prophecy,

282
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:44,775
{\an4}Is the other one true, too?
Was the Great Lord Elder
right about me having to
fight Sasuke, as well?

283
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:51,548
{\an4}I'm afraid I don't know,
Naruto. However, I do
know we stand on the
brink of war!

284
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:57,221
{\an4}<i>Hence, this S-rank</i>
<i>mission. Now, when you</i>
<i>reach the location, you</i>
<i>will follow Yamato's orders.</i>

285
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,159
{\an1}Okay! I understand!

286
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:04,495
{\an1}You can count on me,
granny. I'm on the job!

287
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:08,399
{\an1}Dress casually for
enka.

288
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:11,402
{\an1}I'm looking pretty good,
all right...

289
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:12,905
<i>Where's Bee?! </i>

290
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,173
What up, Bro?

291
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:16,141
You nearly gave me a
heart attack!

292
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:19,179
{\an1}You're going on a
mission! You leave
immediately!

293
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,013
{\an1}What?!

294
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:20,947
Huh?!

295
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,713
Ah!

296
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:23,116
{\an1}<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you wearing?!</i>

297
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,052
[struggling]

298
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,554
{\an1}Let's go!

299
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:31,658
But my concert's
in three days! Ow!
Not so tight!

300
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:38,464
{\an1}There's no way that we
can sell these now...

301
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:41,802
{\an1}Yeah, but if we
don't sell them,
he's gonna be all,

302
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:46,540
{\an1}"Ya fools. Ya idiots.
Ya worthless jerks."
And then what'll happen?

303
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,977
{\an1}<i>We'll end up both tied to</i>
<i>a chair... </i>

304
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,748
{\an4}<i>And then we'll be</i>
<i>forced... to listen to</i>
<i>Master's singing... for</i>
<i>forever.</i>

305
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:56,751
Ahhhhhhh!

306
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,487
{\an1}We'll get calluses
on our ears!

307
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:03,993
{\an1}We have no choice.
We just have to sell
all the tickets!

308
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:08,598
{\an1}Yeah, but if we do sell
all of them... then he's
gonna be so grateful...

309
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:11,067
{\an1}<i>That he'll give us both</i>
<i>first-row seats!</i>

310
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,306
{\an7}And we'll still have
to listen to him sing
forever and get calluses
on our ears!

311
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,175
{\an1}Ow!

312
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,777
{\an1}<i>So do we sell the tickets</i>
<i>or not?! </i>

313
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,913
{\an1}<i>How the hell</i>
<i>should I know?!</i>

314
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:02,252
{\an1}<i>The time has come! Just</i>
<i>like Giant Gramps Sage</i>
<i>prophesied. </i>

315
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:07,058
{\an4}<i>I'm going to go look</i>
<i>for an octopus and train</i>
<i>to control the Nine-Tail's</i>
<i>power.</i>

316
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,560
{\an1}<i>And meet Sasuke once</i>
<i>again.</i>

317
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,730
{\an1}<i>Naruto, are you ready? </i>

318
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:12,564
{\an1}<i>Yeah! </i>

319
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,933
Now, young one,
time to go!

320
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,504
{\an1}<i>Next time on Naruto</i>
<i>Shippuden: The Young Man</i>
<i>and the Sea. </i>

321
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:23,009
{\an1}<i>Set sail for the Land of</i>
<i>Lightning! </i>
