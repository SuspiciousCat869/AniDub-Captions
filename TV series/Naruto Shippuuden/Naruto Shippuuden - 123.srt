DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
It's Sasuke.

4
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:12,033
I must punish him for
killing Orochimaru

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:17,500
when I wanted to be the one
to deliver the final blow.

[grunts]

he's glaring at us Tobi.

00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,301
Tell me and I'll let you go.

12
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,767
-Uh, hmm.

13
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,967
Sharingan, huh?

14
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:01,434
Well, you're Itachi's
kid brother all right.

15
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,467
You were only able
to kill Orochimaru

16
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,067
thanks to your Uchiha blood.

17
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,801
Hmm.

18
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:11,267
You were lucky to be born into
that family, and nothing more.

19
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,301
He's fast.

20
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:27,801
-Ah!

21
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,934
-One down.

22
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:41,201
Now, chatterbox, You're going
to tell me about Itachi.

23
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,834
-What are you doing Tobi?

24
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,767
Don't let your guard down
just because he's a kid.

25
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:49,567
-His teleportation jutsu makes
him too fast for both of us.

26
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:54,001
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): That guy.

27
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,467
Huh.

28
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:00,601
Let me size him up with some
Chakra Level C1 explosives

29
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:01,101
first.

30
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,501

00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:26,201
No! don't blow him up yet!

35
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:26,734
Ah!

-(CRYING) He may
have been strict.

42
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,167
But he was a good partner.

43
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,634
I'll never forget him.

44
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,567
Deidara!

45
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,967
-OK, will you just
shut up already?

46
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:51,901
-Huh?

47
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,234
Hey, you're still alive.

48
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,934
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He
can produce explosives

49
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,834
from his palms.

50
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,401
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
I somehow managed

51
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,567
to escape hidden
in the bomb blast.

52
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:15,101
Good thing I kept the
Chakra level at C1.

53
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:20,901
Hmm, and he's certainly
fast on his feet.

54
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:21,701
How about this?

55
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,334
I think I'll play
with you for a bit.

56
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:39,801
Hmph.

57
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,434
That's child's play.

58
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,301
What a joke.

59
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,201
-Ha ha, not done yet.

00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,901

00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,334
Ha.

00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,334
[laughing]

64
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,334
-No way.

65
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:01,834
-Hmm?

66
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,767
-Just as I thought.

67
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:08,701
-Shut up.

68
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,434
-How's that?

69
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,401
Ah, I guess he's not
so great after all.

70
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:41,901
Ha.

71
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,801
-Yep, I knew it.

72
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:56,834
-Look Tobi, just whose side
are you on here anyway?

73
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,134
(VOICEOVER) Substitution
justsu, huh?

74
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,301
Well, he's clearly very skilled.

75
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:06,334
Which means C2 is my best bet.

76
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,334
-Huh?

77
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,367
But--but that's--

[gasps]

79
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,201
-Tada!

80
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,434
Presenting one of my
partner's signature pieces.

81
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:29,134
His specialty, the C2 dragon!

82
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,801
-You know what to do Tobi?

83
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,367
-Yes sirree partner.

84
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,401
We're going with that, right?

85
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,867
-Yep, that is the plan.

86
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:37,367
Ha.

87
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,501
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Can that giant thing

88
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:48,034
become an explosive as well?

89
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,434
[belch]

90
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,334
-I'm counting on you Tobi.

91
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,667
-Yes sir!

92
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,567
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Judging
by the way that things look,

93
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,667
it can probably fly too.

94
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,101
Not good.

95
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,334
-Here he comes!

96
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,767
Now let's really show him.

97
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,967
Let's show him the power
of your pop art partner!

98
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,701
-Pop is dead!

99
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:09,334
My art is super fly.

100
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,567
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
This one was different.

101
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,034
It was a guided missile.

102
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:34,167
Where's the other one?

103
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,567
First things first then.

104
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:48,401
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER): So his
range is only five meters, huh?

105
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,634
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He
figured out my limit.

106
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,901
-You copied that off Kakashi.

107
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,701
But I will give you credit for
that change in Chakra form.

108
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:56,934
That wasn't half bad.

109
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:03,567
This one's got more bite
than the last bunch.

110
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,734
Blow him to bits.

111
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:14,701
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
Man, he is fast.

112
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:15,534
Got him.

113
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,701
That'll do it.

114
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,767
[gasps]

115
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,134
That's Orochimaru's curse mark.

116
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,034
I didn't realize he
could grow wings too.

117
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,001
He dodged my attack
by flying upward.

118
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:43,967
-Partner!

119
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,667
I set all of the landmine
clay and we're good to go!

120
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,367
-Good job Tobi.

121
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,801
Now just stay out of the way.

122
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,001
-OK.

123
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,767
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Guided missile attacks

124
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,234
from above and
landmines from below.

125
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,967
-This C2 assault
is brought to you

126
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,501
by the linked
attacks of the mines

127
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,901
that restrict your
ground movement

128
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,634
and the pinpoint missile
attacks from the air.

129
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,167
You're completely surrounded
by landmines in the ground

130
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:07,401
all around you.

131
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,434
Step on one, even touch
it and it'll go off.

132
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,901
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): So he plans
to fire that guided missile

133
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:14,234
directly at me.

134
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:19,267
And he's flying just outside
of my maximum attack radius.

135
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,067
-I see that your leg is injured.

136
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,901
I wonder if you can
dodge my attack now.

137
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:24,367
Hmm.

138
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,101
This next one's
going to be huge.

139
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:32,367
Hmm.

140
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,234
You can't escape!

141
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,567
[grunts]

142
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:59,201
-Shouldn't have used
your wings as shields.

143
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:02,534
You can't fly anymore,
not with one wing.

144
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,434
[laughter]

145
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,567
-You're so awesome Deidara!

146
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,801
-Now to settle this at last.

147
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,301
Hmm.

148
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,301
[grunting]

149
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,434
-Like that could get me.

150
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,967
Ha ha, go ahead and leap.

151
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,434
There's no place to land
except on a landmine.

152
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,767
And that'll stop you for sure.

153
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,601
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
You made a foothold.

154
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,001
He got me?

155
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,401
-Your balance!

156
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,501
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
Deliberately thrust his blade

157
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,834
into the ground to
check for landmines

158
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,667
and create a
foothold for himself.

159
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,301
The length of his
sword plus the height

160
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:00,201
he can leap with
one wind was just

161
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,534
enough to get him in range.

162
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,967
Wait, this spot.

163
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,167
Of course, with that attack he
lured me into position right

164
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,534
above his blade.

165
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,967
The shortest distance his
Chakra blade could reach.

166
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,867
-Deidara!

167
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,801
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
I can't move.

168
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,334
No, I'm headed
toward the landmines.

169
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:03,170
-Huh?

170
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:05,698
Ah!

171
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,901
You did die a death
by bombing after all!

172
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,501
Deidara you fool!

173
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,134
-How many times do I have
to tell you to shut up Tobi?

174
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,001
-What?

175
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:43,401
You're still alive?

176
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:43,901
-Obstinate.

177
00:14:50,968 --> 00:15:00,801
[grunting]

178
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,768
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
You-- You damn brat.

179
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:21,434
Those eyes, it's
those same eyes.

180
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,234
-The Akatsuki?

181
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,301
Don't know and don't care.

182
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,501
Now get lost.

183
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,101
You're keeping me from
my art appreciation time.

184
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:48,868
-And I have to take this
brat on as my partner.

185
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:51,301
Sure, he's full of energy.

186
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:54,701
But he seems like
the early death type.

187
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,234
-It's our leader's orders.

188
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,368
His talent will be very useful.

189
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,968
-You know about my talent?

190
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:01,534
But how?

191
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:02,834
Who are you?

192
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:03,968
Talk.

193
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:07,134
-We know you're aiding
anti-government factions

194
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,801
with terrorist bombings.

195
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:13,268
And we are also aware
that you're a rogue ninja.

196
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:16,468
So what exactly is your purpose?

197
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:17,234
-Purpose?

198
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,434
I don't need a purpose.

199
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,201
I take commissions to make
explosions using my art.

200
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:24,201
-Hmm.

201
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,201
Your art?

202
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,168
-Yeah.

203
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,134
-Look.

204
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:34,368
Well, such refined
lines and a form that

205
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,868
pursues two-dimensional
death forumai.

206
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,534
This is true art.

207
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:42,068
But my art goes far
beyond this as well.

208
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,101
My pieces are versatile.

209
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:47,134
While they hold shape,
they are merely objects.

210
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:49,601
But they can also explode.

211
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,401
And when it does explode,
it makes its existence

212
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,568
more sublime.

213
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,134
And it finally comes
fully into its own.

214
00:16:56,168 --> 00:17:00,668
I feel that true art lives only
in that flash of sublimation.

215
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,234
True art is an explosion.

216
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,268
-Disgusting.

217
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,068
Is he finished?

218
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,368
-Who knows?

219
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,101
Who cares?

220
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:19,134
I'll handle this.

221
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,801
-What's up with his eyes?

222
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,268
You want to fight?

223
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:33,568
-If I win you'll become
a member of the Akatsuki.

224
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,634
-That's fine.

225
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:36,668
Just don't mock my art.

226
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,734
That's what my ninjutsu is,
a noble and refined art.

227
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,234
Hmph.

228
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:46,134
Now, feel my art!

229
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:49,434
Ha!

230
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,101
Ha ha, you talked big.

231
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:03,501
But it looks like
that's all you've got.

232
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:04,634
You're done.

233
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,801
Ha!

234
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,834
-Am I?

235
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,301
You should take a
good look at yourself.

236
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:14,868
-What?

237
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,334
How?

238
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:17,534
-That was close.

239
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:20,734
A little later and you'd
have blown yourself up.

240
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,968
-I told you he was
the type who was

241
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,068
going to die an early death.

242
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,168
-Ginjutsu, since when?

243
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:33,568
-Right from the beginning, when
you saw Itachi's Sharingan.

244
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,968
You were already under
his ginjutsu then.

245
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,268
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
It's beautiful.

246
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:16,768
This-- This is art.

247
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:28,468
No, I became intimidated by
someone else's abilities.

248
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,368
That?

249
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,768
Art?

250
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:31,734
Never.

251
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,434
I refuse to
acknowledge it as that.

252
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,834
-You just lost this fight.

253
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,934
DEIDARA (VOICEOVER):
Don't you mess with me.

254
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:45,034
I'm better than you are.

255
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,701
My talent is absolute.

256
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,501
My art can't be beat.

257
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,934
I know I'm better than you.

258
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,401
I will not lose to you.

259
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:10,768
Not to such a-- such a--

260
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:23,468
-Huh?

261
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,768
He's eating the detonating clay.

262
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:33,134
But that means-- I
saved the best for last.

263
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:34,868
This'll kill you.

264
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,434
Tobi, run!

265
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,134
Now!

266
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:37,668
-Huh?

267
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:38,601
[screaming]

268
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:41,068
-Don't do it sensi [inaudible]!

269
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,868
Hurry feet!

270
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,768
-I set this jutsu aside
especially to kill Itachi.

271
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:06,734
But oh well.

272
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,201
[grunting]

273
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,701
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Why is this?

274
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,579
[theme music]

275
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,679
TOBI (VOICEOVER): Boy,
this kid is strong.

276
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:03,146
But then again,
what else should we

277
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,079
expect from Itachi's
little brother?

278
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:09,312
And Deidara sure is fired up,
flying, exploding, and falling,

279
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,612
oh my!

280
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:13,012
At this rate, he'll really
have to apologize to Itachi

281
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,079
for taking down
his little brother.

282
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:16,512
Wait, could that be?

283
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,712
Is he really going to-- No!

284
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:19,846
Not yet Deidara!

285
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,179
Don't say ha yet!

286
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:24,912
-Next time, art.
