Huh?

4
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,131
{\an1}What?! But how-?!

5
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:49,004
{\an1}Itachi?!

{\an1}I have to give you
credit for placing
me under a genjutsu.

10
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,922
Heh.

11
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:30,576
{\an1}Sasuke! Now's your chance!
Why did you stop?

12
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:47,635
But yours is still a
far cry from Itachi's.

13
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:52,875
{\an4}With his masterful Tsukuyomi,
he was able to freely
manipulate time within
the dreamscape.

{\an1}Sticking with Taijutsu, eh?
looks like he wants
to preserve chakra.

00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:48,858
{\an8}<i>Release! </i>

21

{\an7}<i>If Sasuke knows the truth</i>

23
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:07,719
{\an7}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>It's impossible to conceal what</i>

But why?

25
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,308
{\an1}Why did you ever believe that
it was necessary to save the
life of such trash, Itachi?

Rgh!

No! Sasuke!

28
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:36,362
{\an1}Take a good look, Itachi.

29
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,197
{\an1}<i>Look at the state he's in.</i>

47
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:34,937
{\an7}<i>Good. His rage has matured</i>

48
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,741
{\an7}<i>And his body is naturally</i>

49

{\an1}I have no choice!

52

{\an7}<i>Danzo's chakra level</i>
<i>plunged with that jutsu!</i>

54

<i>especially at such a cost?</i>

55
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,936

{\an1}That was Wood Style.
now it makes sense.

58
00:08:57,026 --> 00:09:01,698
{\an1}With that many Sharingan,
I knew there had to be
some kind of secret,

59
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:05,671
to allow someone who
wasn't an Uchiha to
be able to use them.

60
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:14,151
Damn that Orochimaru.
It seems he was in close
contact with Danzo.

Sasuke, listen!

68

{\an1}That's the real Danzo!

69
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:46,765
{\an1}But the jutsu that makes him
invincible is undone right now!

70
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,768
And that means
he's vulnerable!

71
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,873
{\an7}<i>So that woman is a</i>
<i>Sensory Type ninja!</i>

72

00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,515
{\an8}<i>No, I was wrong.</i>

75
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:25,656
{\an7}<i>As soon as Danzo weaved those</i>
<i>signs, the feel of his chakra</i>
<i>shifted just slightly.</i>

76
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,360
{\an7}<i>He launched that other jutsu!</i>

77
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,198
{\an7}<i>I'm probably the only one</i>
<i>who's able to pick that up.</i>

78
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:36,973
{\an7}<i>That means Susano'o's</i>
<i>attack just then probably</i>
<i>wasn't in time. Damn it!</i>

79
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:56,601
{\an7}<i>He recast that jutsu, But</i>
<i>those three eyes stayed shut.</i>

80
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:04,647
{\an4}As far as I can tell, there
are ten Sharingan on that arm,
in addition to the First
Hokage's cells.

81
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,185
{\an1}<i>Uchiha's power and</i>
<i>Hashirama's power.</i>

82
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,293
{\an1}<i>It looks like he's</i>
<i>planning to try to</i>
<i>control Nine-Tails.</i>

83
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:18,467
{\an1}So he's after Naruto, too.

84
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,379
{\an7}<i>Danzo's chakra dropped</i>
<i>again just now.</i>

85
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:29,418
{\an7}<i>It seems like that jutsu</i>
<i>really takes quite a toll.</i>

86
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,622
{\an7}<i>That must be why he</i>
<i>needed to undo it before.</i>

87
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,959
{\an1}Release!

88
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,030
{\an1}In order to preserve his chakra!

89
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,273
{\an7}<i>And another thing; those</i>
<i>Sharingan on his right arm</i>
<i>are definitely linked to</i>
<i>his jutsu, I just know it!</i>

90
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,678
{\an7}<i>[Karin]</i>

{\an1}There's no mistake.

The Izanagi.

100
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,214
{\an1}Where for a few
seconds' span of time,

00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:04,157
{\an1}<i>anything disadvantageous to the</i>

<i>never to open again.</i>

108
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,065
{\an1}But with that many eyes...

109

{\an1}The duration of the Izanagi
varies with each user.

110

{\an1}He wanted to extend that time

115
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:44,539

<i>No matter what!</i>

<i>be able to move.</i>

123
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,718
{\an7}<i>And I'll augment the Baku's</i>
<i>already impressive suction</i>
<i>power with even more force.</i>

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,492
{\an7}<i>About two hundred and forty</i>
<i>seconds, or four minutes, is the</i>
<i>time limit of that jutsu!</i>

137
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,429
{\an7}<i>From what I can tell,</i>
<i>while his jutsu's active,</i>

138
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:27,937
{\an7}<i>it allows his attacks to be</i>
<i>successful but makes Sasuke's</i>
<i>attacks ineffective.</i>

139
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:31,408
{\an8}<i>If that's the way</i>
<i>this jutsu works,</i>

140
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,082
{\an7}<i>Danzo's got to be desperate to</i>
<i>take Sasuke down while the jutsu</i>
<i>is still up and running. </i>

141
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,421
{\an7}<i>Even a mutual strike</i>
<i>would be a win to Danzo!</i>

142
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,761
{\an1}<i>[Karin]</i>
<i>Sasuke! I think I'm</i>
<i>starting to get his jutsu!</i>

143
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,097
<i>Are you</i>
<i>listening to me?</i>

144
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,608
{\an4}When all ten of the eyes you
have on your right arm have
closed your jutsu will be
undone, isn't that right?

145
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:56,678
{\an1}You knew? You knew about
about the Izanagi?

146
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,615
{\an1}As I suspected!

147
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:03,022
{\an1}You tricked it out of me!
Why, you crafty brat!

148
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,659
No! You fool!
Don't engage him!

149
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:30,863
Stop, Sasuke! You should
just retreat for now!
Prolong the battle!

150
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:37,906
{\an1}That would be pointless,
for in that case, Danzo
would just undo the Izanagi.

151
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,584
{\an4}If that happens, Sasuke would be
at an overwhelming disadvantage,
since he's already used up so
much of his strength.

152
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,490
{\an4}Sasuke is pressing him with the
super-fast, super-strong
Susano'o to force Danzo to
continue using Izanagi,

153
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,194
{\an1}and thus use it up.

154
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:20,203
{\an1}Sasuke has long known that
this battle will be won by
whoever outlasts the other.

155
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:44,303
{\an1}He's putting his remaining
strength into a chakra blade.
This is the deciding moment.

156
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:49,612
{\an1}How many Uchiha did you
have to kill to get that
right arm of yours?!

157
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,484
{\an1}It was all thanks to Itachi.

158
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:55,821
{\an1}You made him do it!

159
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,903
{\an1}<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>Shisui's eye has</i>
<i>recovered at last.</i>

160
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:03,243
{\an1}<i>However, Sasuke is no longer</i>
<i>useful with that injury. </i>

161
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:09,953
{\an1}<i>As I thought, Madara's the</i>
<i>one I need to place under</i>
<i>genjutsu and manipulate.</i>

162
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:16,596
{\an1}<i>I can't waste time. My wound</i>
<i>is too deep. I simply cannot</i>
<i>afford to die here today.</i>

163
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,635
{\an1}<i>[Sasuke]</i>
<i>Next time on Naruto Shippuden:</i>
<i>Danzo Shimura.</i>

164
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,571
<i>[Danzo]</i>
<i>I win.</i>
