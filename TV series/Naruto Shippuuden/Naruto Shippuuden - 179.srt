1
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:08,345
[water flowing]

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,652
[fapping]

3
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,886
{\an1}-Now, regarding the Akatsuki.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,254
{\an1}We intend to continue
pursuing them,

5
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:28,123
with assistance
from all our allies.

6
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:30,757
{\an1}-With everything that's
happened to your village,

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,925
those of us from
the Land of Fire

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,894
{\an1}shall provide full support
in your rebuilding efforts.

9
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:40,229
First, we'll put
together a budget.

10
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:42,398
{\an1}Then we'll ease tensions
between the other--

11
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:47,400
{\an1}-More importantly, there is a
more pressing matter at hand.

12
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,634
{\an1}I speak of the selection
of the new hokage.

13
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:52,236
{\an1}(TO HIMSELF): Here it comes.

14
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,037
I knew it.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,737
{\an1}-Would not be possible
for us to simply bide

16
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,006
{\an1}our time until Tsunade recovers?

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,841
{\an1}-Respectfully, my Lord.

18
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,007
{\an1}That's impractical.

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,976
{\an1}Tsunade remains in
a comatose state.

20
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,177
{\an1}The village is still
in ruins and we just

21
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:11,513
{\an1}don't know when Tsunade will
awaken, if she ever does.

22
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:13,881
{\an1}We are unable to steer
the village forward

23
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,715
{\an1}as it currently stands.

24
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,082
Hmm.

25
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:19,717
Besides, she is
the one who allowed

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,252
the Leaf Village
to be destroyed.

27
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:23,353
{\an1}-I'd really hoped that
Jiraiya would follow us

28
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:25,354
{\an1}as the next hokage.

29
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,555
{\an1}I liked him very much
and it saddens me

30
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,723
{\an1}that he's no longer among us.

31
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:34,125
{\an1}So who else is up for
consideration then?

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,392
{\an1}In that case, I--

33
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:36,659
{\an1}-I nominate Kakashi Hatake.

34
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:41,729
-Oho!

35
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,863
How interesting.

36
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,730
{\an1}The son of the White Fang.

37
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,365
Yes, why not?

38
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,832
{\an1}Sounds good to me.

39
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,033
{\an1}And what do the rest of
you think about that?

40
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,802
-He's renowned,
powerful, and virtuous.

41
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,169
He'd do well.

42
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,171
{\an1}-But perhaps he's just a bit
too young for such a position.

43
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,272
{\an1}-I believe that Minato,
the fourth hokage,

44
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:01,607
{\an1}was even younger when
he took the office.

45
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,940
{\an1}-I can't quite remember.

46
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,142
{\an1}Who was Kakashi Hatake's master?

47
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,277
{\an1}-The fourth hokage.

48
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,978
-Oh, is that so?

49
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,846
{\an1}If I'm not mistaken, Jiraiya
was the fourth hokage's master

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,449
{\an1}and the third hokage
was Jiraiya's master.

51
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:21,551
{\an1}It would seem that the matter
practically settles itself.

52
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,784
All right, then.

53
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:25,620
{\an1}-But the third hokage's
teachings led to the village

54
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,621
{\an1}being virtually annihilated.

55
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:28,588
-Oh.

56
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,955
Mmm.

57
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,090
{\an1}-The Akatsuki's leader, the
one who flattened our village,

58
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,192
{\an1}he was a former student
of Jiraiya's as well.

59
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:39,361
{\an1}This is what happens when one
sympathizes with foreigners

60
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:41,794
{\an1}and teaches them ninjutsu.

61
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,063
{\an1}They were too naive,
every single one of them!

62
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,731
That naivete has
continued for generations.

63
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:50,233
{\an1}It alllowed our ally,
The Sand, to betray us,

64
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:54,335
{\an1}set Orochimaru on a campaign
to destroy the Leaf, allowed

65
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,003
{\an1}the Akatsuki to rise up.

66
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,803
{\an1}And now Sasuke, the
last surviving Uchiha,

67
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:02,339
{\an1}has become a rogue ninja
and is working underground.

68
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:04,974
{\an1}What sort of hokage
do we need now?

69
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,909
{\an1}Someone able to clean
up this entire mess.

70
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:10,310
{\an1}Someone who can reform
the shinobi world

71
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,711
{\an1}and who will enforce
all our shinobi laws.

72
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,981
{\an1}The answer is simple.

73
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:22,750
{\an1}That hokage should be me.

74
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:25,218
-My Lord.

75
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:31,255
{\an1}Why don't we allow Danzo to
handle the situation for now?

76
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:31,755
-Hmm.

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,258
{\an1}-An aggressive and one-sided way
of doing things is not how we

78
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:38,892
of the Leaf--

79
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,460
{\an1}-Yes, I've decided.

80
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:46,197
{\an1}Danzo, I hereby name
you the sixth hokage.

81
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,635
{\an1}-She used Lady Katsuyu's
jutsu to protect everyone

82
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,370
{\an1}in the village and she's
been unconscious ever since.

83
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:06,141
{\an1}We don't know when she'll
regain consciousness, if at all.

84
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:09,309
-Granny.

85
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,547
-Hey, Sakura!

86
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:20,615
{\an1}Here, let me go fill these
up with water for you.

87
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:22,249
{\an1}-Why don't we go together?

88
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:25,784
{\an1}-[chuckling] Sakura.

89
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,785
{\an1}-Don't get the wrong idea.

90
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,819
{\an1}It's just that if I
left it up to you,

91
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,055
{\an1}who knows where you'd
get that water from.

92
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:35,022
{\an1}--[sighing] You can trust
me a little more than that,

93
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:36,657
you know.

94
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,358
{\an1}-(TO HIMSELF): Naruto.

95
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,659
{\an1}Who would've imagined.

96
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:46,929
{\an1}SAKURA: We're gonna
be late, you two!

97
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:47,896
NARUTO: Aah!

98
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,331
{\an1}I'll get you for this!

99
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,297
SASUKE: Hmph.

100
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,668
{\an1}-The genin that are
assigned to Team Seven

101
00:04:57,702 --> 00:05:02,037
{\an1}are Sakura Haruno, Sasuke
Uchiha, and Naruto Uzumaki.

102
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,505
-(TO HIMSELF):
Sasuke and Naruto,

103
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,607
{\an1}both of them on the same team.

104
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,140
{\an1}HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
I will be placing

105
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,675
{\an1}Kakashi Hatake in
charge of this team.

106
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,876
{\an1}IRUKA (TO HIMSELF): Kakashi?

107
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,310
{\an1}-You know what I heard?

108
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:15,877
That Kakashi has
never passed a genin

109
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,179
{\an1}that he's been placed
in charge of before.

110
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:20,548
{\an1}-Is the hokage trying
to prevent Naruto

111
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,815
{\an1}from advancing or something?

112
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:23,616
{\an1}-And Sasuke, too?

113
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,350
-Huh?

114
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,317
Hmm.

115
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,784
{\an1}(TO HIMSELF) He couldn't be.

116
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:31,019
{\an1}-Understood, Kakashi?

117
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:32,153
-Yes, sir.

118
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:33,655
{\an1}HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
Team Eight will

119
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:39,157
{\an1}be Hinata Hyuga, Kiba
Inuzuka, and Shino Aburame.

120
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:42,158
{\an1}Kurenai Yuhi will be in
charge of those three.

121
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,093
-Nngh.

122
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:44,960
Yes, sir.

123
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,362
-Now, Kurenai.

124
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:50,631
{\an1}This is your first time being
in charge of genin, isn't it?

125
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,598
{\an1}Keep in mind that
the jonin in charge

126
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,599
{\an1}will decide their future.

127
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,600
-Right.

128
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,635
{\an1}I'll be careful with them, sir.

129
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:03,738
{\an1}-The genin of Team 10 are
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,

130
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,106
{\an1}and Choji Akimichi.

131
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,375
{\an1}I'm placing Asuma Sarutobi
in charge of them.

132
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:10,874
-Roger.

133
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,912
{\an1}-What do you think?

134
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,214
-Hmm.

135
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,049
{\an1}This is a difficult predicament,
even for someone like you,

136
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,182
Shikaku.

137
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,916
-You think so?

138
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,585
I doubt it.

139
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:32,286
-All right.

140
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,121
{\an1}Well, it looks like I'd
better start attacking again.

141
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,522
-Huh.

142
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:40,190
{\an1}Sometimes it can be very
tough for soldiers like us

143
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,693
{\an1}to accomplish anything when
our generals are running amok.

144
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:52,964
{\an1}-Now how about a time-out?

145
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,299
{\an1}-There are no time-outs
on real missions.

146
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:55,798
-Hnngh.

147
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,535
{\an1}-I'm just a pawn.

148
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:03,569
{\an1}You're like a silver
general in Japanese chess.

149
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:06,571
{\an1}I can only do my duty if
I have your protection.

150
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,339
{\an1}-What are you talking about?

151
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,608
{\an1}If you're a pawn, then I'm
just a sacrificial piece.

152
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,108
{\an1}-No, you're wrong about that.

153
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,343
{\an1}Pawns like me are only
able to do their work

154
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,244
