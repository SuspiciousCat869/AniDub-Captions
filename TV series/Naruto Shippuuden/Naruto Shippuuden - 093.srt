00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,571
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I'm a frog.

3
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,530
A frog.

4
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,077
-Can you hear the froggy song?

5
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,833
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Become one with Gamatatsu.

6
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,087
-Can you hear the froggy song?

7
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,925
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Read his
thoughts, and respond to them.

8
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,804
-Yes, I hear the froggy song.

9
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,599
-Yes, I hear the froggy song.

16
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,282
Naruto, you don't look like
you've opened up your mind yet.

17
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,369
Don't focus on his
movements so much.

18
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,372
Try and feel Gamatatsu's
emotional vibes,

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,249
then channel them
using your own style.

-Uh-- heh, heh.

Um-- sorry about that.

Gamakichi is singing.

Everyone, look,
Gamatatsu too is singing.

Hear his noble song.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Connect
with Gamatatsu's heart.

31
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,827
-Whoa.

32
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,662
Check out that cloud.

33
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,498
It looks like a big cream puff.

34
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:26,998
Yummers.

35
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,837
GAMAKICHI (VOICEOVER):
Well, maybe their thoughts

36
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,505
are as one.

37
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,090
-Whoa, hey.

38
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,676
Gamatatsu, did you
just feel that?

39
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,971
-What do I look like,

-Gamatatsu!

55
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,952
-That doesn't
really show you guys

56
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,537
are in tune with each other.

57
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,623

Yes, I hear the froggy song.

62
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,401
Huh?

63
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,320
-Here.

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,113
You look like you could use one.

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,882
Trust me, kiddo.

66
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,511
Everyone who knows you
can see it plain as day.

67
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,638
-Huh?

68
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:10,811
-Gamatatsu, Gamakichi, Sakura
and Tsunade, and myself.

69
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,854
Every single one of
us knows how hard

70
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,190
you've been working lately.

71
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,610
And the only mystery
is how you keep it up.

72
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,445
-I don't know.

73
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,031
Don't like the idea
of giving up, I guess.

74
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,453
And Sasuke.

75
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,121
-Hm?

76
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,542
-I can't help but wonder
what he would think.

77
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:38,046
If he'll ever look at me and
acknowledge all that I've done.

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,131
-That would be great,
wouldn't it, kid?

79
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,290
-Hm?

80
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,177
What?

81
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,061
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): I shouldn't
tell him about the Akatsuki.

82
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,190
-Hey, you two.

83
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,191
Up and at 'em.

84
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,526
-Hm?

85
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,863
-I have a few things to take
care of, so I'm heading out.

86
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,199
I want both of you guys to
go back to the Leaf Village.

87
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,037
Help Naruto with the
rest of his training, OK?

88
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,746
-No problem.

89
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
We'll take care of it.

90
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,833
-There'll be some snacks
in it for us, right?

91
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,335
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

92
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,836
I'll be counting on you.

93
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,842
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

94
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,928
Keep at it.

95
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,721
One day you really
will be Hokage.

96
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,147
Hold onto that unyielding
gutsiness of yours.

97
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,649
No matter what.

98
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,239
TSUNADE: A new enemy?

99
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,532
PAKKU: That's right.

100
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,034
A formidable one.

101
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,745
I saw a bit of their handiwork.

102
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,748
TSUANDE: Which is why
you're giving me this.

103
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,834
There's something inside
that crystal, isn't there?

104
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,171
-The enemy's jutsu took
out one of Shino's insects.

105
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,300
Kakashi wants it
analyzed right away.

106
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,260
TSUANDE (VOICEOVER):
It can't be.

107
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,223
Does that mean the
rumors are true?

108
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,265
-Shizune.

109
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,600
I want this analyzed.

110
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,185
Get it to the lab.

111
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,186
-Yes, ma'am.

112
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,562
-Say what?

113
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,273
Are you telling me he
just took off again?

114
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,441
-Afraid so.

115
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,611
But here, he ask me to
pass this along for him.

116
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,112
-Give it.

117
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,702
-Round up all your stuff, kid.

118
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,619
We're going home.

119
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,802
-Hm?

120
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,803
What is it?

121
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,805
-Look at that.

122
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,599
This high up, you can
see the whole valley.

123
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,476
We just came from down there.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,117
-Lord Orochimaru
will be waiting.

125
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,744
Come along, now.

126
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,578
-Yes.

127
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,287
Of course.

128
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,839
-You smell something, boy?

[whine]

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,094
-Kiba, you find anything?

131
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,012
-Nu-uh.

132
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,514
Not even a whiff,
Kakashi-sensei.

133
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,977
-My Byakugan's not picking
up anything, either.

134
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,813
[screech]

135
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,732
-A bat?

136
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,151
-There are some signs.

137
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,277
-Huh?

138
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,904
Where?

139
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,198
-I'm talking about
one of my insects.

140
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,284
Don't get so excited.

141
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,535
-Just your bugs.

142
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,787
Don't do that.

143
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,748
Last count, you had something
like 10, 000 of them, OK?

144
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,043
The fact that you found one
isn't really that surprising.

145
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,254
-But this one came in
contact with the enemy.

146
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,717
And the fact that it survived
makes it an asset to us.

147
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
-What kind of asset?

148
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,388
-It presumably got hit
by the enemy's jutsu.

149
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,891
Yet it's still here.

150
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,892
-What are you saying?

151
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,853
It's developed some
sort of immunity?

152
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,938
-Could be.

153
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,315
And my insects have
a short life span.

154
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,775
A few hours at most.

155
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,862
It wouldn't take long to breed
more of them that are immune.

156
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,738
-Are you kidding me?

157
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,156
That's amazing.

158
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,200
-It's just a possibility.

159
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,035
I don't know if it'll work.

160
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,455
But I should try to find
as many survivors as I can.

161
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,206
-Don't worry.

162
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,041
We'll help you look for them.

163
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,834
-Right.

164
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,835
We can handle it.

165
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,294
-That's all right.

166
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,587
-What do you mean?

167
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
-I'm the one who
should look for them.

168
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,675
You need to stay put.

169
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,218
if you guys start
tramping around,

170
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,470
you'll end up stepping on some.

171
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,597
I can't have that.

172
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,266
-If you're going
to shoot us down,

173
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,685
you could be a little
nicer about it.

174
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,814
-I didn't want to waste time
dancing around the issue.

175
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,858
-I think we're all set, then.

176
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,609
Shino will start
rounding them up.

177
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,946
The rest of us will get
back on the enemy's trail.

178
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,239
-Fine.

179
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,448
Let's go, Akamaru.

180
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,449
[bark]

181
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,730
[laughter]

182
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,273
-Snake eyes again.

183
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,276
Sorry, fellas.

184
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,530
-You wouldn't be cheating,
now, would you, bro?

185
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,073
-Course not.

186
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,366
I don't know what to tell you.

187
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,246
Some of us are just
born lucky, my friend.

188
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,206
-Sure.

189
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,208
That's why I'm losing.

190
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,418
You'd obviously have
no problem with me

191
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,171
inspecting those
dice of yours, right?

192
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,757
-She's late.

193
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,508
-Aw, man.

194
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,676
Come on.

195
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,428
One more roll.

196
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,929
Huh?

197
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,684
-You want to try?

198
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,394
It's a good way to kill time.

199
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,734
Ignoring me, huh?

200
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,319
Well, that's fine.

201
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,489
I have to say, though,
it's a little surprising.

202
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,742
I can't believe you're still
here, waiting on Guren.

203
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,788
I don't know.

204
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,081
You seemed so defiant.

205
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,085
I thought you'd have used
this opportunity to escape.

206
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,419
-There's no point in running.

207
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,921
I'm no match for her.

208
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,964
-Well, well.

209
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,174
I wasn't expecting that.

210
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:42,929
So you're going to fall in
line like a good boy, huh?

211
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,472
-What about you lot?

212
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,641
You in or out?

213
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,934
-Us?

214
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,978
-You knew the deal
from the beginning.

215
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,021
That we'd eventually
have to fight

216
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,648
for our survival in that place.

217
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,194
You formed a group.

218
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,697
Banded together
to survive, right?

219
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,200
I can see it.

220
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,536
[laughter]

221
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,829
-Sharp one, aren't you?

222
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,997
We did, indeed.

223
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,915
It's not that surprising,
though, is it?

224
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,709
When your back's
against the wall,

225
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,627
it's good to have
friends, right?

226
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,380
We agreed to take care of each
other when push came to shove.

227
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,304
The ones who overestimated
themselves and failed

228
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,474
to use their heads--
they're all dead.

229
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,979
The way I look at it, we made
it this far using brain power.

230
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,108
Though I suppose if that
battle had gone on any longer,

231
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,819
we would have eventually gone
and turned on each other.

232
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,330
You, however, didn't
need anyone else.

233
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,416
You were strong
enough on your own.

234
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,376
When we were fighting
individually,

235
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,714
we had to make sure we
kept our distance from you.

236
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,425
But there are four of us now.

237
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,346
As long as we all stick
together, we can't be beaten.

238
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,350
Now we're all one big family,
though, working under Guren.

239
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,935
You can be a team player,
can't you, big guy?

240
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,899
Huh?

241
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,025
-Man.

242
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,277
She couldn't find a
better hideout than this?

243
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,821
I mean, seriously, what's
wrong with Guren, leaving us

244
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,906
in this creaky old dump?

245
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,293
-I'm going out on patrol.

246
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,250
Find anything out there?

247
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,342
-Akamaru?

248
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,009
What is it, boy?

249
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,264
-Deliver this information.

250
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,140
Fast as you can.

251
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,785
-I thought you said you
were going out on patrol?

252
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,829
-Just clearing my head first.

253
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,458
I'm heading out now, actually.

254
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,500
-All right, then.

255
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,461
I'll go with you.

256
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,712
-Hm?

257
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,797
You're full of
surprises, aren't you?

258
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,799
Does this mean you're
following my advice?

259
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,305
-A dog whistle?

260
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,222
-Yeah.

261
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,517
Akamaru said he
heard one for sure.

262
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,145
-Does that mean our enemy
is working with a dog, too?

263
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,938
-I kind of doubt it.

264
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,649
Trying to cover up human
scent is difficult enough.

265
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,527
With a dog, it's
near impossible.

266
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,446
And if they had a
dog, Akamaru and I

267
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,157
would have smelled him by now.

268
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,493
-So then, why a dog whistle?

269
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,994
-Wish I could tell ya.

270
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,662
-Know where it came from?

271
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,039
-I have no idea.

272
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,332
But they're not that far off.

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,333
That much I do know.

274
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,132
-I've finally made it back.

275
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,178
The first order of business
is to stop at Ichiraku.

276
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,681
I need to recharge a
bit before I train.

277
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,183
KONOHAMARU: Brother Naruto.

278
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,392
-Huh?

279
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,770
-I'll bet you were working
on a naughty new jutsu

280
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,396
out at the hot springs, right?

281
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,484
So I might as well show
you my latest Sexy Jutsu.

282
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,235
-Ah!

283
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,862
Wait a second, Konohamaru!

284
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,322
[scream]

285
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,952
-You think buying
me one bowl of ramen

286
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,371
makes up for the
konk you gave me?

287
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,665
-There's a time and place
for that kind of jutsu,

288
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,751
and that wasn't it.

289
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,418
Summoning Jutsu!

290
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,383
-Oh, man.

291
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,052
So these two guys are
your summons, Naruto?

292
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,555
-Actually, I usually
go even bigger.

293
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,849
But these two small fries should
do for right now, I think.

294
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,393
-Who are you kiddin', here?

295
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,854
You're our dad's henchman,
in case you forgot.

296
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,856
-Come on, just be cool, OK?

297
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,401
I'm trying to impress
this kid over here.

298
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,071
Now then, my amphibian
friend, let's get to work!

299
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,030
-Hey, brother.

300
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,284
I wonder what
today's snack'll be?

301
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,245
I'm on pins and needles.

302
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,997
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Aw, man.

303
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,542
I completely forgot
about the snacks.

304
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,503
-Uh, I think we'll save the
treat for after our training

305
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,879
today.

306
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,383
-What the-- you called us here,
and you don't have any food?

307
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,384
I'm so out of here.

308
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,845
Come on, big brother.

309
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,929
-OK, OK, I got it!

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,931
Snacks!

311
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,809
Will you go get us some
snacks, Konohamaru?

312
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,352
This should cover it.

313
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,354
-Yeah, no problem.

314
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,939
-Sweet!

315
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,608
-Snacktime, snacktime!

316
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,862
-His eating habits are gonna
put me right in the poor house.

317
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,863
Huh?

318
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,740
What the-- you
finished 'em already?

319
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,328
-Awesome!

320
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,455
This guy's a pro!

321
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,956
-And disgusting.

322
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,291
All right, listen up.

323
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,293
Help me out today,
and Pervy Sage'll

324
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,504
give you more snacks than you've
ever dreamed of in your life.

325
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,590
Now come on, let's get to work.

326
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,091
-Roger that!

327
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,384
So--

328
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,137
-Well, we were focusing on
the timing when we stopped.

329
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,222
Why don't we just
pick it up there?

330
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,058
-What were we doing, again?

331
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,060
-You go ahead and
spit out some water,

332
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,646
and when the timing is right,
I'll layer in my chakra.

333
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,688
You got it?

334
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,821
Now fire off that
water pistol of yours,

335
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,115
and I'll try to time
out when to come in.

336
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,617
-Water pistol.

337
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,785
I don't get it.

338
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,745
What water pistol?

339
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,163
-You know.

340
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,166
Just use your water style jutsu
to shoot out a beam of water.

341
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,834
-So, water style?

342
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,169
-Huh?

343
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,505
-Hey, brother, can you
explain to this guy

344
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,799
that I can't do
that sort of thing?

345
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,758
-You're a frog!

346
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,718
Water style is your strong suit!

347
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,844
-It's the truth.

348
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,430
He can't do any sort
of water style jutsu.

349
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,890
-You've gotta be kidding me!

350
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,184
Then why the hell have I
been training with him?

351
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,019
-He can only do what he can do!

352
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
Quit yelling!

353
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,522
-Then you swap in, Gamakichi.

354
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,526
What's the big deal?

355
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,778
Are you gonna help
me out, or what?

356
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,530
-I-- I can't.

357
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,072
-Yeah?

358
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,156
And why's that?

359
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,369
-Come on.

360
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,872
-What are you muttering about?

361
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,290
Say what?

362
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,834
I can't hear ya.

363
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,752
-It's just I'm--

364
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,878
-Come again?

365
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,505
Speak up, already.

366
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,716
-It's just water style--

367
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,093
-Spit it out, will ya?

368
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,971
-I don't do water style, either!

369
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:22,471
-What?

370
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:32,398
[theme music]

371
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,026
KAKASHI: How'd it go?

372
00:21:59,068 --> 00:21:59,860
Any leads?

373
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,612
-I wasn't able to find anything.

374
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,905
-Yeah, same here.

375
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,866
The weather's making it
hard to pick up a scent.

376
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,701
KAKASHI: Not surprising
in this downpour.

377
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,911
-Hm?

378
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:09,829
Look.

379
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,206
Even the bats are
taking shelter.

380
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:12,915
Since--

381
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,375
-Kiba, what's wrong?

382
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,210
-So that's it, huh?

383
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,671
I know what the dog
whistle was about.

384
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,965
Kakashi-sensei, if
I'm right, the enemy

385
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,217
may already know our position.

386
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,053
NARUTO: Next time,
A Night Of Rain.
